**U.S. House Passes Non-Discrimination Against Taiwan Act, Demanding Assistance for Taiwan to Join IMF**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act" on June 23. This act instructs the U.S. to use its influence and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's admission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its participation in economic oversight, access to technical assistance, and eligibility for positions within the IMF.

Congresswoman Young Kim, who introduced the bill, stated that joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources to enhance its financial stability and effectively counter economic pressure from China. She emphasized that long-standing U.S. policy toward Taiwan supports its membership in international organizations that do not require sovereign state status. Even if full IMF membership is not possible, the U.S. must continue to advocate for Taiwan's status. The bill was co-sponsored by Representative Al Green in the House and Senators Dave McCormick and Dan Sullivan in the Senate.

Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) responded to the bill's passage on June 24, stating that it has positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will continue to monitor related developments closely.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," having passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, must now pass a matching version in the Federal Senate and be signed by the President to become law. The Federal Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a similar bill in early June, awaiting a full vote.

**Taiwan Expo Deepens AI Cooperation with Malaysia**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%BD%A2%E8%B1%A1%E5%B1%95-%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%88%87%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9Eai%E5%90%88%E4%BD%9C-213000941.html">News Link</a>

The Bureau of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held the Taiwan Expo this month at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC) in Malaysia. This marks the eighth time the expo has been held, making it the largest in scale to date, focusing on AI-driven smart manufacturing and applications. TAITRA stated that Taiwan has strong capabilities in semiconductors, information and communication technology, smart manufacturing, and system integration. Meanwhile, Malaysia aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center and accelerate its digital infrastructure development. These factors are expected to create a more extensive and complementary partnership between the two nations.

TAITRA Secretary-General Wang Hsi-meng mentioned that this year's expo focuses on five main themes: smart manufacturing, the grand health industry, green sustainability, smart living, and tourism and culture. He specifically noted that Taiwan and Malaysia have significant potential for deeper cooperation in smart manufacturing, where their combined expertise can upgrade smart systems and jointly achieve digital visions.

TAITRA added that Malaysia is striving to become Southeast Asia's largest data center, actively establishing data centers and promoting 5G digital infrastructure in recent years. This drives strong demand for high-performance computing, data analysis, and smart applications. Taiwan, on the other hand, produces over 90% of advanced AI chips, providing a crucial hardware foundation for global AI innovation. To meet Malaysia's AI demands, this year's expo highlights AI and features a new "AI Innovation Application Zone" showcasing the latest technologies in Taiwan's AI ecosystem.

Regarding green sustainability, Wang Hsi-meng stated that Malaysia has ambitious environmental policy goals, while Taiwan can offer practical solutions in enhancing energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies, assisting factories in moving towards a more sustainable and competitive future.

**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B2-%E7%A5%A8%E5%83%B2%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train (ÂçÄÈñìËªä) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

TRA fares will be fully adjusted on June 23, with an average increase of 26.8%. This adjustment covers various train ticket prices, lost and found return fees, luggage, and bicycle transportation fees. For example, the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will increase by NT$153. In addition to fare adjustments, TRA will implement a major timetable change on June 26, and revise its refund policy for delays and other promotional measures. Taiwan PASS prices will also be adjusted, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version seeing the highest increase.

This fare adjustment marks the end of a 30-year freeze on TRA prices. Specifically, local train fares from Taipei to Banqiao will increase from NT$15 to NT$22, and the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will increase to NT$975. Luggage and parcel fees will see an average increase of 36%, with items under 70 kg for distances within 300 km increasing from NT$70 to NT$100, a hike of 43%. Transportation scholar Huang Tai-sheng noted that TRA's price increase is significant, roughly one-third.

In addition to fare increases, TRA's discount measures have also been reduced. The free mileage for using EasyCard or iPASS on Tze-Chiang Limited Express trains will be shortened to 50 km. The "Love Child Ticket," which used to cost one-quarter of the full fare for children aged 6 to 12 with disabilities, will also be canceled, though children aged 6 to 12 will still receive a half-fare discount. For residents of Hualien and Taitung, TRA offers point rewards, with 8 times points on weekdays and 5 times on holidays, which can be used to offset ticket purchases.

Regarding train delays, TRA has also set new rules. If a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes due to a malfunction or reasons not attributable to the passenger, or if the departure time is uncertain, passengers can choose not to travel and apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Huang Tai-sheng pointed out that if the High-Speed Rail were to follow suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to manage demand by adjusting prices. He hopes that TRA passengers will not switch to the High-Speed Rail.

It is worth noting that the TPASS commuter monthly pass is not affected by this price increase, but the government's subsidy amount will increase. Transportation scholar Chang Sheng-hsiung believes that while it will not create a financial black hole, it will indeed increase the financial burden. He explained that the increased burden mainly comes from the TRA portion, while the use of MRT, city buses, and national highway buses remains unaffected.

The Taiwan PASS offered by the Tourism Administration will also see price adjustments, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version having the largest increase, from NT$1900 to NT$2500. This comprehensive fare adjustment means that the public will face higher costs for their daily commuting and transportation.
