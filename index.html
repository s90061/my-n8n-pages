            <h1>Tesla Changes Car Prices; Model 3 and Model Y Can Get Up to NT$100,000 Off</h1>
            <p>Today, Tesla, a company that makes electric cars, changed its car prices in Taiwan. This is because people in Taiwan expect changes due to import taxes from the United States. If you buy a Model 3 or Model Y car that is ready to be delivered between August 27 and September 30, you can get a discount of up to NT$100,000.</p>
            <p>Tesla said that the costs for car parts and shipping around the world are getting higher. The change in import taxes from the US is not the only reason for Tesla's car prices in Taiwan. Even if Taiwan lowers its import taxes, Tesla will not lower the prices for Model S and Model X cars.</p>
            <p>Tesla also said that for the Model 3, they are giving a discount to meet what the Taiwan market wants. The Model Y cars in Taiwan will still come from the factory in Berlin. There are no plans to move production. The price change for the Model Y will be given as a discount on insurance for new car owners who will get their cars soon.</p>
            <p>Tesla announced that this is the biggest discount ever for their updated car models. The Model 3 Performance model will get the largest discount, which is NT$100,000.</p>

            <h1>Wu Chih-chung: Taiwan Helps Indo-Pacific Safety by Making Its Defense Stronger</h1>
            <p>Today, Wu Chih-chung, who is a Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, had lunch with a group from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) visiting Taiwan. He said that Taiwan is making its defense stronger to help keep the Indo-Pacific region safe. He also said that many countries supporting Taiwan show that Taiwan is very important for world safety. He hopes Taiwan can work more closely with countries that have similar ideas in important areas.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs later said in a press release that Vice Minister Wu Chih-chung welcomed a group of five people from IPAC today at a lunch. The group was led by Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the UK Conservative Party. Wu thanked IPAC for continuing to show strong support for Taiwan with their actions.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung said that in recent years, China has often tried to influence Taiwan, entered areas it shouldn't, and used military threats. These actions change the situation in the Taiwan Strait and badly affect peace and stability in the region. Taiwan is working hard to put its "Four Pillars of Peace Action Plan" into practice, which helps Indo-Pacific safety by making its own defense stronger.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung also said that at the same time, international support for Taiwan is growing. This includes worries about China's military exercises near Taiwan, warships sailing through the Taiwan Strait, and actions against China's "One China principle." All these things show that Taiwan is very important for global safety and success. He hopes that Taiwan can work more closely with countries that share its values in more important areas in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith said that IPAC now has members from parliaments in 43 countries and the European Parliament. This shows that more and more countries are worried about China. In recent years, China has used its power in politics and economy to ignore international rules and harm free market economies. Democracies should work together to deal with the threats and problems that China brings.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith emphasized that if countries around the world do not stop China's goals together, China's authoritarian actions could become worse. In the future, IPAC will continue to speak out about issues related to China and take real actions to help democracy grow around the world.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that IPAC held its fourth annual meeting in Taipei last July. Forty-nine lawmakers and important people from 23 countries and the European Parliament attended. The meeting passed a "Model Parliamentary Resolution for UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 by IPAC." Since then, many countries' parliaments have passed similar resolutions or statements, and their governments have shown support for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that during this visit, the IPAC group also met with President Lai, Secretary-General Wellington Koo of the National Security Council, Minister Chiu Chui-cheng of the Mainland Affairs Council, Deputy Minister Chien Fang-kuan of the National Development Council, and the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, among other organizations.</p>

            <h1>Osaka Wanted to Charge Foreign Visitors Extra Money, But Experts Said No</h1>
            <p>Today, Osaka, Japan, decided not to charge foreign visitors an extra fee. They were thinking about this fee, called "foreigner collection money" in Japan, to help pay for problems caused by too many tourists. But after a meeting today with experts, they found that this idea went against laws and fair rules. So, the experts suggested stopping the plan.</p>
            <p>The Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun reported that Osaka's Governor, Hirofumi Yoshimura, officially said last March that he wanted to charge foreign visitors an extra fee. He thought this money could help with "overtourism" problems. Yoshimura asked a group of experts, including university professors, if this plan was possible.</p>
            <p>Today, Osaka Prefecture held a meeting with these experts to talk about the plan. They made a decision and gave it to Osaka Prefecture. A main point discussed was how to collect the money, like through taxes or other charges. They thought that only taxing foreign visitors might go against tax agreements that say people should not be treated differently because of their nationality. Also, collecting a set fee at places like airports would take a lot of time to figure out how to do.</p>
            <p>The meeting concluded that more foreign visitors coming to Japan has made problems like more trash and not enough public toilets worse. However, they said that charging foreign visitors an extra fee has problems with fairness in law and how to do it in real life.</p>
            <p>The experts believe that "overtourism is not only caused by foreign visitors, so it's hard to clearly say why foreign visitors should pay an extra fee." The experts suggested that instead of this, Osaka should charge a lodging tax to all tourists, no matter their nationality, and use this money well.</p>
            <p>Osaka Prefecture is thinking about changing the lodging tax that hotels and inns collect. Starting in September, they might increase it from 100-200 yen per night to 200-500 yen per night (about NT$42 to NT$105). They expect that this tax will bring in 4 billion yen more this year than in 2024, making the total 7.3 billion yen.</p>
            <p>After hearing the experts' decision, Hirofumi Matsusaka, the head of Osaka Prefecture's Citizens' Culture Department, said that they will use the "lodging tax" effectively and take action. For now, they will not collect other fees from foreign visitors. They will also focus on tourists and local people living together happily and making Osaka a more attractive place.</p>
