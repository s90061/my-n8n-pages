            <h1>Yemen's Houthi Group Promises Revenge After Prime Minister and Other Important Leaders Die in Israeli Air Strike</h1>
            <p>A news agency run by Yemen's Houthi group reported today that the Prime Minister of the Houthi government and several other ministers died in an Israeli air strike on Sanaa, Yemen's capital. Mahdi al-Mashat, the leader of the top political group, made a statement saying the Houthi group has promised to get revenge.</p>
            <p>The report said that the attack on August 28 also caused injuries to many people, but it did not give more details.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army also confirmed tonight that they killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the Prime Minister of the Houthi government, and other important officials.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Israel announced yesterday that these air strikes were against high-ranking Houthi officials who are friends with Iran, including their chief of staff and defense minister.</p>
            <p>However, Mahdi al-Mashat's statement did not say if the Houthi defense minister was among those who died or were hurt.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that al-Mashat posted a video on the Telegram app. In the video, he said, "We promise God, the people of Yemen, and the families of those who died and were hurt that we will get revenge."</p>
            <p>He also told foreign companies to leave Israel quickly "before it is too late."</p>
            <p>Rahawi became Prime Minister almost one year ago. But Mohamed Moftah, his assistant, was the real leader of the government. Moftah was chosen today to be the temporary Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>Rahawi was mostly seen as a leader in name only and was not part of the Houthi group's main leaders.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that their fighter planes attacked a place in the Sanaa area where important Houthi leaders were meeting. They called this attack a "difficult operation" that worked because they had good information and strong air power.</p>
            <p>Israeli security sources said on August 28 that the attack aimed at several places where many high-ranking Houthi officials were watching a TV speech by their leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi.</p>
            <p>The Houthi group, which is supported by Iran, has attacked ships in the Red Sea. They said this was to support the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>They have also shot missiles at Israel, but most of them were stopped. In response, Israel attacked areas in Yemen controlled by the Houthi group, including the important port of Hodeidah.</p>

            <h1>A Big Hole in the Ground in Norway Swallows Parts of a Road and Railway, One Worker Dies</h1>
            <p>Authorities in Norway announced today that a very large hole opened up in the ground in a town north of Oslo. This happened because the ground fell in. The hole swallowed parts of a road and a railway, and one person died.</p>
            <p>Photos in Norwegian newspapers show that the hole is many meters wide. It affected both sides of the E6 highway and the train tracks next to it in the town of Levanger. Levanger is about 500 kilometers north of Norway's capital, Oslo.</p>
            <p>Norwegian police said in a statement that a worker from Denmark, who went missing at the accident site, is now believed to be dead.</p>
            <p>The company that manages Norway's train tracks, which is owned by the government, told NRK (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation) that they were working to make the soil stronger along the train tracks.</p>
            <p>The company said it is too soon to know if this work caused the big hole to appear.</p>
            <p>The Norwegian news agency NTB reported that experts said the ground in that area is mostly made of clay. This type of ground can sometimes cause such events.</p>
            <p>Authorities have moved people out of two houses that were near the accident site.</p>
            <p>The Norwegian Road Administration announced that the E6 highway in the area around the accident will be closed for several days.</p>

            <h1>The US Will Not Give Visas to Palestinian Officials for UN Meeting; Europe Asks Them to Change Their Decision</h1>
            <p>Kaja Kallas, Europe's main diplomat, said today that the European Union (EU) wants the United States to think again about its decision. The US decided not to give visas to Palestinian officials who want to go to the United Nations General Assembly next month.</p>
            <p>Kallas spoke after a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Copenhagen, Denmark. She said, "Because of the agreements between the United Nations and the country where it is located, we all ask them to change this decision."</p>
            <p>Kallas used "international law" to ask Washington to take back this unusual action. This decision makes the government of US President Donald Trump and the Israeli government seem more alike, especially during Israel's war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>France is trying to get countries to recognize Palestine as a state when world leaders meet in New York. Before the talks in Denmark, French Foreign Minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot publicly complained about the US not giving visas.</p>
            <p>Barrot told reporters, "Meetings of the UN General Assembly... should not have any limits on who can enter."</p>
            <p>In Copenhagen, other ministers also agreed with France. They asked the US to let the Palestinian group attend the meeting.</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority also asked the US to change its decision. They said it was "a clear breaking of international law and the agreement about the UN office."</p>
            <p>Mahmud Abbas, the 89-year-old President of the Palestinian Authority, has always been friendly with Washington. He had planned to go to the UN meeting.</p>
            <p>Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority President, told the Associated Press in Ramallah, West Bank, today, "We ask the American government to change its mind. This decision will only make things more tense and difficult."</p>
            <p>He added, "Since yesterday, we have been talking with Arab countries and other countries, especially those directly involved in this issue. This work will continue all day."</p>
