            <p>When reporters asked why Putin did not want to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump answered, "Because he does not like Zelenskyy."</p>

            <h1>Tseng Chun-hsin Loses in US Open First Round, Still Waiting for First Grand Slam Win</h1>
            <p>After three years, Taiwan's top tennis player, Tseng Chun-hsin, played in the main competition of the US Open again today. Sadly, he lost to Belgium's good player Bergs with scores of 3-6, 4-6, 3-6. This means he will have to wait longer for his first win in a major tennis tournament.</p>
            <p>The US Open is the last of the four biggest tennis tournaments. Tseng Chun-hsin, who is ranked 118th in the world, got a spot directly in the men's singles main draw this time. He was also Taiwan's only hope for singles. In the first round, he played against Zizou Bergs from Belgium, who is ranked 48th. Tseng wanted to get his first win in a Grand Slam main competition.</p>
            <p>Tseng started the match wanting to challenge his opponent. In the first set, he had a close fight with Bergs. But in the eighth game, he lost his serve and then lost the first set 3-6. Luckily, Tseng adjusted well in the second set. He used his opponent's unstable serves to get ahead 4-2. But then, he also had problems with his serve. He lost his serve twice and then lost the second set 4-6.</p>
            <p>With no other choice, Tseng played the third set trying his best. But he could not find his good form again. He lost his serve twice and fell far behind at 1-5. Even though he broke his opponent's serve once to try and stay in the game, he hit the ball into the net when trying a volley at the end. He lost the match 3-6. This means he will not go to the second round of the US Open men's singles. He is still waiting for his first win in a Grand Slam main competition.</p>
