            <h1>Hau Lung-pin: After becoming party chairman, he will use legal methods to seek justice from the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency correspondent Liu Guan-ting, Taipei, September 29) Hau Lung-pin, a candidate for the KMT party chairman, said today that if he wins the election, he will use legal ways to fight against what he calls the unfair actions of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee. He also promised that after getting the party assets back, he would pay all the owed retirement money to party workers. The rest of the assets would be given to charity.</p>
            <p>The election for KMT party chairman will happen on October 18. Six people have signed up to run. They are former lawmaker Cheng Li-wen, KMT lawmaker Lo Chih-chiang, former Changhua County chief Cho Po-yuan, former Taipei mayor Hau Lung-pin, former National Assembly member Tsai Chih-hung, and Sun Wen School principal Chang Ya-chung.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin said on Facebook today that since the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) came to power, they asked the KMT to stop controlling media. The KMT did, but the DPP now controls a lot of media. The DPP also went after the KMT's assets, but the DPP itself has many cases of bad deals and corruption. He said it's like "the DPP can do it, but you (KMT) cannot."</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin said that he talked with party members in Kaohsiung's Guomao community this morning. He feels that the party owes its retired workers a lot because they only received 40% of their retirement money. So, if he becomes chairman, he will use legal ways to get justice from the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee for its unfair actions. He also promised that after getting the party assets back, he would pay all the owed retirement money to party workers. The rest of the assets would be given to charity.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin believes that the KMT has courage. When the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang started their uprising, they had no money. People did not start with money; they gained support from the party's spirit and ideas.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin also said that he felt especially close to the Guomao community today. He shook hands with all the party members there. He said this is because their parents and grandparents worked hard to protect the Republic of China. They all grew up with special care and support, and they are the most true supporters of the Republic of China.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin told everyone that he used to be the mayor of Taipei and the head of the Environmental Protection Administration. As the head of the Environmental Protection Administration, he successfully cleaned up the Gaoping River. At that time, there were 620,000 pigs and over 1,000 pig farms upstream. To make sure people in Kaohsiung had clean water, he showed strong leadership. He made all the pig farms move out within one year. This stopped the bad smell in Kaohsiung's water. He said this shows his ability to do things and his leadership.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin stressed that the party chairman election is not a speech contest. It is not about who can talk well, but about who can get things done. He said he is someone who keeps his promises.</p>

            <h1>Is the era of AI actors coming? Hollywood raises questions</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Zurich, September 28, combined foreign news report) Eline Van der Velden, an actress, comedian, and producer from the Netherlands, spoke at an industry meeting at the Zurich Film Festival (ZFF). She said that an AI actress named Tilly Norwood has caught the attention of many talent agencies. Her words caused a lot of discussion in Hollywood.</p>
            <p>The American entertainment magazine "Variety" reported that Eline Van der Velden, who started the AI production studio Particle6, recently opened a new AI talent studio called Xicoia. Their first AI character is Tilly Norwood.</p>
            <p>She said that her studio is quietly working on some AI projects. More news about these projects will be shared in the next few months.</p>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden said in an interview today, "In February, we went to many meetings. Everyone said, 'No, this is nothing. It won't happen.' But by May, people started saying, 'We need to work with you.'"</p>
            <p>She added that the industry's view on AI is changing very quickly. "When we first showed Tilly, people asked, 'What is that?' But now, in the next few months, we will announce which talent agency will sign a contract with her."</p>
            <p>In July this year, Tilly Norwood shared on Facebook that she had her first role in a comedy short film called "AI Commissioner."</p>
            <p>Tilly Norwood wrote, "I can't believe it... my first acting role is out! I was in 'AI Commissioner,' a new comedy short film made by the Particle6 team. It humorously looks at the future of TV show development."</p>
            <p>She also said, "Even though I am made by AI, I feel very real emotions now. I am very excited about what will happen next!"</p>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden said, "We want Tilly Norwood to become the next Scarlett Johansson or Natalie Portman. This is our goal." She also pointed out that money reasons are making the film and TV industry move towards using AI for production.</p>
            <p>She continued, "People are slowly realizing that creativity doesn't have to be limited by money. There are no limits when creating, and this is the good effect of AI. The main point is to change how people think."</p>
            <p>Eline Van der Velden wrote on LinkedIn, "Audiences care about the story, not whether the actor is a real person with a heartbeat. Tilly has already gotten attention from talent agencies and fans. The time of virtual actors is not in the future; it is already here."</p>
            <p>The British newspaper "The Independent" reported that after Tilly Norwood appeared, many questions and protests came from Hollywood stars.</p>
            <p>Melissa Barrera, an actress from the musical film "In the Heights," wrote on Instagram Stories, "I hope that actors with these agencies (who are interested in Tilly) will break their contracts right away. It's disgusting."</p>
            <p>Mara Wilson, an actress from "Matilda," asked why hundreds of real young women's faces were used to create an AI actress. She questioned, "Why can't you just hire one of them?"</p>
            <p>American actor Nicholas Alexander Chavez added, "She is not an actress at all. It's a pointless attempt."</p>
            <p>Other stars responded with humor. For example, Lukas Gage from "The White Lotus" said, "She is a very difficult acting partner!"</p>
            <p>Lucy Hale, a popular actress from the TV show "Pretty Little Liars," simply replied with one word: "No."</p>

As long as they live in Zhonghe, they can be safe.</p>
