            <h1>Trump Visited UK, Mentioned Kirk, and Criticized Jimmy Kimmel Again</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump finished his state visit to the UK. Earlier, at a press conference, he said he believed that Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist who passed away, could have become president of the United States one day. Trump also criticized Jimmy Kimmel, a late-night show host, saying he had no talent.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump had a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. At the start of his speech, Trump said: "Just last week, a great American, Charlie Kirk, was brutally killed for speaking his mind."</p>
            <p>"He was a wonderful young man with a bright future. Some people said he might become president in the future, and I told him, I said, 'Charlie, I think you could very likely become president one day.'"</p>
            <p>Trump also thanked "many British citizens who offered their condolences."</p>
            <p>Separately, Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show was stopped after he commented on Kirk's death. Trump had already written on his social media platform, Truth Social: "This is great news for America."</p>
            <p>At today's press conference, Trump again criticized Jimmy Kimmel, calling him "not a talented person." Trump did not consider whether Kimmel's suspension was related to attacking free speech.</p>
            <p>Trump said: "His ratings were very bad, he should have been fired a long time ago. So you can call it free speech or not, he was fired because he had no talent."</p>
            <p>In the press conference, Trump also talked about many other topics. These included the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, and the US-China agreement on the short video platform TikTok.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump and First Lady Melania Trump then boarded Air Force One, the presidential plane, at Stansted Airport near London. They waved to the media but did not speak. This marked the end of their two-day state visit.</p>

            <h1>Jensen Huang Talks About Investing in Intel, Says Government Did Not Interfere, Continues to Look at Foundry Technology</h1>
            <p>Today, Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, spoke about Nvidia buying shares in Intel and their technology cooperation. He said that Nvidia and Intel's team discussed the agreement quietly for almost a year. The Trump government was not involved. This is a very good investment and could create a market worth 50 billion US dollars every year. When asked about chip manufacturing (foundry), Huang only said that today's announcement is mostly about working together on custom CPUs.</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, and Patrick Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, held an online press conference today. They answered questions about their plan to work together on products and Nvidia's decision to invest in Intel.</p>
            <p>When asked if the Trump government was involved in this cooperation, Huang said that they were not. He had the chance to tell Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, about this news today. Lutnick was very happy and supportive of the cooperation between the two American tech companies.</p>
            <p>The Trump government has previously talked about moving chip manufacturing back to the US. The media asked about the future of making chips in the US, how many chips would be made in the US soon, and the challenges of making more chips in the US. Gelsinger only replied, "I think this (local manufacturing) is very important, and we must seriously look at this issue and the chances we have."</p>
            <p>The two companies announced they will work together to create custom data center and personal computer (PC) products for many generations. For data centers, Intel will build custom x86 central processing units (CPUs) for Nvidia. For personal computers, Intel will make system-on-chips (SoCs) that combine Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) and Intel's CPU technology.</p>
            <p>Nvidia also announced it would invest 5 billion US dollars (about 150.4 billion New Taiwan dollars) and buy shares in Intel.</p>
            <p>Huang expects that this cooperation could create 50 billion US dollars (about 1.5 trillion New Taiwan dollars) in business every year. He said, "We are happy to be a shareholder in Intel, and we are happy to invest in Intel. The return on this investment will be very good."</p>
            <p>When the media asked if this cooperation would affect TSMC's chip manufacturing, and if Nvidia was confident in Intel helping to produce AI chips, Huang replied that TSMC is a world-class chip foundry. TSMC's manufacturing technology, speed of work, production capacity, size of infrastructure, and quick business operations make it an amazing world-class chip foundry. He stressed that today's cooperation focuses on the custom CPU areas for data centers and personal computers mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p>Huang said: "We have always looked at Intel's chip manufacturing technology, and we will continue to do so. But today's announcement is fully focused on these custom CPUs."</p>
            <p>Huang mentioned that Nvidia currently buys Arm-based CPUs from TSMC and x86-based CPUs from the market. "In the future, we will buy x86-based CPUs from Intel... we will become a very big customer for Intel's CPUs." He also said that this cooperation agreement does not affect Nvidia's business relationship with Arm.</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that Nvidia will become an important supplier of GPU chiplets (small chips) in Intel's chips.</p>
            <p>Gelsinger also stated, "We all deeply respect TSMC, Mr. Morris Chang, and Mr. C.C. Wei... TSMC has always been a long-term and important partner for Nvidia and Intel. We will continue to maintain this partnership."</p>
            <p>Huang noted that the two sides reached this agreement after quiet discussions for almost a year. White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to the media that the cooperation between Intel and Nvidia is a major step forward for high-tech manufacturing in the US.</p>

            <h1>Magnitude 6.1 Earthquake Hits Central Papua, Indonesia</h1>
            <p>The US Geological Survey (USGS) reported that a shallow earthquake with a magnitude of 6.1 happened early this morning in Central Papua province, Indonesia.</p>
            <p>According to the USGS, the earthquake's center was about 28 kilometers south of Nabire town. Nabire is on the large Pacific island that Indonesia and Papua New Guinea share.</p>
            <p>The USGS measured the earthquake at magnitude 6.1 and a depth of 10 kilometers. However, Indonesia's Agency for Meteorology, Climatology, and Geophysics (BMKG) reported a magnitude of 6.6 and a depth of 24 kilometers. They also noted that there have been several aftershocks.</p>
