            <h1>San Shing Life Insurance Says No Capital Gap for New Rules, Not NT$100 Billion</h1>
            <p>A news report said that San Shing Life Insurance might need more than NT$100 billion by 2040. This money would be to meet the new ICS (Insurance Capital Standard) rules, which say companies must have at least 100% of their needed capital. But San Shing Life Insurance said today that this number was just an guess by the media. Their own checks in April showed they do not have a gap in capital for the new rules.</p>
            <p>There were rumors that San Shing Life Insurance, an old insurance company, was looking to sell. It is believed that three financial groups and one insurance company received invitations. News reports said that starting next year, when Taiwan uses the new ICS system, San Shing Life Insurance might need over NT$100 billion in its own money by 2040. This is to keep its ICS level at 100% or more.</p>
            <p>San Shing Life Insurance sent out a message tonight. They said the NT$100 billion number was only an estimate from the media. They also said it was very different from their plan to move to the new rules and their own ongoing management. Their latest check in April showed no problem with capital for the new rules. San Shing Life Insurance also said that their business and how they handle claims are working well. They want to assure customers that their rights are safe.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's insurance companies will start using two new systems in 2026. These are IFRS 17 (international financial reporting rules) and TW-ICS (Taiwan's own insurance capital rules).</p>
            <p>San Shing Life Insurance said that to prepare for these new systems, they are now selling different products. Their main products, like investment plans that bring in a lot of money at the start, will now focus on stable income. This income will add to the company's own capital. Also, their new health insurance plans are more about giving protection and being for a set time. These plans make more profit than older types of life insurance. And for long-term health insurance, they often use reinsurance, which means they manage risks well.</p>

            <h1>White House Adviser: US Government Might Buy Shares in More Companies, Like Intel</h1>
            <p>Kevin Hassett, who advises the White House on money matters, said today that he thinks the U.S. government might keep buying parts of companies. This would be like what they did with Intel. He hopes this will help create a big fund for the country later.</p>
            <p>The White House said on August 22 that the U.S. government would use about 8.9 billion US dollars to buy 10% of Intel, a big American company that makes computer chips. Some of this money came from a law called the "Chips Act."</p>
            <p>Hassett spoke on a TV show called Squawk Box on CNBC. He said this was a very special case because a lot of money came from the Chips Act.</p>
            <p>He also said that the President, when he was running for election, said it would be good if the U.S. could someday have a large national fund. So, Hassett believes there will be more similar deals in the future, maybe in different types of businesses.</p>

            <h1>El Salvador Man Wrongly Sent Away From US, Then Arrested Again, May Be Sent to Africa</h1>
            <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant from El Salvador, was wrongly sent out of the U.S. before. He was a main topic in talks about former President Trump's strict immigration rules. U.S. officials said today that he has been arrested again. He might be sent out of the country once more.</p>
            <p>News agency AFP said that Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary, stated that ICE (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) arrested Abrego Garcia today. Earlier this year, in March, he was wrongly sent to El Salvador. After that, he was sent back to the U.S.</p>
            <p>Noem posted on social media X that ICE is "working on sending him away."</p>
            <p>Abrego Garcia's lawyer said that the U.S. government wants to send him to Uganda. This is an African country far away.</p>
            <p>After Abrego Garcia came back to the U.S., he was put in jail. This was because he was accused of helping people enter the country illegally. Last week, he was let out of a prison in Tennessee. He was allowed to go back to his home in Maryland while he waited for his court case.</p>
            <p>He had to go to ICE in Baltimore today. This was one of the conditions for him to be released from jail.</p>
            <p>Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of his lawyers, said that when his client went to the meeting with ICE, he was taken and held by them.</p>
