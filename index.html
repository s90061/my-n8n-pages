            <h1>Cuba's President Travels to Asia to Find Help for Economy, Visiting China, Vietnam, and Laos</h1>
            <p>Cuba's President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, said today that he has started a trip to Asia. He will visit China, Laos, and Vietnam. Vietnam is Cuba's most important partner for trade and business in Asia.</p>
            <p>Cuba, which has about 10.9 million people, is currently facing big economic problems. Also, worldwide trade has been affected by former US President Donald Trump's tax policies on goods.</p>
            <p>President Diaz-Canel wrote on social media platform X: "This weekend, we are starting official visits to Vietnam, China, and Laos. These friendly countries have strong relationships with us, a history of working together and being united, and they have also passed the test of time and big challenges."</p>
            <p>According to the Center for International Policy Research in Cuba, Vietnam has become Cuba's biggest investor in Asia since they started business together in 2020. Their total trade is about 340 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Vietnam sells rice, coal, chemicals, textiles, and electronic parts to Cuba. Cuba mainly sells medicines to Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Recently, Cuba allowed a Vietnamese company called Agri VAM to grow rice on 1,000 hectares of land west of Havana, the capital city. Vietnam has helped Cuba with rice farming methods before, but this is the first time a private Vietnamese company will grow rice directly in Cuba.</p>
            <p>Rice is one of the main foods in Cuba. On average, each person eats about 60 kilograms of rice every year.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Higher Education and Job Fair Opens in Bangkok with 39 Universities and 12 Taiwanese Companies</h1>
            <p>To make education cooperation between Taiwan and Thailand stronger and to help universities and businesses work together, the 2025 Thailand Taiwan Higher Education and Job Fair is happening in Bangkok, Thailand, from August 30th to 31st. Thirty-nine universities from Taiwan and 12 Taiwanese companies are there to find talented Thai people.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Education announced today that this education fair has gathered 39 universities from Taiwan. They are giving information about their study programs, how to apply, scholarship details, and advice for studying abroad. The Steering Committee for the Test Of Chinese as a Foreign Language (TOCFL) is also at the fair. They are giving full information about Chinese language tests for students who want to study in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Visitors to the fair also have a chance to win prizes. The biggest prize is a free 3-month in-person Chinese language course from a Taiwanese Chinese language center. Besides the education fair, the event also includes job support. Twelve Taiwanese companies have booths there to offer internships and job advice to Thai students. This helps students plan their careers after studying in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that educational cooperation between Taiwan and Thailand is growing. Both sides signed an agreement on June 20th to work together on technical and vocational education and training. This will give Thai students more chances for practical training when they study in Taiwan. To support the Ministry of Education's plan to help international students come to and stay in Taiwan, the Taiwan-Thailand International Talent Circulation Base also opened in Bangkok on August 29th. It will offer pre-learning courses for Chinese, platforms for academic exchange, and international cooperation resources.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education also said that in the 2024-2025 school year, more than 120,000 foreign students came to study in Taiwan. Nearly 5,000 of these students were from Thailand, making Thailand the 6th largest source of students coming to Taiwan. This shows that there is still a lot of potential for academic exchange between Taiwan and Thailand. In the future, Taiwan will continue to hold events like this higher education fair to attract more Thai students to study in Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>CCTV: Putin Arrives in China for Visit with a Large Group</h1>
            <p>According to China's state media CCTV News, Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in Tianjin by plane. He will attend the 2025 Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. After that, he will go to Beijing for events to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and World War II, including a military parade on September 3rd. The report states that Russia shared that a "large and important" group is with Putin on his visit to China. This group includes three deputy prime ministers and more than ten ministers.</p>
            <p>CCTV News reported that this is Putin's second visit to China since his state visit last May.</p>
            <p>Russia is one of the six countries that started the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. The report describes the relationship: "Under the strategic guidance of the leaders of China and Russia, the relationship between the two countries is at its best time in history. It has become one of the most stable, developed, and strategically important relationships between big countries in today's changing world."</p>
            <p>After his visit to Tianjin, Putin will travel to Beijing. He will attend the events for the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the War of Resistance against Japan and the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War.</p>
            <p>CCTV reported that Russia said a "large and important" group is traveling with Putin to China. This group includes three deputy prime ministers, more than ten ministers, and representatives from big companies. Putin's visit to China for these events further shows the high level of the comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Russia in this new era.</p>
            <p>Before this, Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov said in an interview that Putin will visit China for four days. He described the multi-day trip as unusual for Putin.</p>
            <p>Some experts believe that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will also be at the September 3rd military parade. Looking at the leaders who will be there, it is important to see if an anti-Western alliance between China, Russia, and North Korea will form.</p>
