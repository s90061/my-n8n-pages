            <h1>US Tech News Says Nvidia Has Limited H20 Chips for China</h1>
            <p>The Information, a website about technology news in the US, reported today that Nvidia, a big American company that makes AI chips, has told its customers in China that there are not many H20 chips available. Nvidia also does not plan to make more of these chips.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that the H20 chip was the strongest AI chip Nvidia could sell to China. This was allowed under export rules from the US. But in April, the US government stopped the sale of H20 chips. Because of this, The Information, using information from two people who know about the situation, said that Nvidia has had to stop taking new orders. Nvidia also canceled its orders for making these chips with TSMC, the company that produces them.</p>
            <p>Nvidia said earlier this week that they are planning to start selling H20 chips to China again.</p>
