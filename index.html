Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work, leading to major shifts in businesses and daily tasks. Experts suggest that AI won't just replace jobs entirely, but rather transform them, making some parts of a job easier while creating new tasks. This means many workers will need to learn new skills to work effectively alongside AI technologies. Companies are investing heavily in AI tools to improve efficiency and productivity, from automating customer service to helping with creative projects.

For employees, this transformation can mean more time for complex thinking, as AI handles repetitive or data-heavy tasks. However, it also brings challenges, such as the need for continuous learning and adapting to new ways of working. Some worry about job security, but others see opportunities for career growth in new AI-related fields like AI management or ethical AI development. The culture of work is evolving, with a greater focus on digital skills and collaboration between humans and machines. This technological shift is a key topic for businesses globally as they try to integrate AI responsibly and prepare their workforce for the future.

**Global Heatwaves Impact Summer Travel and Local Economies**

This summer, many parts of the world have experienced unusually high temperatures and heatwaves, significantly affecting travel plans and local economies. Popular tourist destinations, especially in southern Europe, have seen fewer visitors as people try to avoid extreme heat. This trend is impacting businesses that rely on tourism, such as hotels, restaurants, and tour operators, leading to concerns about reduced income. Travellers are now looking for cooler destinations or choosing to travel during off-peak seasons, like spring or autumn, to avoid the intense heat.

These high temperatures not only make sightseeing difficult but also pose health risks for tourists and locals. As a result, some cities and travel companies are adapting by promoting indoor activities, adjusting opening hours, or offering more evening events. The shift in travel patterns highlights how climate change is directly influencing daily life and business decisions. For many regions, finding sustainable ways to manage tourism in a warming world is becoming a critical challenge, requiring innovation in how travel is planned and enjoyed.

**The "15-Minute City" Concept: Rethinking Urban Daily Life**

An innovative urban planning idea called the "15-minute city" is gaining attention around the world, aiming to improve daily life for city residents. The concept suggests that all essential services and amenities â€“ like shops, schools, parks, workplaces, and healthcare â€“ should be accessible within a 15-minute walk or bike ride from one's home. This vision seeks to create more local, livable communities and reduce the need for cars, which can lead to less traffic and cleaner air.

Supporters argue that 15-minute cities can boost local businesses, encourage walking and cycling, and build stronger community connections. It promotes a more sustainable way of living and can improve public health by encouraging physical activity. However, some critics express concerns that such a model could limit people's freedom of movement or lead to certain areas becoming less accessible. Despite the debate, cities like Paris and Melbourne are already implementing elements of this idea, aiming to reshape urban culture and daily routines for a more convenient and environmentally friendly future.`;
