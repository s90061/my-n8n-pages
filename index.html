            <h1>Taiwan People's Party Opposes Wind Turbines in Yilan; Company Hopes for Calm Talks</h1>
            <p>The preparation office for Yifeng Power Company, part of Taiya Wind Energy, plans to build 14 wind turbines in Yilan. Today, the Taiwan People's Party went to the Executive Yuan to protest and gave a letter to show they are against it. Taiya Wind Energy said they respect the opposing views and hope for peaceful and sensible talks.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Chen Wan-hui, the head of the Taiwan People's Party in Yilan County, and local people from Yilan held a press conference in front of the Executive Yuan. The event was called "Taiya Wind Turbines Get Out, Protect Yilan's Coast." Chen Wan-hui said that a meeting planned for Wujie Township was canceled because many people strongly disagreed. But Taiya Wind Energy still said it would "be held later," showing they have not given up on their plan.</p>
            <p>Chen Wan-hui stated that there are many examples in Taiwan where wind turbines near homes cause low-frequency noise and flickering. This can affect people's sleep and mental health over time. She said, "Yilan is our home. The people who have lived here for generations will not let companies take advantage of us in the name of green energy."</p>
            <p>Xie Zhichao, a project director for Taiya Wind Energy, explained that public meetings are held as required by rules. He said they respect local opposition. Taiya Wind Energy hopes to explain the plan because some local people might misunderstand it. A public meeting is the best way for people to quickly and directly learn about the project.</p>
            <p>Xie Zhichao added that Taiya Wind Energy wants to hear what residents think and worry about the project. They want to sit down calmly and talk about each part of the project. They also want to explain the real effects and how to make things better, and how to work with local development. He said they are not acting alone and hope to reach an agreement and balance.</p>
            <p>Li Jianxun, the CEO of Taiya Wind Energy, said that Taiya Wind Energy is a private company that only works on renewable energy. It does not have any political party connections. He asked people not to wrongly suggest things that would confuse local residents. He explained that any project must go through government checks and also needs local agreement to continue. It's not something they can just build whenever they want.</p>
            <p>The Yifeng Power Company's preparation office plans to build a wind power plant along the coasts of Wujie Township and Su'ao Township in Yilan County. They plan to set up 14 wind turbines with a total power of about 98 megawatts (MW). A meeting was planned for today at the Chengxing Village Senior Citizens' Welfare Center in Wujie Township. However, the association decided not to lend the venue after a meeting earlier, so the public meeting will be held another time.</p>

            <h1>Osaka World Expo: 11 Pavilions, Including US and China, Reportedly Owe Money</h1>
            <p>Contractors for the 2025 World Expo in Osaka, also known as the Osaka-Kansai Expo, have reportedly not received money for their work from countries taking part from overseas. The group that runs the Expo announced yesterday that contractors for 11 pavilions have told Japanese officials or the Expo organizers about unpaid bills.</p>
            <p>According to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition (Expo Association), which runs the Osaka-Kansai Expo, said that the pavilions with unpaid construction costs include those for the United States, Angola, India, Uzbekistan, Serbia, Thailand, China, Germany, Poland, Malta, and Romania. This makes a total of 11 countries.</p>
            <p>Angola and India chose "Plan X," where the Expo Association built their pavilions, and then the participating countries decorated the inside and outside. The other nine countries, not including Angola and India, chose "Plan A." In this plan, they signed contracts directly with contractors to build their exhibition halls.</p>
            <p>Contractors who did not get paid formed a group to help themselves in May this year. Some cases have already gone to court. For example, a construction company in Osaka that worked on the Serbian and German pavilions has sued in the Tokyo District Court. They are asking the company that hired them, a public relations company in Tokyo, to pay about 328 million Japanese Yen (about 69 million New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Takashina Atsushi, the deputy secretary-general of the Expo Association, said at a press conference on the first of this month, "Even though we clearly told participating countries to follow the rules, these problems are getting worse. We are very sorry and regret this."</p>
            <p>The Osaka Expo will open on April 13th and will last for half a year, until October 13th. The event will be held on Yumeshima, an artificial island in Osaka City.</p>

            <h1>Tainan Products Sold Overseas in 18 Events; Tokyo Food Expo Brings Over NT$400 Million, a New High</h1>
            <p>Today, the Tainan City Government announced its success in selling farm and fish products overseas during the first half of this year. They held 18 marketing events abroad. One of these, the Tokyo International Food Exhibition, brought in an expected profit of 420 million New Taiwan Dollars, which is the best result ever.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Tainan City Government's Agriculture Bureau held a press conference at the Minjhih Civic Center. It was called "2025 Tainan City Farm and Fish Products Overseas Sales Results for the First Half of the Year." Mayor Huang Wei-che led the city government team and several companies that took part. They explained their achievements in selling farm and fish products in international markets.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Wei-che said in his speech that Tainan is not only an old cultural city and a tech hub, but also an important area for farm and fish products. Although the amount produced this year was less due to natural disasters, the overseas sales were excellent. Through tasting events, special offers, and working with brands, Tainan's fruits successfully entered big chain stores and supermarkets in many countries. This has attracted local shoppers who order from Tainan every year.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Wei-che stressed that the hard work of farmers and fishermen has made "Tainan brands" strong in the world. For example, even though Taiwan tilapia faced challenges with US tariffs, it successfully entered markets in Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asia. Now, pork is also expected to be sold overseas. Many processing factories in Taiwan have received international approval. He hopes Tainan can also have its own processing factory soon to promote good quality meat.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-lin, the head of Tainan City's Agriculture Bureau, said that in the first half of this year, Tainan's farm and fish products got a lot of attention and real orders through food exhibitions, working with sales channels, and various promotional events. In the future, the Agriculture Bureau will continue to help businesses plan their overseas sales and use more marketing strategies. This will help Tainan's good quality farm and fish products stay strong in the international market for a long time.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture Bureau shared information showing that the city government team held 18 international food exhibitions and other overseas marketing events in the first half of the year. These included taking part in international food exhibitions in Tokyo, Singapore, and South Korea. They also arranged for products to be sold and promoted in overseas stores. Additionally, they marketed farm products by attending local festivals, travel fairs, and meeting with local retailers and traders overseas.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture Bureau reported that the Tokyo International Food Exhibition brought in an expected profit of 420 million New Taiwan Dollars, and orders for fresh and processed fruits went over 6,000 metric tons. This is the best record ever. Especially, Nansi winter dates, after low-temperature checks, were sent directly to Japan and stayed sweet. During the Tokyo Food Exhibition, they were successfully sold in Japanese supermarkets.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture Bureau explained that the Singapore International Food Exhibition created an expected profit of about 300 million New Taiwan Dollars. Orders for fresh fruit there were more than 500 metric tons. After the exhibition, Tainan pineapples were part of over 60 tasting events in local chain supermarkets. During the sales period, one container of pineapples often sold out in 1 to 2 days. Also, taking part in the Korea International Food Exhibition led to almost 200 million New Taiwan Dollars in benefits, showing how competitive Tainan's farm products are internationally.</p>
