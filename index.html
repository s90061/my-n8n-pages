US President Donald Trump said he might make Elon Musk leave the country. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has been criticizing a new government spending plan by Trump. Trump also said he would look into money that Musk's companies, like Tesla and SpaceX, got from the US government.

Musk supported Trump's election last year and even worked for Trump's government for a short time. However, they started disagreeing publicly in June because Musk didn't like Trump's new spending bill. Musk said that if the bill passes, he might start a new political party.

Trump believes Musk is upset because the new bill might stop support for electric car businesses. Trump warned Musk that he could lose a lot more. On social media, Trump even said that without government help, Musk might have to close his companies and go back to South Africa.
