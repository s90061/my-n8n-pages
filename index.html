            <h1>Central and Local Governments Work Together to Protect Penghu's Ocean</h1>
            <p>On August 5th, the head of the Ocean Affairs Council, Kuan Bi-ling, said in Penghu that the lives of Penghu people are closely linked to the ocean. The ocean helps them a lot, and this help is very important. The central government and the local government are working together to show they want to protect the ocean's resources.</p>
            <p>Kuan Bi-ling arrived in Penghu today. In the afternoon, she met with County Mayor Chen Kuang-fu. They talked deeply about protecting the ocean, keeping the marine environment clean, ensuring safety at sea, and keeping nature healthy forever. This meeting showed that the central and local governments are working together to protect the ocean's resources.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu said that Penghu is surrounded by sea and has many special ocean resources. For example, the Taiwan Shoal is about 8800 square kilometers. The ocean is not just where Penghu people live, but also key for tourism and managing things in a way that lasts. He thanked the Ocean Affairs Council for always supporting Penghu. This support includes checking water quality, protecting sea turtles, helping habitats and corals grow again, planting seagrass, and teaching about the ocean. All these efforts have really improved how Penghu manages its ocean.</p>
            <p>Kuan Bi-ling pointed out that the ocean's contributions are very important and should not be ignored. The livelihoods of Penghu residents depend a lot on the ocean. She praised Penghu for its hard work and good results in beach cleaning, removing ocean trash, and conservation efforts. However, because the Financial Allocation Act will start next year, the central government's budget will change. She hopes that local governments can keep putting more effort into ocean matters. The central government will also continue to give the help and resources needed, so they can all work together for a healthy ocean in the long run.</p>

            <h1>Song Sheng-Jui Hits Home Run After "Warning" Teammates, Thanks Coach</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 5th (CNA) â€” Song Sheng-Jui from the CTBC Brothers baseball team hit a home run in a game on August 3rd, playing as a substitute. He said that before the game, he told his teammates, like a "warning," that if he didn't hit a home run, it would be because he had done weight training. He has been playing very well, hitting 4 home runs in his last 6 games. He thanked the coach for giving him chances even when he was not playing well, which helped him learn from his mistakes.</p>
            <p>Song Sheng-Jui of the CTBC Brothers team has been playing very well lately. From July 27th to 30th, he hit a home run in three games in a row. On August 3rd, in a game against the Rakuten Monkeys, he did not start. He came in to play defense in the 6th inning. In the 7th inning, he hit a solo home run, which was his 8th home run this season.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Song Sheng-Jui talked to reporters and said he wanted to "tell a funny story." He said that before the August 3rd game, he knew he wouldn't start, so he went to the weight training room. His coach even asked him, "You have a game today, why are you doing weights?" Song Sheng-Jui said he thought of it as a warm-up. He also "warned" his teammates before the game. He told them that if he didn't hit a home run when he came in later in the game, he would have an excuse: it was because of the weight training.</p>
            <p>Song Sheng-Jui also said that at the beginning of July, he was not playing well and didn't know why. Wang Wei-chen and Chiang Kun-yu helped him by watching and seeing if anything was different from before. He kept trying different things, and now his playing is getting better and better.</p>
            <p>Counting today's game, Song Sheng-Jui has played in all 77 games this season. He said that it is still a bit hard to get used to playing every day. But he told himself to keep going. He also thanked head coach Heiichi Hirano for giving him chances to start even when he wasn't playing well before. By going through failures, he learned from them and now knows how to play better.</p>
            <p>Talking about what is different this season, Song Sheng-Jui said that he planned to gain weight during the off-season. He also hired a trainer and learned a lot at a training center in the United States. Taking in and using that information has helped him a lot. His mindset is also different now. He thinks positively to find problems, and he doesn't worry too much after a few mistakes. His mind is calm when he goes to bat.</p>
            <p>Heiichi Hirano once said that Song Sheng-Jui was his first choice for the leadoff hitter position. Song Sheng-Jui also said that he hopes he can do well in this role. However, his ability to choose pitches this year is not very good yet. He hopes to quickly improve his "plate discipline."</p>

            <h1>Foreign Investors Buy NT$11.4 Billion for 2nd Day, Focus on Server Stocks</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 5th (CNA) â€” Taiwan's stock market went up by 281.65 points today, closing at 23660.59 points. Foreign and mainland Chinese investors bought NT$11.488 billion worth of shares, making it two days in a row of buying. They mainly bought shares in server companies. Wistron was bought the most, with 20,800 units, followed by Synnex with 19,200 units and Hon Hai with 13,300 units.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market strongly bounced back by more than 200 points today. Electronic stocks led the way up. Companies that make cooling systems, robot parts, and smaller stocks also got a lot of investment. The market index closed at 23660.59 points, up by 281.65 points, which is a 1.2% increase. It stayed above all its average lines. The total amount of money traded was NT$367.844 billion.</p>
            <p>Today, dealers bought NT$4.525 billion, investment trusts bought NT$3.982 billion, and foreign and mainland Chinese investors bought NT$11.488 billion. All three main types of investors together bought NT$19.995 billion.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 stocks foreign investors bought, they were Wistron (20,800 units), Taiwan Business Bank (20,400 units), Synnex (19,200 units), Hon Hai (13,300 units), Innolux (13,300 units), Yuanta High Dividend ETF (0056) (12,300 units), Quanta (12,100 units), Asia Air Survey (8058 units), Capitalization Taiwan Select High Dividend ETF (00919) (7914 units), and AUO (7740 units).</p>
            <p>Investment trusts bought a lot of financial stocks. Their top 10 buys included CTBC Financial, First Financial, Taishin Financial, Mega Financial, Cathay Financial, E.SUN Financial, Fubon Financial, Synnex, Yuanta Financial, and E.SUN Financial.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-Han, an assistant manager at Cathay Securities, said that poor economic data from the United States last Friday caused US stocks to fall sharply. But after thinking about it, the market saw the weaker economic data as a good sign because it meant interest rates might be cut more. This helped US stocks bounce back, and Taiwan stocks went up too.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-Han explained that today's rebound in Taiwan's stock market was mainly led by electronic stocks. Also, because the market risk was lower, smaller stocks and the over-the-counter market index also saw gains, which means the current upward trend has not changed. Although the results of the MSCI index adjustment will be announced next week, the changes will only start at the end of the month. So, it will not affect the index much in the short term.</p>
