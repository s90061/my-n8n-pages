            <h1>Lithuania's New Government Begins, Culture Minister Still Questioned</h1>
            <p>Lithuania's new government has officially started its work. The Parliament approved the new government's plans on September 25th. Prime Minister Ruginiene and 14 ministers swore an oath and began their jobs. This is the 20th group of ministers. However, many people are still questioning the professional background of the new Minister of Culture, Adomavicius.</p>
            <p>Lithuania's national radio (LRT) reported that a conservative politician, Mindaugas Linge, made a joke. He said the new government's professional standards are "somewhere between a barbecue seller and a pasta maker." This was a hint that Adomavicius's family runs a business selling pasta and dumplings, and he might not have enough experience for the job.</p>
            <p>President Nauseda also joked before that running a barbecue shop or selling expensive cars is not good experience for a minister. But in the end, he still chose Adomavicius as the Minister of Culture. This made hundreds of people from the cultural world and artists protest at the President's office yesterday.</p>
            <p>Before this, the former Prime Minister of Lithuania, Gintautas Paluckas, had to quit after an investigation into a conflict of interest. A new politician from the Social Democratic Party, Inga Ruginiene, was chosen by President Nauseda to be the new Prime Minister. She was in charge of forming the new government.</p>
            <p>Forming this government was difficult and took 30 days. This is longer than the previous government's 21 days. It is also the longest time to form a government in Lithuania since its constitution was passed in 1992. Out of the ministers, 8 are new, and 6 will stay in their old jobs.</p>
            <p>On September 25th, the Lithuanian Parliament approved the new government's plans with 80 votes for, 40 against, and 2 abstentions. The new government then officially started.</p>
            <p>Ruginiene said that the new government will work hard to make public services better, encourage public discussion, spend more money on national defense, and make sure salaries grow. They also want to improve the lives of retired people and those who are disadvantaged. She said that all decisions will be based on respect and talking to each other.</p>
            <p>The government's plans include raising defense spending to 5% of the country's GDP. They will not raise taxes during their time in office. They will not increase the diesel fuel tax. They will make pension adjustments faster. They will also increase social benefits and salaries for government workers. They will reduce waiting times for medical care and improve road maintenance. Also, they will stop extra charges for health insurance items. Most of these plans continue what the previous government was doing. For foreign affairs, they plan to be less strict with China and want to have normal diplomatic relations again.</p>
            <p>However, the opposition parties said that the new group of ministers and their plans are "messy." They pointed out that some ministers did not help write the plans. Also, the plans involve a lot of spending but do not say where new money will come from. Many people also questioned the professional backgrounds of several chosen ministers. How Ruginiene will lead the new government and deal with these questions will be important for everyone to watch.</p>

            <h1>Green Party Accuses Huang Kuo-chang of Secret Filming, White Party Criticizes Media</h1>
            <p>The Green Party says Huang Kuo-chang is involved in a secret filming group and uses dirty political methods. The White Party says the media is mixing up facts.</p>
            <p>Today, Mirror News reported that Huang Kuo-chang, who is the head of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), has built a group that secretly follows and films politicians from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The report said Huang Kuo-chang even led these secret filming operations himself. DPP lawmakers are very angry and say that if this is true, it would be the biggest bad scandal in politics right now. The TPP, on the other hand, says that Mirror News is making things up and confusing facts. They say the report is a way to change the topic from problems with disaster relief.</p>
            <p>Last June, DPP lawmaker Wang Yi-chuan thought someone was following him, so he reported it to the police. In August, the prosecutor decided not to charge anyone. But today, Mirror News reported that Huang Kuo-chang has been secretly filming DPP politicians for years and even gave orders to the people doing the filming.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Wu Sze-yao said today that there have been rumors in politics and in the parliament for some time that a secret filming group might exist. She said the clues revealed by the media now are very similar to these rumors, which shows that this secret filming group really does exist.</p>
            <p>Wu Sze-yao said that if the media report is true, it is truly the biggest bad scandal in politics today. She said it is wrong to use bad ways like watching, following, and secretly filming political opponents who have different ideas. She called this a very evil and dirty political method. She asked all the people who have been harmed to take legal action together, because only the law can protect victims.</p>
            <p>The media said that Wang Yi-chuan has been asking questions about this for many days, but Huang Kuo-chang has always replied by saying he won't join in or stoop to a low level. Wu Sze-yao pointed out that Huang Kuo-chang, who loves to connect different things and spread bad rumors about others, is very good at it. But when it's about himself, even when things are very clear, he chooses to avoid the topic. She said Huang Kuo-chang's recent reactions in front of the media show he is weak and feels guilty. He cannot hide for much longer and should bravely face the issue instead of blaming others or avoiding the topic.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi-chuan said in an interview today that China's Taiwan Affairs Office announced sanctions against him last May. He said that secret photographers started renting cars and following him in May of last year. If the people who followed other politicians are the same group, work for the same company, and are led by the same person he faced, then it is not just about him being followed.</p>
            <p>He asked, "Where did the money for these things come from? Who paid these people? And where did the money come from?" He said he will sue Huang Kuo-chang's group and will not stop until he finds out the truth. He added, "Huang Kuo-chang, you cannot hide anymore."</p>
            <p>The TPP said today in a statement that Mirror Media followed and bothered Huang Kuo-chang in the summer of 2023. Huang Kuo-chang only collected evidence to protect himself. Two years later, Mirror News used parts of those old conversations to make up a story, mixing up facts. They did this to work with the DPP to spread bad rumors. They said Wang Yi-chuan then started to shout and insult again, and even connected it to him being sanctioned by China, which is an old trick to make people think he supports communism.</p>
            <p>The TPP said that since there are problems with disaster relief and many things are going wrong, this kind of false accusation is just repeating an old trick where the party, prosecutors, and media all work together. They said it's a way to distract people from the real issues.</p>
