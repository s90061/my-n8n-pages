            <h1>Taipei Police and Citizens Work Together to Catch Missing Workers; Two Men Arrested</h1>
            <p>Taipei police recently stopped a suspicious car in Wanhua District. Three men in the back of the car suddenly ran away. Police officers immediately chased them. Two helpful motorcycle riders, Mr. Chen and Mr. Hsu, saw this and helped the police. They crashed their motorcycles and got hurt. In the end, police caught two Vietnamese men who had stayed in Taiwan longer than allowed. One person is still missing, and police are looking for him.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Police Department's Second Brigade said in a press release today that on the morning of August 7th, at 10 AM, officers were on patrol in Heping West Road, Wanhua District. They saw a suspicious car and stopped it to check. But the three men in the back quickly ran away when they saw the police.</p>
            <p>Police immediately stopped the two Vietnamese women in the front of the car. Then, they split up to strongly chase the men. Mr. Chen and Mr. Hsu, who were on motorcycles, kindly joined the chase. They actively helped by giving police rides to follow the men.</p>
            <p>But during the chase in an alley, Mr. Chen and Mr. Hsu's motorcycles accidentally crashed into each other. This caused Mr. Hsu to fall and get hurt. The team leader, Wu Wen-cheng, who was with him, also fell. But he still managed to catch one man, who was a Vietnamese worker who had gone missing.</p>
            <p>After checking, the police stopped five Vietnamese people that day. Two women had legal papers. The two Vietnamese men, who were caught and are in their 30s, had stayed illegally for over 500 days and 60 days respectively. After questioning, they were sent to the National Immigration Agency. One Vietnamese man is still missing, and the police are actively looking for him.</p>
            <p>Also, Mr. Hsu, the helpful citizen who got hurt, was taken to the hospital for treatment. He is not in danger.</p>
            <p>The police department said they especially thank the helpful citizens for being brave and stepping up to help catch the illegal workers. This clearly shows strong cooperation between the police and the public, and it shows good values in society. Police have already sent officers to visit the injured citizens to comfort them and will praise their good actions.</p>

            <h1>AU Optronics Keeps Buying Companies to Escape Panel Industry's Unstable Market</h1>
            <p>AU Optronics (AUO), a company that makes display panels, has bought many companies. Besides buying BHTC, a main supplier for car companies in Germany, AUO has also been very active in Taiwan. After taking control of FSP, a big LED company, AUO also changed the board of directors at Adlink Technology in June this year, taking full control. AUO recently announced that Adlink's money information will be part of AUO's financial reports starting from the second quarter. These big investments have caught the market's attention.</p>
            <p>In the past, when panel makers were quickly making more products, BenQ-AUO Group founder K.Y. Lee led the purchase of another panel company, Quanta Display. But his decision to buy Siemens' mobile phone part failed in the end.</p>
            <p>After K.Y. Lee retired, BenQ Qisda Group, which makes LCDs and has its own brands, was given to Chen Che-hung, the current chairman of Qisda. AUO, the panel company, was given to Paul Peng, the current chairman.</p>
            <p>After Chen Che-hung took over Qisda, he bought many small "hidden champion" companies. Some of these were listed on the stock market and some were not. Chen Che-hung was once the fourth chairman of the Taiwan Mergers & Acquisitions and Private Equity Council. He calls the large group of companies under Qisda, which includes internet communication, healthcare, smart solutions, and low-earth orbit satellites, the "Qisda Fleet."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, AUO, the panel company, used to invest mostly in companies related to panels. This meant it was hard for them to escape the panel industry's problem of "making money for one year but possibly losing money for two years." Their investments could not change this problem.</p>
            <p>The panel industry works best when companies are very big. Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, once helped Innolux, a smaller company he supported, buy a much bigger company called Chi Mei Optoelectronics. Innolux also bought TPO Displays from the Compal Group. At one point, Innolux's production was even bigger than LG Display in Korea, making it the second-largest panel maker in the world. But then, Chinese panel companies kept making more and more products, and many new factories opened. China has now become the biggest supplier of panels in the world.</p>
            <p>Because there are too many LCD panels, Korean companies have been selling their factories and focusing on OLED panels. Taiwanese companies AUO and Innolux have chosen a strategy to change their old production lines. They are investing in new technologies and products. AUO is promoting a new panel technology called MicroLED. Innolux is also working in semiconductor packaging, making FOPLP (Fan-out Panel Level Packaging). At the same time, both AUO and Innolux have sold factories to semiconductor companies to get cash.</p>
            <p>However, to avoid the ups and downs of the panel industry, AUO has started focusing on three main areas: Display Technology, Smart Mobility, and Vertical Solutions. To grow its Smart Mobility business, it bought BHTC, a main supplier of car parts in Germany. To make more MicroLEDs, it took control of FSP. Now, for Vertical Solutions, it is investing in Adlink to develop AI edge computing.</p>
            <p>AUO said in a recent meeting with investors that Smart Mobility and Vertical Solutions together made up 43% of its total sales in the second quarter. They hope this will be more than 50% by 2027. The market is watching to see if AUO's new investments will help these three main areas succeed and truly help the company escape the unpredictable nature of the panel industry.</p>
