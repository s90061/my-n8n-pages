            <h1>Czech Representative in Taiwan: Taiwan and Czech Republic Cooperate to Aid Ukraine, Learning from Ukraine's Mobilization</h1>
            <p>The Czech Republic's representative in Taiwan, David Steinke, said in a recent interview that Taiwan and the Czech Republic are working together to help Ukraine with medical aid, infrastructure, and energy. He also mentioned that Taiwan is learning from Ukraine's war experiences. The amazing way Ukrainians organized themselves during the war and fought against the attackers is an important lesson for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Czech media outlet Seznam Zprávy published an interview with David Steinke on August 31. The title was "Taiwan is learning how to fight. Its representative abroad says they are working with Czechs in Ukraine." The report talked about Taiwan's safety, international relations, economy, and culture. It showed many different parts of Taiwan's current situation and the relationship between Taiwan and the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Talking about the tension between Taiwan and China, Steinke stressed that even with the tension, daily life in Taiwan is still normal. In Taipei, you can hardly feel any tension. However, the government is always improving training for people to be ready for disasters and emergencies. This includes first aid classes, defense education, and evacuation drills. "Sometimes in Taipei, you can see arrows pointing to shelters. This idea is being spread in a planned way, and it has become faster recently."</p>
            <p>Speaking about when China might modernize its military, Steinke pointed out that the year "2027" is often mentioned, but it was not said by China's government. It was an estimate by American experts. 2027 has become a symbol, and even Taiwan talks about it. It is like the Sword of Damocles, meaning a bad thing that could happen at any time. "Personally, I don't think 2027 will be a major turning point. Our office's plans and activities go beyond that year."</p>
            <p>Steinke said that for Taiwan, the United States is the most important international friend. The relationship between the US and Taiwan has been strong for a long time. Both major political parties agree on this, so no matter which party is in power, it will not change how strong the relationship is. "Currently, Taiwan and the United States are discussing tariffs. This discussion is serious and follows rules. But it will not change how broad, deep, and important their relationship is."</p>
            <p>He added that after the United States, Japan is the second most important country for Taiwanese people. This is because Japan is closer in culture, history, and location.</p>
            <p>Steinke said that since Russia fully invaded Ukraine, Taiwan has clearly and strongly supported Ukraine and actively helped with humanitarian aid. Taiwan and the Czech Republic are working together to help Ukraine in areas like medicine, infrastructure, and energy.</p>
            <p>Steinke mentioned that Taiwan is closely watching the situation in Ukraine. There are similarities between them. "If there is one lesson Taiwan has learned from Ukraine, it is the amazing ability of the Ukrainian people to organize themselves. This is what Taiwan wants to achieve. People coming together to resist attackers is a very important lesson for Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Talking about the relationship between Taiwan and the Czech Republic, Steinke said, "We have been building this relationship for 30 years. During these years, both sides have had different governments and priorities. But we have still successfully kept pushing the relationship forward, which is a very important quality. Not every country's relationship has this kind of strength."</p>
            <p>Steinke pointed out that semiconductors are one of the main points of cooperation between the Czech Republic and Taiwan. But it's not just that. They also work on artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum technology, and space. In these areas, the Czech Republic and Taiwan are not competing, and they both have a chance to work together.</p>
            <p>Steinke said, "Taiwan is very good at hardware, and we in the Czech Republic have many talented people in software development. Both sides are very good at different things that complement each other. Czech software has a bright future in our relationship."</p>
            <p>Besides technology, Steinke also talked about the lively cultural exchange. He said Taiwan is a society with rich culture. People love music and literature and often join art activities. Czech culture is very popular in Taiwan. Famous musicians like Antonín Dvořák and Bedřich Smetana, and writers like Milan Kundera, Bohumil Hrabal, and Václav Havel are highly respected.</p>
            <p>Steinke shared that the Czech Republic is trying to promote more modern Czech cultural works. For example, Kateřina Tučková's novel "Žítkovské bohyní" (The Goddesses of Žítková) will soon be published in Chinese. Young Czech artists, designers, and independent musicians are also getting more attention in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Also, the Czech video game "Kingdom Come: Deliverance" has become very popular in Taiwan. It has even helped tourism. Steinke said, "Many Taiwanese tourists visit the Czech Republic because of this game, and they specifically go to Kutná Hora, where the game is set. This game has greatly increased Taiwanese people's interest in the Czech Republic and has brought real economic benefits."</p>
            <p>Steinke said that Taiwanese people are quite wealthy. When they visit the Czech Republic, they often spend a lot, which brings real benefits.</p>

            <h1>Encouraging Jaw Shaw-kong to Run for Chairman? Eric Chu: I Believe Someone Popular Will Lead the Party</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) party chairman election is coming up. KMT Chairman Eric Chu gave a special appointment letter to Jaw Shaw-kong, who used to be the head of Broadcasting Corporation of China. This made many people wonder. Eric Chu said today that supporters care about whether the KMT can win back power in 2028. The KMT's Central Standing Committee has already decided to delay the sign-up time for the chairman election. He asked everyone to be patient, saying he believes a person everyone respects will lead the party in the end.</p>
            <p>Tonight, the KMT held a party to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II and Taiwan's return. KMT Chairman Eric Chu, Vice Chairman Sean Lien, and Secretary-General Justin Huang, along with other high-ranking party members, were there. It's important to note that Katayama Kazuyuki, the representative of the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association, was also invited.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairman election is happening soon. Eric Chu, who has said he will step down, gave appointment letters to Jaw Shaw-kong and Kuan Chung-ming, a former president of National Taiwan University. This made people think he might be encouraging Jaw Shaw-kong and Kuan Chung-ming to run for party chairman.</p>
            <p>Before the event, Eric Chu spoke to reporters. He said he has often publicly stated that he hopes the KMT will be led by someone everyone wants. He hopes everyone will work hard until the very last minute. But he also clearly stated that KMT supporters and the people of Taiwan care most about the KMT being able to win power again in 2028.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said that the KMT must stay united and firm. The KMT needs to follow the right path and work with what most Taiwanese people want. Also, the cooperation between the KMT and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) must not change. This is an important goal for the KMT, and they are still working on it. He specially thanked Jaw Shaw-kong and Kuan Chung-ming for being willing to work hard for the KMT together.</p>
            <p>About the party chairman election, Eric Chu strongly said that since the Central Standing Committee has decided to delay the registration time for the party chairman election, everyone should be a little patient. He believes that in the end, a person that everyone wants will lead the KMT.</p>

            <h1>Flexible Parental Leave: Women's Groups Say 30 Days for Single-Day Leave Is Still Not Enough</h1>
            <p>The government is creating a flexible parental leave system that allows workers to take parental leave for single days. Women's groups said today that they support the change to flexible parental leave. However, they believe that only being able to take 30 single days is still not enough. They also said it is not fair to single parents or parents who are struggling.</p>
            <p>Today, the Executive Yuan approved the "Flexible Parental Leave and Care Plan." This plan makes parental leave and family care leave more flexible. For example, new parents can take parental leave for one day if their child's babysitter suddenly can't work. Also, if a child or elderly family member has an urgent problem, people can take family care leave by the hour. These new rules will start on January 1 next year.</p>
            <p>The Awakening Foundation released a statement today. They said that the Executive Yuan has made changes to flexible parental leave, family care leave, and has also increased housing rental subsidies for married couples and parents. They praised the government for giving workers the right to take leave for one day to care for babies and young children. But they also said there are some things they are not happy about.</p>
            <p>The Awakening Foundation said that one of the new rules allows employers to ask replacement workers to work more overtime hours when someone takes flexible leave for a sudden situation. Even though the Executive Yuan said this is to prevent people from working too much, the government does not have good ways to make sure it happens. So, they cannot promise that employers will not misuse this new rule.</p>
            <p>The foundation said that asking replacement workers to work more overtime will make unfair treatment worse for caregivers at work and will make gender inequality worse. Even if the replacement worker does not work too much, other co-workers might ask, "Why did someone take flexible parental leave, but the replacement worker's overtime hours increased?" This could cause problems at work.</p>
            <p>The foundation also mentioned that since women still take leave more often, this rule will strengthen the idea at work that "most people who take leave are women, so women workers are the reason for problems for those who can work overtime." This will make the old idea stronger that "men are good workers who can work overtime, and women are less important workers." This will reduce the positive effect of the flexible parental leave change, which was meant to make workplaces more equal for men and women and more friendly to caregivers.</p>
            <p>In addition, the foundation said that only allowing 30 days to be taken one day at a time helps normal two-parent families. But it is still not fair enough for single parents who are struggling. If a single parent has no help and needs to take their child for early treatment often, 30 flexible days are definitely not enough. These parents will have to use other types of leave that reduce their pay, which means they lose money. This makes the Executive Yuan's promise of "helping those in need first" disappear.</p>
            <p>The foundation asked the Executive Yuan to remove the rule that allows replacement workers to work more overtime. This would stop unfair treatment of caregivers and gender bias from getting worse at work. They also asked the government to keep checking and improving how flexible parental leave is working. This is to make sure workers find it easy to use and can take the leave. They also said the government should study the problem of not having enough time for care in an aging society and gender equality, and then plan for the next steps of changes.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan Confederation of Trade Unions also released a statement. They said they support the more flexible parental leave policy. However, they believe that both parental leave and family care leave should be paid. They noted that there is a difference in pay between men and women in Taiwan. This often leads to men, who earn more, continuing to work, while women take parental leave. Therefore, they hope the actual percentage of income replaced by parental leave can be higher, and that the number of months for claiming it can be increased, to match actual salary levels.</p>
