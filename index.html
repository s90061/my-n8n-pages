            <h1>Heavy Rains in Northern China: Deaths and Missing People in Hebei and Shanxi, Beijing Reservoir Releases Water</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 27 (CNA) For several days, heavy rains have fallen in cities and provinces in northern China. This has caused a lot of damage. In Fuping County, Hebei Province, by 6 PM yesterday, 2 people had died, 2 were missing, and 46,000 people were affected. In Tianzhen County, Shanxi Province, a bus with 12 people was covered by floodwaters this morning, and all 12 people are now missing. Also, the Miyun Reservoir in Beijing received a record amount of water because of the heavy rain. So, it released water this afternoon.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Chinese media like CCTV News, Fuping County in the western mountains of Hebei Province had very heavy rains for two days, from July 25 to 26. This was the most rain the county has ever seen in one day. From 5 PM on July 25 to 1 AM on July 26, Fuping County had an average of 140.5 millimeters of rain. The Xizhuang weather station even recorded an amazing 532 millimeters of rain. This station also had a county record of 145 millimeters of rain in one hour.</p>
            <p>The Fuping County Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters said today that by 6 PM on July 26, a total of 46,235 people in Fuping County were affected. Among them, 2 people died, and 2 people are missing. Also, 4,655 people from 1,289 households were moved to safe places.</p>
            <p>Besides Fuping County, Yixian County in Hebei Province, which is closer to Beijing, and Zhuozhou City, which had bad floods in 2023, also had heavy rains these days. In Yixian County, by 8 AM on July 25, the amount of rain in one day was more than 440 millimeters. This was a new record and almost as much rain as they usually get in a whole year. This caused serious flooding in the town and nearby areas. The recent heavy rains in Zhuozhou City also caused many places to flood. This made many people remember the floods from 2023.</p>
            <p>In Shanxi, according to the "Shanxi News" WeChat account, at 5:08 AM today, a medium-sized bus with 12 people lost contact near Guqianbao Town in Tianzhen County, Shanxi Province, due to heavy rain. It seems the bus was washed away by the water. All 12 people on the bus are now missing. Local officials are working hard to send rescue teams to search for and help them.</p>
            <p>Reports say that since July 23, heavy rains have caused many rivers in northern and central Shanxi to flood. The rain is still falling, and local officials say that "the flood control and rescue situation is difficult and serious." At 10 AM this morning, the flood emergency response in four cities (Datong, Shuozhou, Xinzhou, and Lvliang) was raised from Level 4 to Level 3. Two other cities, Taiyuan and Yangquan, also started a Level 4 flood emergency response.</p>
            <p>In Beijing, the Miyun Reservoir has received a lot more water upstream because of the recent heavy rains. The water flow reached 6,550 cubic meters per second, which is a new record. To handle the large amount of water coming in, the people managing the reservoir started releasing water at 3 PM today. This is to lower the water level below the highest safe level for flood control. Many Beijing citizens think this is one of the few times the Miyun Reservoir has released water since it was built in 1960.</p>

            <h1>Rakuten Monkeys Used Many Pitchers in Extra Innings; Lin Tzu-Wei Called Up as Long Reliever</h1>
            <p>Taoyuan, July 27 (CNA) The Rakuten Monkeys baseball team in Taiwan's professional league has made some changes to its players. Today, starting pitcher Huang Tzu-Peng moved up to the main team, and pitcher Lin Tzu-Wei also returned to the main team. Head coach Koichi Koga said that yesterday's extra-inning game used many pitchers. So, Lin Tzu-Wei will be a long relief pitcher for now.</p>
            <p>The Monkeys played against the TSG Hawks again today at their home field, Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. Taiwanese pitcher Huang Tzu-Peng started the game. Huang Tzu-Peng was sent to the minor league on July 13. At that time, coach Koichi Koga said he could not share many details about what Huang Tzu-Peng needed to work on, but generally, it was about his control when pitching.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Monkeys lost to the Hawks after a tough game that went to 10 extra innings. Today, pitcher Lin Tzu-Wei was also moved up to the main team. Koichi Koga said that the pitchers used many throws yesterday. So, Lin Tzu-Wei is back on the main team today and will mostly work as a long relief pitcher.</p>

            <h1>Cheng Hao-chun Pitches Into 6th Inning for First Time This Season, Did Not Want to Leave the Game</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 27 (CNA) Cheng Hao-chun, a pitcher for the CTBC Brothers in Taiwan's professional baseball league, pitched 5.1 innings yesterday without giving up any runs. This was the first time this season he pitched into the 6th inning. For a moment, he did not want to leave the game and joked with pitching coach Wang Chien-Ming about it. Today, Cheng Hao-chun laughed and said he really wanted to finish the whole game, but for now, he will follow the team's plan.</p>
            <p>Cheng Hao-chun had Tommy John surgery on his elbow at the end of 2023. He returned from his injury in early June this year. In his first five starts, he pitched 5 innings. Yesterday, in the game against the Uni-President Lions, he pitched into the 6th inning for the first time. He threw 78 pitches in total for 5.1 innings and did not allow any runs.</p>
            <p>However, after Cheng Hao-chun threw two walks in the bottom of the 6th inning, he did not want to leave the game. CTBC Brothers pitching coach Wang Chien-Ming said today that Cheng Hao-chun's current limit for pitches is 85. "Of course, he doesn't want to come off the mound. Yesterday was his first time trying to pitch into the 6th inning. In the 6th inning, his control was not as good as in the earlier innings. He will slowly get better after this."</p>
            <p>Cheng Hao-chun laughed and said, "I really wanted to finish the whole game." Cheng Hao-chun said that after pitching 5 innings, he told Wang Chien-Ming he wanted to keep pitching. About the situation in the 6th inning, he said, "At that time, I wanted to tell him (Wang Chien-Ming) to go back, but he was already on the mound, and it was too late. I was originally thinking of getting a double play to end it."</p>
            <p>Cheng Hao-chun mentioned that yesterday was the first time he pitched into the 6th inning in two years. "Also, we batted first, so I had more rest on the side. My body is still getting used to it," he said. When asked about his current limit of 85 pitches per game, Cheng Hao-chun said, "Right now, I don't want to change much. The plan was clear from the start, and we are still talking about it. Before my next start, we will see how my body feels, and then make plans."</p>
            <p>Cheng Hao-chun also said that his body's recovery was not going as smoothly a while ago. "Maybe I added too many training exercises. But my performance and condition in these last few games have been good."</p>
