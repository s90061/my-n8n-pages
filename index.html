            <h1>Trump May Visit Japan in Late October; US Says He Really Wants To</h1>
            <p>Today, the Nikkei newspaper reported that officials from Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US and Japanese governments are planning for US President Trump to visit Japan at the end of October. This visit might happen before the APEC summit in South Korea.</p>
            <p>South Korea will hold the APEC summit in Gyeongju from October 31st to November 1st.</p>
            <p>If Trump visits Japan, he might meet the person who will become Japan's new Prime Minister. The current leader of Japan's ruling party, Shigeru Ishiba, has said he will step down. After the party's election on October 4th, Japan's parliament will choose the new Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>In February this year, when Shigeru Ishiba visited the US, he invited Donald Trump to visit Japan. If this trip happens, it will be Trump's first visit to Japan since his second term started.</p>
            <p>On October 24th, Mignon Houston, a deputy spokesperson for the US Department of State, told Nikkei that "Trump really wants to visit Japan, and this shows the long-standing friendship between the US and Japan."</p>
            <p>She also said, "This also shows that our relationship and plans with Japan in the Indo-Pacific region are very important."</p>
            <p>When asked if Trump would visit Japan before the APEC summit, Houston only said, "We don't guess... whether he visits or not, Japan is important for safety, stability, and growth in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>
            <p>Trump might have a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea during the APEC event. This would be his first meeting with Xi since his second term began. The Nikkei newspaper said that if Trump visits Japan before the APEC summit, Japan could talk about its China policy with the US first.</p>
            <p>Also, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in late July that Trump will go to the ASEAN leaders' meeting in Kuala Lumpur in late October. Malaysia is currently the leader of ASEAN.</p>
