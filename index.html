            <h1>Tainan Works to Stop Dengue Fever After Rain; School Cleaning Drills Reach Local Areas</h1>
            <p>The Education Bureau in Tainan City and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Control have worked together. For two days, they held training and cleaning exercises in schools. The goal is to make schools better at stopping dengue fever. They also want to spread this knowledge to homes and neighborhoods.</p>
            <p>Zheng Xin-hui, the head of Tainan City's Education Bureau, said today that yesterday and today, they held "2025 School Mosquito and Insect Control Program Training and School Cleaning Exercises." These events took place at Xintai Elementary School in Xinying District and Xinxing Junior High School in South District. Experts and teachers shared ideas for lessons. Students also learned about dengue fever prevention. This helps to build a complete network for preventing the disease.</p>
            <p>Zheng Xin-hui also said that the Education Bureau helps schools start mosquito prevention clubs. Through these clubs and lessons, students can learn by watching and doing. This teaches them the right ways to prevent sickness. A clean and healthy school environment helps stop dengue fever and other diseases carried by mosquitoes.</p>
            <p>He added that the Education Bureau is working with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Control again. They hope that by training teachers, good ideas about preventing sickness will reach students, families, and local areas.</p>
            <p>Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che stated in a press release that Typhoon Danas and strong winds brought heavy rain to Tainan. Schools are working hard to clean up and fix things after the storm. They are also making maps of areas in schools where disease might spread easily. This helps them check risky areas more often. They are also working with the Environmental Protection Bureau and local district offices to clean and disinfect school areas.</p>

            <h1>Minister Peng Chi-ming Hopes Local Governments Spend More on Environment</h1>
            <p>Peng Chi-ming, the Minister of Environment, said today that after a new law about money for local governments is passed, the central government will have less money. He hopes that local leaders will give more care to the environment when they plan their budgets, like a mother caring for her child. This follows a discussion yesterday between Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen and Premier Cho Jung-tai about the new law.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Premier Cho Jung-tai led a meeting. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen was there and talked about the central government's big budget, the new money law, and special money for projects. The Premier's office said that Premier Cho reminded Mayor Lu to stick to the topic and solve problems. But Mayor Lu kept changing the subject. So, Premier Cho stopped her by saying she should not just try to get attention.</p>
            <p>This morning, Minister Peng Chi-ming was on a TV show. He said he was at yesterday's meeting. Mayor Lu talked for about 10 minutes. He said the atmosphere was like "a mother scolding her son, very strong and tough." Premier Cho also reminded Mayor Lu that they were talking about adding more money to the budget, and a lot of that money would go to local areas.</p>
            <p>Minister Peng also mentioned that later, during a special discussion, Taipei and New Taipei also talked about these same issues. Premier Cho repeated that the central government and local governments need to have more meetings to decide how to handle these things.</p>
            <p>Minister Peng said that the Ministry of Environment planned to give local governments about 400 billion New Taiwan dollars. But after the new money law changes, the amount given to local areas might be less. For example, the central government usually helps many cities and counties pay for garbage trucks. But with the new rules about money, local areas will have more money than the central government. So, the central government will not have money to give to local areas.</p>
            <p>Minister Peng thinks that who is responsible for what money also needs to be very clear. But he said it's hard to divide it perfectly right now.</p>
            <p>At noon today, Minister Peng spoke at a press conference about the UN Plastic Treaty meeting. He added that the central government's budget will be much smaller after the new money law is passed. He wants to ask local environmental protection offices to consider this. He said that cleaning up trash is a local job, but often the central government helps pay for it. He hopes that in the future, local leaders will be more supportive, like a "mother's loving gaze," and plan to give more money to protect the environment.</p>

            <h1>Trump Invites Putin to Former Cold War Base for Talks</h1>
            <p>(Anchorage, Alaska, August 14, AFP) US President Donald Trump is changing history. He has asked Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet tomorrow in Alaska. Alaska used to be part of Russia. What is more, the meeting will happen at a military base that once watched the Soviet Union.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that the meeting place is very interesting. This is because Vladimir Putin is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Tomorrow will be the first time he can go to a Western country since Russia sent soldiers into Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
            <p>Trump and Putin will meet at Elmendorf Air Force Base. The base's motto is "Top Cover for North America," which means it protects the sky above North America.</p>
            <p>Trump once said that Putin suggested this meeting. It is not clear if Trump thought about what the base or Alaska means for the meeting. Some Russian nationalists still wish Alaska was part of Russia.</p>
            <p>However, George Beebe, a former expert on Russia at the CIA, said that choosing Alaska shows that the two big countries have things in common. It shows their connection through history and the Pacific Ocean, not their competition or the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Beebe now works for a group called the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, which supports careful military actions. Beebe said that Trump wants to show "this is not the Cold War." He added, "We will not repeat many meetings in neutral countries like during the Cold War."</p>
            <p>He said, "We are starting a new time. This is not just for the relationship between the US and Russia, but also for how this relationship affects the world."</p>
            <p>In the 1700s, Russia made Alaska a colony. But it was hard to make money from the colony. Also, the Crimean War made Russia very weak. So, in 1867, Tsar Alexander II sold Alaska to the United States.</p>
            <p>At that time, many people made fun of William Seward, the US Secretary of State, for this deal. Some even called it "Seward's Folly," thinking Alaska was not worth much. But later, it became clear that this land was very important for military plans.</p>
            <p>In 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and took some islands in the Aleutian Islands. After this, the US quickly built Elmendorf Air Force Base. During the Cold War, this base was a very important place to watch what the Soviet Union was doing in the Bering Strait.</p>
            <p>Just nine months ago, an electronic spy plane and other US military planes from Elmendorf quickly took off. They followed Russian planes flying near Alaska's coast.</p>
