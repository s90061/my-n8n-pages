            <h1>Artist Lee Mingwei's Solo Exhibition in Sweden Invites People to Weave Together Shared Memories</h1>
            <p>The artist Lee Mingwei's special art show, "Best Regards, Lee Mingwei," started on September 26th. It was part of the "MalmÃ¶ Gallery Weekend" at the Moderna Museet MalmÃ¶ in Sweden. People in the city celebrated by joining in and experiencing art that uses "invitation" as a way for everyone to create shared memories together.</p>
            <p>Lee Mingwei was born in Taiwan. He has a master's degree in art from Yale University. Now, he lives in Paris, New York, and Taipei. His art talks about trust, being close to others, and understanding yourself. His works have been shown in famous museums around the world. These include the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo, the Taipei Fine Arts Museum, the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the de Young Museum in San Francisco, the Tate Modern in London, the Gropius Bau in Berlin, and the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney.</p>
            <p>This time, the Moderna Museet MalmÃ¶ in Sweden invited Lee Mingwei to show his art. His solo exhibition, "Best Regards, Lee Mingwei," opened during the "MalmÃ¶ Gallery Weekend." It will be open until January 11, 2026.</p>
            <p>Also, Lee Mingwei's exhibition is in the museum's big Turbine Hall. The museum planned opening events, guided tours by the curator, and workshops for families. This allowed people to join in and experience the art that uses "invitation" during the city's festival.</p>
            <p>Elisabeth Millqvist, who is a branch director and curator, planned this exhibition. It focuses on three of Lee Mingwei's well-known interactive artworks. These are "The Letter Writing Project" (started in 1998), "Fabric of Memory" (started in 2006), and "The Mending Project" (started in 2009). The exhibition will also show video documentaries of his other works: "The Gift of Unknowing" (2017), "The Sound of Flowers" (2013), and "Guernica in Sand" (2006).</p>
            <p>The curator said that the artworks will grow and change throughout the exhibition. This will happen as people from the city join in. Through public calls for entries and volunteers, people from MalmÃ¶ and visitors are invited to help write this "collective book."</p>
            <p>For many years, Lee Mingwei has started his artworks with an "invitation." He changes everyday actions into special ceremonies. Through writing, mending, talking, and giving, strangers meet each other in open situations. The artworks change and develop over time with the people who join in. This turns the exhibition space into a place for talking and thinking deeply. This way of making art, based on "giving and responding," is often called a "gentle and strong" way of looking at relationships.</p>
            <p>The three interactive artworks in this exhibition are: "The Letter Writing Project." It uses three transparent "letter kiosks" to create a quiet space. It asks visitors to write thank-you notes, apologies, or goodbyes that they never said. Or they can read letters left open by others, which helps them feel at peace.</p>
            <p>"Fabric of Memory" collects fabrics or clothes from Sweden that hold family and personal memories. These come with stories written by the people who donated them. Visitors can open a box in the exhibition, read the story, and then close it again. This creates a shared memory for the city.</p>
            <p>"The Mending Project" uses mending, colored threads, and talking. It asks visitors to bring clothes that need to be fixed. They sit across from a mender and talk about their life experiences while the clothes are being sewn.</p>
            <p>The artist starts with his own experiences. He uses "relationships and time" as his materials. Visitors join in to weave a network. The art keeps changing and moving in different situations and at different times.</p>

            <h1>Old Photos: Huang Chun-pi, a Great Master of Painting</h1>
            <p>Huang Chun-pi was a very famous ink wash painter around the world. People often called him one of the "Three Masters Who Came to Taiwan from Mainland China," along with Zhang Daqian and Pu Hsin-yu. He also taught at the Taiwan Provincial Teachers' College (later National Taiwan Normal University) as the head of the art department for over 20 years. He helped a lot with art education and was called a great teacher of painting.</p>
            <p>Even though he was famous for Chinese painting, Huang Chun-pi first studied Western painting. He only became interested in Chinese painting after he met a man who owned a picture framing shop. When he was 24, Huang Chun-pi won the best prize for Chinese painting at the first art exhibition in Guangdong Province. He combined Western and Chinese painting styles. This gave his ink wash paintings special light and color.</p>
            <p>Huang Chun-pi was most famous for painting clouds and waterfalls. This was because he loved to travel and see nature. He taught at Central University in Chongqing for many years, which had moved there. He lived by the Jialing River for a long time. He also visited Mount Emei many times. In nature, he learned the true spirit of mountains and rivers.</p>
            <p>In 1949, Huang Chun-pi came to Taiwan. He worked as a professor and head of the art department at the Taiwan Provincial Teachers' College. During this time, he also painted scenes from places like Alishan and Taroko Gorge. In 1969, he went to South Africa for an exhibition and visited Victoria Falls. On his way back, he went to Brazil to see Zhang Daqian. He also traveled to Iguazu Falls and Niagara Falls in America. These three famous waterfalls in the world gave him ideas for many of his well-known waterfall paintings.</p>
            <p>On September 28, 1991, the National Museum of History held a special exhibition for Huang Chun-pi's 95th birthday. This was his last art show. During the exhibition, he passed away from pneumonia at the age of 94.</p>

            <p>LG Electronics from South Korea wants to sell shares of its company in India, LG Electronics India, for the first time on the stock market. This is called an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The company could be valued at up to 774 billion Indian Rupees, which is about 263.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This could be one of the biggest IPOs in India this year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that documents released today show the price range for LG Electronics India shares. Each share will cost between 1080 and 1140 Indian Rupees. People can start buying shares for three days from October 7th. Big, important investors can buy shares one day earlier.</p>
            <p>If the shares are sold at the highest price, this IPO could help LG Electronics raise up to 116 billion Indian Rupees. LG Electronics India will not create new shares for this IPO.</p>
            <p>LG Electronics applied for the IPO for its Indian company last December. It was planned to start in May this year. But because the stock market was not stable, the company decided to delay it.</p>
