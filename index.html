            <h1>Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che Visits Brisbane City Hall in Australia, Starts Cooperation</h1>
            <p>Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che recently visited Brisbane City Hall in Queensland, Australia. He met with Brisbane City Council President Sandy Landers and others. They talked about how to manage a city, exchange students, and sports activities. This visit will start a new friendship and cooperation between the two cities.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Government said today that Mayor Huang visited Brisbane City Hall on September 5th. Sandy Landers, the President of the Brisbane City Council, and Steven Huang, the Vice President, welcomed him. This was Mayor Huang's first time visiting Australia.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang said that people in Taiwan like Australian red wine and beef. Tainan is a main place for farming and fishing in Taiwan, making a lot of mangoes, pineapples, and milkfish. He said Tainan City will go to the "2025 Sydney Food Show." He hopes to share Tainan's good farm and fish products and find more buyers in Australia.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang explained that Tainan is Taiwan's first city, with a long history and culture. It also has many high-tech companies. TSMC's factory in Tainan helps build the semiconductor industry. He hopes Tainan City and Brisbane can work together in new technology, student exchange, and sports events in the future.</p>
            <p>Sandy Landers welcomed Mayor Huang to Brisbane, which is called the "City of Sunshine." She said Brisbane is one of Australia's best cities to live in. It is currently the "Brisbane Festival," and she hoped the visitors would have a good time. Steven Huang also said he hopes the two cities can work more on monitoring for disasters in the future.</p>
            <p>The city government said that Brisbane is the capital of Queensland, Australia. It has about 2.6 million people and is Australia's third-largest city after Sydney and Melbourne. Brisbane Port is an important way for Australia to trade with other countries, especially in Asia. Recently, Brisbane has been working on smart city plans and new industries, such as information technology, medicine, new energy, and environmental technology.</p>

            <h1>National Central University Study: More Ecological Footprint, Less Cybersecurity Risk</h1>
            <p>A team from National Central University has found something interesting: when a company's ecological footprint is bigger, its cybersecurity risks are actually lower. This shows that being good for the environment and being safe online can help each other. The results of this study have been published in a global science paper.</p>
            <p>National Central University shared in a press release today that Professor Wang Chih-wei's team from the Department of Finance studied companies listed in the US between 2007 and 2018. They looked at the "risk factors" in company yearly reports to find out how big their cybersecurity risks were. First, the team found which companies had been attacked by hackers. Then, they compared the words in other companies' reports to see if they described similar high risks.</p>
            <p>The study found a clear link: a higher ecological footprint means lower cybersecurity risk. There are two main reasons for this: "innovation investment" and "cash on hand." Companies with a larger ecological footprint often have to follow stricter environmental rules. This makes them put more money into new green technologies and digital tools, which also makes their cybersecurity stronger. These companies also tend to keep more cash. They do this to be ready for new rules or unexpected changes, and this extra money helps them invest in better cybersecurity protection.</p>
            <p>The research team believes that if companies want to stop harming the environment, they must also deal with online safety problems. They should not try to fix only one problem at a time. The team suggests that companies should mix their plans for the environment with their plans for digital safety. Working together across different parts of the company can make it stronger overall. Governments can also give rewards to companies that care about both the environment and cybersecurity. This way, everyone can work towards two goals: making the country sustainable and making its online systems safe.</p>
            <p>The study was published in an international journal called "Energy Economics."</p>

            <h1>Ally Shot Dead, Trump Calls It "A Dark Time for America"</h1>
            <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump shared his deep sadness and anger today. This was after Charlie Kirk, a young leader from the right-wing group, was shot and killed. It happened while Kirk was giving a speech at a university campus in Utah. Trump called this event "a dark time for America."</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump spoke in a 4-minute video from the Oval Office in the White House. He said, "I am both sad and angry about the terrible killing of Kirk at a university campus in Utah. Kirk inspired millions of people, and everyone who knew and loved him is shocked and hurting tonight."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "This is a dark time for America." He explained that Kirk traveled all over the country to have "kind discussions."</p>
            <p>Trump said Kirk "died for truth and freedom" and sent his prayers and sympathy to Kirk's family.</p>
            <p>The President also mentioned other well-known shootings. He strongly criticized "extreme and political violence." These events included an attempt to kill him in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July, the shooting of a healthcare leader in New York last December, and a large shooting at a baseball practice for Congress members in 2017, where Steve Scalise, a Republican leader, was hurt.</p>
            <p>He said that people in America and the news media must "understand that making people who think differently seem like bad people will only lead to sad violence and killings."</p>
            <p>Trump promised to keep taking action. He also said he would share a more complete plan to stop political violence.</p>
            <p>He stated, "My government team will find everyone who was part of this terrible act and other political violence. This includes groups that give money and support to these actions, and also those who target our judges, police officers, and everyone who keeps order in our country."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Kirk was shot and died during an event at Utah Valley University. He had helped increase support for Trump among young voters.</p>
            <p>The person who did the shooting has not been caught yet.</p>
            <p>Videos from the scene showed Kirk speaking to a large crowd. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and he quickly fell into his chair. The camera quickly moved away, and the people at the event were very scared. Investigators said they believe a single bullet came from a person dressed in black on the roof of the campus building. They think it was a planned killing.</p>
