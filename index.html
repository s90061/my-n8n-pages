A 21-year-old man, Zhou Zijun, went to a dental clinic in Taipei last month. He violently attacked a female dentist, Dr. Shen, claiming his teeth cleaning was too painful. Police found out that the attack was connected to a 15 million New Taiwan Dollar debt. Chen Zhongyi, who runs a company, asked Xia Weilong, a key member of the Zhulian Gang Jingan group, to handle the debt.

Police arrested six people. The court decided that Xia Weilong and his associate Zhou Wenhan should be held in custody because they might do the same thing again. So far, three people, including Zhou Zijun, are in custody.

Xia Weilong said he was asked to help with the debt, but he denied threatening the dentist or telling Zhou Zijun to hit her. He claimed he didn't know why the dentist was attacked.

Dr. Shen said she lent Chen Zhongyi 15 million New Taiwan Dollars. When he didn't pay it back, she sued him and won. However, Chen Zhongyi then sent gang members to "negotiate" the debt. They wanted the mortgage papers back first, which Dr. Shen felt was a trick to avoid paying.

Police found that Xia Weilong, Yan Daozhi, and Zhou Wenhan had gone to Dr. Shen's clinic before. They used their gang's name to scare her. When negotiations failed, they reportedly told Zhou Zijun to pretend to get his teeth cleaned and then attack Dr. Shen.

On the day of the attack, the air conditioning at the clinic was broken, so Dr. Shen had no appointments. However, Zhou Zijun still forced his way in for a check-up. He tried to move to a different chair because there was a camera in front of the one he was in. Luckily, Dr. Shen insisted he stay, and the camera recorded the whole violent event. Dr. Shen was seriously hurt, and Zhou Zijun was already taken into custody. Now, Xia Weilong and Zhou Wenhan are also in custody.

**May 2025 Was Second Hottest on Record, This Year Likely Among Top 5 Hottest**

The Central Weather Administration announced today that May 2025 was the second hottest May ever recorded. This information comes from new reports by the European Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The global average temperature in May was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than before the industrial revolution. The NCEI also said that 2025 is very likely to be one of the five hottest years on record.

In May, many places around the world experienced very high temperatures. For example, the United Arab Emirates had its hottest May day ever on May 24, reaching 51.6 degrees Celsius. Iceland had its worst May heatwave ever, with over 90% of weather stations reporting new high temperatures for May. France also had a severe heatwave in May, with the national high-temperature reaching 30.5 degrees Celsius on May 30. This was the hottest May on record for France, and only the second time since 1947 that May temperatures went over 30 degrees.

The Central Weather Administration also noted that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean has been very low since the beginning of the year. Although it improved slightly in April, May still saw the lowest amount of sea ice in the last five years. The ice is melting faster than average. The situation for sea ice in the Antarctic is also serious, with some areas having almost no ice at all.

The Weather Administration also mentioned that the world's oceans are experiencing "ocean heatwaves," with unusually high temperatures. This is greatly affecting ocean life and the environment and economy of coastal areas. It could also make climate change worse.

The Central Weather Administration stated that global warming continues to impact many regions. The global average temperature from January to May 2025 was the second highest ever recorded. The NCEI also believes there is a more than 99% chance that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years in history.

**Guangzhou Jinan University Removed from Taiwan's List of Recognized Chinese Universities After 10 Years**

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from the list. The updated list now includes 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges.

Earlier this year, Minister of Education Cheng Ying-Yao said that universities managed by China's United Front Work Department have special political goals, not just academic ones. He stated that Taiwan should stop working with these schools and will no longer recognize their degrees.

The Ministry of Education explained that Guangzhou Jinan University has been under the control of China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment without specific political aims, the university was removed from the recognized list.

The Ministry of Education also said that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair, respectful, and mutually beneficial. Schools in Taiwan that plan exchange activities with China should follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of the activity, the organizers, the schedule, and any promotional materials. Activities should not have political goals or content. Schools should also avoid accepting one-sided invitations or helping China with its political plans.

The Ministry of Education also advised schools to ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education if they are unsure about any activity's organizers or plans. Taiwan still hopes to encourage young people from both sides to learn together and understand each other better. However, they should be aware of possible risks and check the background of the organizers to ensure there are no political aims.
