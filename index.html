An Egyptian man, 70, named Hamed Ramadan Bayoumy Aly Marie, was unhappy when a customs dog named Freddie found forbidden items like beef in his suitcase. He kicked the 11-kilogram dog, hurting its ribs. Video showed Freddie flying into the air, clearly hit hard. Mr. Marie had to pay for the dog's medical care and was sent back to Egypt.

This happened on June 24, around 6:30 AM, at Dulles International Airport in Washington D.C. Freddie, a 5-year-old Beagle, was working in the baggage area when he found something unusual in Mr. Marie's suitcase. When a customs officer started asking Mr. Marie questions, he kicked Freddie. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said the kick was strong enough to throw the 11.34 kg Beagle into the air.

Freddie was taken to an animal hospital and had a bruise on his right rib. Mr. Marie's suitcase had over 45 kg of beef, rice, eggplant, cucumbers, bell peppers, and corn seeds. These items are not allowed into the U.S. because they can carry diseases that harm American plants and animals. Mr. Marie said he was guilty of hurting an animal that helps the police. He was told to pay 840 US dollars for Freddie's medical costs and was sent back to Egypt the next day. CBP said that attacking their dogs is an attack on all of them, as these dogs are very important for their work.

**French Media: China's Military Still Weaker Than US, Corruption Hurts It**

A French magazine, "Le Point," wrote an article comparing the military strengths of the US and China. It said that even though China's army has made some good technical progress and promotes itself a lot online, its military power is still much less than the US. Also, problems like corruption and removing people from their positions in the army are making it weaker. Experts warn Taiwan not to become too confident because of this.

"Le Point" recently released a special report on the current state of military forces around the world. One part of it looked closely at the real difference in military power between the US and China. China often shows off its military on social media, like its new "J-50" stealth fighter jet. The article said China's military budget has grown almost 10 times in 20 years, and it will be about 220 billion Euros (about 7.5 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) by 2025. China's leader, Xi Jinping, said in 2017 that by 2049, China's army would be "world-class" and change the balance of power with Washington. But people are still not sure if this will happen.

Marc Julienne, an expert from a French research center, said, "China is still far behind the US. Of course, it is growing fast in some areas. But can it make a big technical jump that would stop the US from being its enemy? Not yet." The magazine said the difference between the US and China's military is huge, like the story of the "bull and the frog." Even though China's technology is impressive, it's still not as strong as the US military's whole system and power. An expert in Taiwan, Mathieu Duchatel, said China's success in missile and shipbuilding industries shows its military modernization started by Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s. China's navy now has more ships than the US navy. But another expert, Benjamin Blandin, warned that many of these are smaller coastal boats, and the US still has much bigger ships in total. He also said that many of China's ships are getting old and will need to be replaced soon, which might be hard as China's population is getting smaller.

If China wanted to attack Taiwan, it wouldn't need to fight the US army globally, only near its own coast. China is preparing equipment for landing, like changing ferries and cargo ships for military use. Taiwan has about 15 beaches that could be attacked. China's "mobile ports" could double the number of landing spots, but they would also be easy targets. Another expert, Ou Hsi-fu, said China's sea invasions still have weak points, like few ways to move on land and crowded armored vehicles. Instead of a full invasion, China might try to make Taiwan give up by blocking it, hacking its computer systems, bombing, and sending airborne troops. This would stop the US and its friends from helping Taiwan. China has many missiles for this, like long-range missiles and hypersonic vehicles.

Mr. Duchatel said China wants its threats to be so strong that no one would dare to get involved. This is important for its plans for Taiwan. To do this, China needs to change the balance of power with the US and clearly wants to change its nuclear weapons power. The article also said that China's air force is a weak point. Chinese drones have often crashed in other countries. The US, however, started a $1 billion plan in 2023 to make thousands of drones for air, sea, and land, to work with its F-35 fighter jets. Also, the US has 11 aircraft carriers compared to China's two old Soviet ones, giving the US a stronger position. Even though China has reduced the gap, it is still behind the US in things like fighter jet launchers and the number of nuclear attack submarines.

One advantage for China is fighting close to home, where its navy has more ships in Chinese waters and the Taiwan Strait. But if there's a submarine battle, the US could cut off supplies to Chinese aircraft carriers east of Taiwan. Finally, the report said that corruption and removing high-ranking officers in China's military are causing problems. In the last two years, two defense ministers have been removed for corruption, and the current defense minister is also said to be in trouble. Mr. Ou Hsi-fu said that these actions of removing high-level military officers are "affecting their efficiency and readiness for war." But he also stressed that even with these problems, China's army is still very large. The US can use these weaknesses, but Taiwan cannot be too confident when facing such a strong enemy.

**Six Chinese and Two Taiwanese Accused of Helping North Korea's Weapons Programs**

The U.S. Department of Justice announced today that six Chinese people, two Taiwanese people, and one American citizen have been charged. They are accused of helping North Korean IT workers get remote jobs at over a hundred American companies. This earned at least $5 million (about 140 million New Taiwan Dollars) for North Korea, which was used to fund their weapons programs. These nine people have been formally accused.

The United Nations has placed sanctions on North Korea to stop it from developing missiles and nuclear weapons. The U.S. Department of Justice stated in court papers that North Korea sends thousands of skilled IT workers around the world. These workers pretend to be Americans and get remote IT jobs at U.S. companies. They then use the money earned to fund North Korea's weapons programs.

The Justice Department said that in Boston, Massachusetts, nine people, including Liu Meng-ting and Liu En from Taiwan, have been charged. Financial accounts, websites, and laptops used for the scam have been taken. The companies affected include some of the "Fortune 500" biggest companies and a defense company in California. These companies thought their employees were working in the U.S., but most of them were in North Korea or China. Their salaries were sent to accounts linked to North Korea.

John Eisenberg, who leads the national security section at the Justice Department, said in a statement that these plans aimed to steal money from American companies. This was done to get around sanctions and pay for North Korea's illegal activities, like their weapons programs. The people charged are accused of setting up bank accounts to receive money and creating fake websites for fake companies. This made people think the workers were from real businesses. They also got help from unnamed people inside the U.S. to connect to computer systems remotely. This made the companies think the workers were logging in from inside the U.S.

Court documents show that in October 2024, law enforcement searched seven places in New York, New Jersey, and California. They visited places called "laptop farms," where laptops from American companies were kept for the scam. They found over 70 devices belonging to the affected companies. Also, law enforcement closed 21 fake website addresses used to help the North Korean IT workers and froze 29 bank accounts. These accounts had tens of thousands of dollars that were being used to transfer money for the North Korean government through remote IT work. Today, Georgia also announced a similar case. Four North Korean citizens are accused of using fake identities to work at a blockchain company in Atlanta. They stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in digital money and sent it overseas. The Justice Department said that the way the Georgia case was done is different from how North Korean IT workers usually operate. The latter usually get jobs to send their salaries back to North Korea. In the Georgia case, the accused people worked at virtual currency companies to gain trust and then stole digital assets.
