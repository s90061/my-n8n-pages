Time magazine announced its 2025 list of the 100 most influential companies globally on June 26, with TSMC making the cut as the only wafer foundry firm. AI chip giant Nvidia was not selected.

The list is divided into five categories: Innovators, Disruptors, Leaders, Titans, and Pioneers. TSMC is listed under the Titans category. Time magazine noted that TSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturer, producing the "brains" for devices like smartphones and data centers. Thanks to the continuous surge in demand for advanced AI chips produced by TSMC, the company's first-quarter 2025 financial results exceeded analysts' expectations.

These chips have drawn TSMC into the trade war between the United States and China. Facing pressure from the White House, TSMC pledged in March to invest US$100 billion in US chip manufacturing facilities, bringing its total US investment to US$165 billion. Overall, TSMC plans to build nine factories in countries such as Germany and Japan in 2025.

TSMC's foundry competitors, South Korea's Samsung and US-based Intel, did not make the list, nor did Nvidia. Other AI and semiconductor companies listed include Alibaba, ASML, ByteDance, DeepSeek, Huawei, Meta, OpenAI, and Scale AI.

Notably, China's Pop Mart, known for its globally popular "Labubu" dolls, also made the list of the 100 most influential companies. Time magazine stated that Pop Mart currently has 530 themed stores worldwide, and its revenue and profit in 2024 more than doubled compared to 2023.

**Han Kuo-yu Criticizes Malicious Recalls as Political Struggle, Says "A Successful Major Recall Will Leave Taiwan's Democracy Empty"**

The "major recall" campaign has entered a fierce stage. Taoyuan legislator Wan Mei-ling held an anti-recall briefing session tonight, with Mayor Chang San-cheng, legislator Hsieh Lung-chieh, and Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu attending in succession. They emphasized that Wan has been working in the central government to secure development and welfare for Taoyuan and assist in promoting beneficial bills, yet she is being subjected to a malicious recall. They called this a political struggle, stating that "if the major recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be empty." They urged the public to vote "against" on July 26.

Han Kuo-yu jokingly said that today, the grandmasters of Wudang and Shaolin had come to support Wan Mei-ling, "Grandmaster Wudang is Chang San-cheng, and Grandmaster Shaolin is me," drawing continuous laughter from hundreds of supporters in the audience.

Han Kuo-yu stated that they just finished elections last year, and it feels like elections are starting again now, which is not democratic politics but a political struggle and is unreasonable. He praised Wan Mei-ling's constituent services, noting that everyone commends her. As a five-term city councilor and two-term legislator, despite her busy schedule with constant meetings, Wan Mei-ling's attendance rate is 100%, having secured over NT$55 billion in development funds for the locality. "She works so hard, and now there's a recall. Does it mean the more excellent you are, the more you get recalled? This goes against democracy."

Han Kuo-yu also said that sitting as the Legislative Yuan President, he knows which legislators are serious in their interpellations. He felt sad hearing the Democratic Progressive Party constantly shout "major recall, major success." He said if Taiwan's democracy is a wall that Taiwan has painstakingly built, now with the recall pushing, the wall is about to be destroyed.

Han Kuo-yu declared, "If the major recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be empty." Taiwan will no longer be able to boast about the preciousness of its democracy to the outside world. He urged everyone to vote, stating that not voting is equivalent to not supporting Wan Mei-ling.

**Medical Associations Object to Increased Medical Student Quotas; Ministry of Education: Within Total Control**

Eleven medical associations released a joint statement today expressing dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Education's plan to increase medical student quotas from the current 1,300 to nearly 1,600, warning of potential negative impacts on the healthcare system and teaching quality. The Ministry of Education clarified this evening that the adjustment of medical school admission quotas for three national universities for the 2026 academic year was made in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and does not exceed the Ministry of Education's established total quota of 1,300, meaning the number of general medical students for the 2026 academic year will still be within 1,300.

The 11 medical associations stated in their joint declaration today that the Ministry of Education's decision in June to loosen medical student admission numbers, unilaterally increasing the quotas for post-baccalaureate medical programs at Tsing Hua, NCKU, and National Sun Yat-sen Universities, has caused a backlash among frontline doctors. They strongly oppose expanding the number from 1,300 to nearly 1,600, cautioning that this move could significantly affect the overall healthcare service system and medical education quality.

However, the Ministry of Education responded tonight that since 1998, it has collaborated with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's physician workforce planning, allocating 1,300 spots annually within its authority to 11 university medical departments. The three universitiesâ€”Tsing Hua, NCKU, and National Sun Yat-senâ€”established their post-baccalaureate medical programs in line with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Physician Training Program for Key Specialties with Public Funding," offering public-funded positions. Following a review meeting in 2021, it was decided that after the public-funded program concludes, adjustments to medical student quotas could be made within the total quota, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's consent for public-funded student admissions.

The Ministry of Education further explained that as the Ministry of Health and Welfare's public-funded program will not be extended beyond 2025, discussions were held with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and other relevant units in February of this year regarding the 2026 academic year admission quotas for the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs. After several inquiries between February and April, the Ministry of Health and Welfare replied that self-funded student quotas could be allocated to the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs starting from the 2026 academic year, provided that the total medical student quota of 1,300 set by the Ministry of Education is not exceeded.

Therefore, the Ministry of Education emphasized that considering the substantial resources, courses, and equipment already invested by the three universities, and the fact that students are still enrolled, along with the understanding that the source of public-funded students is not regular high school graduates, it was assessed that this adjustment would not impact existing university medical school admissions. Hence, in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare, 35 self-funded positions were granted to each of the three national universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs, ensuring that the total number of general medical students for the 2026 academic year remains within the 1,300 quota.
