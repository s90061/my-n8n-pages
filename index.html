            <h1>Taiwan Wins First Asian Baseball Championship Game with a Big Victory Over Palestine</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's baseball team played against Palestine today in their first game of the Asian Baseball Championship. Taiwan won the game easily with a score of 14 to 0 after 7 innings. This was thanks to their starting pitcher, Lin Sheng-en, who struck out 10 players in 4 innings, and Lin Yu-li, who hit 3 times and helped score 3 runs.</p>
            <p>The Asian Baseball Championship is happening in Pingtan, China. Taiwan is in Group B with Palestine, Hong Kong, and South Korea. Their first game was against Palestine today.</p>
            <p>Taiwan started scoring right away. In the first part of the first inning, after one player was out, Pan Jun-yu hit a triple. Chen Min-tsu then got to walk to first base. High Yu-wei hit a double, which scored the first run. Yang Chen-yu then hit a single, adding another run.</p>
            <p>Taiwan kept scoring in the second part of the second inning. Lin Yu-li hit a single and then stole second base. Chen Hsiao-yun hit a single, moving Lin forward. Lin then scored the third run for Taiwan after another player hit the ball.</p>
            <p>In the fourth part of the fourth inning, Taiwan loaded all the bases with hits from Lin Yu-li, Chen Hsiao-yun, and Pan Jun-yu. Chen Min-tsu hit a single, bringing in one run. After two players were out, two more walks brought in another run. Tsai Chih-yu hit to add more points, and Tsai Wei-tai walked, bringing in another run. Lin Yu-li then hit a double for his second time in that inning, bringing in 3 runs and making Taiwan's lead much bigger.</p>
            <p>Taiwan added more runs in the fifth part of the fifth inning. After a player was hit by the ball and several players walked, all bases were loaded. Lee Yi-wei hit a fly ball, which allowed another player to score. In the sixth part of the sixth inning, they scored 3 more runs.</p>
            <p>Taiwan started the game with Lin Sheng-en, a pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds team in American baseball. At the beginning, he had some trouble with his throws and walked two players in a row. But he quickly got better and struck out 3 players, stopping the other team from scoring. In the second part of the second inning, he hit the first batter with a pitch, but the runner was caught trying to steal a base. Lin Sheng-en then struck out 2 more players, not letting any runs score.</p>
            <p>Lin Sheng-en got better and better. In the third and fourth innings, he easily got three players out. In total, he threw 65 pitches in 4 innings, and no one hit against him. He struck out 10 players and only walked 3, but he did not let any runs score, so he got the win.</p>
            <p>In the fifth inning, Taiwan used different pitchers: Lu Meng-yang from CTBC Brothers, Li Chih-lin from Wei Chuan Dragons, and Wang Yu-chieh from Taiwan Power Company. Each pitcher threw one inning and did not let any runs score, helping the team win. Taiwan's four pitchers together struck out 13 players and only allowed one hit, without letting any runs score.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Airport Will Stay Open During Typhoon, But Many Flights Will Be Cancelled</h1>
            <p>Super Typhoon Wabasaha is coming close to Hong Kong. Today, Hong Kong International Airport said that the airport will stay open during the typhoon. However, many flights are expected to be cancelled tomorrow evening.</p>
            <p>The Airport Authority's Director of Airport Operations, Raymond Yeung, told reporters this afternoon that because of the typhoon, local flights will be greatly reduced starting at 6 PM tomorrow. Flights on September 24th will also be affected.</p>
            <p>According to news reports, Cathay Pacific will cancel 500 flights starting tomorrow. HK Express will cancel more than 100 flights, and Hong Kong Airlines will cancel all of its flights.</p>
            <p>Also, the Hong Kong government is taking Typhoon Wabasaha very seriously. The committee that deals with extreme weather, led by the Chief Secretary for Administration, announced prevention measures today. These include closing all schools (middle schools, primary schools, special schools, kindergartens, kindergarten-cum-child care centres, and night schools) tomorrow and the day after.</p>
            <p>The Observatory said earlier that Typhoon Wabasaha has a very wide storm system. It will pass south of Hong Kong. Even though it will be some distance from Hong Kong, its strong winds are expected to be a big danger to the city. The weather on September 24th is expected to be very bad, with strong winds and heavy rain and thunderstorms. Winds will be strong, reaching levels 8 to 9, and even stronger (level 11) offshore and on high ground. There will also be very big waves in the sea.</p>

            <h1>Germany's New Representative Says Taiwan Shows Democratic Values After Seeing Hong Kong's Freedom Decrease</h1>
            <p>Karsten Tietz, the new German representative in Taiwan, said in an interview with CNA that Germany's office in Taiwan is getting bigger because Taiwan is becoming more important in many areas. He noted that among Germany's offices in Asia, only the one in Taiwan is growing. He also talked about his time working in Hong Kong. He said that after seeing Hong Kong's freedoms disappear, democratic Taiwan is encouraging and shows that democracy is a value for everyone.</p>
            <p>Karsten Tietz, who is the new German representative in Taiwan and the head of the German Institute Taipei, arrived in mid-August. He recently gave his first interview to the media in Taiwan with CNA. He shared that his main goals are to make the relationship between Germany and Taiwan wider, deeper, and closer.</p>
            <p>Tietz stated that even though the German Foreign Office has less money, the German Institute Taipei is getting bigger. Taiwan is the only place in Asia where Germany's office is growing. By January next year, four more staff members will be added, including two senior staff for political affairs. This shows how important the relationship between Germany and Taiwan is. He hopes to make Germany more visible in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Tietz explained that the reason for this growth now is that the German Institute Taipei has not had enough staff for almost 10 years. Also, Taiwan's importance has grown in many key areas like semiconductors. Both sides also work together in microelectronics, artificial intelligence (AI), and hydrogen energy, involving businesses, government, and schools. Germany has realized this and is now fixing the situation.</p>
            <p>In September 2024, two German navy ships sailed through the Taiwan Strait. This was the first time German navy ships had done so in 22 years. About this, Tietz said that the Taiwan Strait is international water, and all countries have the right to sail there. He added that Germany wants to keep international rules based on law.</p>
            <p>Tietz clearly said that sailing through the Taiwan Strait should not be a problem. All countries should follow international rules. He also mentioned that Germany released its "China Strategy" in 2023, which is a response to changes in the political situation and is not a secret. The "China Strategy" explains the risks to peace and stability in this area, including relying too much on China. Germany's work with Taiwan fits with this strategy.</p>
            <p>Tietz further emphasized that Germany wants to "de-risk" and have many different supply chains. Taiwan is an excellent partner that shares the values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law with Germany. Everyone knows that we should not depend only on one country, "especially countries that have different ideas about international rules based on law."</p>
            <p>Tietz's last foreign assignment was in Hong Kong from 2015 to 2018. This was after the Umbrella Movement ended. During this time, he saw the democratic freedoms in Hong Kong become smaller.</p>
            <p>Tietz said working in Hong Kong was "very challenging." He sadly recalled that when he arrived, Hong Kong still had freedom of the press, freedom to protest, freedom to express opinions, and some voting rights. He even met with student leaders from the Umbrella Movement. These students believed Hong Kong could be a model for democracy in China, and some students were elected to the Legislative Council.</p>
            <p>Tietz said that later, these students became enemies of the state. Some elected members were removed from their positions or even arrested. He could not say goodbye to these students before he left, which affected him deeply. He said he "basically saw a free society change into a society where people were afraid to use their legal freedoms."</p>
            <p>When asked how his experience in Hong Kong affects his work as the representative in Taiwan, Tietz said he deeply understands why Taiwanese people see Hong Kong as a warning about "One Country, Two Systems." This is because he really saw what happened in Hong Kong, and it made him want to come to Taiwan. He can also understand how Taiwanese people feel about Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>When asked if "One Country, Two Systems" is not possible, Tietz carefully said, "From what I saw, it did not work in Hong Kong."</p>
            <p>Tietz stressed that democratic Taiwan is very encouraging. He is happy to see that the people of Taiwan value democracy and the rule of law. This shows that these are not just Western values, but values that all people should have.</p>
