            <h1>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu Seeks Re-election, Will Face Kraft in November</h1>
            <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu won the primary election today. This is a step forward in her goal to be mayor again. She is expected to be a strong candidate for the final election in November.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Wu is the first Asian-American and female mayor of Boston. In November, she will compete against another candidate. This person is Josh Kraft, who is also a Democrat and leads a non-profit group. His father is Robert Kraft, who owns the New England Patriots professional American football team.</p>
            <p>Also running are Robert Cappucci, a military veteran who used to be a school board member, and Domingos Darosa, a community activist.</p>
            <p>Wu became more popular partly because she often defended Boston. She spoke out against attacks from the Trump government. People from the Trump government, led by Tom Homan, who manages border issues, often said Boston was not doing enough to catch illegal immigrants. They also said they would increase arrests. Boston is often called a "sanctuary city." Wu has also said many times that she wants Boston to be a friendly place for immigrants.</p>
            <p>Currently, Kraft is Wu's biggest challenger. Among the three challengers, Kraft is the most well-known. However, he has found it hard to create a campaign message that voters really connect with and would make him win. All summer, he spent a lot of money on advertisements. He strongly criticized Wu on different issues, like the high cost of living in Boston and how she deals with areas that have serious drug problems.</p>
            <p>Wu also benefits from strong support from the city council and most Democratic leaders in the state. She can also use her position as mayor to show leadership and has continued to start many new programs, especially for housing.</p>
            <p>When Wu went to vote today, she said the Trump government targeted Boston because Boston "shows all the good things about our democracy." She said, "We prove that when people work together, anything is possible; we also prove why they are wrong."</p>
            <p>Wu often works with her young daughters. She also has a lot of support from the city council and many Democratic leaders. This summer, she also used her role as mayor to highlight her achievements in housing, fighting climate change, and reducing crime. She started several programs related to these areas.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Kraft has found it hard to express his ideas clearly in debates. He often joins Wu in criticizing the Trump government's attacks. Last month, during a campaign event with steelworkers from a union, Kraft said that Trump "actively attacks our democracy and causes hate and division across the country."</p>
            <p>Kraft is in charge of the Kraft Family Philanthropies and the New England Patriots Foundation. But he has not been able to create a strong message that voters like. He focuses on issues like bike lanes, the cost of living in Boston, and the problems of homelessness and drug addiction in the area called "Methadone Mile" (also known as Mass and Cass).</p>
            <p>By the end of August, Kraft's campaign had spent 5.5 million US dollars. This is much more than Wu's 1.1 million US dollars. This is mainly because he put more than 5 million US dollars of his own money into his campaign.</p>
            <p>Kraft sometimes criticizes Wu and sometimes presents himself as someone who wants to bring positive change to Boston.</p>
            <p>Kraft told the Associated Press that when he talks to voters, he feels that Wu's control over the mayoral position might not be as strong as people think.</p>
            <p>He said, "Everywhere I go, my team and I, across all neighborhoods in this city, no matter their race, economic status, group, or language, we hear the same message: they feel they are not heard and that they are not connected with the mayor and the city team."</p>
            <p>He said, "Some polls show a big difference, but let me tell you: elections are not decided by polls, but by people."</p>

            <h1>Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Begins Receiving Goods; Counter Staff "Happy to Return After Half a Year"</h1>
            <p>The Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung closed after a gas explosion on February 13. From today until September 25, the store will start bringing in goods to get ready to open again. Store staff and companies that supply goods said they are very happy to return after "wandering" (working elsewhere or waiting) for six months.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Urban Development Bureau said that Shin Kong Mitsukoshi sent their plan yesterday. Companies can start bringing in goods from 9 AM on September 10. They will continue until September 25 to fill all floors of the store. The bureau also approved this plan. During this time, the store must follow the safety rules in the approved plan to keep everyone safe.</p>
            <p>On the first day of receiving goods at Shin Kong Mitsukoshi, companies for the 6th floor were scheduled first. This includes children's clothing, baby products, and children's toys from about 50 different brands. Zeng Wen-cheng, the Deputy Director of the Urban Development Bureau, also visited to check. He said he saw that the process of bringing in goods was organized. The store had a plan for controlling things, and companies had ID cards and signed in and out. The paths for delivery trucks were also set up to make sure traffic flowed well.</p>
            <p>Zeng Wen-cheng pointed out that Shin Kong will finish bringing in goods by September 25. Thinking about the types of goods, today they mainly brought in dry items. The food for the 12th-floor restaurant area will be brought in on the last day. The Urban Development Bureau will work hard to ensure the safety of the entire building.</p>
            <p>Shin Kong Mitsukoshi said that bringing goods into the Taichung Zhonggang store started today. They are doing it in a "safe and orderly" way. Everyone involved must show their real names. They are bringing goods in floor by floor and area by area. They are also controlling the number of people, the flow of goods, and vehicle traffic to keep everyone safe.</p>
            <p>A store staff member named Lin said she is back today to help get ready for the reopening. She has been waiting for a long time, and all the staff will return together.</p>
            <p>Another staff member named Hsu said she is truly very happy. She had been "wandering" for six months, and now she can come back, which makes her very happy. She said that when she first heard the news about the store closing, her heart broke, and she couldn't sleep at night. It felt like she had lost everything. She is very thankful to be able to return, and everyone stayed in their jobs and did not leave.</p>
            <p>A supplier named Li said that they have worked with Shin Kong for a long time. Everyone is looking forward to the reopening and has strongly supported the store. They are very confident in Shin Kong's public safety, saying that the safety checks must be of the highest standard.</p>

            <h1>Trump Again Says He Did Not Write Offensive Letter; White House Supports Handwriting Analysis</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a Democratic member of the US Congress showed a rude letter. It was said to be from President Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, a rich man who committed sex crimes. Today, Trump said again that he did not write this letter. The White House also said they would support checking the handwriting to see if it is true.</p>
            <p>Reuters and AFP reported that Trump and the rich man Jeffrey Epstein were friends for 15 years. They were often seen together. Later, in 2004, they had a disagreement about a property deal. Epstein lost his good reputation because of charges of sex trafficking. He died in prison in 2019 while waiting for his trial.</p>
            <p>Recently, people have been talking about a letter that might be from Trump. It was supposedly sent to Epstein in 2003 to wish him a happy birthday. The letter reportedly had drawings of naked women. The Democratic member of Congress shared pictures of this letter on social media yesterday. The White House immediately said that Trump did not write it.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump told reporters that the signature on the letter was not his handwriting. He also said that the way the letter was written did not sound like him. He said, "People who have interviewed me for a long time know that's not how I talk. It's all nonsense."</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, told reporters that the White House will help with handwriting analysis. This will show that what Trump says is true.</p>
            <p>She said, "The President did not write this letter, and he did not sign this letter."</p>
            <p>Leavitt also said that Trump did not sign a check that was supposedly from him to Epstein.</p>
            <p>She added, "The President's signature is one of the most famous in the world, and it has been for many years."</p>
            <p>James Comer, a Republican member of the US House of Representatives, is in charge of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. This committee is looking into the Epstein case. Comer said he believes what Trump has said.</p>
