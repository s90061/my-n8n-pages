            <h1>Portugal Recognizes Palestinian State, Following UK, Canada, and Australia</h1>
            <p>New York, September 21 (Central News Agency) â€“ After the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, Portugal announced today that it recognizes the Palestinian State. This makes Portugal another Western country to take this step. This happens as the war in Gaza continues with no clear end.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Portugal's Foreign Minister, Paulo Rangel, spoke to reporters in New York. He said this before the United Nations General Assembly debate starts tomorrow. He stated, "Recognizing the Palestinian State is therefore the completion of our basic, consistent, and widely agreed policy."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Portugal believes that the 'two-state solution' is the only way to achieve fair and lasting peace. It is also the way to help Israel and Palestine live together peacefully."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia announced that they recognize the Palestinian State. This makes the UK and Canada the first G7 countries to do so. After the UN General Assembly debate begins, it is expected that France and other countries will also recognize the Palestinian State.</p>

            <h1>Syria to Hold Parliamentary Elections on October 5, First Under New Government</h1>
            <p>Damascus, September 21 (Central News Agency) â€“ Syria's state news agency, SANA, reported today that Syria will hold its first parliamentary elections under the new Islamic government on October 5. This will be the first election since the new government took power.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the new parliament is expected to create a base for a wider democratic process. This comes after nearly 14 years of civil war in Syria and the former President Bashar al-Assad stepping down last December. Some people who criticize the system say that it does not include enough minority groups.</p>
            <p>The new parliament will also look at new laws to change the country's economy, which has been controlled by the government for a long time. It will also approve international agreements that might change Syria's relationships with other countries.</p>
            <p>SANA reported that the People's Assembly will vote for 210 seats, and voting will happen in "all areas." The election committee said last month that voting in three provinces would be delayed because of safety worries.</p>
            <p>About one-third of the People's Assembly seats will be chosen by President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Syria was originally going to have parliamentary elections in September.</p>
            <p>In March this year, Syria released a new constitution to guide the country during the time of change under President Sharaa. This constitution says that Islamic law is very important, but it also protects women's rights and freedom of speech. However, it also made some people worried that the Islamic government might have too much power.</p>
