            <h1>Wei Hong-liang Pitches 1.2 Scoreless Innings, Gets First Career Minor League Win</h1>
            <p>Wei Hong-liang, who was the top draft pick for the TSG Hawks baseball team this year, played in a minor league game today. He pitched for 1.2 innings and did not allow any runs. His fastest pitch was 149 kilometers per hour. The Hawks team won the game against the CTBC Brothers with a score of 3 to 2. This was Wei Hong-liang's first win in the minor league.</p>
            <p>Wei Hong-liang is 19 years old. He started playing in the minor league at the end of August. In his first game on August 28th, he pitched for 1 inning. He did not let anyone get a hit, and he struck out two batters, not giving up any runs. Today, he played in the minor league again.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hawks minor league team played against the Brothers minor league team. After 5 innings, the score was tied at 2-2. In the bottom of the 6th inning, the Hawks team put Wei Hong-liang in to pitch. He walked the first batter, Hsu Shao-yu. Then, he got the next two batters out with a fly ball to center field and a ground ball to second base. After that, Hu Meng-chih hit a single, putting a runner in scoring position. But Wei Hong-liang got control again and got Yang Hsiang-ho out with a fly ball to right field. He did not let any runs score.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 7th inning, after two outs, the Hawks team scored runs. This happened because Huang Ping-yang, Lan Yin-lun, and Tung Ping-hsuan all hit singles. Wei Hong-liang continued to pitch in the bottom of the 7th inning. He got a batter out with a fly ball to center field and then struck out Liu Kuei-yuan before leaving the game.</p>
            <p>Wei Hong-liang threw 30 pitches in total today over 1.2 innings. He allowed 1 hit, struck out 1 batter, and walked 1 batter. He did not allow any runs. His fastest pitch was 149 kilometers per hour. The team won the game, and Wei Hong-liang got the win.</p>
            <p>Yokota Hisanori, the pitching coach for the Hawks, had said earlier that Wei Hong-liang would join the team and travel with the main team. This was because they hoped Wei Hong-liang would have a chance to play in the main league this season.</p>

            <h1>First Bank: 10 Billion NTD in Home Loan Quota Remains, Focus on Homes for Personal Use</h1>
            <p>Recently, public banks' home loan lending has been getting attention. First Bank announced today that it mainly provides loans for homes that people live in themselves, which are considered basic needs. They expect the growth rate of home loans to be 5% to 6% this year. The goal for the total increase in loans for the whole year is about 40 billion New Taiwan dollars. By the end of this year, there will still be 10 billion New Taiwan dollars available for lending.</p>
            <p>First Financial Holding Company held a meeting today to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of 2025. They announced their financial data and business situation for the first half of the year. Their net profit after tax was 13.946 billion New Taiwan dollars, which is a 1.6% increase from last year. This is the highest profit for the same period in history. The earnings per share (EPS) was 0.97 New Taiwan dollars. First Bank, which is a subsidiary, had a net profit after tax of 13.807 billion New Taiwan dollars, a 7.9% increase, also a new record for the same period. Other subsidiaries together had a net profit after tax of 0.763 billion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tsai Shu-hui, the Vice President of First Bank, said that the bank mainly offers loans for homes that people need to live in. She estimates that home loan growth will be 5% to 6% this year. The target for the total increase in loans for the year is about 40 billion New Taiwan dollars. They lend about 7 to 8 billion New Taiwan dollars each month, and it takes about 2 months to arrange these loans. As for group home loans, these mostly come from public housing, urban renewal, and old building renovation projects. The total amount of loans for construction and land increased by 15.6 billion New Taiwan dollars, but regular construction and land loans decreased by about 8 billion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Looking at the economy for the whole year, Ms. Lee Shu-ling, the Vice President of First Financial Holding Company, explained that different organizations believe that economic growth will slow down in the second half of the year. It might go below 2.5%, and for the whole year, it will be around 4.4%. Next year, because of the high numbers this year, economic growth will also slow down. This is because the market needs time to deal with issues about tariffs. There might be a "gap period" for about half a year. It is clear that exports will be affected in the second half of this year.</p>
            <p>Ms. Lee Shu-ling said that if the tariffs are finally decided, companies should have ways to deal with them. It looks like this will lead to new foreign investments or changes in how companies manage their money. This will still create opportunities for the financial industry. She said, "Next year, apart from the housing market which might be a bit careful, the overall economy will not look too bad."</p>
            <p>Ms. Lee Shu-ling stated that, in comparison, Taiwanese companies have had good experiences during recent economic changes. Some weaker companies might still face problems, but generally, she believes there is no need to worry too much.</p>
            <p>First Financial Holding Company said that due to the impact of higher tariffs from the United States, changes in exchange rates, and Taiwanese companies moving their supply chains, local industries will face business difficulties in the second half of the year. Also, the housing market is cooling down, and there were high numbers before. So, the growth of bank lending is expected to slow down. They will actively help customers overcome business challenges. They will also keep their operations strong and take advantage of opportunities, such as the opening of the "Asia Asset Management Center" in Kaohsiung. They will also use their many overseas branches to provide cross-border financial services for Taiwanese companies changing their production plans.</p>
