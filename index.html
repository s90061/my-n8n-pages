A report by the British newspaper "Daily Telegraph" states that China plans to build six more "medical centers" in Xinjiang by 2030. These centers will include places for organ transplants. An international human rights group, ETAC, said this number is too high for the local population and makes people worry about forced organ harvesting.

Xinjiang currently has three such medical centers that can do organ transplants. If these new centers are built, the number of places for organ transplants in Xinjiang will triple in about five years. Four of the new six centers will be in Urumqi, the capital city.

In 2019, a group called the "Uyghur Tribunal" in the UK said that China might do as many as 100,000 organ transplants a year. This is almost three times more than what China officially reports. The tribunal found that there was enough proof that Chinese officials were taking organs from people who were held in custody, sometimes even while they were still alive. Uyghurs and Falun Gong followers are often victims of this.

Wendy Rogers, who works with ETAC, told the "Daily Telegraph" that while China has a program for organ donation, many people who are called "donors" actually have their organs taken by force. Some of these people die while their organs are being removed. Rogers thinks the new centers in Xinjiang might be used to get and put in organs. She also said it would be cheaper to bring people who need organs to Xinjiang for the transplant. This would also make the time shorter between taking out an organ and putting it in, which helps keep the organ good.

Rogers also mentioned that most Uyghurs are Muslims who do not drink alcohol. Because of this, like Falun Gong followers, they are seen as healthier and "better" sources for organs. In 2020, Xinjiang had about 26 million people, but it will have nine medical centers for organ transplants. For comparison, Guizhou province has about 39 million people but only three such centers. The Uyghur population in Xinjiang is only about 12 million.

Official numbers also show that fewer people donate organs in Xinjiang than in other parts of China. In Xinjiang, only 0.69 people per million donate organs, while the average for China is 4.6 people per million. Experts believe that at least 500,000 Uyghurs are currently held in camps in Xinjiang.

**SRE Chooses Century Wind Power for Offshore Wind Farm Parts**

SRE (Synergy Renewables Energy) announced today that it has chosen Century Wind Power to provide underwater foundations for its Haicheng wind farm, also known as Formosa 3-1. This decision shows SRE's support for Taiwan's goal to use more local products in offshore wind power. It also shows that the company can keep its projects on time and maintain quality while helping local and international supply chains grow.

SRE stated in a press release that Century Wind Power will be responsible for providing 35 jacket-type underwater foundations for the "Haicheng Wind Power" project. These parts are needed for the project to connect to the electricity grid. During this time, Century Wind Power will not only build up local manufacturing abilities but also combine resources from supply chains in Taiwan and other countries. This will allow them to use both local teamwork and international connections.

Lin Yung-yao, the chairman of SRE, said that SRE is based in Taiwan and has high hopes for local suppliers. He is happy to give them important tasks. This partnership is very meaningful because it not only meets the requirements for using local products but also allows a local company to manage all the steps of the underwater foundation supply chain. Lin sees this as a big step forward for Taiwan's offshore wind power industry in its third stage of development.

Lai Wen-hsiang, the chairman of Century Wind Power, said that his company will bring together resources from suppliers in the Asia-Pacific area. They will also use their factories and two "Century King Kong Towers" in Taiwan to make and assemble the parts as much as possible. This will help them deliver the underwater foundations to the client on time and with the right quality.

Haicheng Wind Power (Formosa 4) is the third offshore wind farm that SRE is building in Taiwan. It is located off the coast of Miaoli. At the end of 2022, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved a capacity of 495MW for the project during the first phase of the third stage of offshore wind power development. In late 2024, the project received permission to start building, making it the first project from that phase to reach a major step.

**US Trade Deficit Grew to $71.5 Billion in May, Trump's Tariffs Add Uncertainty**

New government information released today shows that the US trade deficit in May grew more than expected, reaching $71.5 billion. This means the US imported more goods and services than it exported. However, both imports and exports went down at the same time. This suggests that President Trump's tariffs are not only affecting the economy but also causing problems for supply chains.

According to Agence France-Presse, Donald Trump said in early April that he would put equal tariffs on many US trade partners. Then, he paused this for 90 days, during which only a basic 10% tariff was in place. This 90-day period is expected to end on July 9.

Data from the US Department of Commerce shows that the trade deficit in May was higher than April's deficit of $60.3 billion. It is important to note that both imports and exports decreased in May. Imports went down by 0.1% to $350.5 billion, mainly because fewer goods were imported. Exports dropped sharply by 4% to $279 billion, with industrial supplies and raw materials showing the biggest decrease.
