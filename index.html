            <h1>New York Times: Former Senator Lost Election After Attending President Tsai's Dinner, Pro-China Groups Worked Against Her</h1>
            <p>When former President Tsai Ing-wen visited New York in 2023, a state senator named Iwen Chu went to a dinner for Taiwanese people living abroad. The New York Times reported that this decision hurt her in the election the next year. Her supporters stopped backing her, and she lost to a candidate who was supported by groups that favor China. Local leaders said that Iwen Chu was very popular. They believe she would have won if she had not gone to that dinner.</p>
            <p>Today, the New York Times published a long report called "How the Chinese Communist Party Affects Elections in New York." It says that groups like clubs for people from the same hometown are used by the Chinese Consulate in New York to influence elections. These groups secretly try to stop politicians who speak against the Chinese government. They strongly support candidates who are friendly to China.</p>
            <p>A part of the report, called "China Tries Hard to Stop World Support for Taiwan," starts in 2019.</p>
            <p>That year, President Tsai Ing-wen visited New York for the first time as president. She went to a dinner for Taiwanese people. John Liu, a state senator who was born in Taiwan, was there. But he later told the New York Times that people from the Chinese Consulate contacted his office. They told him clearly that it was not a good idea for him to be at the event.</p>
            <p>John Liu said that some of the hometown clubs that first asked him to the dinner then took back their invitations.</p>
            <p>The New York Times also said that in 2021, a high-ranking FBI officer warned state lawmakers. The officer said that consulate workers use threats and gifts to influence politicians, especially those who support Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The officer sent a letter to a new state assemblywoman. In the letter, he wrote: "You and your staff, and other people, are targets of these actions."</p>
            <p>Last year, a conservative American magazine, "National Review," reported that in 2023, President Tsai Ing-wen visited New York again. The Chinese Consulate told Mayor Eric Adams to stay away from "any official contact" with President Tsai. Mayor Adams did not go to the dinner later.</p>
            <p>However, State Senator Iwen Chu, who is Taiwanese-American, went to the dinner. This cost her a lot.</p>
            <p>Two people who were at the dinner told the New York Times that after the event, Chinese diplomats invited some members of the hometown clubs to the consulate. They asked Iwen Chu about her thoughts on Taiwan becoming independent.</p>
            <p>Zhen Jinrong, the head of the New York Taishan Association and one of the attendees, remembered in Cantonese, "I said I didn't know anything."</p>
            <p>Soon after, Iwen Chu also got a letter from the consulate. The New York Times saw a copy of an email. A diplomat asked Iwen Chu to meet with the Deputy Consul General to talk about "New York and China working together."</p>
            <p>In April 2023, Iwen Chu met the Deputy Consul General. After they said hello, the Deputy Consul General quickly started talking about the main issue. He said people were not happy about the dinner and that the situation was "very tense."</p>
            <p>"They put pressure on me," Iwen Chu said later.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that Iwen Chu told the Chinese diplomat that she focused on New York problems, not world problems. But it was too late.</p>
            <p>In February 2024, a powerful person in New York, Chen Shanzhuang, who works for Beijing, started looking closely at a Republican candidate. This candidate, Steve Chan, was a former Marine born in Hong Kong. He was running against the Democrat Iwen Chu.</p>
            <p>Three people who were there said that Chen Shanzhuang asked Steve Chan in his office what he thought about Hong Kong and Taiwan. Steve Chan replied that he supported Hong Kong's democracy and that China should not bother Taiwan.</p>
            <p>When he was asked "if he wanted to change his answer," Steve Chan became less firm. He suggested keeping things as they were.</p>
            <p>However, Steve Chan told the New York Times that he did not change his mind at that time. Whatever he said, Chen Shanzhuang believed him. Later, Chen Shanzhuang supported Steve Chan at hometown club events. Other community leaders who had supported Iwen Chu also started supporting Steve Chan.</p>
            <p>Last November, Steve Chan easily won against Iwen Chu. Yu Jinshan, who used to be the head of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, said he thought the Chinese Consulate "got some groups in Brooklyn to work against Iwen Chu."</p>
            <p>This year, the New York Times asked Steve Chan why he let Chen Shanzhuang, who clearly works with China, support him.</p>
            <p>Steve Chan answered, "Whether you like him or not, whether he is a Communist or not, he is very important in his community."</p>

            <h1>Vietnam Builds Land in South China Sea as Fast as China, Uses Smart Strategy</h1>
            <p>In the last two years, Vietnam has been quietly and quickly building new land in the South China Sea. It is almost building as fast as China. Experts say Vietnam has become a "smart player" in this area. It acts strongly on the ground but uses gentle talk in its dealings with other countries. Some people also think China is letting Vietnam do this because China wants to focus its strong actions on the Philippines.</p>
            <p>On August 22, an American research group called CSIS released a report. It said that new pictures from space show Vietnam started building more land on 8 islands and reefs in the Spratly Islands this year. These islands are claimed by different countries. The report suggests Vietnam's building might soon be bigger than China's. China claims almost all of the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>On August 25, China's Foreign Ministry held a regular press meeting. A spokesperson named Guo Jiakun said the Spratly Islands belong to China. He strongly disagreed with other countries building on islands and reefs that China says they took illegally. He said China would take steps to protect its land. These words were much like what China said and did in February.</p>
            <p>Another report from AMTI, which is part of CSIS, said that by March 2025, the new land Vietnam made in the Spratly Islands was about 70% of the land China made.</p>
            <p>Since 2022, Vietnam's building in the South China Sea has become easier to see. But China has not reacted as strongly as some people thought it would.</p>
            <p>Sebastian Strangio, an expert on Southeast Asian countries, wrote in "The Diplomat" magazine today: "It's a bit surprising that Vietnam's actions have not made China react much. But China has reacted very strongly to small actions by the Philippines, like when the Philippines tried to give supplies to its soldiers on islands that China claims."</p>
            <p>Strangio thought that if China and Vietnam's relationship gets worse, China might act strongly. "But China seems to want to focus its strong actions on the Philippines," he said. The Philippines is a friend of the U.S., so China might see it as acting for the U.S.</p>
            <p>"For now, Vietnam and China seem okay with, or at least not against, the actual borders in the Spratly Islands becoming clearer."</p>
            <p>A Vietnamese researcher, Pham Van Luat, wrote in "Luat Khoa Magazine" about Vietnam's "well-planned" two-sided approach in the South China Sea for the last two years. He said this new plan "is a direct answer to China's strong growth in this area."</p>
            <p>China is growing its power in the South China Sea. It tries to stop ships from the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, and other countries. "Because of these actions, the Vietnamese government started to take strong steps on the ground and clever diplomatic actions."</p>
            <p>"Whether on land or at sea, Vietnam is acting more firmly to show it is there and it owns the land. But in politics, it still acts in a smooth way."</p>
            <p>Vietnam's work to build land on 8 new islands and reefs is now as big as or even bigger than China's. Also, new buildings like ammunition storage units are appearing on these new islands. The AMTI report said that Vietnam is quickly trying to make its ownership in the Spratly Islands a "done deal."</p>
            <p>Pham Van Luat believes that by improving, building land, and making artificial islands, Vietnam now has enough power to make it hard for China to block its islands and reefs. The Philippines still faces threats of being blocked by China because it has not done similar things.</p>
            <p>In March 1988, China and Vietnam fought a sea battle over islands in the Spratly Islands. China won and took important islands. Many Vietnamese navy soldiers were hurt or died.</p>
            <p>Pham Van Luat said that compared to how "simple" Vietnam was in 1988, it is now a "smart player" in the South China Sea game. It has learned to use "planned, many-sided actions. These actions might look like they are going in different ways, but they actually work together."</p>
            <p>Vietnam is actively building more land and military bases in the Spratly Islands. At the same time, it keeps friendly talks with China to avoid problems.</p>
            <p>Also, Vietnam welcomes countries like the U.S. and Japan, who are China's competitors, to build stronger security relationships. But it also keeps making its economic ties with China stronger. "This way of doing many things at once shows that the government is more practical and experienced. It can take better actions to protect what is good for its country."</p>
            <p>However, Pham Van Luat also said that China surely knows Vietnam has been building land very quickly since 2022. China also sees Vietnam's clever diplomacy: Vietnam welcomes Chinese leaders with high honors, but also protests and pushes back when China enters its special sea area.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that these handshakes, hugs, and gun salutes help make their connection stronger and control problems between the two communist parties. "At the same time, they also hide the strong building happening on the ground. This building is changing the important situation in the South China Sea forever."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Official Explains Defense Plans at US Midwestern Meeting</h1>
            <p>New York, August 25 (CNA) An important group for state lawmakers in the U.S., called the "Midwestern Legislative Conference," recently held a training event for leaders. On August 24, Lay Yen-feng, who is the Director of Taiwan's office in Chicago, went to this event. He thanked politicians from both main U.S. parties for helping Taiwan protect itself. He also explained that President Lai Ching-te has said that next year, Taiwan's spending on defense will be 3.32% of its total economy (GDP). By 2030, this will go up to 5%.</p>
            <p>The Midwestern Legislative Conference happened from August 22 to 26 in Madison, Wisconsin. This is the capital city of the state. Lawmakers from the Midwest of the U.S. and Canada, along with leaders from other groups, were there. Lay Yen-feng, the Director from Taiwan's office in Chicago, was asked to give a speech on August 24.</p>
            <p>Lay Yen-feng said that Taiwan currently faces problems in its area. China uses army threats, spreads false news, explains a UN rule (Resolution 2758) incorrectly, and uses money problems to keep threatening peace in the Indo-Pacific area. Taiwan is in a very important place in the "first island chain." It has helped for a long time to stop powerful countries that are not democratic from growing stronger.</p>
            <p>Lay Yen-feng thanked the U.S. for support from both political parties to help Taiwan defend itself. He said that Taiwan can protect itself. In the last 8 years, its defense budget has grown by 80%. President Lai has announced that next year's defense budget will be 3.32% of the country's total money made (GDP). By 2030, it will be 5%. Taiwan will also keep working closely with the U.S. on safety to keep the Indo-Pacific area peaceful and stable.</p>
            <p>He said that trade between the U.S. and Taiwan helps both sides. If they work together more, it can make the ways democratic countries get their goods stronger and safer. Working together on education can also help young people in the future be better at competing. A stronger Taiwan and U.S. are not just good for them. They also make sure the Indo-Pacific and the world are peaceful, rich, and stable. He hopes Taiwan and the U.S. will keep working hand in hand to start a new part of their relationship and build a stronger future.</p>
