            <h1>50 Years Since Vietnam War: Film Looks at Memories of Second Generation in Penghu Refugee Camp</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Hung Su-su, Taipei, July 29) This year marks 50 years since the Vietnam War ended. A documentary called "Strangers and Their Children" was filmed in Taiwan, Penghu, Vietnam, America, and Russia. It tells the stories of four people born in a Vietnamese refugee camp in Penghu. They look back at their memories of escaping, surviving, and finding their identity as part of a country.</p>
            <p>"Strangers and Their Children" had its first showing today. The director, Liu Ji-hsiung, and the film team were there. Hu Yuan-hui, the chairman of PTS (Public Television Service), also came to support. Hu Yuan-hui said, "I grew up when 'Blood Letters from the South Sea' was important. Even though I later studied news about the Vietnam War, I didn't know much about this forgotten history. I believe the director's film will help us learn more about this part of history and think about human nature and civilization."</p>
            <p>Speaking about how he made the film, Liu Ji-hsiung said, "Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations, so other countries don't officially recognize it. I even think Taiwan is like a refugee. But by filming these 'strangers' and their lives in Taiwan, my view of the world became wider. I believe that the international help we gave in the past will have an impact everywhere in the world in the future."</p>
            <p>For 20 years after the Vietnam War ended in 1975, political refugees escaped by boat to find a new life. Those who survived, called "boat people," were placed in refugee camps in Southeast and Northeast Asia. But at that time, due to Taiwan's difficult diplomatic situation, these camps were not registered with the United Nations. Because of different languages, social customs, and cultures, these refugees were seen as strangers by Taiwanese people.</p>
            <p>Records show that 106 babies were born in the Penghu Vietnamese refugee camp. Many of them later came back to Taiwan to find their roots. Among them, Ruan Guoyue, who lives in the United States now, shared in a press release that he recently went to New Taipei City to visit Huang Jinyu, the former deputy director of the Penghu refugee camp, who is over 100 years old. He thanked Huang for greatly helping his parents in the past.</p>
            <p>Ruan Guoyue looked at old photos and said with emotion, "I was only 6 months old then. I can't imagine how they felt having to leave everything behind. Thanks to Uncle Huang (Huang Jinyu)'s help, we can now live happily together."</p>
            <p>Zhou Jie-er, a 70-year-old Chinese-Vietnamese, drifted to Penghu in 1979 and lived in the refugee camp. She met and fell in love with Mr. Ni, a young man from Jiangmei Village. At the end of that year, they had a rare wedding inside the camp. In 1980, they had a daughter named Ni Yan-yan. Their whole family settled down in Penghu. Zhou Jie-er said, "I am different from other refugees. They all left, but I stayed in Penghu and became a Penghu mother."</p>
            <p>The documentary "Strangers and Their Children" will first be shown on PTS Channel at 10 PM on the 31st and will also be available on the "PTS+" platform. Liu Ji-hsiung hopes that through this film, more people will see this valuable but forgotten history. (Editor: Chang Ya-ching) 1140729</p>

            <h1>Starlux Airlines: Direct Flights to Phoenix Starting Jan 15 Next Year, No Stops</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Chiang Ming-yen, Taipei, July 29) Taiwanese airlines are adding new flights to Phoenix. Starlux Airlines announced today that it will start direct flights from Taipei to Phoenix on January 15 next year. Tickets are on sale now. Phoenix will be Starlux Airlines' fifth destination in North America. This route is also the first direct flight from Arizona to Asia without any stops.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese airlines are adding flights to Phoenix, USA. China Airlines recently announced that it would start a new route to Phoenix on December 3 this year, being the first. It will use an Airbus A350-900 plane and offer three round-trip flights per week.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines announced today that it will start flights to Phoenix on January 15 next year. The airline sees Phoenix as having steady demand for tourism and business. In recent years, because TSMC built a factory there, the technology industry is growing stronger. Starlux Airlines is taking this chance to expand its business in North America and improve its connecting flights between Asia and North America.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines stated that the Taipei-Phoenix route will use a new generation Airbus A350 plane. At the beginning, there will be three flights per week. From March 2026, it will increase to four flights per week.</p>
            <p>Zhai Jian-hua, the CEO of Starlux Airlines, said that the Starlux Airlines Taipei-Phoenix route is the first direct flight from Arizona to Asia without stops. Phoenix is the fifth largest city in the United States. Starlux Airlines believes in its business and tourism potential. It has many tourist attractions, and in recent years, many technology companies have moved there. This has made Phoenix an important center for new industries, showing its diverse appeal in both tourism and technology.</p>
            <p>He said that in recent years, because TSMC moved there, it has caused other related industries to build factories, which has increased visits between Taiwan and Phoenix. Starlux Airlines opening this route will meet the growing need for travel between the two places.</p>
            <p>Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said that Starlux Airlines starting flights from Taipei to Phoenix further strengthens Phoenix's position as a top city in North America. It shows Phoenix's growth in international business and highlights that Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is one of the best managed airports in the world.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines stated that for its US routes, there are currently 10 flights per week between Taipei and Los Angeles, one flight daily between Taipei and San Francisco, and Taipei and Seattle, and four flights per week between Taipei and Ontario, California. As Starlux Airlines continues to grow its presence in North America, travelers will have more convenient connecting services. (Editor: Yang Lan-hsuan) 1140729</p>

            <h1>Eric Chu: DPP Group Should Actively Discuss Dujuan Typhoon Disaster Special Act</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Liu Guan-ting, Taipei, July 29) Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu today asked the government to think about the people. He said that for things like urgent disaster relief, giving money back to the people, and boosting the economy, the government should stop being proud of its power and always put the people first. The KMT group in the Legislative Yuan quickly proposed a draft for the "Special Act for Post-Typhoon Dujuan Reconstruction." He said the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should actively discuss this to pass the act faster.</p>
            <p>It is rumored that the Executive Yuan will not ask for a review of the special act about giving NT$10,000 to everyone, which has caused much discussion. Wu Szu-yao, the head of the DPP group in the Legislative Yuan, said today in an interview that the deadline for asking for a review is the 31st, so there is still time. She believes the Executive Yuan is still thinking about it.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said on Facebook this afternoon that he saw the DPP facing a big recall result, but instead of humbly thinking about it and accepting the new public opinion, they blamed the people for wanting NT$10,000 cash. He asked if the ruling party didn't know that this money was from the government collecting too much tax and should be returned to the people. He also said that giving cash to everyone is to encourage spending, boost the economy, and ease economic pressure from tariffs.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said there are rumors that the Executive Yuan wants to use a trick. They say they won't ask for a review, but they still plan to go to the Constitutional Court, and they might not even set aside money for it. They just want to get through the second wave of big recalls on August 23. He believes that the government focuses on politics every day and ignores the people's lives, and people's anger is growing.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu stressed that he sincerely asks the government to think about the people. For things like urgent disaster relief, giving money back to the people, and boosting the economy, they should stop being proud of their power and always put the people first. He said that democracy is not about power; it is about the people's lives. People do not want the government to play politics; they want to live and work in peace.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu also said that after a big and bad recall, President Lai Ching-te still doesn't care about the people and can't see the disaster victims. Recently, the government has been slow to react to the serious damage caused by Typhoon Dujuan and the heavy rains that followed. He said that the standard rescue procedures (SOPs) that Taiwan has used for a long time to help disaster victims quickly were not seen, and the Executive Yuan still hasn't suggested a quick reconstruction plan that should have started.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said that the Kuomintang (KMT) group in the Legislative Yuan quickly proposed a draft for the "Special Act for Post-Typhoon Dujuan Reconstruction." They hope that the lives of disaster victims will return to normal soon. However, after the Legislative Yuan sent it directly to its second reading, it still needs to go to discussion, which means a "cooling-off period" of one month. He said that the disaster victims are still suffering, so the DPP should actively and quickly discuss with the KMT group, who proposed the act, to pass it faster.
