            <h1>China's Community Canteens Close After Government Money Stops</h1>
            <p>In China, "community canteens" mainly served older people. Over 1700 of these canteens opened in different places since 2022. But in two years, many of them have closed down. The main reason is that these canteens became projects just for showing good government work. Most were run by outside companies. When the government stopped giving money, the canteens could not continue and had to close. Many older people who bought meal cards for these canteens cannot get their money back.</p>
            <p>On October 31, 2022, China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the Ministry of Civil Affairs sent out a notice. It was about starting pilot projects for building complete communities. It asked different areas to try improving community services. This included building kindergartens, service centers for older people, medical centers, and handy shops like convenience stores, vegetable shops, canteens, pharmacies, and home service spots. These were to offer "one-stop" services for residents.</p>
            <p>The notice also asked each county-level city and district to choose 3 to 5 communities. They were to start these "complete community" pilot projects. After two years, these projects would be used all over the country. The goal was to provide many services for people's daily lives, including community canteens. After this, many community canteens started opening in China. Unofficial numbers show that about 1700 community canteens were set up in China within about one year after the notice.</p>
            <p>However, Chinese media reports say that soon after many community canteens opened, they had problems with money and not enough customers. Because of this, many community canteens in places like Beijing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Hangzhou, and Suzhou have closed since last year. Some canteens even closed less than two months after opening.</p>
            <p>The reports mentioned that in Suzhou, for example, more than 2000 community canteens, called "meal points for older people," were opened to follow the policy. But at least half of them lost money, and many closed down completely.</p>
            <p>According to the reports, when these community canteens first opened, they received help from local governments, like money or lower rent. This made private businesses happy to run the canteens for the communities. But in recent years, local governments have had less money. So, some stopped giving money to the community canteens. This made it hard for the canteen operators to continue. They could no longer offer cheap food, so they lost customers, and finally, the canteens closed.</p>
            <p>Reports quoted community workers who said that some places set up community canteens just to "complete tasks from above." They did not really think about what older people needed. What made people even angrier was that many older people bought meal cards for the canteens, but now they cannot get their money back because the canteens closed. Their money is gone.</p>
            <p>Some community canteens are still open, but they are having problems. They are barely staying open because they still get some money from the government. Experts say there are four reasons for these problems. First, the taste of the food is not good enough. It is hard to make food that both older people and younger adults like. Also, many canteens use pre-made meals, which are now disliked in China, to save money. This makes the food even less appealing.</p>
            <p>Second, the food choices are boring. After some time, people found that the canteens always had the same few dishes. They were not varied or rich. But if canteens keep changing their menus, the cost goes up a lot, making it harder to run them. Third, even though canteen food is relatively cheap, many older people got tired of the limited choices. They preferred to go back to buying food and cooking at home, as it is cheaper to cook for themselves.</p>
            <p>Fourth, most community canteens in China are led by the community but run by private businesses. However, these businesses often just want to make a profit. They care more about getting special offers and money from the government. They rarely put effort into running the canteens well. Once the government stops giving money, these businesses naturally close down.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Coast Guard Ships Twice Disturb Kinmen Waters, Taiwan Coast Guard Makes Them Leave</h1>
            <p>Four Chinese coast guard ships bothered the waters near Kinmen twice today, in the morning and afternoon. Taiwan's Coast Guard Administration (CGA) made them leave by sailing alongside them. The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch of the CGA said this is the first time in two years that Chinese coast guard ships have caused trouble on a Sunday holiday. It happened just one day after a recall election and a referendum took place. This situation is different from before.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch of the Ocean Affairs Council's CGA sent out a press release today. It stated that at 8:50 AM today, four Chinese coast guard ships, named "14608," "14527," "14603," and "14515," entered Kinmen waters from the southwest of Damao Mountain. They turned off their "Automatic Identification System" (AIS) and sailed east in a single line. The Taiwan Coast Guard found them and quickly sent patrol boats to respond. By 11:00 AM, the Chinese coast guard ships were made to leave the restricted waters.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch said that the same four Chinese coast guard ships bothered Kinmen waters again at 3:00 PM. The Taiwan Coast Guard patrol boats that were already there quickly moved closer to them. They used Chinese and English radio broadcasts to tell the coast guard ships to change direction and leave. With the Taiwan patrol boats sailing next to them and watching, the Chinese coast guard ships left Kinmen's restricted waters at 5:10 PM.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch pointed out that this is the first time in two years that the Chinese coast guard has caused this kind of trouble, called "grey zone harassment," on a Sunday holiday. It happened just one day after a recall vote and a public vote were finished. This is not like past events.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration released a statement asking China to stop these actions that harm peace and stability in the area. They said such actions could make people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait feel bad. The CGA always acts firmly to uphold the law, responds completely, and works hard to protect the country's power and safety.</p>

            <h1>Lu Shiow-yen Not Running for KMT Chairperson; Huang Kuo-chang Says 2026 Plans Can Be Discussed After Result</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen announced today that she cannot run for chairperson of the Kuomintang (KMT) party. Huang Kuo-chang, chairperson of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), said he believes Lu Shiow-yen has thought about many things. He respects how other parties choose their leaders. He added that once the KMT has chosen a new chairperson, both parties can talk and discuss their plans for the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, KMT Chairman Eric Chu publicly asked Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to take over as chairperson. Today, Lu Shiow-yen announced that industries are facing a very difficult time. She feels she must stay in her current job during this hard period. She used the phrase, "Mom will stay at home," meaning she cannot run for KMT chairperson.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Huang Kuo-chang went to Sanchong District in New Taipei City for an event called "Bright Golden Castle Paradise, Grandparents and Grandchildren Love Without Limits." When asked by reporters, Huang Kuo-chang said that Lu Shiow-yen is a very good political leader and an older, more experienced person in politics. He believes she has considered many things. This is because the central government has handled the high tariffs from the United States very poorly, which has greatly hurt the machine tool industry in central Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that Lu Shiow-yen is focusing on city matters and wants to help the machine tool companies. He called this "her decision to take responsibility." As for the KMT chairperson election, he respects how other parties choose their leaders. He said the most important thing is for his own party to do well. He will work with great honesty and kindness. Once the KMT has chosen its leader, both parties can discuss and talk about their plans for the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked about the failed referendum to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant. The Green camp (Democratic Progressive Party) questioned if spending NT$1.1 billion was a waste of public money. Huang Kuo-chang said this shows that the DPP has not truly started to reflect and review their actions. He believes the "big bad recall" that the DPP started was the real waste of public money. He said the results of this referendum clearly show that a huge number of votes made the DPP's "nuclear-free homeland" policy something they must now let go of.</p>
            <p>About changing the Referendum Act, Huang Kuo-chang said he had discussed it with Lo Chih-chiang, the KMT caucus's chief deputy secretary-general. Lo Chih-chiang's idea for a bill to link referendums with general elections would simply return things to how they were before 2019. He fully supports this. TPP members also think the "birdcage referendum" (a term for referendums that are hard to pass) should be made easier. Otherwise, if referendums are not held with elections, and then people complain about low voter turnout, it's like the DPP gets to decide everything.</p>
            <p>Also, Wu Yi-cheng, a former TPP candidate for Kaohsiung mayor, wrote on social media on August 23. He mentioned that Huang Kuo-chang questioned his daughter, who works at a TV station, by calling her question "stupid." Wu Yi-cheng tried to calm things down and hoped Huang Kuo-chang would show more wisdom and patience when talking for the TPP with the public.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that day he never attacked the reporter. He was attacking the silly question that the reporter said a netizen had asked. That's why he answered the reporter by saying, "What kind of stupid question is this?" He was saying the netizen's question was very silly. Wu Yi-cheng is a good politician. When Huang visited Kaohsiung, they talked happily. Huang said he would humbly accept advice from older politicians.</p>
            <p>As for netizens saying Huang Kuo-chang's US lawyer license "was canceled," Huang Kuo-chang said he is now a legislator in Taiwan. How could he pay the fees for the American Bar Association? He asked, "Isn't that a stupid question?" He passed the US bar exam in 1999, then continued his Ph.D. studies, came back to Taiwan to teach, worked at Academia Sinica, and is now a legislator. He asked, "What is the point of all this?"</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang also said he would not join in with the "perverted behavior" of illegally searching for personal information about his underage son. He said he has always said the same thing, and if people keep asking similar questions in the future, he will still say the same thing.</p>
