            <h1>OPEC+ Will Produce More Oil in September, 547,000 Barrels Each Day</h1>
            <p>Some members of OPEC+ (Oil Producing Countries and their friends) have agreed to make more oil. Because the world economy looks strong and there is not much oil stored, some people think this could make oil and gas prices go down.</p>
            <p>The group met online today and said that 8 of these countries will make 547,000 more barrels of oil every day in September.</p>
            <p>The countries that will make more oil are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman. These countries had planned to slowly stop reducing oil production by September 2026. This new announcement means they will stop reducing oil production sooner.</p>
            <p>OPEC+ decided in July to make 548,000 more barrels of oil each day in August. This is another step they are taking. OPEC said that depending on what happens in the market, they might stop or change how much oil they produce.</p>

            <h1>After Air Fight with Israel, Iran Starts New Defense Group</h1>
            <p>After a short air fight with Israel in June, Iran's main security group has said yes to creating a National Defence Council today. This is according to Iran's state media.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the fight with Israel in June was the hardest military challenge for Iran since its war against Iraq in the 1980s.</p>
            <p>State media reported, quoting the Supreme National Security Council's office: "This new defense group will check defense plans and make Iran's military stronger in a focused way."</p>
            <p>The group will have leaders from three government parts, high-ranking military commanders, and other related departments. President Masoud Pezeshkian will lead this group.</p>
            <p>Amir Hatami, the head of Iran's armed forces, warned today that the danger from Israel continues and should not be thought of as small.</p>
