            <h1>Chinese Student Questioned for 10 Hours at US Customs, Sent Back with 5-Year Ban</h1>
            <p>A Chinese student named Gu recently tried to enter the United States. He had a valid visa to study there. However, customs officers questioned him for 10 hours in three rounds. They focused on his connection with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). After this, he was sent back to China and cannot enter the U.S. for 5 years. This student planned to study philosophy, not sensitive subjects like AI. His deportation notice said he had "incomplete documents."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported yesterday that Mr. Gu, a 22-year-old philosophy student, flew for 29 hours to Texas. He was going to study at the University of Houston. He had all his papers and a full scholarship, so he thought everything would be fine.</p>
            <p>But at the airport, he was stopped and questioned. After being in the U.S. for only 36 hours, he was sent back to China. His dream of studying in America suddenly ended. Gu said, "I cannot live the life I hoped for."</p>
            <p>He is one of many Chinese students who were allowed to enter the U.S. but then sent back, or faced long questions upon arrival. We don't know the total number of these students. This has made Beijing very angry. It also shows the uncertainty caused by changes in Trump's policies.</p>
            <p>The Trump government first planned to cancel visas for Chinese students. But then, Mr. Trump himself quickly changed his mind. He said he would welcome hundreds of thousands of Chinese students to study in the U.S. This was partly to help some American schools stay open.</p>
            <p>Even so, some officials and lawmakers still worry about Chinese students. They are especially concerned about students studying advanced technology like quantum computing and artificial intelligence (AI). They also suspect these students might be connected to the Chinese government or military. Some lawmakers even want to stop all Chinese students from entering the country.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, there is no exact data on how many Chinese students with valid visas have been questioned or sent back at U.S. airports. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection has not yet responded with numbers or details about these events.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump recently said that he told Chinese President Xi Jinping, "We are honored to have their students here. Of course, we will check carefully to see who exactly (is coming to the U.S.)."</p>
            <p>The report states that the Chinese Embassy said it has received reports. More than ten Chinese students and scholars were questioned, bothered, and sent back when they entered the U.S.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy said in a statement that "the U.S. often carries out unfair, politically motivated checks on Chinese students and scholars. This causes them emotional and physical harm, financial losses, and stops their careers." The U.S. sends them back because of "visa problems" or "possible harm to U.S. national security."</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy also said that these students and scholars were taken to small rooms for long questioning. They were asked questions that were not related to their studies again and again. They had to wait for a long time in cold rooms without blankets. Some used aluminum foil to keep warm. Some were kept for more than 80 hours.</p>
            <p>Last week, Mr. Trump was interviewed by "The Daily Caller," a conservative news website. He said, "When you say you won't accept students from a certain country, that is a big insult to that country."</p>
            <p>"I think what we are doing is right. It is good, not bad, to get along with all countries, especially countries with nuclear weapons."</p>
            <p>Mr. Gu told the Associated Press that he really liked his time as an exchange student at Cornell University before. Because of this, he applied for a Master's degree in philosophy in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Even though there were reports that the Trump government was making student visa rules stricter, Gu said he was not very worried. He was not worried even when customs stopped him at Houston Airport and took him to a room for questioning.</p>
            <p>He said his personal belongings were searched, and his electronic devices were taken away. After the customs officers checked his electronic devices, they started questioning him. They mainly asked about his connection to the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
            <p>Like almost all Chinese young people, Gu was a member of the Communist Youth League of China. He said his parents are members of the Party, but he never joined it himself.</p>
            <p>Customs officers also questioned him about his relationship with the China Scholarship Council. This information appeared in his chat history. Gu said the name "China Scholarship Council" came up in his talks with classmates, but he did not receive money from the Chinese government.</p>
            <p>When Gu was told he would be sent back, he had been awake for almost 40 hours. The waiting room where he was kept had lights on for 24 hours, and the temperature was very low.</p>
            <p>Gu said, "I was shaking because I was so cold and nervous. Now that I am sent back, many thoughts are in my head. What will I do in the future?"</p>
            <p>Before he was put on a plane, he was held for another day. Gu is thinking about appealing this decision. However, this could take several years and cost thousands of U.S. dollars.</p>

            <h1>Technical University of Munich and TSMC to Open AI Chip Research Center</h1>
            <p>The government of Bavaria, Germany, announced today that it will work with TSMC. They will open an AI chip research and development center at the Technical University of Munich. The goal is to make Europe better at designing chips and to train German people for the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from Bavaria's Ministry of Economic Affairs, the AI chip R&D center will be called the "Munich Advanced High-Tech AI Chip Center" (MACHT-AI). It will be based at the Technical University of Munich. Professor Hussam Amrouch from the university will lead it.</p>
            <p>The AI chip R&D center will focus on making powerful, custom-made AI chips. It will also train students and researchers to understand processes like FinFET. TSMC will help with the technology.</p>
            <p>Thomas Hofmann, the president of the Technical University of Munich, said that Professor Amrouch is a key expert in hardware design at the university. The new center will improve the school's teaching and research in FinFET processes and AI hardware design. It will also start new chances for cooperation between the Technical University of Munich and TSMC.</p>
            <p>The Bavarian State Ministry of Science and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will both pay for the AI chip R&D center. The total cost is about 4.5 million Euros, which is about 160 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Markus Blume, Bavaria's Minister of Science, said, "Thanks to our cooperation with TSMC, we can train local people in the world's most advanced chip technology."</p>
            <p>Hubert Aiwanger, Bavaria's Minister of Economic Affairs, explained that Europe still needs more skilled people in AI chip design. The AI chip R&D center will help Germany get more semiconductor experts.</p>
            <p>In May this year, TSMC announced at the European Technology Forum that it would open a chip design center in Munich. This center will help European customers make powerful chips for cars, artificial intelligence, and industrial internet of things. It is expected to open in the third quarter of this year.</p>

            <h1>Brazil Fights US Tariffs, Plans to Work with BRICS Nations to Change WTO</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump is starting high tariffs again. Because of this, the Brazilian government is working hard to change the World Trade Organization (WTO). Brazil is also planning an online meeting for leaders of the BRICS countries in September. The goal is to agree on changes for the global trade system.</p>
            <p>CNN Brazil reported that Mauro Vieira, Brazil's Foreign Minister, recently spoke at the Federation of Industries of the State of SÃ£o Paulo (Fiesp). He said Brazil has started talks with countries like Mexico, India, and France, which are affected by U.S. tariffs. He also heard worries about the international trade system getting worse. He stressed that Brazil wants to make big changes to the WTO to make it more modern and flexible.</p>
            <p>Since 2019, the U.S. has stopped the appointment of judges to the WTO's appeals body. This has made the system for solving trade problems stop working. This problem has continued through both Trump's and Biden's governments. Brazil believes that this problem makes it harder for weaker countries to deal with trade pressure. It also hurts fair and stable global trade.</p>
            <p>Brazil's President, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, is working to gather BRICS leaders for an online meeting. He plans to invite Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. New members like Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran will also be invited.</p>
            <p>The BRICS countries did not directly criticize the U.S. However, at their meeting in Rio in July, they clearly spoke against "one-sided protectionist actions." This shows that the group is not happy with the current trade system.</p>
            <p>Recently, President Lula also spoke with Xi Jinping, Narendra Modi, Vladimir Putin, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. They talked about working together and making trade partnerships bigger.</p>
            <p>Also, Brazil announced that it will start talks again about a free trade agreement with Canada. Geraldo Alckmin, the Vice President and Minister of Industry, Trade, and Services Development, also went to Mexico and India. He wanted to make economic cooperation between these countries stronger.</p>
            <p>Vieira pointed out that the U.S. tariffs are related to legal actions against former President Jair Bolsonaro and his team. They are suspected of trying to harm democratic systems. Vieira called these tariffs "political actions." He emphasized that Brazil will not accept any talks that involve legal interference. Brazil will stick to its principles of independence and law.</p>
