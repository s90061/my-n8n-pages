            <h1>Groundbreaking for Chiayi County and City Railway Elevated Extension, Expected to Open in 2031</h1>
            <p>This morning, a special ceremony was held to start the temporary track part of the Chiayi County and City Railway Elevation Extension Project. Important people like the Minister of Transportation, Mr. Chen Shih-kai, and the Chiayi County Magistrate, Mr. Weng Chang-liang, were there. They wished for the project to go well and finish soon. The Railway Bureau said that the elevated railway is expected to open in the year 2031.</p>
            <p>During his speech at the ceremony, Minister Chen Shih-kai said that Chiayi is changing, and its transportation system must change too. He said that starting the temporary track part of the project today means that the whole plan is now in the actual building phase. This also shows that the government is serious about improving transportation in Chiayi County and City, and they are taking real steps to make it happen.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Shih-kai explained that in the future, many different construction jobs, track work, and electrical system projects will begin one after another. He hopes that the Railway Bureau, the building teams, and the county government teams will work together with everyone in society to make the project go smoothly. This will help Chiayi move into a new time for transportation.</p>
            <p>The Director of the Railway Bureau, Mr. Yang Cheng-chun, thanked the Chiayi County Government for their great help in moving this project forward. He believes that once the Minxiong railway is elevated, it will really help the city grow. It will also fix traffic problems caused by the railway blocking paths. This will help the Chiayi County Government achieve its goal of "brave transformation and Chiayi innovation."</p>
            <p>Mr. Weng Chang-liang hopes that the Chiayi County and City Railway Elevation Extension Project will not only connect different parts of the city that were separated by the railway. He also hopes that the new Minxiong station will have a small-town style. He also expects that the shopping street under the railway, which will connect to Minxiong's famous goose meat street, will greatly help to refresh and bring life back to the whole city.</p>
            <p>The Railway Bureau pointed out that the government approved this project in May 2023. Besides connecting the areas on both sides of the railway and helping the city grow evenly, it will also get rid of 5 railway crossings in Chiayi County. This will improve traffic problems caused by these crossings. The project will cost 17.348 billion New Taiwan dollars. The work will start north of the Dingliao Road crossing and go south to the north end of the Jiabei elevated station. It will be about 8.92 kilometers long. The current Minxiong station will also be changed into an elevated station. The elevated railway is expected to open in the year 2031.</p>
