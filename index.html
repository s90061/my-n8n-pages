            <h1>Landowner in Meinong "Grand Canyon" Case, Former Assistant to Kaohsiung City Councilor, Shi Lijun, Detained for Questioning Overnight</h1>
            <p>Shi Lijun, a former assistant to independent Kaohsiung City Councilor Chu Hsin-chiang, is suspected of breaking environmental protection laws. Today, police searched and arrested Shi, her husband, Mr. Wu, and a tenant, Mr. Wang. The Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office stated that the three individuals are currently being questioned by prosecutors overnight.</p>
            <p>Recently, KMT Legislator Ko Chih-en visited the site of the Meinong "Grand Canyon" case. Shi Lijun, former assistant to independent Kaohsiung City Councilor Chu Hsin-chiang, was one of the people there. Later, the Kaohsiung City Government confirmed that Shi was the landowner of the illegal mining pit, which was already on their watch list. She is suspected of breaking the Waste Disposal Act and was fined NT$3 million.</p>
            <p>The city government explained at that time that Shi was involved in a new type of illegal sand and gravel mining. After she bought the land, illegal mining and dumping started happening unusually quickly. The city government had already collected information about this and sent all the evidence of illegal activity to the Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office for investigation.</p>
            <p>Today, the police searched and arrested Shi, her husband Mr. Wu, and the tenant Mr. Wang. The decision on whether to take further legal action will be made after the prosecutors finish questioning them.</p>
            <p>The whole case involves an illegal mining pit in the Xijiyang section of Meinong District. Last month, the city government and investigators worked together to stop these illegal activities. They sent the case for investigation under the Waste Disposal Act, and the person responsible has already been held. On September 11, the city government added more fines totaling NT$11.3 million, based on the Waste Disposal Act, the Soil and Rock Exploitation Act, and the Regional Plan Act. This means the total fines for this case are now NT$14.3 million.</p>
