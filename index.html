The Taipei Department of Information and Tourism announced today that Taipei Broadcasting Station will hold a "Love Taipei Summer Concert" on July 19th. This event celebrates the station's 64th anniversary and also honors 50 years of Taiwan's folk song movement. The concert will take place at Zhongxing Hall in National Taiwan Normal University Affiliated Senior High School, with two shows. People can get free tickets starting June 30th.

There will be two concert times: 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM and 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM. You can get there by taking the MRT to Daan Station, Exit 2.

Tickets can be obtained in two ways starting June 30th at 9:30 AM. Each person can get up to two tickets for one show only. For physical tickets, check the Taipei Broadcasting Station website or Facebook page for pickup locations. For e-tickets, you can get them through the KKTIX platform, but you need to be a member first.

Many famous singers will perform popular folk songs, including "July Liangshan," "Kapok Road," and "Love the Country More Than Beauty." Students from the Affiliated High School's guitar club will also sing "Grandma's Penghu Bay" with Li Mingde, connecting different generations through music.

Hu Shao-chien, the director of Taipei Broadcasting Station, said that for 64 years, the station has not only recorded the sounds of Taipei but also been a part of citizens' lives. He hopes this concert will use familiar melodies to continue the strong connection between the city and its people.

If you cannot attend the concert in person, the Taipei Broadcasting Station 931 YouTube channel will broadcast it live.

**Lin Tzu-han and Partner Score 71 on Day 3 of LPGA Dow Championship**

On the third day of the LPGA Dow Championship, Taiwan's Lin Tzu-han and her English partner Jodi Ewart Shadoff scored 71. They are now tied for 16th place with a total of 203 strokes, which is 7 strokes under the standard.

The LPGA Dow Championship started in 2019 and is a team golf event. The first and third rounds use a "four-ball" format, and the second and fourth rounds use a "foursome" format. The total prize money is 3.3 million US dollars.

This year's event is in Michigan, USA. Three Taiwanese pairs started, but only Lin Tzu-han and Jodi Ewart Shadoff made it past the first two rounds.

On the third day, their performance was not as good as the first day. They made two birdies and no mistakes in the first nine holes. However, after that, they made mistakes on holes 10, 11, and 17, scoring a bogey on each. They finished with 71 strokes, which was worse than their 67 strokes in the first round.

Lin Tzu-han, 25, is a new player in the LPGA this year. Before this tournament, she played in five events but only finished one, tying for 70th place. The Dow Championship is her second tournament this year where she has made it to the final rounds.

**Taipei Man Curses and Hits Police During Drug Check; Two Suspects Under Investigation**

Early today, police in Taipei's Zhongshan District saw three men acting suspiciously. When police went to check them, a bag with suspected drugs fell from one man's pocket. Another man, Pan (30), cursed at the police officer. Then, Zhuang (32) hit the officer, causing an injury. Both men are now being investigated by law.

Police officers were on patrol around 3 AM and noticed three suspicious men at a parking lot on Linsen North Road. During the check, a bag, possibly containing drugs, fell from Zhuang's left pants pocket.

The other two men with Zhuang were rude when the police asked them questions. Pan kept using bad words to curse the officer. When the police tried to control Pan, Zhuang also continued to curse and then hit the police officer, injuring him.

Police immediately arrested Zhuang for obstructing official duties. The bag that fell was tested and found to contain ketamine, a Class 3 drug. Zhuang is being investigated for drug-related crimes and obstructing official duties. Pan is being sent for punishment under the Social Order Maintenance Act.
