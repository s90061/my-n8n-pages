            <h1>Taiwan Water Company Works with Businesses for Custom Water Supply, Aims to Start by Year-End to Make More Money</h1>
            <p>To earn money besides water fees, Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) will work with water filter companies. They will offer "custom water supply services" using the "TWC Select" brand. This means they will provide water systems that meet the needs of different users, such as homes, restaurant chains, and tech factories. They are starting to choose partner companies soon and hope to begin this service by the end of the year. TWC also hopes this will help more Taiwanese water filter companies grow.</p>
            <p>In the future, if customers in Taiwan need custom water services, they can contact TWC. TWC will send staff to test the water, give advice, and then install the water filter equipment. Usually, there will be a one-time fee. TWC will also provide a water quality report from a professional organization and check the water regularly.</p>
            <p>Water prices in Taiwan have not changed for 31 years. TWC loses more than 2 New Taiwan Dollars for every cubic meter of water it sells. Changing water prices affects people's daily lives, so the Ministry of Economic Affairs has told TWC to first look for ways to save money or offer new services to earn more. For example, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, suggested at the beginning of the year to charge different prices based on water quality.</p>
            <p>It is known that TWC has started planning a "custom water supply service." They will work with companies that provide water filtering equipment for homes or businesses. They will use the "TWC Select" brand to offer water quality tailored to users' needs. Target customers include general households, restaurant chains, food processing companies, semiconductor factories, medical facilities, construction companies, and other chain restaurants.</p>
            <p>People involved in the plan said that the water TWC provides already meets standards for drinking water. Taiwan's water quality standards are even better than those of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, some users need special water quality. For example, some people think the water is too hard, so they can add a filter to reduce hardness. Also, advanced factories in the technology sector need very high-quality water. These are all possible customers.</p>
            <p>TWC will soon choose one or two companies publicly. For dividing the work, TWC will be in charge of checking filter materials, water quality standards, and technical approval. The partner companies will develop and install equipment, give custom advice, and provide after-sales service. TWC will get money from technical service fees. It is estimated to earn about 30 million to 50 million New Taiwan Dollars over six years.</p>
            <p>People in the industry said that smaller companies also hope to work with a government-owned company like TWC to get more recognition and save on marketing costs. This would help them win bids in other countries. TWC also wants to help more companies compete in the international market.</p>
            <p>An expert in the industry said that about 40% of homes in Taiwan have water purifiers. This means nearly 60% of homes do not. TWC offering this service is good because TWC has its own equipment and skills to test water quality. This can ensure the water is better after a purifier is installed. Otherwise, it is hard for regular families to know if their water quality has really improved after installing a purifier themselves.</p>
            <p>An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the "custom water supply service" is what TWC thinks is most workable. TWC had looked at other ideas before, but they all had problems. For example, deep-sea water needs a lot of money to start, and small-molecule water has legal limits.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Water Company Continues to Lose Money in First Half of Year; Over 70 Billion NTD for Leak Reduction Plan Adds Financial Pressure</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) has been borrowing money for water projects. The money they pay in interest and for equipment wearing out has made their losses bigger each year. This year, they expect to lose another 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars. According to TWC's financial report, they have already lost about 2.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the first six months of this year. Plus, they need to pay for more than 70 billion New Taiwan Dollars themselves for a plan to reduce water leaks. This adds more money problems for the company.</p>
            <p>TWC continues to work on many water projects. They have now borrowed over 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars. They pay a lot of money in interest each year. They have lost money for two years in a row, and the amount of loss keeps growing. This year, they expect to lose around 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars. As of June this year, they had lost 2.432 billion New Taiwan Dollars before tax, and their debt-to-asset ratio was 47.71%.</p>
            <p>As the business environment gets harder, TWC will start an 8-year plan this year to lower the water leakage rate. This plan will cost a total of 80.77 billion New Taiwan Dollars. For the first four years, the government will provide 2 billion New Taiwan Dollars each year, totaling 8 billion New Taiwan Dollars. TWC will need to find the remaining 72.774 billion New Taiwan Dollars itself. The new equipment they buy will also lose value over time, adding to costs. As the average interest rate for borrowing money goes up, their operating costs will also rise, which clearly means more financial pressure.</p>
            <p>The 8-year plan to reduce leaks will use smart ways to manage and fix water leaks. They will use big data to find areas where leaks are common, check for leaks, and replace pipes. They will also focus on keeping the pipe system in good condition. After the plan is finished, the leakage rate should drop from 11.99% at the end of 2024 to 9.77% at the end of 2032. This means they can save about 59.1 million cubic meters of water each year, which is about 1.17 times the water capacity of Hushan Reservoir.</p>
            <p>Besides the task of reducing leaks, TWC recently looked at how to make their response better after Typhoon Danas caused water outages. One important task is to create a clear plan for pumping stations that do not have their own power generators. They have also set up plans for areas that are likely to have geological problems. Specific actions include moving portable power generators to these areas and renting generators based on agreements with companies. This is to make sure the power supply does not stop. For some pumping stations on the side of the road, where there is not much space, water trucks and water collection buckets will be used instead.</p>
            <p>Also, TWC will ask Taipower to restore electricity first to important locations to reduce the impact on people's water supply. TWC is also planning to learn from Taipower's experience in managing disasters and directing resources, as instructed by Deputy Minister Lai Chien-hsin of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They want to use good methods to make TWC's disaster response much better.</p>
