            <h1>Physical Therapy Association Turns 50, President Lai Asks for 3 Important Things</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Physical Therapy Association held its 50th anniversary party today. President Lai Ching-te attended, saying it felt like "coming home." He asked the group to help with three important tasks. These tasks are to make Taiwanese people healthier by 10%, to join in long-term care, and to be part of the new Ministry of Sports.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Physical Therapy Association started its 50th-year events today. More than 300 experts, teachers, and workers from the UK, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong came. They talked about how physical therapy is changing around the world and what will happen in the future.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, who studied rehabilitation medicine at National Taiwan University, also came to the party. He first thanked Wang Zi-juan, the head of the Physical Therapy Association. He thanked her for her hard work on changing the law for physical therapists. He said she worked like "Ah-Hsin," treating the Parliament like her home. If she had not visited different political groups often, it would not have gotten support from all sides. It would have been hard for only the Democratic Progressive Party to pass it.</p>
            <p>President Lai said that he used to be a physical therapist. He often thinks, "Once a physical therapist, always a physical therapist." He feels it is his duty to make laws better so physical therapists can help people more and grow. This is a goal they all share.</p>
            <p>The President said that after the law was changed, there are still a few things they need help with. First, after he started his job, he created the Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee in the President's Office. He hopes this will make Taiwanese people healthy, the country stronger, and the world welcome Taiwan.</p>
            <p>President Lai explained that Taiwanese people live 80.77 years on average. But they are unhealthy for more than 8 years. This means about 10% of their average life is unhealthy. They might be sick in bed, use a wheelchair, or need help with daily life. The Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee wants to change this. They need help from everyone, especially physical therapists, to reach this goal together.</p>
            <p>President Lai said the second task is that Taiwan is becoming a very old society. So, physical therapists and occupational therapists are even more needed to help old people stay healthy. When the government works on long-term care, he hopes everyone will give strong support.</p>
            <p>Finally, he talked about the Ministry of Sports, which will officially start on September 9. It needs many people and different kinds of skills. Physical therapists are very important. Taiwan's sports teams have been doing very well recently. Every time he welcomes sports heroes who win glory for the country at the President's Office, he sees physical therapists in their support teams. This shows how much they help athletes. When the Ministry of Sports is set up, it will work to improve sports for everyone, support competitive sports, and grow the sports industry. All these things need physical therapists to join in.</p>
            <p>Zheng Su-fang, the Vice President of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, said that President Lai is a very good alumnus of the physical therapy department. This is the first time in the world for this to happen. In his political career, he has always strongly supported the growth of physical therapy in many ways. This includes the recent change in the physical therapist law, which lets people go directly to a physical therapist even if they are not sick. She said the President protects the country, and everyone should continue to be his best support.</p>

            <h1>Yi Huiman is Being Investigated, China's Securities Regulator Supports the Investigation and Fighting Corruption</h1>
            <p>After China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced today that Yi Huiman, the former head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), is being investigated, the CSRC Party Committee quickly held a meeting. They said they strongly support the decision by the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the National Supervisory Commission to investigate Yi Huiman. They also said the CSRC Party Committee must "learn deeply from this lesson, use this case as a warning, and always remember it." They will work hard to remove the reasons and conditions that allow corruption to grow.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that Wu Qing, the Party Secretary and Chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, led this meeting. During the meeting, they shared the decision from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission to investigate Yi Huiman for "serious rule-breaking and illegal actions." Everyone at the meeting agreed to strongly support this decision by the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the National Supervisory Commission.</p>
            <p>The meeting mentioned that the decision by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission to investigate Yi Huiman clearly shows the strong will and firm decision of "the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core" to always push forward with "strict governance of the Party." It also clearly shows the Party's constant stance of fighting corruption with "no forbidden areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance." This sends a clear message that they will "not stop for a moment, not step back even half a step, and will fight corruption to the very end."</p>
            <p>This meeting said that the CSRC Party Committee must "learn deeply from this lesson, use this case as a warning, and always remember it." They need to further improve their "political judgment, political understanding, and political execution." They also need to willingly accept supervision from the disciplinary inspection team at the CSRC and other groups. They must always stay calm and keep strong pressure on corruption. They are determined to fight corruption, win battles, continue for a long time, and fight it completely.</p>
            <p>The meeting stated that leading officials must set an example. They must constantly "improve their Party loyalty" and build a "correct view of power." They must strongly work on improving their behavior. They need to make the system for supervising and controlling public power better in every way. They will deeply investigate and deal with corruption and bad behavior together. They will also improve good ways and tools to stop new kinds of corruption and hidden corruption. They will work very hard to get rid of the reasons and conditions that make corruption grow.</p>
            <p>This meeting stressed that they must keep strengthening what they learned from the special education about strictly following the "eight-point regulations" of the Central Committee. They will make sure that fixing problems found in central inspections becomes a normal, long-term process. They must truly keep the "strict approach, strict actions, and strict atmosphere" for a long time.</p>
            <p>The meeting asked everyone to strongly follow the important decisions made by the Party Central Committee about the capital market. They need to strengthen supervision by law, effectively stop risks, and strongly push for "high-quality development" of the capital market. This will help the economy keep getting better and serve the bigger plan of "Chinese-style modernization."</p>

            <h1>AKIRA Misses Tainan Food the Most, Says His Danzai Noodles are "Top Quality"</h1>
            <p>AKIRA, who is married to model Lin Chi-ling and is a Japanese actor, will perform in the "Tidal Taipei" event at the Taipei Arena tomorrow, September 7, 2025. He said in an interview today, September 6, that he misses Tainan food very much. He also proudly stated that his homemade Danzai noodles are "top quality" and delicious.</p>
            <p>AKIRA arrived at Songshan Airport around noon today. About a hundred fans were there to greet him. Some people held signs to welcome him.</p>
            <p>AKIRA spoke in the afternoon and said that this year he spent Qixi (Chinese Valentine's Day) with his wife Lin Chi-ling and their son at a festival near their home. He also said he usually makes sure to spend time with his family. "Instead of just handmade gifts, I like to add some special decorations to make them meaningful when I prepare them for someone."</p>
            <p>AKIRA travels between Taiwan and Japan often. He said he has been missing Tainan snacks a lot recently. He can also tell that the flavors in Tainan food are different from Taipei food. What he misses most is Danzai noodles. "I also cook them at home. My Danzai noodles are probably 'top quality' good."</p>
            <p>Also, the movie "Demon Slayer: To the Hashira Training Arc" is showing now. People online have said that if you have parents like AKIRA and Lin Chi-ling, you would have a child like Tanjiro, the main character. AKIRA laughed and said that this puts a bit of pressure on him because Tanjiro is a very famous character. He felt a little shy that people said this. He added, "A child is a child. I won't limit him. But when he grows up, I will tell him about this, 'You might become like this when you grow up.'"</p>
            <p>AKIRA will lead his junior groups, PSYCHIC FEVER and BALLISTIK BOYZ, to perform together at the "Tidal Taipei" event at the Taipei Arena tomorrow evening.</p>
