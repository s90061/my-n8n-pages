            <h1>Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks May Restart on July 23; Zelensky Hopes for Leader Meeting</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky said he has suggested new peace talks with Russia in Turkey. He hopes this will prepare for a future meeting between the two countries' leaders. Ukrainian news reports, quoting people close to the situation, say the talks might start as early as July 23rd or 24th in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
            <p>Today, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram that Rustem Umerov, who leads the National Security and Defense Council, has offered to meet with Russia. The talks will focus on exchanging prisoners of war, returning Ukrainian children taken by force to Russia, and getting ready for talks between the two presidents.</p>
            <p>Zelensky said, "We all know that real, useful talks can only happen at the highest level, with leaders." But he did not give more details about the talks.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian newspaper "Ukrainska Pravda" quoted a report from the Turkish version of the British newspaper "The Independent." It said that people involved in diplomacy shared that representatives from Russia and Ukraine might meet this week in Istanbul. The specific dates are expected to be July 23rd and 24th. Similar news has also been reported in Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish media.</p>
            <p>Zelensky also said that they are getting ready for at least one exchange of prisoners with Russia.</p>
            <p>Today, Dmitry Peskov, who speaks for the Russian president, replied that they are talking with Ukraine to set a date for the third round of peace talks.</p>
            <p>Recently, US President Donald Trump asked Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine within 50 days. If not, the US would place "secondary sanctions" on countries that trade with Russia.</p>
            <p>However, yesterday Peskov had already said that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to talk about peace. But for Moscow, reaching Russia's goals is still the most important thing.</p>
            <p>In a document from earlier talks, Russia repeated its demand for Ukrainian soldiers to leave all four regions: Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Russia's position remains strong.</p>
            <p>Representatives from Ukraine and Russia had two rounds of talks in Istanbul on May 16th and June 2nd. They did not agree on a ceasefire. But both sides agreed to keep working together on exchanging prisoners and dead bodies. They have already agreed to release more than 2,000 prisoners and exchange about 6,000 bodies.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: Chris Paul Agrees to Sign, Returns to Former Team Clippers for 21st NBA Season</h1>
            <p>Today, the American sports channel ESPN reported that Chris Paul, a famous point guard in the NBA, has agreed to sign with his old team, the Los Angeles Clippers. He will play his 21st NBA season, and many people think this will be his last year playing.</p>
            <p>According to ESPN, many teams wanted Paul to join them. But Paul, who is 40 years old, finally chose the Clippers, a team he knows well.</p>
            <p>Paul has been chosen for the NBA All-Star Game 12 times in his career. From 2011 to 2017, he played for the Clippers for six seasons. During that time, he played in the All-Star Game five times.</p>
            <p>When Paul was with the Clippers, he played with teammates like Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. They were called "Lob City" because they often did exciting "alley-oop" dunks.</p>
            <p>Paul was chosen by the New Orleans Hornets (now the New Orleans Pelicans) in 2005 as the 4th pick in the first round. That season, he won the NBA Rookie of the Year award. In his career, he has made 12,499 assists and 2,717 steals. Both of these numbers are the second highest in NBA history.</p>
            <p>Last season, he played for the San Antonio Spurs. He played all 82 regular season games. This made him the first player in his 20th season to play every single game.</p>
