            <h1>Legislative Committee Reviews Bill: Parking Lots Breaking EV Charging Rules Can Be Fined Up to NT$90,000</h1>
            <p>Today, the Transport Committee of Taiwan's Parliament approved a new rule for parking lots. It says that if a public parking lot does not follow the rules for electric car charging spots and equipment, and they do not fix it after being told to, the person in charge can be fined up to 90,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>To make it easier for electric cars, the current Parking Lot Act says that public parking lots must have special spots and chargers for electric cars. The government has rules for how many spots there should be and how good the chargers must be. But before, there was no punishment if public parking lots did not follow these rules.</p>
            <p>Today, the Transport Committee of Taiwan's Parliament approved a change to the Parking Lot Act. It says that if a public parking lot does not follow the rules for electric car charging, and they do not fix it even after being asked, the person in charge can be fined from 9,000 to 90,000 New Taiwan Dollars. They will also be told to fix it again.</p>
            <p>The new rule also says that if they still do not fix the problem by the new deadline, they can be fined again and again. If needed, their business can be closed for up to 30 days.</p>
            <p>Also, the Transport Committee approved a change to the Road Act today. This is because recently, there have been many accidents with public buses. The people hurt in these accidents could not get money for their injuries because the bus companies did not have insurance for other people (third-party liability insurance). Sometimes, the driver who caused the accident had to pay a lot of money, which was a big problem for them and for society.</p>
            <p>The new rule says that all bus companies (for long trips, city trips, and tours) and taxi companies must now buy insurance for other people, not just for their passengers. The Ministry of Transport will decide the lowest amount of this insurance. If these companies do not buy the right insurance, bus companies will be fined from 100,000 to 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars. Taxi companies will be fined from 3,000 to 30,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Also, the new rule states that when companies put pipes under roads or fix manholes, they must make sure the road surface is flat again afterwards. The road must be level with the parts around it. If you check with a 3-meter ruler, the difference in height should not be more than 0.6 centimeters up or down. The Ministry of Transport will also set rules for how slippery the road can be.</p>
            <p>The rule says that if these companies do not fix the road within a certain time, they will be fined from 30,000 to 150,000 New Taiwan Dollars. They will also be given a new time limit to fix it. If they still do not fix it, they will be fined again and again.</p>

            <p>Hsieh Ming-chun is only 19 years old. He helped his high school team, Guangfu High School, win two basketball championships in a row. After that, he went to the US to study and play basketball differently. While there, he was even on a list for a big high school all-star game in the US. Later, he joined the TPBL (Taiwan Professional Basketball League) draft. The Gothawks team picked him as the fourth player in the first round. This way, he made his dream of becoming a professional basketball player come true.</p>
            <p>Today, Hsieh Ming-chun officially signed a contract with the Gothawks. He chose to keep wearing the number 15 jersey, which he wore in high school. He said through the team that he wants to learn more about American basketball from his teammate Samuel Manu. He also wants to get better and better. His goals are to play defense against Jeremy Lin and help the team win first place.</p>
            <p>Also, Wei Peng-he, a guard picked by the Gothawks in the second round, signed his contract today. He said his goals are to win the championship, be the best new player, and play well all the time. He is excited to play against his brother, Wei Liang-zhe, who plays for the Kaohsiung Family Seahawks. Wei Peng-he smiled and said that when he was picked, his brother told him to enjoy it. "But when we play against each other, I won't let him enjoy it as much," he said.</p>

            <h1>Lien Chen-hsiang Gained 21 Kilograms, Met Liu Pin-yen While Filming</h1>
            <p>Actors Liu Pin-yen and Lien Chen-hsiang met while making a TV show called "San Francisco Beauty Salon." Lien Chen-hsiang gained 21 kilograms for his part. He joked that he did not look good or have a good body, but he put all his effort into the role. Liu Pin-yen's character in the show was in debt and worked hard to earn money. Both characters start a journey to change their lives for the better.</p>
            <p>"San Francisco Beauty Salon" takes place in places common in Taiwan, like breakfast shops and beauty salons. It shows how people from different generations struggle and make choices about family, dreams, and real life. The show carefully explores how people can change their lives.</p>
            <p>Producer Dai Tian-yi and director Du Cheng-che made this show together. Many actors are in it, like Liu Pin-yen, Lien Chen-hsiang, Chang Kuang-chen, Fang Chih-yu, Yang Ming-wei, Yang Ching, Chien Chang, and Chen Hsiao-hsuan. They all play parts in this family story, which has family love, romantic love, and exciting moments.</p>
            <p>This show is special because Lien Chen-hsiang and Liu Pin-yen started their relationship while making it. This year, they told everyone they got married and are going to have a baby. In the show, Lien Chen-hsiang plays a character who lost his job and stays home. He gained 21 kilograms for this role. He said it was the most difficult project for him. He hopes that through this show, people will see a different Lien Chen-hsiang, one who does not care about looking good but only about acting his part fully.</p>
            <p>Liu Pin-yen's character in the show is in debt and works hard to make money to live. She said she is very excited for people to see the show. She also joked, "because that is how I looked before I was pregnant, when I was most beautiful."</p>
