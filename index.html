            <h1>Five Major Banks' August Credit Card Spending Announced, CTBC Bank is Number One with NT$66.9 Billion</h1>
            <p>In August, the total amount spent on credit cards from the top five banks reached NT$266.231 billion. This is a 4.19% increase compared to last year. This increase was due to many people traveling for summer holidays, eating out, and shopping. CTBC Bank had the most spending, with NT$66.95 billion. Also, they worked with Uni-President to release a new credit card. This helped them issue many new cards, 225,000 in August. So, CTBC Bank was first in both spending and new cards issued.</p>
            <p>CTBC Bank's spending in August was NT$66.95 billion, which is a 10% increase from last year. CTBC Bank said that in August, people spent more on overseas travel, holidays, food, and transport. These types of spending made up more than half of their total spending in August. From January to August this year, their total spending was NT$580 billion, an 8% increase from last year.</p>
            <p>Cathay United Bank's spending in August was NT$65.056 billion, an 8% increase from last year. This was because more people traveled, ate out, and shopped during the summer holiday. From January to August, their total spending was about NT$553.9 billion, a double-digit increase from last year.</p>
            <p>E.SUN Bank's spending in August was NT$47.848 billion, a 4.7% increase from last year. This was the highest amount for this month in previous years. The growth came from payments using apps, spending abroad, travel, and online shopping. All these areas grew by more than 10%.</p>
            <p>Taipei Fubon Bank's spending in August was NT$47.356 billion, a small decrease of 0.9% from last year. Taipei Fubon Bank said that the main reasons for spending growth in August were overseas spending and large supermarkets. These two types of spending made up nearly 40% of the total. As autumn comes, Taipei Fubon Bank will continue to focus on travel spending. They will also join with department store anniversaries and online shopping events like Double 11 to get more spending in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Taishin Bank's spending in August was NT$39.022 billion, a 5% decrease from last year. However, if you add the income tax payments made by credit card from June to August this year, their spending actually increased by 3% from last year. Looking to the future, Taishin Bank said that as department store anniversary sales start, and long holidays begin in October, they expect more spending on department store food and overseas travel.</p>
            <p>Regarding the number of new cards issued, CTBC Bank issued many cards in August, reaching 225,000. E.SUN Bank was second with 133,000 cards. Cathay United Bank was third with 43,000 cards, Taishin Bank was fourth with 38,700 cards, and Taipei Fubon Bank was fifth with 38,600 cards.</p>
            <p>In August, CTBC Bank announced a big partnership with Uni-President Group. They launched the CTBC Uni-Open co-branded card. This card can be used at 30 brands under the Uni-President Group. This helped increase the number of new cards issued. CTBC Bank expects to reach a goal of 1 million cards in the first year.</p>

            <h1>Shou Jun-Shuo Will Be a Dad, He Vomited at Home; His Wife Jiao Fan-Fan Says He Was Too Nervous</h1>
            <p>Singer Shou Jun-Shuo announced at his concert in Taichung last night that he will become a father. After the concert, he said in an interview that his wife, Jiao Fan-Fan, had thought she was pregnant two times before, but it wasn't real. So this time, he wanted to stay calm. Jiao Fan-Fan laughed and said that after Shou Jun-Shuo found out he was definitely going to be a dad, he was so nervous that he vomited when he got home.</p>
            <p>Shou Jun-Shuo said he doesn't know the baby's gender yet. But he said the gender doesn't matter, as long as the baby is healthy. They had planned to try seriously for a baby at the end of the year. But the good news came sooner than they thought. Now, he tries his best to make sure Jiao Fan-Fan doesn't feel stressed. He added, "Seeing her vomit also makes me feel sad for her."</p>
            <p>Shou Jun-Shuo mentioned that because Jiao Fan-Fan had thought she was pregnant twice before, when they first found out about the good news this time, he kept telling himself to stay calm. He said, "When we got to the hospital, the doctor said the dad could come in to see the ultrasound. That's when I really knew it was true." Shou Jun-Shuo remembered that when he first heard the baby's heartbeat, he joked with the doctor, "Is he too nervous?"</p>
            <p>Jiao Fan-Fan said that after they knew she was pregnant, they went to eat sukiyaki to celebrate. But then, Shou Jun-Shuo started vomiting when he got home. Shou Jun-Shuo said it was probably food poisoning. But Jiao Fan-Fan joked that he was throwing up because he was nervous about becoming a dad.</p>

            <h1>Thai Baht is Stronger by Over 7%, Causing Concerns; Thai Prime Minister Says It Must Be Fixed Now</h1>
            <p>The Thai Baht has become more valuable against the US dollar by over 7% this year. This has made some business owners who trade goods worried. Today, Thai Prime Minister Anutin said that the strong Thai Baht needs to be fixed right away, and they will talk about it soon. Also, some news sources said that Thailand might tax gold trading to stop the Baht from getting even stronger.</p>
            <p>The Thai Baht has gained over 7% in value this year. It is now the second-best performing currency in Asia, after the New Taiwan Dollar. Companies like rice traders are worried about the strong Baht. They are asking the government to do something about the exchange rate problem.</p>
            <p>Charoen Laothammatas, who is the head of the Thai Rice Exporters Association, asked the government and the Bank of Thailand before to make the Baht's value stable. This is to protect how well Thai rice can compete with other countries and to protect farmers' earnings.</p>
            <p>The "Bangkok Post" newspaper reported today that Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the strong Thai Baht must be fixed immediately. He also said they would discuss this later today.</p>
            <p>The Federation of Thai Industries (FTI) believes that an exchange rate of 34 to 35 Thai Baht for 1 US dollar is better for Thailand's economy.</p>
            <p>The "Bangkok Post" also noted that a government planning group thinks Thailand's economy will grow by 1.8% to 2.3% this year. However, because of US taxes, economic growth in the second half of this year is expected to slow down a lot. Last year, Thailand's economy grew by 2.5%, which was less than other countries.</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Post mentioned reports from financial news that the Thai government is thinking about taxing gold trading. This is to stop the Thai Baht from getting stronger, as a strong Baht is harming exports and tourism.</p>
            <p>These reports quoted people who know the situation. They said that the Bank of Thailand and the Ministry of Finance are talking about taxing gold that is bought and sold online using Thai Baht.</p>
            <p>The people who know said that the government wants to use this tax to reduce gold exports. They also want to make it more expensive for Thai people to own gold. They also pointed out that when dollars come into the country because of gold exports, it is one reason why the Thai Baht gets stronger.</p>
