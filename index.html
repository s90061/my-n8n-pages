            <h1>Lithuania's Suicide Rate is Back Up, Highest in EU; Older People are Most at Risk</h1>
            <p>A new report from Lithuania's Hygiene Institute shows that the country's suicide rate has gone up a little in the last two years. This happened after many years of it going down. The rate is still the highest in the European Union, almost twice the average for EU countries. In both 2023 and 2024, there were 19.6 suicides for every 100,000 people. Most of these were older people.</p>
            <p>Lithuanian National Radio (LRT) reported that last year, 566 people died by suicide. This is more than 562 in the year before and 527 in 2022. Lithuania has about 2.89 million people.</p>
            <p>Paulius Skruibis, who leads the Vilnius Universityâ€™s Suicidology Research Centre, said that suicide rates for all age groups have generally gone down recently. However, for people over 65, the rate has gone down the least. This age group now has the highest percentage of suicides.</p>
            <p>To help older people, a volunteer group in Lithuania called "Silver Line" talks to about 8,000 older people on the phone. They offer friendship and emotional support. Ieva ÄŒerbulÄ—nienÄ—, a coordinator, said that many older people just want to talk to someone. This is because most of them live alone, cannot move easily, or have lost family and friends.</p>
            <p>She said that more than half of older people have felt lonely. If they lose their job because of age, get sick, or lose a loved one, they often feel sad and helpless. Many older people choose to suffer in silence, which can lead to thoughts of suicide.</p>
            <p>Jekaterina Rojaka, who chairs the Lithuanian Parliament's Committee on Suicide and Violence Prevention, said that money problems, being poor, not having a job, and losing family members are big reasons for suicide among retired people.</p>
            <p>Tomas Baranovas, who works as the acting head of the Lithuanian Emotional Support Services Association, said that his group gets about 18 calls each day about suicide risk. They also get 13 online messages. Older people like to call for help, while young people often use the internet to send messages.</p>
            <p>He said that more people asking for help might mean that people are less ashamed to seek mental health support.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the Lithuanian Ministry of Health has made mental health services better. People who are thinking about suicide can see a mental health expert on the same day at a general clinic. If family members see a problem, they can call 112 for help. Since July, mental health centers have also started a system where social workers help people individually.</p>
            <p>Ieva VaskelienÄ—, a health ministry official, said that people can now get help without giving their name. They can talk to a mental health expert or an addiction counselor without needing a diagnosis. School mental health experts have also been trained to help students who might be at risk of suicide.</p>
            <p>Skruibis said that the suicide rate has been going down steadily for the past 10 years, but it is still much higher than the EU average. He noted that the rate has stopped decreasing recently, which is something to watch.</p>
            <p>Experts say that even though the long-term trend is down, the suicide rate has stayed high in recent years. This shows that Lithuania still needs to improve its mental health and social support systems, especially for older people.</p>

            <h1>Hou Wen-yong's New Drama Stops Filming, Loses Millions; Shao Yu-wei Stressed, Hormones Out of Balance</h1>
            <p>Writer Hou Wen-yong is also the producer and scriptwriter for the TV series "People Floating in Love." Filming for this show stopped once because of the pandemic, and some actors also changed. Hou Wen-yong said today that these changes caused a loss of about 20 to 30 million NT dollars. Actress Shao Yu-wei said she was so stressed that her hormones became unbalanced.</p>
            <p>This year, the Kaohsiung Film Festival's "mystery screening" was for "People Floating in Love." Hou Wen-yong, along with director Hsu Fu-chun, producer Ke Yi-sen, and actors Shao Yu-wei and Fan Shao-hsun, attended today. They talked about the filming process in an interview.</p>
            <p>Hou Wen-yong said that when they lost money, he did struggle inside. But he decided to accept it and keep looking for more money. He said, "Of course, it's harder, but I'm just unlucky, I always take the more difficult path." He also joked that he didn't borrow money from his dentist wife for filming. He said, "Because she is the producer, I had good reason to ask her for more investment." When asked if the current team was the best choice, he said, "Life is not like that! The best result is that this drama was finally made."</p>
            <p>Shao Yu-wei joined in the new version of the show. She joked that she went from the younger group to the older group. She said, "I watched the first part a little. The character details are different in the second part, but the main story is still largely the same." Her boyfriend, Wu Kang-jen, only acted in the first version. She said that when they are dating, they keep work separate and do not talk about it.</p>
            <p>Shao Yu-wei said that during filming, she was so stressed that her hormones and period became irregular. She looked bloated on screen and even got rashes all over her body. Her agent even thought she looked "terrible" at the time. Hou Wen-yong mentioned that Shao Yu-wei also asked him for help when trying to understand her character. He told her to watch the movie "Killing Eve" for ideas.</p>
            <p>Fan Shao-hsun was in the show from the very first version. But he said his first character was a rich American-Born Chinese (ABC) person. Acting with that accent put some pressure on him. The new version fits his feelings better.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Kaohsiung Film Festival is happening from now until October 26th.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Fights Hard for 3 Games, Beats Former World No. 1, Wins Arctic Open for Second Time</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's top badminton player, Chou Tien-chen, fought hard today in the men's singles final of the BWF Super 500 Arctic Open in Finland. He played against his opponent, the former world number one Kunlavut Vitidsarn. After a difficult three-game match, Chou won with scores of 21-11, 13-21, and 21-19. This means he has now beaten Kunlavut three times in a row and has won the Arctic Open for the second time.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen, who is 35 years old, had tough matches in every round of this week's Arctic Open. From the first round of 32 players all the way to the final match, he had to play three full games to win. This is Chou Tien-chen's first championship title this season.</p>
