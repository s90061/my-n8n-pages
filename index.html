            <h1>Central Taiwan Film and Television Base Talent Cultivation Showcases Results; TV Series Scenes Recreated, Attracting Attention</h1>
            <p>The "Central Taiwan Film and Television Base Talent Cultivation Program" held an event today to show its results. The program is supported by the Ministry of Culture and Taichung City Government. At the event, they showed recreated scenes from the TV series "Paradise on Fourth Floor." The organizers hope this program will train students and help Taichung become a place where film and TV talents can grow.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture's Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development and the Taichung City Government's Information Bureau supported this program. Chaoyang University of Technology and China Motion Picture Development Co. organized the "Central Taiwan Film and Television Base Talent Cultivation Program â€“ Film Art Design and Set Quality Practical Workshop." The event was held today at the Central Taiwan Film and Television Base. Many people attended, including Chen Yu, the Deputy Director of Taichung City Government's Information Bureau, and Xu Song-qi, the Vice President of Chaoyang University of Technology.</p>
            <p>Chen Yu spoke at the event. She said that this workshop is now in its third year. The city government continues to put money into it to train students. It also brings industry professionals back to learn. This is very important for the long-term growth of the film and TV industry. She hopes Taichung can become a place where film and TV talents are developed.</p>
            <p>Xu Song-qi said that the workshop combines studio work and hands-on training for film art design. This year, over 100 students from 17 colleges and universities, both from Taiwan and other countries, signed up. These students came from departments like film, theater stage design, interior design, and visual communication. In the end, 24 students were chosen to join the 17-day intensive practical course.</p>
            <p>Xu Song-qi also said that this year, people already working in the industry could join. This helps share knowledge and skills in the industry. They also invited university professors from related subjects to sit in on classes as "guest observers." This helps professors understand modern film and TV skills and how to connect them with teaching.</p>
            <p>The organizers explained that this workshop used the TV series "Paradise on Fourth Floor" as its main text. Students learned the full process, including reading the script, setting art styles, hiring carpenters for sets, building scenes, arranging props, and making things look real. Students worked in a real studio. The Central Taiwan Film and Television Base will be open to the public for free on July 26 and 27, from 11 AM to 4 PM. (Edited by Huang Shih-ya) July 25, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Ko Wen-je's Injunction for Recall Vote Rejected; Lawyer Files Appeal</h1>
            <p>Former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je is currently held in custody because of his involvement in the Jinhuacheng case. He asked the court for a temporary order to let him vote in the recall election tomorrow. However, the Taipei High Administrative Court said no to his request this morning. Ko Wen-je's lawyer, Hsiao Yi-hung, filed an appeal this afternoon.</p>
            <p>The Taipei High Administrative Court stated that once they receive the appeal, they will send all the related documents to the Supreme Administrative Court to be reviewed, as the law requires.</p>
            <p>This case started because the Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged Ko Wen-je in the Jinhuacheng case. The Taipei District Court is now handling the case. The Taipei District Court believes that Ko might destroy evidence or talk to other people involved or witnesses. So, the reason and need to keep him in custody are still there. Because of this, the court recently decided to keep Ko Wen-je in custody for another two months, starting from August 2.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je asked for a temporary order. He said that according to the election law, he has the right to vote. He asked the Taipei City Election Commission and the Agency of Corrections, Ministry of Justice, Taipei Detention Center, to let him vote in the recall election for Luo Chih-chiang, a legislator from the 11th legislative term (Taipei City's 6th election area). He asked to do this in a suitable way before his administrative lawsuit is finished. He suggested three ways: setting up a voting place in the detention center, voting by mail, or being escorted to a specific voting place.</p>
            <p>After a court hearing yesterday, the Taipei High Administrative Court made its decision today. The court's decision said that according to the election law, voters must vote in person where they are registered. How to make sure a person in custody can vote is a matter that lawmakers need to think about carefully. The detention law does not cover this. If security is too strict, it could hurt a person's rights. If it is too loose, it could make it easier for them to escape and make security harder, which could harm the public good.</p>
            <p>The court's decision stated that if they allowed Ko Wen-je's request temporarily, it would cause great harm to the public good by affecting the election results. This harm would be much greater than if they did not allow his request and he later won the case. Therefore, the court rejected his request. He has the right to appeal this decision.
