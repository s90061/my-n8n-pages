A British Member of Parliament and former Defense Minister, Gavin Williamson, said that Western countries are too "scared" to work with Taiwan because of pressure from China. He believes that in the future, the British government should officially recognize Taiwan, just like it helped other countries recognize Kosovo.

Williamson told Nikkei Asia that countries should see Taiwan as "a proud, independent nation." He also thinks they should do more to help Taiwan against military threats and "grey zone" attacks from China. He suggested combining political support, selling weapons, and working together on drones and important weapon supplies. He also emphasized that allies like Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Australia, and the US should work together because their interests are connected.

Williamson also talked about Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te's plan to increase defense spending to 3% of the country's GDP. Williamson called this plan "positive and very necessary." He said it is very important to show the world that Taiwan will protect its independence and is ready to defend itself.

In terms of money, Williamson believes that the UK, which joined the CPTPP last year, should openly support Taiwan joining. He said this again at the Taiwan Foreign Correspondentsâ€™ Club. He also suggested that the UK should take small steps and encourage countries like Australia and those in Europe to do the same.

**Is Huang Kuo-chang Planning for Taipei City Councilor? He Asks Hsu Fu to Join Anti-Recall Activities in Songshan and Xinyi**

There are rumors that Hsu Fu, the deputy secretary-general of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), will run for city councilor in Taipei's Songshan and Xinyi areas. TPP Chairman Huang Kuo-chang said today that it is too early to say for sure. He explained that the TPP will create new rules for choosing candidates at their party meeting in August. After that, they will officially start the process.

However, Huang Kuo-chang said that in the Songshan and Xinyi areas of Taipei, KMT lawmakers Wang Hung-wei and Hsu Chiao-hsin are facing big recall votes. He asked Hsu Fu to help organize anti-recall activities in addition to his work at the party headquarters. Huang hopes that TPP supporters in Songshan and Xinyi will come out on July 26 to vote against the recall. He admitted that it will be a difficult time.

Huang Kuo-chang spoke about this to the media before attending a book launch for KMT lawmaker Lo Chih-chiang today. In other news, two people, Dai Rui-ning and Lin Hui-chu, were arrested for threatening a prosecutor who was handling the Jinghua City case. They put the prosecutor's name and photo online with threatening words and images. The court decided today to keep them in custody because of the threats.

**Typhoon Nears Green Island and Orchid Island; Tourists Rush Back, Park Asks Hikers to Come Down**

Typhoon Danas is coming, and it is expected to have the biggest impact tomorrow. Many tourists on Taitung's Green Island and Orchid Island returned early today. Taroko National Park, which had over 600 people planning to enter the mountains, quickly contacted hiking groups to ask them to come down early or stay safe where they were.

Because of the typhoon and strong waves, ferry companies in Taitung announced that all boat trips to and from Green Island, Orchid Island, and Houbihu in Pingtung are canceled for tomorrow. A tourist from Hong Kong, Mr. Cheng, had planned a 4-day trip to Green Island. He was supposed to go back on July 7, but he had to leave two days early because of the typhoon. He said he had been diving for two days, but it was okay to end his trip early due to the typhoon.

A farmer in Taitung, who grows rice, was rushing to harvest while the weather was good but his machine broke down. He had to stop and quickly find other farmers' machines, hoping to finish harvesting today. Betel nut farmers also moved their Sunday harvest plans earlier, trying to gather as much as possible.

The Central Weather Bureau issued a sea typhoon warning for Danas this morning. Taroko National Park immediately announced that people are not allowed to enter the park's protected areas. All permits to enter the park that were already given out are now canceled. The park said that before the typhoon, 173 groups with 624 hikers had applied to enter the mountains. Starting yesterday, the park began contacting these groups, telling those who had not yet started their trip to avoid going, and asking those already in the mountains to come down quickly. Some groups have already come down, and some have chosen to stay safe in the mountains.
