            <h1>US and Japan Talks: Trump Changes Numbers on a Chart</h1>
            <p>New York, July 23 (CNA) - US President Donald Trump announced that the US and Japan have made a trade deal. During their talks, a large chart on Trump's table got a lot of attention. It seems Trump himself changed Japan's suggested investment amount from $400 billion to $500 billion. He also put an "X" under "semiconductor products" for a suggested 15% tax.</p>
            <p>On July 22, Donald Trump posted on social media that the US had made a "huge trade deal" with Japan. He said taxes on Japanese goods would go down to 15%, and Japan would invest $550 billion in the US (about 16.115 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). But Dan Scavino, a White House aide, posted a photo on X of Trump and US-Japan negotiators at the White House, which caught people's eye.</p>
            <p>The photo clearly showed words on a large chart on Trump's table. It had "10% tax" and "15% tax on cars, medical products, and semiconductor products," along with "$400 billion." But "400 billion" was changed to "500 billion," and there was an "X" under "semiconductor products." Trump's social media post later increased it to a 15% tax and $550 billion investment.</p>
            <p>The financial news channel CNBC said Trump's negotiation style seemed to be active until the last minute on July 22. The chart looked like Japan's suggested investment plan, but it was changed to $500 billion, and then the final social media post said $550 billion. The White House explained that $400 billion was Japan's suggestion, and Trump added $150 billion for the American people.</p>
            <p>On July 23, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg that he made the large chart and put it on the table. He said the main US negotiator sat behind him, and Trump led the talks.</p>
            <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Bloomberg that some countries sending cars to the US face higher taxes. But Japan offered stocks, loan guarantees, and new money for big projects in the US, which is why they got a 15% tax rate.</p>
            <p>Will the 15% tax rate in the US-Japan deal become the lowest rate for other countries? Bessent stressed that it is a different agreement. Japan offered new ways to fund investments, which is why they received the 15% rate.</p>
            <p>Both the US and Japan have different ideas about the investment amount in the deal. Andy Laperriere, head of US policy research at Piper Sandler, an investment bank in New York, said Japanese officials have different opinions about the investment plans in the US. He said $550 billion is the highest amount, and it includes government loan guarantees.</p>
            <p>Laperriere also noted that Japan feels forced to accept the deal. He believes Japan will be slow and careful with investments in the US that do not help Japan's interests.</p>

            <h1>Two Doctors Plead Guilty After "Friends" Actor Matthew Perry Died from Ketamine Overdose</h1>
            <p>Los Angeles, July 23 (CNA) - Matthew Perry, an actor from the American TV show "Friends," died in 2023 from too much ketamine. One doctor who was accused of giving him ketamine had already said he was guilty. Today, another doctor also said he was guilty.</p>
            <p>On October 28, 2023, Matthew Perry was found dead in his hot tub at home in Los Angeles. He was 54 years old. An autopsy showed that he died because of "the acute effects of ketamine." Five people were accused in this case. One of them is Dr. Salvador Plasencia, who pleaded guilty today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that today, in a Los Angeles court, he admitted to four charges of illegally giving ketamine, which is a controlled drug. He could go to prison for up to 40 years.</p>
            <p>Plasencia is 43 years old. He will not be put in jail before his sentencing on December 3. His lawyer said he plans to give up his doctor's license within 45 days.</p>
            <p>Plasencia admitted that he gave Matthew Perry ketamine. Ketamine is a strong pain reliever that works quickly and can make people hallucinate.</p>
            <p>This controlled drug is sometimes used to treat depression and anxiety. But some people use it illegally for fun. Plasencia admitted that he gave Matthew Perry ketamine shots at Matthew Perry's home and in the back of his car. He did not do this for a legal medical reason.</p>
            <p>Plasencia used to run an urgent care clinic. He got ketamine through another doctor in San Diego, Mark Chavez, who is also accused in this case. Court papers show that Plasencia once sent a message to Chavez saying, "I wonder how much this idiot will pay."</p>
            <p>Plasencia's lawyer said the doctor "deeply regrets" his choices in this case and "takes full responsibility."</p>
            <p>Chavez and two other accused people have already pleaded guilty. But they have not been sentenced yet.</p>
            <p>The fifth person accused, Jasveen Sangha, is called a drug dealer by US authorities and was known as the "Ketamine Queen" by her customers. She is accused of giving Matthew Perry the ketamine that caused his death. However, she says she is not guilty. Her trial is expected to start in August.</p>
            <p>Matthew Perry had publicly said that he struggled with drug addiction for decades, including when he was starring in "Friends" in the 1990s.</p>
