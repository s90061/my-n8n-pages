            <h1>Ukraine: Russian Attacks Cause Power Outage at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Threatening Global Safety</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, October 1 (CNA) â€“ Ukraine's Ministry of Energy said today that Russian attacks caused some parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to lose electricity. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia is a threat to global safety.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Ukraine's Ministry of Energy stated on Telegram that there was an emergency at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant because Russia attacked energy places in the Kyiv region.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Energy also said that the power problem caused the New Safe Confinement to lose power. This important building covers the destroyed Reactor No. 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. It stops radioactive materials from going into the environment.</p>
            <p>Reactor No. 4 at Chernobyl exploded on April 26, 1986. This nuclear accident killed hundreds of people and spread radiation. The area around it became one of the most empty places on Earth.</p>
            <p>President Zelensky wrote on Facebook today that Russia is making the war last longer every day. It refuses to stop fighting completely and safely. It keeps attacking Ukraine's energy places, including important places that keep nuclear power plants and other nuclear sites safe. This is a threat to the whole world.</p>

            <h1>Jane Goodall Dies at 91; She Visited Taiwan in June to Give Hope for the Future</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 1 (CNA) â€“ The Jane Goodall Institute announced today that the famous conservation expert Jane Goodall passed away peacefully in her sleep at the age of 91. Jane Goodall visited Taiwan in June this year. She said that she did not have much time left and wanted to use her last strength to help people understand that there is still a way forward in this difficult world.</p>
            <p>The Jane Goodall Institute in Washington DC shared this news on Instagram today. They also said that Jane Goodall was on a speaking tour in California, USA, at the time. Her schedule showed she was supposed to give a speech in Los Angeles on October 3.</p>
            <p>The institute said that Dr. Jane Goodall's discoveries as an animal behavior expert changed science completely. She also worked very hard to protect and bring back the natural world.</p>
            <p>Jane Goodall was born in London in 1934. When she was growing up, she dreamed of living with wild animals. She once said that her love for animals started when her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. As she read books like Tarzan and Doctor Dolittle, her love for animals grew even more.</p>
            <p>In 1960, when she was 26, Jane Goodall went to Tanzania for the first time. She deeply studied chimpanzees. At that time, studying animals in their natural homes like this was seen as a new way of doing fieldwork.</p>
            <p>When she lived with the chimpanzees, Jane Goodall recorded them using tools and doing other things that people thought only humans could do. She also noticed their special personalities. Her observations and the articles and documentaries published in the 1960s not only changed how people saw chimpanzees but also changed how people understood the feelings and complex social lives of all animals. This made her well-known to the public.</p>
            <p>"For many years, chimpanzees taught me that they are really so much like us. They made the line between humans and animals unclear," she said in 1997.</p>
            <p>Besides studying primates and her research work, she also actively worked to protect the environment and spoke against cutting down forests. She said at the "Global Citizen Festival" in 2024, "Because we are part of nature. Also, our food, water, clothesâ€”everything depends on healthy natural systems and the complicated network of plants and animals connected to each other."</p>
            <p>"If nature continues to get worse, what will happen to the future of our next generation?"</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Jane Goodall traveled for about 300 days each year. She met with local officials in different countries and talked with community and school groups. For many years, she kept giving speeches until the end of her life. Just last week, she spoke during New York Climate Week.</p>
            <p>In January this year, then-US President Biden gave Jane Goodall the "Presidential Medal of Freedom." This is the highest award for a civilian in the US, given for her academic research and social work.</p>
            <p>About five months later, Goodall visited Taiwan after seven years. While she was sick, she gave an interview to the media. She talked about topics like artificial intelligence (AI), oceans, and conservation. The 91-year-old also said that she did not have much time left. She wanted to use her last strength to help young people understand that there is still a way forward in this difficult world.</p>
            <p>When talking about life and death, Jane Goodall said that she spent her life watching the world, from chimpanzees in Africa to starting the "Roots & Shoots" program. She believes that when the body dies, something continues to exist. "I cannot think of a greater adventure than finding out what that is," she said. For her, it was acceptable.</p>
            <p>The "Roots & Shoots program" started in the 1990s. Now it is active in 75 countries and has taught many young people to help protect the Earth. Her image, holding notes, crouching in bushes, and watching primates with binoculars, will always be remembered.</p>
