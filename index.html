            <h1>President Lai Ching-te Votes in Tainan for Nuclear Power Plant Referendum</h1>
            <p>Today, people voted on whether to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant. In the morning, President Lai Ching-te went back to Tainan City to cast his vote. He did not talk to the media.</p>
            <p>President Lai walked into the polling station at Anping Junior High School in Anping District, Tainan City. After voting, he waved and smiled at the reporters there. Before leaving, he talked briefly with Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che and Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Lin Chun-hsien. Lin Chun-hsien later said that President Lai was very concerned about how Tainan's areas damaged by typhoons and heavy rain were being fixed.</p>
            <p>Today, there were also votes to remove lawmakers Lo Ming-tsai, Chiang Chi-chen, Yang Chiung-ying, Yen Kuan-heng, Lin Szu-ming, Ma Wen-chun, and Yu Hao from the KMT party. Also, there was a nationwide vote on the Third Nuclear Power Plant. The main question for the vote was: "Do you agree that the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue to operate after the government agency says it is safe?" The ballot for this vote was white. All citizens aged 18 and older could vote in this referendum.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Intelligence Chief Removed After Report Disagrees with Trump on Iran Nuclear Damage</h1>
            <p>Today, US officials said that Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and two high-ranking generals have been removed from their jobs. This is the latest in a series of military removals this year. In June, the DIA made a first report that was different from President Trump's claim that Iran's nuclear sites were completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Kruse had been the director of the DIA since early 2024. Not long ago, the DIA made a first assessment. It said that the US air attacks on Iran only delayed Iran's nuclear plans by a few months.</p>
            <p>This assessment was widely reported by US media. It was very different from Trump's statement that Iran's nuclear sites were "totally destroyed." This made Trump and other government officials angry.</p>
            <p>A high-ranking defense official, who did not want to be named, said that Kruse "will no longer be the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency." But the official did not say why Kruse was leaving.</p>
            <p>Before becoming the DIA director, Kruse worked as a military advisor to the Director of National Intelligence. He also led intelligence efforts to fight the Islamic State (IS) group, among other roles.</p>
            <p>Another US official, who also did not want to be named, said that the other two generals removed were Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, who leads the Navy Reserve, and Rear Admiral Milton Sands, who leads the Naval Special Warfare Command.</p>
            <p>In June this year, the US carried out a large military operation against three nuclear sites in Iran. More than 125 planes and one missile submarine were used.</p>
            <p>Trump called the attack an "amazing military victory." He said many times that the US "destroyed" these nuclear sites. But the DIA's first assessment made people question Trump's statements.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says US Will Get 10% of Intel Shares, White House Involvement in Companies Continues</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump announced that the US will get 10% of Intel, a company that makes computer chips. This agreement means that government money given to Intel will be exchanged for company shares. This is the latest example of the White House getting involved in American businesses in an unusual way.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this agreement helps improve the relationship between Trump and Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger. Trump had previously said that Gelsinger had a conflict of interest and should resign. The agreement will make sure Intel gets about $10 billion to build new factories or make existing ones bigger in the US.</p>
            <p>Under the agreement, the US will buy 9.9% of Intel's shares for $8.9 billion. This is about $20.47 per share, which is about $4 less than Intel's closing stock price today of $24.8.</p>
            <p>Intel's stock price went up by 5.5% today when the market closed. It went up about 1% more after hours.</p>
            <p>A White House official said that Trump met with Gelsinger today.</p>
            <p>Trump said today, "He came to keep his job, and in the end, he agreed to give us $10 billion for America. So we got $10 billion."</p>
            <p>US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick posted on social media platform X that Gelsinger reached an agreement that is "good for both Intel and the American people."</p>
            <p>This investment is the newest unusual agreement between the US government and a company. Before this, the US government made a deal with Nvidia, a big company that makes AI chips. This deal allowed Nvidia to sell H20 chips to China, but Nvidia had to give 15% of the sales money to the government.</p>
            <p>Also, the US Department of Defense made a deal with MP Materials, a mining company. The government became its biggest shareholder to make more rare earth magnets. The US government also got a "golden share" with veto power in the deal that allowed Nippon Steel to buy US Steel.</p>
            <p>The US federal government's wide involvement in company matters has made some critics worried. They think Trump's actions create new risks for businesses.</p>
            <p>But some people who watch the industry also wonder if Intel can solve its problems on its own.</p>
            <p>Daniel Morgan, a senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust, said that "without government help or other financially stronger partners, Intel's factory division would find it hard to get enough money to keep building more chip factories at a good speed." He added that Intel "must keep up with TSMC in technology to get business."</p>
            <p>Intel said that the US government's shares will be held passively, meaning the government will not have seats on the board. When shareholders need to agree on something, the government must vote with Intel's board, but there are some "limited exceptions." Intel did not say what these exceptions are.</p>
