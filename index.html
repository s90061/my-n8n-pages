            <h1>The Unforgettable Shadow: 9/11 Survivor Hopes No More Tragedies</h1>
            <p>Twenty-four years ago, on September 11, two hijacked airplanes hit the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. The buildings fell down in huge fires. This was a new kind of attack that no one had seen before. Because it was shown live all over the world without stopping, it became the first big shared memory for many people. Survivors who were there still tell the same story today to remind everyone not to forget history.</p>
            <p>It was a clear, cool autumn morning on September 11, 2001. People in the New York area were going to work. At 8:46 AM, an American Airlines plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center. At 9:03 AM, a United Airlines plane hit the South Tower. At 9:37 AM, a plane hit the Pentagon in Washington. At 10:03 AM, a plane crashed in Pennsylvania. The two World Trade Center buildings burned for 56 minutes and 102 minutes before they fell.</p>
            <p>In the World Trade Center attacks, 2,977 people from more than 90 countries died. This included passengers on the planes, police and firefighters helping, and many brave people who tried to help. These were unnamed heroes caught in the dust and falling buildings.</p>
            <p>The 9/11 events shocked the whole world. As the new century began, people faced a sad history of complicated ethnic issues and clashes between cultures.</p>
            <p>New York City quickly cleaned up, rebuilt, and developed the World Trade Center area, which was called Ground Zero. They built the 9/11 Memorial and Museum and seven new buildings. Where the North and South towers once stood, they made reflecting pools with the names of those who died carved around the edges.</p>
            <p>The museum keeps signs of the tragedy. The area is now a special tourist spot that has attracted almost 100 million visitors. People come to One World Trade Center to see this recent history.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Hillman, the president of the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, said that nearly 3,000 people died in the tragedy. The shocking images were sent all over the world. She said it was not only a tragedy for America but also a moment the whole world saw. Every year at this time, people remember those lost at this holy place.</p>
            <p>She said that the 9/11 Memorial opened to the public 10 years after the event, and the museum opened in 2014. She is proud that they have welcomed 90 million visitors from over 175 countries. Today, half of the visitors to the park come from other countries. She added that no matter where people come from, they make sure everyone feels welcome in this place.</p>
            <p>Over the past 24 years, New Yorkers who experienced the event have told many stories from that time. The stories continue, some from inside the two buildings, some from outside. What is the same is that the people telling the stories cannot forget.</p>
            <p>Desiree Bouchat, a survivor from the South Tower, remembered: "We went to the window and couldn't see anything. Everyone didn't know what to do. But then my boss, Jim, said to leave and go home. Great! It was only 9 AM, and we could go home. We went downstairs for coffee and tea, thinking we would go back up when things were clear."</p>
            <p>"I remember walking on that floor. Each floor was about one acre, but there was no one on the floor. My co-workers were on the north and west sides of the building. They said, 'You're right there!' They saw the plane fly by and hit the building. Papers on desks turned to ash. They were quickly told to leave."</p>
            <p>"But people on the south and east sides of the building didn't know what was happening. Jim then said it was time to leave again. I walked to the elevator and saw Jim going down the hall to make sure everyone was ready to leave, but Jim never left."</p>
            <p>That morning 24 years ago, many American families were broken apart. Many people lost close friends and family. Children who were too young to say goodbye to their family members are now adults. Bouchat, now in middle age, still chokes up when she talks about the last time she saw her co-workers. She has decided to tell the same story every chance she gets, so that such a tragedy will not happen again.</p>

            <h1>Switzerland Debates Sending Peacekeeping Troops to Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Last Sunday, Russia attacked Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, with 800 missiles and drones. This shocked the world. Now, countries in Europe are discussing whether to send protection forces to Ukraine. This topic has also caused strong political discussions in Switzerland.</p>
            <p>Beat Flach, a member of the Swiss Green Liberal Party (GLP) in parliament, will propose an idea during the autumn parliament session. If Russia and Ukraine sign a peace agreement, he wants the Federal Council to study if Swiss peacekeeping troops (Swisscoy) can be sent to Ukraine for a mission.</p>
            <p>Most political parties in Switzerland currently support this idea. However, the largest party in the Swiss parliament, the Swiss People's Party (SVP), strongly disagrees. They say that Switzerland should focus completely on its own safety and not send soldiers to other countries for long periods.</p>
            <p>Since 1999, Swiss peacekeeping troops have been part of NATO's international peacekeeping work in Kosovo. About 200 Swiss soldiers take turns staying there. Their main jobs are to watch roads, keep bridges safe, protect convoys, and help with supplies. The Swiss parliament will soon vote on whether to continue this mission until the end of 2026. The Swiss People's Party also opposes continuing this mission.</p>
            <p>Member of Parliament Flach believes that Switzerland has experience with international peacekeeping in Kosovo. So, he thinks Switzerland should get ready for peace in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Swiss Ministry of Defense, about 300 Swiss soldiers and civilians are currently part of global peace missions. They are in 18 countries, including the Korean Peninsula, Africa, and the Middle East, working on a total of 14 peace projects.</p>
            <p>Peacekeeping troops do not fight in wars. Their job is to keep peace and observe. Not all Swiss people who join are national soldiers. Any Swiss citizen between 18 and 65 years old, male or female, can apply. So far, 14,000 Swiss citizens have taken part in peace missions.</p>
