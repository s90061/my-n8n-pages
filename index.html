            <h1>Syria Votes to Form New Parliament for the First Time Since Assad's Fall</h1>
            <p>Committees in different areas of Syria voted today to choose members for a temporary parliament. This marks a new period after the time of former President Bashar al-Assad.</p>
            <p>However, people have criticized this process because one-third of the members will be directly chosen by the interim leader, al-Sharaa, which they say is not democratic.</p>
            <p>News agency AFP reported that the new parliament is expected to make al-Sharaa's power stronger. He leads a group of Islamic fighters who, in December last year, removed Bashar al-Assad from power after a 13-year civil war.</p>
            <p>Members of local committees voted at the Syrian National Library in Damascus, the capital city. The election committee announced tonight that "voting has finished, and counting is now happening."</p>
            <p>A member of the Damascus election committee told AFP that some early results might be known tonight. But the final list of elected members will be announced tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The election committee stated that over 1,500 people wanted to be members for a 30-month period. Only 14% of these people were women. Al-Sharaa will directly choose 70 out of 210 members. The other two-thirds will be chosen by local committees, which were set up by the election committee. However, al-Sharaa himself appointed the election committee.</p>
            <p>After the new government in Damascus took power, they dissolved the old parliament, which used to just agree with the leader. According to a temporary constitution made in March, the new parliament will make laws until a formal constitution is approved and a national election is held.</p>
            <p>Millions of Syrians have left their homes or country because of the war and do not have official papers. Al-Sharaa said that it is not practical to hold direct elections at this time.</p>
            <p>Human rights groups have criticized this selection process. They believe that al-Sharaa has too much power. They also think that the process does not fairly represent minority groups and different religions in Syria.</p>
            <p>Last month, many groups said in a joint statement that this selection process means al-Sharaa "can effectively create a parliament where most members are either chosen by him or are loyal to him."</p>

            <h1>Putin Suggests Extending Nuclear Arms Treaty, Trump Says "Sounds Like a Good Idea"</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that Russian President Vladimir Putin's idea to continue limits on strategic nuclear weapons "sounds like a good idea."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last month, Putin said Russia would willingly continue to follow the limits of the 2010 "New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty" (New START). This treaty sets limits on the size of the two biggest nuclear weapon collections in the world. The treaty will end in February next year.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump about Putin's suggestion as he left the White House, he replied, "I think it sounds like a good idea."</p>
            <p>Last week, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow is still waiting for Trump to respond to Putin's offer to willingly continue the limits on strategic nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>After Trump and Putin met in Alaska, USA, in mid-August, there have been many times when Russian drones flew into NATO airspace. This has made things more tense between the US and Russia. If they can agree on limiting nuclear weapons now, the situation could improve.</p>
            <p>In a video released today, Putin warned that if the US decides to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles that can hit inside Russia, the relationship between Moscow and Washington could completely break.</p>
            <p>He said in the video, "This will ruin our relationship, or at least it will make the good things that have already appeared in our relationship disappear."</p>
            <p>Last month, US Vice President J.D. Vance said that Washington is thinking about Ukraine's request for missiles that can hit inside Russia, including Moscow. It is still not clear if the US has made a final decision on this.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Gaza Ceasefire Talks Will Take Several Days, Rubio Asks Israeli Army to Stop Bombing</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that talks to stop fighting in Gaza will happen for several days. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, on the other hand, warned that Israel must stop bombing to get the hostages released.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump told reporters at the White House, "They are now having talks, the talks have started, and they will continue for a few days... We will see what happens, but I hear things are going quite well."</p>
            <p>CNN released Trump's answers to text message questions today. When asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to end military actions in Gaza, he replied "Yes."</p>
            <p>Talks between Israel and the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas are planned to happen in Sharm El-Sheikh, a resort in Egypt. Netanyahu has said he hopes the hostages held in Gaza can be released within a few days.</p>
            <p>However, Rubio asked the Israeli army to stop air attacks on Gaza.</p>
            <p>He said on CBS's "Face the Nation" program, "I think Israel and everyone agrees that it's impossible to release hostages while bombing continues, so the air attacks must stop first."</p>
            <p>This round of diplomatic efforts comes after Hamas gave a positive response to Trump's plan for a ceasefire. This plan aims to end the war in Gaza and for Israel to release imprisoned Palestinians in exchange for the hostages.</p>
            <p>Rubio also admitted on NBC's "Meet the Press" program that there are still many "practical problems" to solve to clear the way for releasing hostages. He also predicted that the long-term goals of governing Gaza in the future and disarming Hamas will be "more difficult."</p>
            <p>He said, "You cannot build a government in Gaza that is not Hamas in 3 days. I mean, that will take some time."</p>
            <p>Trump told CNN that he expects to find out soon if Hamas, the group that attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, causing the conflict, truly wants peace.</p>
            <p>He warned that if Hamas refuses to give up power, it will face "complete destruction."</p>
