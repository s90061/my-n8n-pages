A recent report shows that many people in the UK are having financial difficulties. Over a third of people, about 35%, say they are struggling to pay for basic necessities like food, energy, and housing. High prices for these items are the main reason for their struggles.

To cope, many individuals and families are cutting back on spending. This includes eating out less, delaying big purchases like new appliances, and finding cheaper ways to entertain themselves. Some are also borrowing money to cover their everyday costs, which can lead to more debt. The report highlights that young people and families with children are particularly affected by these financial pressures. This constant financial stress can also make people feel worried and anxious about their future. Experts suggest that government and businesses need to find ways to support households during this challenging time.

**Artificial Intelligence is Changing How We Work**

A new report from the World Economic Forum indicates that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on jobs and workplaces around the world. Companies are using AI more and more to help with daily tasks, which is changing how many businesses operate.

The report suggests that while some jobs might disappear because AI can do them, many new jobs are also appearing. These new roles often involve working with AI or managing AI systems. For example, there's a growing need for people who can develop, maintain, and oversee AI technologies. The report also says that workers will need to learn new skills to adapt to these changes. Important skills for the future include critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving, as humans will need to work alongside AI. Many company leaders believe AI will make their businesses more efficient and help them grow, but they also recognize the need to train their employees for this new work environment.

**Venice Introduces a New Fee for Day-Trippers**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started a new system to manage its many tourists. Starting this year, day-trippers who visit for just one day now have to pay a small fee to enter the city. This is a trial program that applies on certain busy days, mostly during peak tourist season.

The city hopes this new rule will help reduce the huge crowds that visit every day. Too many tourists can cause problems for local residents and put stress on Veniceâ€™s old buildings and infrastructure. To enter, visitors need to book their visit online and pay the fee before they arrive. They will then receive a QR code to show upon entry. People who stay overnight in hotels and local residents do not need to pay the fee. This initiative is an effort to protect Venice's unique culture and environment, aiming to make tourism more sustainable in the long term for one of the world's most visited cities.
