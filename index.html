Carlos Alcaraz, a young tennis player from Spain, won his second match at Wimbledon. He defeated British player Oliver Tarvet in three straight sets: 6-1, 6-4, 6-4. This win helps Alcaraz continue his goal of winning Wimbledon for the third time in a row.

In his first match, Alcaraz played a difficult game against Fabio Fognini from Italy, which lasted over four hours. However, today's match against Tarvet took only 2 hours and 17 minutes. Tarvet, an amateur player ranked 733 in the world, showed good skills, making the home crowd happy.

Alcaraz has now won 20 matches in a row. In the third round, he will play against either Felix Auger-Aliassime from Canada or Jan-Lennard Struff from Germany.

**P. Diddy Found Not Guilty of Sex Trafficking, Guilty of Lesser Charge**

Sean "Diddy" Combs, a well-known American rapper, was found not guilty of serious charges like racketeering and sex trafficking in New York. However, he was found guilty of a less serious crime: transporting people for prostitution.

After 13 hours of discussion, the jury decided Diddy was guilty of two charges of transporting people for prostitution. Each charge could mean up to 10 years in prison. But he was found not guilty of the more serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which could have led to life in prison.

Overall, this decision is a win for Diddy. When the judge read the verdict, Diddy looked down and prayed. He seemed relieved when he heard he was not guilty of the serious crimes. His family and supporters cheered, and his lawyers were very happy, with some even crying. Diddy shook hands with one of his lawyers and thanked the jury as he left the courtroom.

Prosecutors had said that Diddy led a group involved in sex crimes for many years, using his staff and bodyguards to commit many illegal acts. Diddy always said he was innocent of all charges.

**Bloomberg: Trump Reaches Trade Deal with Vietnam, 40% Tariff for Goods from China via Vietnam**

According to Bloomberg, former U.S. President Donald Trump announced today that he has reached a trade agreement with Vietnam after weeks of talks. Under the deal, goods from Vietnam to the U.S. will have a 20% tax, and goods that are shipped through Vietnam from other places, like China, will have a 40% tax.

Trump posted on social media that Vietnamese goods sent to the U.S. will have a 20% tax, and goods that are re-routed will have a 40% tax. He also said that Vietnam has agreed to remove all taxes on goods imported from the U.S.

Bloomberg reported that the 40% tax will apply to goods considered "transshipped." This means products whose parts come from China and other countries, are then sent through Vietnam, or only have very little assembly done in Vietnam before being exported to the U.S. The U.S. has not yet released a list of specific goods that will have the 40% tax.

Trump said he made the agreement after talking with Vietnam's Communist Party leader, To Lam. This means Vietnam will "open its market to the U.S.," allowing American products to be sold in Vietnam with no taxes.

Vietnam has been a special challenge for the Trump government because some of his advisors see Vietnam as a key partner against China in Asia. Also, products from Vietnam are very common for American shoppers.

In recent years, more goods from Vietnam have been sent to the U.S. as companies moved their factories from China to Vietnam. Vietnam is a big supplier of clothes and sportswear, with brands like Nike, Gap, and Lululemon having factories there. Last year, Vietnam was the 6th largest supplier of imports to the U.S., sending almost $137 billion worth of goods, according to U.S. government data.

After Trump's announcement, shares of furniture and clothing companies went up. Companies like ON Holding, Nike, and Lululemon saw their stock prices reach new highs, increasing by 7.2%, 3.9%, and 2.9% respectively.

Last year, Vietnam had the third-largest trade surplus with the U.S. globally, after China and Mexico. In May, exports from Vietnam grew by 35% as companies rushed to ship goods before the deadline.
