            <h1>Elon Musk Says Netflix Promotes Transgender Ideas, Asks People to Stop Subscribing</h1>
            <p>Elon Musk, a very rich businessman, said today that Netflix, a company that streams movies and TV shows, is promoting what he called "transgender ideas." He asked his 227 million followers on social media to stop their Netflix subscriptions.</p>
            <p>Musk joined a group that is stopping using Netflix. This group was started by a conservative social media account called Libs of TikTok. This is part of Musk's latest fight about social and cultural issues.</p>
            <p>Libs of TikTok asked people to stop using Netflix. They said it was because of an animated TV show called "Dead End: Paranormal Park" and Netflix's rules about having many different kinds of people in their company.</p>
            <p>The person who created "Dead End: Paranormal Park," Hamish Steele, caused a problem. This was because of things he wrote on social media about a conservative internet personality named Charlie Kirk, who was attacked in September. Some people online thought Steele's words were not respectful.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Musk shared a post from Libs of TikTok on X, which is his social media platform. He wrote, "Cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>The post included a picture from a Netflix company report. The report showed that Netflix had increased the number of directors and main actors who were not white.</p>
            <p>Musk then sent more messages. He told his followers, "For your children's well-being, cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>Hamish Steele himself wrote a post on another social media platform, Bluesky, about this argument. But his post has now been removed. He wrote, "These are all lies and bad stories!"</p>
            <p>Musk has a personal link to transgender topics. His oldest daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, publicly became a woman in 2022. She also legally changed her name and her gender.</p>
            <p>Musk has said that his child was "destroyed" by something he called the "woke mind virus."</p>

            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London fell by 18.70 points, which is 0.20%. It closed at 9427.73 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up a lot, by 308.94 points, or 1.28%. It closed at 24422.56 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris also went up a lot, by 89.68 points, or 1.13%. It closed at 8056.63 points.</p>

            <h1>Tesla Delivers 7% More Cars in Third Quarter, Better Than Expected</h1>
            <p>Tesla, a big electric car company, announced today that its car deliveries in the third quarter went up by 7% compared to last year. This was better than what experts thought would happen. This changed the recent trend where sales had been going down for a few months. This drop happened because some customers were not happy with CEO Elon Musk's actions in politics.</p>
            <p>AFP news reported that Tesla delivered 497,099 vehicles in the three months ending on September 30. This number was higher than the 447,600 vehicles that FactSet, a company that provides financial information, had predicted.</p>
            <p>Tesla did not share specific sales numbers for different areas. But, car companies saw a clear increase in electric car sales in the United States last quarter. This happened before a federal tax discount for buying electric cars, which President Donald Trump supported, came to an end.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk warned in July that Tesla's financial reports might be difficult once the tax discount for electric cars stopped.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump approved a financial plan. It said that a federal tax discount of up to $7,500 for each new electric car would slowly be removed, starting from September 30.</p>
            <p>However, before this rule ended, car companies like General Motors and Ford Motor saw a large increase in their electric car sales in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>Recently, Tesla has been facing more competition from electric car brands in China. Also, there has not been much demand for its electric pickup truck called Cybertruck.</p>
            <p>Musk has said that Tesla can grow a lot in self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. But some people who study the market are disappointed that Tesla has not yet made a cheaper car, which is a goal Tesla has had for a long time.</p>
            <p>Even though the numbers for car deliveries were good, Tesla's stock price started high today but then dropped. It went down by more than 3% during the day.</p>
