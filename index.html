            <h1>New Scooter Parking Lot at Taichung Zhongxiao Night Market Opens on October 17th for Worry-Free Shopping</h1>
            <p>The Zhongxiao Night Market in Taichung City is a popular place for food. However, scooters are often parked illegally on the streets and small roads nearby. To fix this, the Transportation Bureau built a "Zhongxiao Scooter Parking Lot" at the corner of Zhongxiao Road and Lane 195 of Zhongxiao Road. It will open on October 17th and has 80 spaces for scooters, making parking safer.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Transportation Bureau announced today that Zhongxiao Night Market is an old and popular food area in the South District of Taichung City. Many traditional snack stalls and special restaurants are there. A lot of people from the city and tourists come to eat, so scooters are often parked illegally on nearby roads and alleys. This makes it hard for people to walk and causes traffic problems.</p>
            <p>Ye Chao-fu, the head of the Transportation Bureau, said that the new Zhongxiao Scooter Parking Lot is close to the night market. It will help with the need for scooter parking during busy times. This will make traffic better around the night market and improve the general environment.</p>
            <p>The Transportation Bureau explained that building the parking lot included preparing the land and paving it with asphalt. About 80 scooter spaces were marked out based on the space available and what was needed. The whole parking lot has LED streetlights, so it is bright at night. This makes it safer and more comfortable.</p>
            <p>The design of the parking lot also includes green features. Maple trees are planted at the entrance to provide shade and a welcoming look. Large-leaf boxwood and red-leaf trees are used to create green fences along the edges and dividing areas. This helps guide people clearly and creates a good scooter parking area that is good for the environment and reduces carbon.</p>

            <h1>Aaron Yan's Dessert Brand Has Food Safety Problems; Kaohsiung Health Bureau Orders Improvements</h1>
            <p>Aaron Yan's dessert brand "Huo Huo Xuan Wu" is being investigated for food safety issues with its "Pear Blossom Pastries." The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau checked the factory and found many mistakes. They told the company to fix these problems by a certain date. Also, because the company's hygiene manager was not officially approved, they will have to pay a fine of at least NT$30,000.</p>
            <p>News reports said that during the Mid-Autumn Festival this year, "Pear Blossom Pastries" had many orders. At that time, after the pastries were baked, they were put directly in a warehouse hallway without packaging. Also, the expiration dates on the products were wrong.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said today that they received the information on the 14th and went to check the factory. At the factory, they were making bread, not other pastries. However, the company admitted that when they had many orders, they sometimes put products in areas that were not for production because there was not enough space to cool them down.</p>
            <p>The inspectors also found other problems at the factory. These included dirt inside refrigerators, dirty fans, and food additives not being managed correctly (meaning not having a special person, special cabinet, and special record book). The company has been told to fix these problems by a certain date. If they don't, they will be fined at least NT$60,000. Furthermore, because the company's hygiene manager has not been officially approved, the Health Bureau will fine them between NT$30,000 and NT$3,000,000 according to the law.</p>
            <p>Regarding the expiration dates on the products, the Health Bureau said that when they checked the factory, the products they saw were unpackaged baked breads that, by law, do not need to have an expiration date marked on each package.</p>
            <p>In addition, the person who reported the problems also said that during the Mid-Autumn Festival, there were too many orders, so workers had to work overtime. The Health Bureau said they have asked the Labor Bureau to handle this matter.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau reminds companies to follow food safety rules. They should keep their facilities and equipment clean, label products correctly, and manage hygiene well. This is to keep consumers safe when they eat. If consumers have problems, they can call the City Government Consumer Service Center or the 1950 Consumer Service Hotline for help.</p>
