            <h1>Maoluo River in Nantou Rises; Hsu Shu-Hua Asks People to Move Cars from Low Areas</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Cheng Wei-chen, Nantou, August 3) For several days, it has rained a lot in Nantou County. This has made the soil loose in many places, and rocks are falling. Road section Tou 54 at 13.4 kilometers is damaged and might collapse, so it is now closed. People going between Jiji and Shuili can use Provincial Highway 16 instead. The Maoluo River water level has gone up. People are told to move their cars from low-lying areas.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration says that strong, short rain showers are likely because of the southwest airflow. Today, there will be heavy or very heavy rain in the mountains of Nantou County. Other parts of Nantou County will have heavy rain. The rain forecast at 10 AM predicts that Nantou's mountains will get 100 to 190 millimeters of rain in the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Nantou County Mayor Hsu Shu-Hua said on Facebook this morning that the Maoluo River's water level is now high. She has asked the Nantou City Office to tell village leaders to announce more often for people to move cars from under elevated bridges and low areas. Warning lines have been put up, and water pumps are still working.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-Hua also said that rocks have fallen at 28 kilometers on Tou 89 Road. The Shanlinxi Highway is blocked by mudslides and cannot be used. She has asked contractors to help clear the roads.</p>
            <p>The Jiji Township Office said that before Puji Bridge at 13.4 kilometers on Tou 54 Road, the road is badly cracked and sinking. It could collapse at any time. This road section is now closed. The road from Shuili to Jiji can be changed to Provincial Highway 16. Because a slope collapsed a few days ago at 12 kilometers on Provincial Highway 16, traffic is now only allowed in one direction.</p>

            <h1>Expert: Kang Ding Warship Gets New Launch System and Radar, Fights Better</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter You Kai-hsiang, Taipei, August 3) The Navy's Kang Ding-class frigates have been improved. They now have a Huayang Vertical Launch System made by NCSIST and Sea Sword II missiles. An expert said today that the Sea Sword II missiles can fly much farther than the old Sea Chaparral missiles. Also, the new launch system does not need to move up, down, left, or right to shoot. It can fire "instantly" and "continuously." The new turning radar gives a 3D view of the battlefield. This means the ship can see targets far away, hit them accurately, and react quickly.</p>
            <p>To make their fighting power stronger, the Navy has put aside NT$43.1599 billion from 2022 to 2030. This money is to improve the combat systems of six Kang Ding-class ships (La Fayette frigates) in the 124 Fleet. The first ship to be improved, the Chen-teh, went out for sea tests for the first time on the morning of July 28. It is expected to finish its improvements and be ready for duty by the end of this year. Starting next year, one ship will be improved each year until all are done. This will make the Navy's fighting power complete.</p>
            <p>The Kang Ding-class ship upgrades include air defense missiles, combat control systems, search systems, towed sonar, and missile systems. For the missile systems, the ships used to have Sea Chaparral short-range air defense missiles. After the upgrade, they will have the "Huayang" Vertical Launch System (VLS), developed by NCSIST. They will also carry 32 Sea Sword II (TC-2N) air defense missiles.</p>
            <p>The vertical launch system at the front of the ship has 8 parts. Each part can hold 4 Sea Sword II missiles. Su Tzu-yun, an expert from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said that the Sea Chaparral missiles only fly about 8 kilometers. However, the Sea Sword II missiles are expected to fly about 30 to 40 kilometers. There are also more of them, and they can be launched faster. When fighting, they do not need to move up, down, left, or right like the Sea Chaparral missiles. Instead, they "fire instantly" and then turn towards the target area. They can even fire many times in a row. Their fighting power is much better than the Sea Chaparral.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kang Ding ship has a new Type 997 turning radar from British company BAE Systems. This greatly improves its ability to find things. Su Tzu-yun said that the Kang Ding ship's old radar was 2D. But the new radar is 3D. This means it can find targets, their distance, and their height. This gives the Kang Ding ship a 3D view of the battle. Also, public information shows that it can "lock on and track" more than 200 targets at the same time. This means it can see farther, be more accurate, and react faster.</p>
            <p>The Kang Ding-class frigates are based on the French Navy's La Fayette-class frigates. They belong to the Navy's 124 Fleet. Their home port is Zuoying Naval Base. Their main jobs are air defense, anti-submarine warfare, escorting ships, stopping blockades, and joint surface attacks in the Taiwan Strait. There are currently 6 ships: Kang Ding (PFG-1202), Hsi Ning (PFG-1203), Kun Ming (PFG-1205), Di Hua (PFG-1206), Wu Chang (PFG-1207), and Chen-teh (PFG-1208).</p>

            <h1>Guangxi Mercedes Owner Shows ID to Force Way, Showing Off Power Causes Public Anger</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Taipei, August 3) A man in Guangxi recently posted a video. He said that a woman driving a Mercedes showed an "ID card" and forced him to let her pass when they met on the road. The woman also knew his personal information. He thought a public official was using their power unfairly. Today, officials announced their investigation results. They said the woman used her husband's law enforcement ID to scare the man. News reports said that showing off special power is a big problem. A normal argument became a national public issue.</p>
            <p>On July 22, Mr. Li was driving in Fangchenggang City, Guangxi, and met a Mercedes car. The woman driving the Mercedes showed an ID card with "Administrative Law Enforcement" written on it. She forced him to let her pass. The man in her car (the woman's father) even said Mr. Li's home address and last name from his license plate right there.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li thought a public official used their power to get his personal information. He was very angry and complained. But the police did not come to help. So, he posted videos about it online. The videos were watched over 10 million times.</p>
            <p>On July 31, police from a local station came to his house at night. They said the videos showed the woman's car license plate and shared her private information. They told him to delete the videos and say sorry. He deleted the first videos but then posted them again with parts hidden. This made people pay attention again.</p>
            <p>At first, the police said they could not share if the woman was a public official. But after many people complained, they announced that a group was formed to look into the matter.</p>
            <p>Today, a team from the Fangchenggang City Committee and Government in Guangxi shared the results of their investigation. They said the 28-year-old woman driving the Mercedes, whose last name is Hou, is not a public official herself. Her husband is a Level 2 firefighter at a fire station in Shangsi County, Fangchenggang City. The "administrative law enforcement ID" Ms. Hou showed belonged to her husband. She showed the ID to scare Mr. Li.</p>
            <p>The police are now looking into the bad effects Ms. Hou's actions had after they were shared online. Her husband, Mr. Li, did not keep his ID safe, which allowed it to be used illegally. He is being investigated by the Fangchenggang City Fire and Rescue Department for possibly breaking work rules.</p>
            <p>About Mr. Li thinking his private information was shared, the report said that Ms. Hou's family and Mr. Li's parents' home are close. They know each other. But Mr. Li has worked in another place for many years and did not know this. When the car problem happened, Ms. Hou's father, who was in her car, got out to talk and recognized Mr. Li. That is why he said Mr. Li's family address and other personal details at that time.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Ms. Hou and her father do not have "police phones" or other tools used by police and legal departments to look up people's information. So, they did not look up Mr. Li's information at the scene.</p>
            <p>Today, Chinese news outlet The Paper said that even an administrative law enforcement ID held by a Level 2 firefighter from a small town's fire station could be used by his wife to scare others. This shows that the idea of "showing off special power" still exists in some areas and is very strong. "Even a tiny bit of power is used to its fullest."</p>
            <p>This event also involved whether the police acted and responded to everyone in the right way. The news report said that in the age of social media, this "showing off special power" can become very big when people across the country pay attention. This can then become a national public issue. It causes big negative effects on the local area's image. This is a big lesson from this event.</p>
