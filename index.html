A city councilor in Hsinchu said that the city's cycling track, called a velodrome, has been fixed many times but is still not good. Recently, people found water on the track and uneven cracks. The city government said these problems are the contractor's job to fix, and they have told the contractor to improve them.

Another city councilor, Liu Yen-ling, said that the velodrome was supposed to be improved for a big cycling event. But the work was slow, and the money almost got taken back by the government. Because of this, the event had to be moved to another city, which was embarrassing for the whole country. She also said that even though the city claims the project is almost finished (99.03%), there are still many problems like water, cracks, and missing fences.

The Hsinchu City Government's Public Works Department said that the water and cracks are the contractor's responsibility to fix. They also mentioned that some damage to the track was made by machines when fixing the asphalt. They have asked the contractor to re-do it, and athletes might test the track by the end of July.

**Taipei wants to help Nvidia, talks with Shin Kong Life about land deal**

Nvidia wants to build its Taiwan main office in Taipei's Beitou-Shilin Technology Park. But there's a problem: another company, Shin Kong Life, owns the rights to the land. Taipei's Deputy Mayor, Lee Sze-chuan, said the best way to solve this is for the city and Shin Kong Life to agree to end their current land contract. Then, the city can arrange a special land deal for Nvidia.

Nvidia's boss, Jensen Huang, said in May that their Taiwan office would be in Beitou and Shilin. The Taipei City Government then started working with Nvidia every week. They found out Nvidia liked the T17 and T18 land plots, which Shin Kong Life got the rights for in February 2022. Shin Kong Life recently asked to directly transfer the land rights to Nvidia, but the city government said this doesn't follow the rules and might seem unfair to others.

The city government has told Shin Kong Life that they need to finish building on the land and get permits by 2029, or they will break the contract. Deputy Mayor Lee said the city hopes Shin Kong Life will work with them more actively. He also said that if the city buys back the land rights, they would need to offer it publicly again. But to help Nvidia build its headquarters, the city is asking if they can make a special agreement to give the land rights directly to Nvidia.

**Japanese seafood back in China after two years, three companies approved**

China's customs office announced today that three Japanese companies can now sell seafood to China again. This is happening after about two years. China had stopped buying Japanese seafood in August two years ago because of treated water released from the Fukushima nuclear power plant.

A Chinese Vice Premier, He Lifeng, met with a Japanese official, Yu Moriyama, at an expo in Osaka. He Lifeng said that China welcomes good quality Japanese seafood that meets Chinese rules. China's customs had already said last month that they would allow Japanese seafood imports again, but not from 10 specific areas, including Fukushima.

To start exporting again, Japanese companies need to register with China. Three companies have now been approved: one from Hokkaido and two from Aomori. Their registration is good for five years. When these companies send seafood, they need to include papers that show the products were checked for radiation and where they came from. Japan is still asking China to also allow seafood from the other 10 areas to be sold.
