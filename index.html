            <h1>Czech Republic Plans Global Meeting for Literature Museums, Invites Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The Czech National Literature Museum will hold a "World Meeting of Literature Museum Leaders" in 2026. They want to talk about what literature museums should do in the 21st century. The museum's director, Michal StehlÃ­k, met with Taiwan's Minister of Culture, Li Yuan. StehlÃ­k invited Taiwan to join, saying that Taiwan's ideas could offer new ways of thinking, not just European ones.</p>
            <p>On September 12, Mr. StehlÃ­k said that the meeting will discuss how to show literature, how to use new technology to make things digital, and how to work together. He called these "challenges that every director of a literature museum must face." He hopes Taiwan will come because he believes an Asian viewpoint from Taiwan can give new ideas.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Culture shared news that the Czech National Literature Museum is a national art center for literature. It works in a very similar way to Taiwan's National Museum of Taiwan Literature. Both are national organizations for literature.</p>
            <p>The Czech National Literature Museum started in 1952. Its job is to gather, organize, record, and show the history of Czech literature and books. It keeps important writers' lives, their works, and their belongings from the 18th century until today. It is seen as the most important place in the Czech Republic for saving and studying literature.</p>
            <p>Minister Li Yuan said that in 2024, the "Czech Writers' Month" chose Taiwan as its special country for the first time. This was the first time an Asian country was chosen in the event's 25-year history. During his trip to Europe, he visited the Czech National Literature Museum especially to learn from them.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan also said that the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, which started in 2003, is quite new compared to the Czech museum. He believes "Taiwan can learn many things from the Czech Republic about how to run a literature museum."</p>
            <p>Mr. StehlÃ­k explained that the Czech National Literature Museum has been collecting art and pictures related to writers since the beginning, to keep up with new technology. They also use art and interactive videos in their exhibitions. They use AI technology to show literature in more different ways.</p>
            <p>Mr. StehlÃ­k mentioned that the total length of the Czech National Literature Museum's collection is more than 7 kilometers. To make everything digital, they would need three times more workers and it would take 70 years. But with AI technology, reading and processing text has become faster. However, as a historian, he also warned that it will be harder in the future to know if a book or text was written by a human or by AI. He said that the difference between "written by a person or written by AI" might become unclear in history.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan talked about his own experience. In 2003, he started writing using his mobile phone. He said, "Before, literature museums mainly collected and showed handwritten papers or letters from writers. But now, people write on phones and computers. So, how to collect and show these new types of writings is a new challenge for literature museums in the future."</p>

            <h1>Strong 7.5 Earthquake Off Russia, Tsunami Warning Lifted</h1>
            <p>A very strong earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 happened in the sea near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. Taiwan's weather office, the Meteorological Administration, has said that the danger of a tsunami is now gone.</p>
            <p>Today, September 13, a big earthquake of 7.5 happened off the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula. The Meteorological Administration in Taiwan said that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has now confirmed that there is no longer a tsunami danger for the Pacific area.</p>
            <p>From 10:48 AM to 11:24 AM today, the Meteorological Administration sent out three messages about the tsunami. They said that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center told them about the 7.5 earthquake. It happened at 10:38 AM today, near the east coast of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, at 53.10 degrees North and 160.40 degrees East.</p>
            <p>At 11:52 AM, the Meteorological Administration sent its fourth tsunami message. It said that with the latest information from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, they could confirm that the tsunami danger for the Pacific area was now finished.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Symphony Orchestra Apologizes for Adult Ads on Facebook Page</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Symphony Orchestra (TSO) said sorry. This is because a short internet link on their Facebook page showed ads for adult products. Today, the TSO said they are sorry that people saw these bad advertisements.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Councilor Chen Chung-wen from the Kuomintang party said he got a complaint. Someone clicked a short link on the TSO's Facebook page and saw an advertisement for adult products. Councilor Chen said that the Taipei City Cultural Affairs Department should tell the TSO to fix this. They should also check if other posts have the same problem.</p>
            <p>The TSO explained that they use short links on their Facebook page. This helps them see how popular their posts are. They thought long website addresses with special codes might look bad on the page. So, to make the posts look nice and neat, they used a free service that makes short links.</p>
            <p>The TSO said that when you use a free service for short links, that service sometimes puts ads on the page you go to. This means the TSO could not control what ads were shown. So, the TSO will now only use their own website links that they can control. This will stop this kind of problem from happening again.</p>
