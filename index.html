            <h1>Yunlin County and Miaoli Mountain Areas to Watch for Heavy Rain; Eastern Taiwan Mountain Areas for Local Heavy Rain</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Central Weather Administration has updated its heavy rain warning. Strong clouds are forming, and this means there could be short periods of heavy rain. Nantou County and Chiayi County have already experienced heavy rain. Today, Yunlin County and the mountain areas of Miaoli County may have local heavy rain. Also, the western part of Taiwan and the mountain areas in the east may have some heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Please be careful of lightning, strong winds, rivers rising quickly, and hail. In mountain areas, please watch out for landslides, falling rocks, and sudden floods. In low-lying areas, please be careful of flooding.</p>

            <h1>Mountains to Watch for Heavy Rain on August 21st Afternoon; Tropical Low Pressure Expected This Weekend, Bringing More Moisture</h1>
            <p>The Weather Administration announced that today, because of a cold air mass high up, there were very strong air currents in the afternoon. People from New Taipei to Chiayi reported seeing hail. Tomorrow, in the afternoon, mountain areas should still be careful of local heavy rain. It is expected that a tropical low pressure system will form around the weekend and pass through the northern part of Luzon Island. This will slightly increase the moisture in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, due to the cold air mass high up, the air currents were even stronger. People reported seeing hail in parts of Xizhi in New Taipei, Taichung, Nantou, and Alishan in Chiayi.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, because of the strong air currents, many areas had heavy rain or local very heavy rain. Tomorrow, the cold air mass will move away. Most places will be cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, the western part of Taiwan and the mountain areas in the east will have local short thunderstorms. There is a chance of local heavy rain in all mountain areas, but the rain will be less strong than today.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, the temperature will generally be hot, about 32 to 35 degrees Celsius. But in Taipei, and in mountain areas of central and southern Taiwan, it could be over 36 degrees Celsius in some places. Before it rains, it will feel humid and hot everywhere.</p>
            <p>On August 22nd, there will be even less moisture. This will be the most stable day in the coming week. Most places will be cloudy to sunny. Only the Hengchun Peninsula will have a few short showers. In the afternoon, all mountain areas will have local short thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>For the weekend, the wind will start to blow from the east, and there will be slightly more moisture. The southeastern part of Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula will have local short showers. In the afternoon, the western part of Taiwan and the mountain areas in the east will have local short thunderstorms. Starting from August 25th, the moisture will increase a bit more. The eastern part of Taiwan, and in the afternoon, the western part of Taiwan and Yilan, will easily have thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Looking at the next week, Taiwan will mainly be affected by the Pacific high pressure system. But right now, there is a large area of low pressure from the South China Sea to the east of the Philippines. A tropical disturbance is developing there. It is expected that this tropical disturbance east of the Philippines may become a tropical low pressure system over the weekend. It will pass through the northern part of Luzon Island during the weekend and enter the South China Sea next week, moving towards the Indochina Peninsula. It will not directly affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Because of the large low pressure area and the possible tropical low pressure system, easterly winds and moisture will come to Taiwan. Current information shows that it is unlikely for the tropical low pressure system to become a typhoon before or after it passes Luzon. The Weather Administration will continue to watch it.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs Sees AI Business Opportunities, Expects Export Orders to Rise for 7th Month in August, Not Afraid of Tariff Impact</h1>
            <p>The AI business is very active, and export orders in July were better than expected. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that even though the temporary tariff rate from the US is 20% and the "232 investigation" results are not out yet, they are positive about AI business opportunities in the second half of the year. Electronic and information and communication products will support the orders, and it is expected that orders in August will continue to have double-digit growth.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs released statistics on export orders. In July, export orders were 57.64 billion US dollars. This is a new high for the same period in history, and it is a 15.2% increase from last year. This is the sixth month in a row that orders have grown. From January to July this year, the total orders reached 378.21 billion US dollars, which is a 16.4% increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that export orders in August will be between 55.5 billion and 57.5 billion US dollars, with an increase of 10.5% to 14.5% compared to last year. However, because Taiwan's temporary tariff rate is 20% from the US and the "232 investigation" results are not out yet, there are still uncertain factors. So, it is hard to predict how the second half of the year will perform.</p>
            <p>The orders in July were better than expected mainly because AI led to high-end semiconductors and servers growing more than expected. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics recently raised the economic growth forecast for 2025 to 4.45%. AI business opportunities will continue to grow steadily in the second half of the year, which will keep supporting export orders.</p>
            <p>Looking at the main types of goods, in July, electronic product orders reached 22.59 billion US dollars. This is a new high for the same period, with a 24.8% increase from last year. The Ministry analyzed that strong demand for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing led to more orders for IC manufacturing, IC design, memory, printed circuit boards, and chip channels.</p>
            <p>In July, information and communication product orders reached 16.32 billion US dollars, also a new high for the same period, with a 15.5% increase from last year. Strong demand for artificial intelligence and cloud applications helped server, network communication products, and graphics card orders grow.</p>
            <p>For traditional goods, basic metals decreased by 12.6% compared to last year, and plastic and rubber products decreased by 10.3%. These were the only two main types of goods that had negative growth. Chemical products grew by 7.8% compared to last year because downstream customers restocked their inventory, and medicine orders increased.</p>
            <p>Currently, the temporary tariffs from the US affect traditional industries more. The Executive Yuan has also launched policies to support industries. However, it is still important to keep watching the impact on traditional industries. For example, mid-to-high-end machine tools compete with Japan and Germany, and these two countries have lower tariff rates than Taiwan. Low-end machine tools compete with China, which has higher tariff rates than Taiwan, so the impact is relatively lower.</p>
            <p>In addition, the US is encouraging manufacturing to return, which has increased orders for automated machinery products. In July, orders reached 1.77 billion US dollars, a 6.2% increase from last year. Because of the need for semiconductor factory expansion, in the long run, this will lead to continued growth in semiconductor equipment and automated equipment.</p>
            <p>However, it is also important to watch if tariffs cause demand to drop, or if companies delay or stop investing. This could affect the orders for the machinery industry.</p>
            <p>The second half of the year is the peak season for new electronic products. People are watching the shipping rush. The shipping rush for consumer electronic products might happen in August or September. Right now, it is about preparing parts from upstream suppliers. Also, with the AI business opportunities, the overall growth in electronic products is better than expected.</p>
            <p>Regarding the early shipping rush affected by US tariff policies, some manufacturers reported that the shipping rush has slowed down. This includes companies in basic metals, machinery, and plastic and rubber industries. Some industries even saw their orders decrease compared to the previous month.</p>
