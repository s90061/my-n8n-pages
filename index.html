        const text = `**Which Chipmakers Are at Risk if US Revokes China Waivers?**

The United States might cancel special permissions that allow global chipmakers to send American technology to China. This action could significantly impact certain chip companies, especially those dealing with advanced technology for AI and data centers. If these waivers are removed, major companies with large sales in China, such as Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, could see a decrease in their income. This move would intensify the technology competition between the US and China, pushing chipmakers to change their supply chains and business plans.

**Chinese Tugboat "United Ocean Engineering 5001" Enters Taiwan's Waters Unhindered**

A large Chinese tugboat named "United Ocean Engineering 5001" reportedly entered Taiwan's territorial waters without any interception, carrying an unknown cargo. The Hengchun Coast Guard's PP3559 vessel apparently took no action, citing an inability to receive the ship's signal. Taiwan ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone) has issued a warning, expressing concern about the "United Ocean Engineering 5001"'s unclear intentions. There are fears that if it is towing large military equipment or engaging in 'grey zone' intrusions, potentially damaging Taiwan's undersea cables, it should be closely monitored and intercepted.

**The $480 Million Scam Playbook: Chinese Microcap IPOs Are Bleeding U.S. Investors**

Many American investors are reportedly falling into a clear fraud scheme: small Chinese companies, like Jayud Global Logistics and China Liberal Education, have their initial public offerings (IPOs) on Nasdaq, only to see their stock prices drop sharply just weeks later. These scams often begin with convincing ads on social media like Facebook or WhatsApp and then turn into "pump-and-dump" operations. This means the stock price is artificially increased, after which the manipulators sell their shares, causing significant losses for ordinary investors. This pattern suggests a new form of stock market manipulation, where millions are raised in IPOs, and then the value plummets, causing substantial harm to investors.
