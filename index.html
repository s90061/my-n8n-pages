            <h1>The Ministry of Transportation helps people fix their homes by connecting them with companies.</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest recently affected southern Taiwan. Many people's homes were badly damaged. The Ministry of Transportation said today that there are not enough workers or materials right now. So, they have asked different parts of the ministry to connect people with companies. They hope to help residents find workers to fix their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation wrote on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po held a meeting yesterday. He brought together different parts of the ministry to check the progress of repairs in the Tainan disaster areas and decide what to do next. They have already visited over 100 damaged homes. They are also looking at all available workers and resources. They want to do their best to help people rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people cannot find workers to do repairs because there are not enough workers, materials, or machines. The government has asked all ministries to help. They have also given each ministry an area to take care of. The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for the Xinying, Yanshui, Baihe, and Houbi areas in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people who want to repair their homes can first register with their district chief. Then, the Ministry of Transportation will connect different parts of the ministry to find companies. After that, residents will talk with the companies. Once they agree, they will sign a simple contract. The Ministry of Transportation's main job is to connect people with companies; it does not pay money for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make the rebuilding after the disaster faster, the Ministry of Transportation has also set rules for action. Besides connecting people with companies, they will first help old, single-story houses and houses with roofs blown off that people cannot live in anymore. This is immediate help. Also, waste materials like asbestos tiles should be gathered in one place. The district office will then help remove them.</p>
