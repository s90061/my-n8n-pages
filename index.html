Taiwanese companies are planning to invest more in the United States. This is happening because of former US President Trump's new tax policies. Many Taiwanese businesses want to make sure their supply chains stay strong, so they are looking at investing more in America.

Several Taiwanese banks are also trying to get more business in the US. They are opening more offices and branches there. For example, CTBC Bank and First Bank are two of the biggest Taiwanese banks with many locations in the US. They want to help Taiwanese companies with their money needs, especially in places like Arizona, where a large chip-making company is building a factory, and Texas, where many Taiwanese tech companies are setting up.

Other banks like Bank SinoPac and E.SUN Bank are also growing their presence in the US. They see good chances to help companies in important areas like computer chips, AI servers, car making, and medicine. Banks believe that new US policies will help these industries grow, bringing more business for them.

**Flash Floods in Texas Kill At Least 13, 23 Girls Missing from Camp**

Heavy rains caused very bad floods in central-south Texas last night. Police said today that at least 13 people have died. Also, about 23 girls who were at a summer camp are now missing.

The area hit hardest was northwest of San Antonio, in Kerr County. The police chief there said that the number of people who died might go up. The governor of Texas said some of the people who died were children. The missing girls were at a camp near the Guadalupe River, which rose very quickly by 8 meters in just 45 minutes.

Officials are using boats and helicopters to look for the missing girls. The camp director said they had a "disaster" and no electricity, water, or internet. People have been told to stay away from the flooded areas because many roads are closed.

**Hamas Says Yes to US Ceasefire Plan in Gaza**

Hamas, a Palestinian group, said today they are happy with a plan for a ceasefire in Gaza. The United States helped create this plan. Hamas is ready to talk about how to make the plan happen, which would include releasing hostages and ending the fighting.

Earlier, former US President Trump mentioned a plan for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. He said he expected everyone involved to respond soon. Hamas said they have talked about the plan and are ready to start serious discussions to make it work.

However, there might still be some difficulties. A Palestinian official close to Hamas said they still have questions about getting aid into Gaza, using the Rafah border crossing to Egypt, and when Israeli soldiers will leave. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has not yet said anything about Trump's statement. There are still big differences between the two sides, especially about Hamas giving up its weapons.
