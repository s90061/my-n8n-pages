            <h1>Trump: US and Philippines Finish Trade Deal, US to Charge 19% Tax on Goods</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. today in Washington. After their meeting, President Trump said that the US and the Philippines "finished a trade deal." This deal means the Philippines will let American goods into their market without any taxes. On the other hand, the US will put a 19% tax on goods from the Philippines. This 19% tax is a little less than the 20% tax Trump had talked about before.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. is the first leader from Southeast Asia to meet President Trump since Trump returned to the White House. Since early April, when Trump started using special taxes on goods, the US has made trade deals with other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Trump told reporters during his meeting with Marcos Jr. at the White House that they would talk about trade. He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal," but he did not give more details.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Trump quickly posted on his social media site, Truth Social. He wrote that the meeting felt good, and "We finished the trade deal." Based on the deal, the Philippines will open its market to the US and charge no taxes. The Philippines will pay a 19% tax to the US. Also, both countries will work together on military matters.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that Marcos Jr. is a "very good and strong negotiator."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an important friend of the US in Asia. Reports from other countries say that last year, the US bought 5 billion US dollars more from the Philippines than it sold to them. The total trade between the US and the Philippines was 23.5 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Trump sent letters about taxes to more than 20 countries. One letter went to Marcos Jr. It said that starting August 1st, the tax on goods from the Philippines to the US would go up to 20%. This was higher than the 17% suggested in April. The Philippines wanted to get a better trade deal before the August 1st deadline.</p>

            <h1>White House to Share New Plan for AI: Send US Technology Abroad, Focus on Growing</h1>
            <p>A paper seen by Reuters shows that the White House in the US plans to share a new idea tomorrow. This idea asks to send American Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to other countries. It also aims to fight state rules that are too strict and stop AI from growing well.</p>
            <p>The Reuters news agency saw a short summary of the plan. It says the White House will stop giving federal money for AI to states that have very tough rules about AI. It will also ask the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to check if state rules go against federal rules.</p>
            <p>This plan will also help develop AI that is "open source" and "open weight." This means the code and models are available for others to use and improve. It will also "send US AI technology to other places through complete systems" and a plan from the Commerce Department for data centers.</p>
            <p>The paper says this plan will "focus on making jobs and big changes in industries using AI. It will give more power to American workers."</p>
            <p>Janet Egan, who works at a US think tank called "The Center for a New American Security," said that this plan is a change. She said it moves from President Biden's past ideas of "limiting AI" to thinking about "how to spread the basic technology that helps the whole world." Reuters described it this way.</p>
            <p>The summary also said that even though the plan focuses on making AI grow, it still talks about how important it is to "stop bad uses and get ready for future problems with AI."</p>
            <p>In January this year, US President Donald Trump told his government to make a plan. This plan was to make "America the world's main place for artificial intelligence" and to make it easier for AI to grow fast by removing rules that cause problems.</p>
            <p>This report will come out tomorrow. It has ideas from the National Security Council (NSC). Trump will give an important speech tomorrow at an event called "Winning the AI Race." This event is put together by David Sacks, an expert on AI and cryptocurrency for the White House, and a host from the All-In podcast.</p>

            <h1>Trump Meets Marcos Jr.: US and Philippines Close to a Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump welcomed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the White House today. They had a meeting. Trump said they would talk about trade and other topics. He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal." Trump added that Marcos Jr. is a very strong negotiator.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. is the first leader from a Southeast Asian country to meet with Trump since Trump came back to the White House. In early April, Trump started using special taxes on goods. Since then, the US has made trade deals with two Southeast Asian countries: Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump spoke to reporters during his meeting with Marcos Jr. in the Oval Office at the White House. He said they would talk about trade, war, and peace. He said the Philippines is very important for military matters. Also, the US and the Philippines have recently had "some great military training."</p>
            <p>He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal," but he did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked how close they were to an agreement. Trump only answered that Marcos Jr. is a "very strong negotiator." He said they had not made a deal yet "because he (Marcos Jr.) was too strong during the talks."</p>
            <p>But Trump also said, "We might agree on some things."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is one of the US's important friends in Asia. The government in Manila hopes to get a better trade deal before August 1st, which is a deadline.</p>
            <p>Reports from other countries say that last year, the US bought 5 billion US dollars more from the Philippines than it sold to them. The total trade between the US and the Philippines was 23.5 billion US dollars. Earlier this month, Trump sent a letter to Marcos Jr. about taxes. It said that starting August 1st, the tax on goods from the Philippines to the US would likely go up to 20%. This was higher than the 17% suggested in April.</p>
