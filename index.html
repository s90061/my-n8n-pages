            <h1>How to Stay Safe During a Tsunami: Advice from the US National Weather Service</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 30) Early this morning, a strong earthquake of 8.8 magnitude happened in Kamchatka, Far East Russia. Many places on the US West Coast, Alaska, and other Pacific countries like Japan received different levels of tsunami warnings. Here are the steps the US National Weather Service suggests taking when a tsunami happens.</p>
            <p>What is a Tsunami?</p>
            <p>The National Ocean Service, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the US, says a tsunami is a series of very large waves caused by earthquakes or volcanoes erupting underwater. Earthquakes can make the ocean water move suddenly. This creates strong currents and huge waves. The closer these big waves get to the shore, the taller they become.</p>
            <p>A tsunami is made of many waves, and it can last for a long time. The first wave is not always the biggest. Later waves might suddenly get much taller. A big tsunami can last for several days. For example, Japan has warned that the tsunami caused by the Kamchatka Peninsula earthquake might last for more than one day.</p>
            <p>How are Tsunamis Predicted?</p>
            <p>According to the U.S. National Weather Service, tsunamis cannot be predicted exactly. Tsunami warning centers base their predictions on the size and location of the earthquake that caused the tsunami. After they detect a tsunami, they use computer models to guess how tall the waves will be, where they will hit, and when they will arrive.</p>
            <p>NOAA uses a system called DART (Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis). They also work with a larger international network. This system measures changes in water pressure when tsunami waves pass over it. This helps them detect, measure, and report tsunamis in the ocean right away.</p>
            <p>What to Do When a Tsunami Warning is Issued?</p>
            <p>The US National Weather Service uses a four-level tsunami alert system, from most serious to least serious: warning, advisory, watch, and information statement.</p>
            <p>People should also be aware of natural signs that a tsunami is coming. These include hearing a loud ocean roar, seeing the water level suddenly go up or down, or the water quickly pulling back from the shore.</p>
            <p>A "tsunami warning" is the highest level alert. The National Weather Service explains that it means: "Take action, danger! A tsunami that will cause widespread flooding is expected or is happening. Dangerous coastal floods and strong ocean currents may occur. This might continue for several hours or days after the first wave arrives."</p>
            <p>If a tsunami warning is issued, officials advise people to leave immediately. Go to high ground and as far inland as you can. This means at least 30 meters above sea level or 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) inland from the coast. Always follow the instructions from local authorities.</p>
            <p>The National Weather Service reminds us that even though people should go to high places, most tall buildings are not built to stand against a tsunami. However, if there are no other choices, the higher floors of some strong tall buildings might offer some safety.</p>
            <p>The Ready.gov website from the US Department of Homeland Security suggests this: If you are on a boat at sea during a tsunami warning, you should go out into deep water until you are in a safe area. If you are in a harbor, you should leave your boat and move to a safe area on land.</p>
            <p>For international partners in the Pacific and Caribbean, the US only gives "tsunami threat" notifications, not full warnings. The National Weather Service says that a tsunami threat message explains how a tsunami might affect people, buildings, and nature. Then, each country decides what kind of alert to issue themselves.</p>

            <h1>Raw Materials Like Nickel and Molybdenum Rise, Hua Hsin Increases Prices for Some Stainless Steel Rods in August</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 30) Hua Hsin Lihua, a company that makes cables and stainless steel, announced today that the prices for important stainless steel materials like nickel and molybdenum have gone up. Also, the New Taiwan Dollar has become weaker compared to other currencies. These things have made the total cost for the steel factory higher. After thinking about both the market and the costs, the company has decided to increase the prices for some of their stainless steel rod products in August.</p>
            <p>Hua Hsin stated that the price for 300 series stainless steel rods will increase by NT$2,000 per ton. The extra cost for free-cutting steel will go up by NT$1,000 per ton, and the extra cost for 316 steel will also increase by NT$1,000 per ton. The prices for 200 series and 400 series steel will stay the same.</p>
            <p>Hua Hsin explained that even though trade talks between Taiwan and the US are still happening, the main steel-exporting countries in Asia have already made agreements with the US. Because of this, people are less unsure about the market, which helps the demand for steel get better.</p>
