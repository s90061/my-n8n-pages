            <h1>Trump Extends TikTok Deadline Again, Will Talk with Xi Jinping</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Donald Trump said that an agreement has been made with China about the video app TikTok. He will talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the 19th to "confirm everything." After this, the White House released an order from Trump, which extends the TikTok deadline again until December 16.</p>
            <p>A US law said that TikTok must be sold to a company that is not Chinese, or it would be banned. This was for national security. This law was supposed to start the day before Trump became president in January this year. But when Trump took office, he said he would give TikTok 75 more days to either sell or be banned in the US. Then, he extended it a second time until June 19, and then again until September 17.</p>
            <p>Just before the old deadline ended, Trump signed an order today to extend the TikTok deadline until December 16. This is the fourth time he has delayed the ban on this popular video app in America.</p>
            <p>This morning, as Trump left the White House to visit the UK, he told reporters: "We have reached an agreement on TikTok. I have made a deal with China. I will speak with President Xi Jinping on Friday to confirm all the details."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that "a group of very big companies want to buy it."</p>
            <p>News from other countries said that the US and China finished their talks about taxes and money rules in Madrid, Spain, yesterday. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that both sides have a basic agreement for TikTok.</p>
            <p>For a long time, Trump wanted to ban TikTok or make ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, sell its part of TikTok. But he later changed his mind and promised to protect TikTok. He believes TikTok helped him get support from young voters in the US election last November.</p>
            <p>TikTok is one of the most used social media apps in the US, with about 170 million American users.</p>
