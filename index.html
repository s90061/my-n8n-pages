            <p>China Airlines sees Phoenix as an important new technology hub in the American Southwest. There is a growing need for business travel there.

From Phoenix, passengers can easily connect to other cities in the United States using many flight routes.</p>
            <p>China Airlines stated that the Taipei-Phoenix route will be its seventh direct passenger route in North America. Flights will be on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays. The flight from Taipei to Phoenix (CI036) will leave Taoyuan Airport at 10:55 AM. It will fly directly to Phoenix without stopping and arrive at 8:00 AM local time.

            <h1>Hepatitis C Positive Rate is 1.5%; Health Agency to Offer More Free Screenings Starting in August</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) â€“ The Health Promotion Administration (HPA) announced today that the positive rate for Hepatitis C in Taiwan has fallen from 3.6% in 2011 to 1.5% this year. Starting in August, the HPA will expand free screening for Hepatitis B and C. People born before 1986 and up to 79 years old can get one free screening in their lifetime. About 2 million people are expected to benefit.</p>
            <p>July 28 is "World Hepatitis Day." The World Health Organization (WHO)'s theme for this year's World Hepatitis Day is "Hepatitis: Letâ€™s Break It Down." It asks countries to act faster to remove things that stop hepatitis prevention and liver cancer prevention. These include high costs, social stigma, and unequal access to medical care.</p>
            <p>The HPA said in a press release that to find and treat hepatitis early, it began including Hepatitis B and C screenings in its preventive health services in 2011. It offered one free screening in a person's lifetime for people aged 45 to 79. By combining public health and medical screening information, improving cloud systems, encouraging hospitals to screen more people, and sending positive patients for tests and treatment, the HPA is actively working to find and treat cases early.</p>
            <p>The HPA stated that by March of this year, over 7.34 million people aged 45 to 79 across the country had been tested for Hepatitis C. The Hepatitis C positive rate in Taiwan dropped from 3.6% in 2011 to 1.5% this year. The Hepatitis B rate also dropped from 15.6% to 9.5%. This creates a good foundation for Taiwan to meet its goal of eliminating Hepatitis C by 2025.</p>
            <p>HPA Director-General Wu Chao-chun said that starting August 1 this year, the HPA will promote and expand the age range for Hepatitis B and C screenings. Originally, people aged 45 to 79 could get one free screening in their lifetime. This will now include people born before 1986 and up to 79 years old. This step helps Taiwan move towards the WHO's goal of "eliminating viral hepatitis" by 2030.</p>
            <p>Wu Chien-yuan, head of the HPA's Chronic Disease Control Division, said that compared to the old screening rules, about 2 million more people will now be able to get screened.</p>
            <p>Wu Chao-chun said in a press release that the HPA aims to eliminate Hepatitis C by 2025. He urged people to get screened and follow treatment. If they do, they can be fully cured and avoid the risk of liver cirrhosis or liver cancer in the future.</p>
            <p>The HPA also reminded people that good daily habits are very important for preventing hepatitis, in addition to getting screened. Hepatitis B can spread through blood and body fluids, so people should not share needles, toothbrushes, razors, or other personal items. People who have not received the Hepatitis B vaccine can ask medical centers about getting vaccinated. Hepatitis C mainly spreads through blood. Avoiding unsafe ear piercing, tattoos, and acupuncture is also an important way to prevent it. (Edited by Guan Zhong-wei) 1140725</p>

            <h1>Security Asks to Photograph Man with Recall Fan; Taipei Metro: Will Teach Staff Better</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) â€“ A person riding the metro with a fan that had words about a recall on it was asked by a security guard if they could take a photo because the fan was seen as controversial. Taipei Metro said today that the guard was not trying to stop the person. However, the way the guard spoke made the person feel bad. Taipei Metro will teach its staff more to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
            <p>A user posted on Threads, a social media platform, that after going to an event held by the "Alliance Against Communism for Taiwan" in front of the Presidential Office yesterday, they took the metro home with a fan that said "Agree to Recall." On the train, a security guard thought the fan was controversial and asked to take a photo for a report.</p>
            <p>The user felt that they had put the fan in a bag and placed it quietly between their feet. They did not wave it or speak loudly. Also, during the event, many people had recall-related materials and went in and out of the metro. The user wondered what rule they had broken.</p>
            <p>Taipei Rapid Transit Corporation (Taipei Metro) responded in a written message. They said that the passenger was simply riding the metro. They did not put up, hang, hand out, or announce any promotional items. They also did not block pathways or affect other passengers. So, station staff should not stop them.</p>
            <p>Taipei Metro explained that they found out the security guard was patrolling the train car. When the guard saw the passenger had an item related to a recall, they asked the passenger if they agreed to a photo to check the item. The guard was not trying to stop or tell the passenger they could not carry the item.</p>
            <p>However, Taipei Metro said that the way the security guard talked made the passenger feel bad. Taipei Metro will give its staff more training on how to handle similar situations to avoid outside misunderstanding. (Edited by Fang Pei-ching, Huang Ming-hsi) 1140725</p>
