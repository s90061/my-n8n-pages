            <h1>US Stock Markets Go Up; Taiwan Stock Market to Stay Strong, Watch Nvidia Report</h1>
            <p>The four main US stock market indexes closed higher. This happened even after US President Donald Trump ordered Lisa Cook to leave her job on the Federal Reserve Board. Investment experts say that everyone is waiting for Nvidia's financial report on August 28th. Also, in September, there will be a semiconductor exhibition and a Taipei aerospace and defense exhibition. These events will help different kinds of stocks to do well. So, the Taiwan stock market is expected to stay strong with some ups and downs.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that last week, Trump asked Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook to resign. On the evening of August 25th, he wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social." He shared claims that Cook lied about a mortgage contract. Because of this, he said Cook was fired and that it was "effective immediately."</p>
            <p>On August 26th, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 135.60 points, or 0.30%, closing at 45418.07 points. The S&P 500 went up by 26.62 points, or 0.41%, closing at 6456.94 points. The Nasdaq Index went up by 94.98 points, or 0.44%, closing at 21544.27 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 51.62 points, or 0.90%, closing at 5807.92 points.</p>
            <p>On August 26th, the Taiwan stock market first dropped more than 160 points to 24113.03 points. But TSMC, a big and important company, helped to keep the market stable. Robot, drone, and defense stocks all went up and hit their daily limits. The main index then went up at the end of the day. It closed with a rise of 27.72 points, reaching 24305.1 points. The total money traded was 514.013 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went up by 1.33%, closing at 238.72 US dollars. Nvidia's stock went up by 1.08%, closing at 181.77 US dollars.</p>
            <p>In other company news, Apple has officially sent out invitations. They announced that their autumn product launch event will start at 1 AM Taiwan time on September 10th. People expect them to show the new iPhone 17 series phones.</p>
            <p>The chairman of Shinkong Steel, a big company that cuts and sells steel, Mr. Su Ming-te, held a meeting with investors on August 26th. He said that the company has orders worth over 10 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Even with the impact of matching tariffs, he believes that orders will become stable in the second half of the year. Also, government building projects will move faster in the fourth quarter. Their storage and logistics business brings in steady money. This means the company's business this year might grow more than last year.</p>
            <p>TM Robot, a company under Quanta Group, held a meeting about its business before going public on August 26th. Chairman Ho Shih-chih said that starting in September, TM Robot might show samples of robots that use Nvidia's Jetson Thor computer system.</p>

            <h1>Six Areas, Including New Taipei and Taoyuan, Get High Temperature Warnings; Expert Says It Will Be Hot Until August 30th</h1>
            <p>Today, the weather agency announced high temperature warnings for six areas, including New Taipei City, Taipei City, and Taoyuan City. New Taipei and Taoyuan could reach 38 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Wu Te-jung said it will be hot everywhere until August 30th. People should also watch out for strong thunderstorms in the afternoon. Next week, moisture from the south will move north, and temperatures will drop a little. But strong afternoon thunderstorms will still be possible.</p>
            <p>Wu Te-jung, who is an assistant professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote in his weather column today. He said that the newest European weather models show that a tropical disturbance is entering the South China Sea today. Tomorrow and on August 29th, it will slowly develop. It has a low-to-medium chance of becoming a typhoon, about 40%. Its path looks similar to Typhoon Swordfish.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu pointed out that the newest American weather models show that the average path of the storm is towards the northwest. This is a bit more north than Swordfish. But individual models show very different paths, and the storm is expected to be weak. Also, the newest models show that next week, other tropical weather systems will be active far east of Taiwan. This means the northwest Pacific Ocean is still in its typhoon season.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Central Weather Agency issued high temperature warnings. The weather in many places will be very hot. New Taipei City and Taoyuan City are under a red warning, meaning there is a chance of continuous extreme high temperatures of 38 degrees Celsius. Taipei City and Chiayi County are under an orange warning, meaning there is a chance of continuous high temperatures of 36 degrees Celsius. Taichung City and Changhua County are under a yellow warning, meaning people should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu noted that the newest European models show that from today until August 30th, most places will be sunny with some clouds. It will be very hot. The sun's UV rays will be at dangerous levels around noon. So, people need to protect themselves from the sun and avoid heatstroke. More moisture will come from the south. Hualien, Taitung, and Pingtung may have some short periods of rain. The atmosphere will not be stable. In the afternoon, there may be local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains. Sometimes, these storms might spread to the plains in central and southern Taiwan. People need to be careful of strong thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also said that the newest European models show that from August 31st to September 2nd, moisture from the south will move north. Most places will be cloudy with some sun. Temperatures will go down slightly, but northern Taiwan will still be quite hot. The eastern and southern parts of Taiwan may have some local short rains. In the afternoon, there might be local showers or thunderstorms in all areas, and there is still a chance of strong thunderstorms.</p>

            <h1>US Cancels Small Package Tax Rule; 25 Countries Stop Sending Mail to US</h1>
            <p>Today, a United Nations agency for postal services said that 25 countries have stopped sending packages to the United States. This happened because the US government under President Trump removed a rule that allowed small packages to enter the country without extra taxes. This change has created a lot of confusion.</p>
            <p>News agencies Reuters and Agence France-Presse reported that the Universal Postal Union (UPU) is based in Switzerland. It has 192 member countries and helps them work together on postal services. The UPU said that on August 25th, they sent a letter to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. In the letter, they said they were worried about the stopped shipments.</p>
            <p>Some countries like Australia, Norway, and Switzerland have publicly said they stopped sending mail. However, the UPU did not name all the specific countries that have stopped shipments.</p>
            <p>In July, the Trump government announced that starting August 29th, they would stop a rule called "de minimis." This rule allowed international packages worth less than 800 US dollars to come into the US with very little paperwork or taxes.</p>
            <p>The Universal Postal Union said that countries will keep stopping shipments to the US. This will continue until the US government makes it clearer how they plan to carry out the new rules.</p>
