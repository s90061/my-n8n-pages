            <h1>National Filial Piety Award Winners Are Over 60 Years Old, Showing the Importance of Late-Life Companionship and Support Between Generations</h1>
            <p>The 2025 National Filial Piety Awards ceremony will be held on August 13th at the Penghu County Performing Arts Center. A total of 30 people will receive awards. The Ministry of the Interior said that 20 of this year's award winners are over 60 years old. This shows that support and spending time with older people are becoming more important. It also highlights how important and useful "wise filial piety" is today.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of the Interior said in a press release today that the National Filial Piety Awards have been given for 43 years. Every year, through public selection, they find and honor ordinary heroes who quietly take care of their families. This helps society value and continue the tradition of filial piety. The 2025 National Filial Piety Awards ceremony will be on August 13th at the Penghu County Performing Arts Center.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of the Interior also said that this year's National Filial Piety Awards followed the idea of "different kinds of filial piety." They chose 30 award winners in five groups: long-term care, good use of resources, helping others achieve goals, working together, and showing respect to parents. For example, Lin Yu-tsai from Penghu County, in the long-term care group, has patiently helped her mother go to the doctor and get better for over 20 years. She has taken care of her mother without complaining and supported her through hard times. Yu Su-ching from Taichung City, in the good use of resources group, applied for long-term care services for her father-in-law. She brought in an oxygen machine and equipment to check blood oxygen. She also trained to be a nursing assistant in an integrated ward and got a care license. She personally helped care for her father-in-law when he was in the hospital.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is now a super-aged society. The Ministry of the Interior said that the average age of this year's award winners and the family members they care for has also increased. This year, 20 winners are over 60 years old, and 3 of the people they care for are over 100 years old. This shows that spending time with older people and support between generations are more and more valued. It also further highlights how important and useful "wise filial piety" is today.</p>
            <p>To show respect to the award winners, the Ministry of the Interior gives each winner NT$50,000 and a trophy. Low-income families also get an extra NT$30,000. This is to encourage more people to value family love and practice filial piety in time. The Ministry of the Interior also said that you can see more stories of this year's award winners in the "2025 Filial Piety Awards Album" (https://www.moi.gov.tw/cl.aspx?n=11177).

            <h1>Dong Yi-chun from Tainan First High School Wins Teacher Award for Creating Museum Research Course</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 2nd, CNA reporter Chen Chih-chung) Dong Yi-chun, a teacher at Tainan First High School, has worked in art education for many years. She created the first museum research course. This course encourages students to use art as a way to connect local culture with the world and to inspire them to learn. She received this year's Teacher of the Year Award.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Education released a press release. It introduced eight teachers who won the Teacher of the Year Award from schools under the K-12 Education Administration. Dong Yi-chun, a teacher at Tainan First High School, created the first and only "Museum Research, Visit, and Practice" course in the country. This course combines humanities, technology, and art. She guides students to plan real exhibitions. This helps them understand culture and take part in public activities. She also worked with the National Museum of Taiwan History for an exhibition. She won the 2018 Ministry of Education Teaching Excellence Gold Award.</p>
            <p>Besides her new courses, Dong Yi-chun also believes in "teaching everyone." She creates special lessons with passion and love for all students, including those with special needs, in regular classes, and in gifted classes. She uses basic ideas to help students do things they thought were impossible. She creates amazing results, showing that "music is not only art, but also a way to connect with love and care."</p>
            <p>Su Yong-ching, a teacher at Kinmen High School, grew up on the main island of Taiwan. Her first teaching job was at Kinmen High School. She stayed in Kinmen, an island away from the city, for 18 years. She saw that students in rural areas felt lost and faced difficulties. So, she started to lead teachers to work together across different subjects. She created the "Kinmen Studies" course. This course helps students explore their hometown and understand themselves. It also helps them gain confidence through hands-on activities.</p>
            <p>Jiang Tseng Wei-mei, a director at Hualien Commercial High School, believes that education can change lives. She went back to her old school, Hualien Commercial High School, to teach. For 27 years, she has kept bringing in resources and new ways of teaching. She works in education with passion and energy. Students, parents, and colleagues see her as a superhero. She is happy to take on big responsibilities and helps students avoid mistakes. The smiles of students, the encouragement from colleagues, and the support from parents are what keep her going.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced the list of 2025 Teacher of the Year Award winners in July. A total of 72 teachers received this highest honor in education. The official award ceremony is planned for September 18th in Taipei. (Editor: Wu Su-rou) 1140802</p>

            <h1>Reuters: CapitalG and Nvidia Talking About Investing in VastData</h1>
            <p>(New York/San Francisco, August 1st, Reuters) Two sources said that CapitalG, which is part of Google's parent company Alphabet and invests in growing companies, is talking with Nvidia, a big chip company. They are discussing investing in Vast Data, a new company that builds infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this investment round could make Vast Data worth as much as 30 billion US dollars (about 892.2 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the matter said that more attention is being given to companies that build the main parts of AI. Vast Data is getting billions of dollars from many big tech companies, private equity firms, and venture capitalists. If the deal happens, Vast Data will become one of the most valuable new AI companies.</p>
            <p>According to the sources, CapitalG and Nvidia, who already support Vast Data, are currently talking about being part of this investment round. The deal might be finished in a few weeks. The sources asked to remain anonymous because the talks are private.</p>
            <p>Vast Data, based in New York, develops storage technology for large AI data centers. This technology helps transfer data efficiently between Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) made by companies like Nvidia.</p>
            <p>Banks and experts said that Vast Data's customers include companies like Elon Musk's xAI and the cloud computing company CoreWeave. Vast Data's importance in the AI supply chain makes it an attractive company for others to buy.</p>
            <p>Nvidia did not want to comment. Vast Data and CapitalG did not immediately reply to requests for comments from reporters. (Translator: Li Pei-shan/Reviewer: Chang Hsiao-wen) 1140802</p>
