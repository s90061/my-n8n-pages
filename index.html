            <h1>German High-Speed Trains Have Special Rooms for Babies and Toddlers</h1>
            <p>Recently, Taiwan's high-speed trains started quiet areas, and many people talked about it. Other countries' train systems do things differently. This shows how they think about public spaces and talking to others.</p>
            <p>German trains are sometimes late, but they are very good for families. On the Intercity Express (ICE) trains, there are "toddler rooms." The walls have animal pictures. There is a big table where children can draw. You can also put baby strollers there. There is a changing table for babies and safe power outlets. This helps parents with young children enjoy their trip.</p>
            <p>The "toddler room" is a small, closed room made by German Rail. It is for families with children aged 0 to 5. In the room, there is a place for strollers and safe plugs to warm milk or food.</p>
            <p>Inside the room, there are two seats facing each other. The walls are colorful. In the middle, there is a very big table with cute pictures of train travel. You can put toys and baby things on it. German Rail also gives drawing books and crayons for small children to draw during the journey.</p>
            <p>Nadja, a mother from Stuttgart, traveled with her two-year-old daughter on a long ICE train. It was their first time in a toddler room. Nadja told the news agency, "We have the whole room to ourselves. The stroller fits, and my daughter can play, talk, and eat without bothering other people."</p>
            <p>While she was talking, Nadja's husband took their baby for a walk outside the room. Toddler rooms are usually near the dining car. The paths are wider, and the dining area is louder. So, if a baby cries, it will not bother people as much as in a quiet area. This makes parents feel less stressed. The toilets in the same car as the toddler room are much bigger. They have a changing table that folds down. They are even bigger than the first-class toilets.</p>
            <p>German Rail also has an open "family area" for families with children from kindergarten age to school age. Other passengers who don't mind noise can also choose seats in the family area.</p>
            <p>The toddler room is for caring for babies and giving privacy. The family area lets older children move around, eat, and talk freely. Both rooms let parents with children not worry about making noise. They also let other passengers choose a quieter car.</p>
            <p>Also, German Rail has a "quiet area." A staff member told the news agency that many ICE passengers travel for work or business. They work or have online meetings on the train. For intercity trains like ICE, the quiet area is "very important" compared to regular local trains.</p>
            <p>If passengers need to have meetings or talk on the phone, they can choose seats in the "mobile phone area." This clear plan means different groups of passengers can be comfortable on the same train.</p>
            <p>You can choose your seat area, like the "toddler room," "family car," "quiet area," or "mobile phone area," when you buy train tickets on the German Rail website or app.</p>
            <p>It is good to know that if you put in the age of your children, the system will show you available seats in the family areas. German Rail suggests booking toddler or family rooms early if you travel with children. There are not many seats, and popular times are often booked quickly.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has also started talking about having quiet areas and family cars on its high-speed trains. The ICE example shows that if train spaces are planned well, people laughing and quiet can be together, even if people want different things.</p>
            <p>Nadja said that German Rail is often criticized for delays. But for new parents like her, German Rail's child-friendly design is perfect. During the interview, Nadja's two-year-old daughter came back to the toddler room after a short walk. She started drawing on the reporter's business card. This scene, with green fields outside the window, was the most relaxing and nice thing the reporter saw during a busy work trip.</p>

            <h1>Yemen Rebels Say Their Army Leader Died; Israel Confirms It</h1>
            <p>Today, Houthi rebels in Yemen said their top army leader, Ghamari, died "while doing his job." Ghamari was a very important military officer in the Houthi group, which Iran helps.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that the Houthis did not directly say Israel was responsible for the death. But they said their fight with Israel was "not finished." They also warned that Israel would "get a strong punishment for what it did."</p>
            <p>In August, Israel attacked Sanaa, the main city of Yemen, from the air. The attacks aimed at the Houthi army leader, the defense minister, and other important people. Those attacks killed the Houthi government's prime minister and some ministers.</p>
            <p>At that time, Israel said the air attacks were for Muhammad Abd Al-Karim al-Ghamari, the Houthi government's defense minister, and other senior officers.</p>
            <p>Ghamari was also part of the "Jihad Office" that Abdul Malik al-Houthi leads. This group is in charge of military actions.</p>
            <p>Today, Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, said that Israel killed Ghamari. He also said, "We will do the same if anyone threatens us in the future."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Shows New Technologies to Make Life Better with AI</h1>
            <p>The "2025 Taiwan Innovation Technology Expo" started today. Taiwan's Digital Development Ministry is showing new technologies. Their main idea is "making things strong."</p>
            <p>The Minister, Lin Yi-ching, said they are showing 14 technologies. These include 5G internet, satellite communication, drones, and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Many of these are already used in real life. For example, drones can deliver medicine. This uses AI, 5G, and smart machines to help people.</p>
            <p>The Expo is open from October 16th to 18th at Taipei World Trade Center Hall 1. The Digital Development Ministry has a special area called "making things strong." They want to use technology to make the country's digital systems stronger. They also want to help businesses use smart technologies.</p>
            <p>Lin Yi-ching said that new technologies come from different companies trying to be the best. If businesses, schools, and research groups work together, they can turn new ideas into smart ways to help people.</p>
            <p>Lin Yi-ching said the Ministry is showing 14 technologies, and many are already being used. One example is the "smart drone digital platform." Drones can deliver medicine to far-away places with this. Recently, in Hualien, a dam overflowed. Roads in Guangfu Township were blocked. Drones quickly brought medicine to the people who needed it. This shows how AI, 5G, and smart machines work together to help people.</p>
            <p>The Ministry said this year's exhibit has three main topics: "Green Energy Smart Services with AI," "5G Internet for Fast Communication," and "Satellite and Internet Technologies." You can see things like an "AI system for green power," a "5G AI robot for doctors," a "way to test satellite communication for ships," and "ways to save energy in phone networks."</p>
            <p>The Ministry said these technologies show their main goals: "digital trust, digital strength, and digital money." This is how they "make things strong." They hope this exhibit will let more people see how digital technology helps businesses and society. It shows how technology is truly valuable in our lives.</p>
