            <h1>21-Day-Old Baby Gets RSV and Almost Becomes Very Sick; Doctor Says Parents Must Not Ignore Prevention for Newborns</h1>
            <p>A baby in Taichung, who was only 21 days old, had bad coughs and even vomited. After going to the doctor, they found out the baby had RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus). The doctor warns that babies with weaker immune systems can get very sick if they catch this virus, so parents should be careful.</p>
            <p>Wuri Lin Shin Hospital said today in a press release that a 21-day-old baby girl recently had bad coughs, vomited, had a blocked nose, a lot of mucus, and didn't want to eat. She quickly went to the hospital, and a quick test showed she had RSV.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lai Yung-ching, a pediatrician at Wuri Lin Shin Hospital, explained that RSV spreads very easily. It can spread through droplets from talking or sneezing, or by touching things. One person can give it to three others. Its symptoms are like a common cold, so people often don't realize it's serious. This can lead to a bad infection in the lower part of the lungs. It used to be more common in winter, but now it can happen at any time of the year.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lai said that RSV is the most common breathing infection for babies and young children under 5 years old. About 68% of babies get RSV before they turn 1, and as many as 97% get it before they turn 2.</p>
            <p>About the symptoms, Dr. Lai said that most babies first show cold-like symptoms such as coughing, a runny nose, and fever. But it only takes 3 to 5 days for the infection to become very serious. Among these cases, 30% to 40% will get a bad infection in the lower lungs. Also, 50% to 80% of children who go to the hospital because of bronchiolitis (a lung infection) will have trouble breathing and make wheezing sounds. This is very important to watch out for.</p>
            <p>For treatment, Dr. Lai said there is no special medicine that can cure RSV right now. The main treatment is to help with the symptoms. Pregnant women can get an RSV vaccine, or babies can get an RSV antibody shot after they are born. This can help prevent them from getting very sick.</p>
            <p>After the medical team gave the baby girl the right treatment, she was able to leave the hospital after 2 weeks. The baby's mother was also recovering from childbirth and had cold symptoms. It is possible that the mother passed the virus to the baby.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lai warns that babies who are born too early, children with heart problems from birth, and babies with weak immune systems are at high risk for RSV. If they get infected, it can cause very serious problems. Parents should always be careful and pay attention to their own health so they don't give the virus to babies who have weaker defenses.</p>

            <h1>Police Officer Who Won Award Is Held for Money Laundering and Organized Crime, Suspended from Work</h1>
            <p>A police officer named Huang from Taitung, who once won the National Police Light Award, was put in jail and cannot see visitors yesterday. This happened because he is thought to be involved in money laundering and organized crime. The Taitung County Police Bureau then held a meeting last night and decided to suspend him from his job, as the law says.</p>
            <p>Officer Huang once received the National Police Light Award for solving a big case about drugs being smuggled by sea. But now, he is suspected of being involved in organized crime and breaking the Money Laundering Control Act. Yesterday, the Taitung District Court decided to keep him in jail and not let him see anyone.</p>
            <p>Cai Pei-yuan, the head of inspection for the Taitung County Police Bureau, said today that on the morning of September 3rd, the police bureau worked with the Taitung District Prosecutor's Office. They also worked with the Investigation Bureau's Eastern Mobile Team. They searched places connected to Officer Huang, who works in the juvenile police unit, and took him in for questioning. On September 4th, the prosecutor's office asked the Taitung District Court to hold him in jail under the Money Laundering Control Act. The court agreed to put him in jail and not allow him to see visitors.</p>
            <p>Cai Pei-yuan stated that because Officer Huang was put in jail, the police bureau quickly held a review meeting last night and suspended him from his job according to the law.</p>
            <p>Cai Pei-yuan said that they have been investigating evidence about Officer Huang's alleged illegal activities. He added that the police bureau will investigate any illegal behavior by its officers according to the law. They will not hide anything, not protect anyone, and not show favoritism. They will hold people strictly responsible and remove them from their jobs if needed. They will also check on the responsibility of other staff who supervise.</p>

            <h1>Man Enters Taichung Temple 8 Times Pretending to Pray, Damages Donation Box, and Steals Money; Now Charged</h1>
            <p>A man named Ni went to a temple in Taichung's West District. He went in and out of the temple's main hall eight times, bowing and praying. He was pretending to be a "devoted worshipper." After this, he broke a donation box and stole the money inside, then ran away. The police were told about it, called him in for questioning, and sent the case to the prosecutor. The prosecutor has now charged him with serious theft and other crimes.</p>
            <p>The First Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department said today that on June 1st, the Gongyi Police Station received a report. A temple on Xiangshang Road Section 1 had its donation box broken and the donation money stolen. The police started an investigation right away.</p>
            <p>The police looked at surveillance videos and saw that starting at 1:55 PM that day, Mr. Ni went into the temple's main hall eight times. He bowed and prayed many times. He kept going in and out, making it look like he was doing something else, to make people think he was a "devoted worshipper."</p>
            <p>The video showed that Mr. Ni committed the crime several times in just 5 minutes. He used a tool to try and open the donation box. When that didn't work, he broke the wooden board of the money slot with his hands. He reached in four times to steal the donation money and then left.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lu, the temple director, told the police that he was resting in his office at the time. When he woke up, he found the donation box was broken. He estimated that about NT$10,000 in donation money had been stolen.</p>
            <p>After investigating, the police identified Mr. Ni as the person involved. After he was called in and questioned by the police, the entire case was sent to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation. The prosecutor recently charged him with serious theft and damage to property under the Criminal Code of the Republic of China.</p>
