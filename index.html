            <h1>China Shows Old Records About Japanese Army Making Chinese People Work Against Their Will on 94th Anniversary of Important Event</h1>
            <p>Today is the 94th anniversary of a big event in China called the September 18th Incident. China's state TV, CCTV, reported this morning that the Heilongjiang Provincial Archives has shown special old papers to the public for the first time. These papers are about "The Japanese Army Forcing and Enslaving Chinese Workers During Their Invasion." There are 62 such papers in total.</p>
            <p>CCTV News said that these old papers were made during the time when Japan and its helpers ruled. They talk about how workers were used and controlled, plans to take workers, the bad treatment of workers, and how workers fought back. This shows that after the September 18th Incident, Japan's empire forced Chinese people to work for 14 years when they ruled Northeast China.</p>
            <p>The report said that the forced workers were treated very badly. Their living conditions were terrible. The papers show they did not have enough food, did not have warm clothes, and had to do very hard work. Many workers ran away because they could not stand it. The Japanese army and the government they set up caught, punished, and even killed these workers to stop them. They took away their freedom and respect.</p>
            <p>Nie Boxin, who is in charge of organizing archives at the Heilongjiang Provincial Archives, said that these new papers are not just important for history research. They also strongly disagree with Japanese right-wing groups who say the invasion did not happen or make their bad actions seem good. This release is to remember the sad history, protect human fairness, and tell everyone to love peace and stop war.</p>
            <p>This year is the 80th anniversary of China winning the war against Japan. Before September 18th, the Japanese Embassy in China sent emails to Japanese people living in China. They told them "to be extra careful because feelings against Japan are very strong."</p>

            <h1>TV Host Shen Yu-lin Shares Funny Family Stories on "Who's Coming to Dinner," Says His Daughter Is Also Funny</h1>
            <p>TV host Shen Yu-lin recently shared that he has leukemia, a type of blood cancer. He is now working hard to fight the cancer and hopes to return to work soon. Before he got sick, he visited the Bai Xian family in Taisi, Yunlin, for a TV show called "Who's Coming to Dinner." The Bai Xian family works on a farm. On the show, Shen Yu-lin told funny stories about his family and joked that his daughter has his sense of humor.</p>
            <p>Before his illness, Shen Yu-lin visited the Bai Xian family, who live in Taisi Township, Yunlin County. Mr. Bai Xian and his father work as farmers in their hometown. The TV show's team said that Shen Yu-lin is not only funny on TV. As soon as he arrived, he made the whole family laugh. At the dinner table, Shen Yu-lin enjoyed the homemade food the family made. He also joked, "The best food is food that feels happy."</p>
            <p>When they talked about how people get a sense of humor, Shen Yu-lin laughed and said it might be something you are born with. He said his father was not a typical soldier. He explained, "My dad was not a serious father in the old way. He would not make us stand at attention at home. He just had a natural sense of humor, so I think it might be because of DNA."</p>
            <p>Shen Yu-lin married his wife Ya Ya in 2010. After they got married, they had a daughter. When asked how he manages both his busy work and family life, Shen Yu-lin said he uses the time before his child goes to school to spend time with her. He said, "For three years, I have made sure to wake up early every day. This is to use the 5 minutes before my child gets on the school bus. That is our special time together."</p>
            <p>Even though the father and daughter have a good relationship, Shen Yu-lin sadly said that his daughter treats him differently compared to her mother. For example, on Mother's Day, his daughter would work hard to prepare something. But on Father's Day, his daughter would say that she should treat both parents the same and celebrate his Father's Day well. She would sing a song for him, but when she started singing, it was "Only Mama Is Good in This World." This made Shen Yu-lin laugh and say, "My daughter really got her humor from me."</p>
            <p>The new Season 16 of "Who's Coming to Dinner" is on now. It is shown every Friday at 9 PM on Public Television, and also live on the "Who's Coming to Dinner" Facebook fan page and YouTube channel.</p>
