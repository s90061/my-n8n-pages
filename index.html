President Lai Ching-te is giving a series of ten talks called "Uniting the Nation." In his third talk, he spoke about how the government works. However, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that a recent survey showed many people (around 70%) want the President to talk about the economy.

Mayor Lu asked the President to share his plans for the economy. She explained that Taiwan's economy is facing difficulties, like the New Taiwan Dollar getting stronger against other currencies. This makes it harder for companies to sell their products to other countries and causes problems for insurance companies, which have lost a lot of money recently.

Mayor Lu hopes the President will address these important economic issues that concern the public. She mentioned problems with exchange rates, exports, tariffs, energy, and gas supply. She believes the President should offer solutions to make people feel more secure.

Nikkei Asia reports that UMC, which is Taiwan's second-biggest company for making computer chips, is thinking about making more advanced chips. Currently, companies like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel mostly make these very advanced chips.

Four people familiar with the matter said that UMC is looking into new ways to grow, possibly by making 6-nanometer chips. These chips are used in things like Wi-Fi, radio devices, Bluetooth, artificial intelligence, TVs, and car processors. UMC is also thinking about working more with Intel on making chips, including 6-nanometer technology, in Arizona by 2027.

UMC's finance chief, C.K. Liu, told Nikkei Asia that UMC continues to explore advanced chip technologies. However, he stressed that working with partners would be important to share the costs. UMC is the fourth-largest chip maker in the world. It is facing pressure from China, which is trying to make more chips locally and support its own companies like SMIC.

TSMC's stock price dropped sharply at the end of trading today, with over 10,000 shares being sold quickly. The price went from NT$1075 to NT$1060, losing NT$20. This means the company's total value fell below NT$28 trillion.

Even though TSMC's American stock (ADR) went up by over 2% on June 27, its stock in Taiwan fell today. An analyst named Wang Chao-li said that foreign investors have a large number of "sell" orders for futures contracts, suggesting they want to push down the market index.

Besides TSMC, other big companies like Hon Hai (Foxconn), MediaTek, and Delta Electronics also saw their stock prices drop suddenly at the end of the day. This strong selling at the end of trading reduced the overall market index significantly.
