Original News URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw497k8v906o

Artificial intelligence (AI) is slowly becoming a normal part of our homes. Many people already use smart speakers like Amazon Echo or Google Home, which are powered by AI. These devices can play music, answer questions, and control other smart devices in the house, like lights or thermostats.
Now, AI is moving into other areas. For example, some new washing machines can use AI to decide the best way to clean your clothes based on how dirty they are. Refrigerators might soon use AI to track what food you have and suggest recipes.
Even security systems are using AI. They can learn the difference between a family member and a stranger, or tell the difference between a pet and a person moving outside. This helps to reduce false alarms.
While these changes make our lives easier, they also bring up questions about privacy. Our devices are listening and collecting data about our habits. People need to think about how comfortable they are with this and what companies do with their information. As AI becomes more common, understanding these things will be important for everyone.

**Work: The Rise of the Four-Day Work Week**

More companies around the world are trying out a four-day work week, where employees work fewer days but for the same pay. This idea is gaining popularity because early results show good things for both workers and businesses.
Studies in countries like the UK and Portugal found that when people worked four days a week, their stress levels went down, and they felt healthier. They also reported a better balance between their work and personal life. For companies, productivity often stayed the same or even went up. This might seem strange, but when employees are happier and less stressed, they work more efficiently during the hours they are at work.
Some companies worry about how it will affect their customers or how it will fit with their industry. However, many businesses that have tried it say that it helps them attract and keep good employees. As the job market changes, the four-day work week could become a standard way of working in the future, offering a new path for a healthier and more productive work life.

**Travel: Sustainable Tourism Gains Momentum**

More and more travelers are thinking about how their trips affect the environment and local communities. This is leading to a big increase in sustainable tourism. Sustainable travel means choosing ways to travel that are good for the planet and support the people who live in the places you visit.
Travelers are now looking for eco-friendly hotels that use less water and energy, or tour operators who care about wildlife protection. They also want to buy local products and support small businesses, so their money helps the community directly.
A recent report shows that many people are willing to pay a bit more for travel options that are sustainable. This change is being driven by younger travelers who are very concerned about climate change.
Airlines are also trying to be more sustainable by using newer, more fuel-efficient planes or looking into alternative fuels. While there's still a lot to do, the growth in sustainable travel shows that people want to enjoy the world without harming it, helping to protect beautiful places for future generations.`;
