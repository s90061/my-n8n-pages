            <h1>Former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung Passes Away, Lin Chia-lung Remembers Him as a Calm and Steady Role Model</h1>
            <p>Former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, a senior advisor to the President, passed away today at 87 years old. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said he felt sad and missed Mr. Chang after hearing the news just before his trip abroad. Mr. Chang was asked to be the Premier twice during difficult times. But he always helped make the political situation stable with his calm and steady way. He is a good example for younger people to learn from.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung wrote on Facebook tonight that he felt sad and missed Mr. Chang after hearing the news of his death before his trip. Looking back at Mr. Chang's life, he graduated from National Taiwan University with a law degree and passed the bar exam to become a lawyer. He had a strong spirit and courage to fight for justice.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung pointed out that the Kaohsiung Incident was an important turning point in Mr. Chang's life. He was not afraid of the government's power at that time. He showed courage as a lawyer and bravely stood up. He became part of the defense team for the Kaohsiung Incident. Their courage inspired many young students, including Lin Chia-lung himself. This started many democratic movements in Taiwan and reminds everyone that democracy and freedom are not easy to get.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung remembered that when former President Chen Shui-bian won the election for the first time in 2000, Mr. Chang was the general director of the campaign office. His calm, steady, and good communication skills helped a lot to win the election. After that, he led the team for the first change of political parties in government. At that time, when Lin Chia-lung was helping to form a group of national policy advisors, he first met and worked with Mr. Chang.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said that Mr. Chang was asked to be the Premier twice during difficult times. But he always helped make the political situation stable with his calm and steady way. He is a good example for younger people to learn from.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung recalled that when he was a consultant for the National Security Council, he wanted to improve communication with Russia. So, he helped create the Taiwan-Russia Association and asked Mr. Chang to be its first chairman. Now, as the Foreign Minister, he feels even more thankful for Mr. Chang's help with Taiwan's foreign relations.</p>
            <p>Besides their work together, Lin Chia-lung said that after Mr. Chang retired, they often met. Whether it was visiting him in Kaohsiung or meeting at gatherings, Mr. and Mrs. Chang were always kind, like family elders. They always cared for and encouraged him and his wife, Liao Wan-ju. Mr. Chang's advice was very valuable to him and his wife throughout their lives.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said that being a prison counselor was the most important thing to Mr. Chang when he was alive. He hoped that those who made mistakes would change for the better. This showed his lifelong spirit of not caring about fame or money, but always standing up for justice in times of need.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said, "A wise person has long gone, but their example remains." He remembered Mr. Chang's life and believed that Mr. Chang did not truly leave everyone. Instead, he became a thousand gentle breezes, staying with everyone to protect their beloved Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen-Brunei Charter Flight Exchange: Taiwan's Representative Office in Brunei Witnesses a New Chapter of Visa-Free Travel</h1>
            <p>Taiwan and Brunei now allow each other's citizens to travel without a visa. Taiwan's representative office in Brunei said that a special charter flight between Kinmen and Brunei started exchanges on September 26th. This is not only a new step forward in tourism cooperation but also carries a history of over a hundred years of connections and family ties between the two places.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the representative office in Brunei, since Taiwan and Brunei started visa-free travel in June this year, visits between the two sides have become more frequent, and their friendship has grown stronger. After the visa-free policy, the first "Kinmen-Brunei" charter flight exchange began on September 26th.</p>
            <p>The representative office in Brunei said that this charter flight brought more than 140 people from Kinmen to Brunei. At the same time, it also took nearly 100 people from the Chinese community in Brunei to Kinmen to visit their ancestral home. This round trip is an important new step for tourism and cultural exchange since the visa-free policy started.</p>
            <p>The representative office in Brunei pointed out that many people in Brunei are descendants of immigrants from Kinmen. Since the 19th century, many people from Kinmen bravely crossed the sea to settle in Brunei. They helped with the local economy and played a key role in education, business, and culture. They grew together with the local society and became an important part of Brunei's Chinese community. This history of immigration, which spans over a hundred years, makes the bond between Kinmen and Brunei even stronger. It also gives this charter flight deeper historical meaning.</p>
            <p>The representative office in Brunei said that Taiwan's representative to Brunei, Hsiao Sheng-chung, went to Brunei International Airport. He waved goodbye to the people from Brunei leaving for Taiwan and welcomed the people who came from Kinmen. Brunei's Tourism Board also sent representatives to be there and arranged traditional cultural performances special to the area. Hsiao Sheng-chung stressed that this charter flight is not just about tourism. It also connects the deep friendship between the people of both places. In the future, the office will continue to promote different cultural activities to help people from both sides understand each other better and strengthen their friendship.</p>
