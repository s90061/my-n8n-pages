            <h1>Japan's Defense Report Says China's Military Aims Are a Challenge; China's Embassy Protests</h1>
            <p>Japan recently released its 2025 Defense White Paper. It says that China's military goals are a new and huge challenge for Japan and the world. The Chinese Embassy in Japan said that the issue of Taiwan is very important for the political basis of China-Japan relations. They called it a "red line" that cannot be crossed. The embassy has strongly protested to Japan.</p>
            <p>Last night, the Chinese Embassy in Japan posted a statement on its website about Japan's 2025 Defense White Paper. The Chinese Embassy said that Japan's new defense report continues to wrongly describe China. It also speaks badly about China's defense policy and its normal military actions. This goes against the basic rules of international relations and the four political agreements between China and Japan. China is very unhappy and strongly against this. They have formally protested to Japan.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in Japan stated that "the Taiwan issue is completely China's internal affair." They said it is at the very center of China's main interests. The Taiwan issue affects the political foundation of China-Japan relations and is a "red line" that cannot be crossed. The embassy also said that "Diaoyu Islands and their smaller islands are China's land by history." China will continue to take all needed steps to protect its land and legal rights. Japan is not involved in the South China Sea issue, so it should stop causing trouble and conflict.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in Japan said that China wants to develop peacefully and follows a defense-only military policy. China's military cooperation with other countries follows international laws and customs. Japan has changed its security plans a lot in recent years. It has also increased its defense budget for 13 years in a row. Japan is also developing and buying many offensive weapons. This is a serious threat to peace, safety, and stability in the area.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in Japan said that this year marks "80 years since the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." They urged Japan to think deeply about its past mistakes. They also asked Japan to correctly understand China and stop using "China threat" as an excuse to make its military stronger and bigger.</p>
            <p>On July 15, Japan's Defense Minister, Gen Nakatani, presented the 2025 Defense White Paper at a cabinet meeting. He said that China is quickly making its military stronger and increasing its military actions.</p>
            <p>Japan's Defense White Paper points out that China has been very active with military actions near Taiwan in recent years. This trend continued and even grew stronger in 2024. For example, after President Lai Ching-te took office in May 2024, China immediately started a large military exercise called "Joint Sword 2024A." After Double Ten Day, they also started the "Joint Sword 2024B" exercise.</p>
            <p>Last year, China's military also entered Japanese airspace many times. Their aircraft carrier came close to Japanese waters. For over 30 years, China has been increasing its defense budget without clear reasons. It has quickly and widely improved its military power, especially with nuclear weapons, missiles, and naval and air forces. China continues to increase military activities in areas near Japan, including around the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyutai Islands) in the East China Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the West Pacific outside the First Island Chain.</p>

            <h1>Penghu Town Air Defense Drill: Realistic Practice of Sheltering and Rescuing</h1>
            <p>Penghu held a town air defense drill today. At 10 AM, after the air raid alarm sounded, the whole county, including one city and five townships, took part. Police officers controlled people and cars everywhere. They guided people to find shelter nearby. The drill also practiced rescuing injured people and responding to disasters. The whole exercise felt very real.</p>
            <p>Before the Penghu town air defense drill began, County Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu, Tan Wei-chung from the Executive Yuan's Mobilization Conference, and Lin Chi-cheng from the Command Headquarters listened to a briefing in the county government's first-floor meeting room. When the alarm sounded, all one city and five townships in the county joined the drill. Police, fire, and civilian defense staff immediately controlled vehicles and helped people find shelter. City streets became empty. They also visited different shelters to check on them.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu visited the county government's basement, the bus station, and the underground shelter at Penghu No. 3 Port. In the Penghu No. 3 Port basement, almost 300 tourists took shelter there. The Penghu County Fire Bureau also used robots for a disaster rescue drill at the Taipower Magong Substation. The First Health Center and Magong Elementary School practiced rescuing many injured people, giving first aid, and providing relief after a war. The whole drill felt very real.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu said that this was the first time they held a town resilience drill. It was to make the whole community better prepared for air defense. It also checked how well the government can respond to disasters. Most importantly, it reminded everyone to be ready for problems. Through these drills, people learn to be more aware of dangers and always prepare well. This way, they can handle all kinds of disasters and challenges.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Artists Gather, Heading to Weimar Art Festival and Ars Electronica Festival</h1>
            <p>The Weimar Art Festival will happen in Germany in August. Five Taiwanese groups will be part of a section called "Taiwan Focus II." Today, these groups met with other groups that will go to the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria, in September. Minister of Culture Li Yuan said that these groups represent Taiwan as a "national team."</p>
            <p>A press conference was held today for the "2025 Weimar Art Festival and Ars Electronica Festival." Minister Li Yuan said he especially thanked all the artists and groups who are taking part. He thanked them for bringing Taiwan's culture and creative energy to the world stage. He said that the moment each group leaves Taiwan, they represent Taiwan. Also, because of everyone's hard work and cultural diplomacy, Taiwan can build its own cultural identity and strength.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan also said that Germany once had the "Weimar Republic" period. At that time, art grew very well. Musicians, artists, and dancers created a great cultural era together. Today, he was very happy to see the groups ready to perform. He also hopes that Taiwan can truly have such a "renaissance" one day.</p>
            <p>Among the groups at today's event, five will go first to the Weimar Art Festival in Germany in August. The Cultural Division of the Taipei Representative Office in Germany has worked many times with Rolf C. Hemke, the director of the Weimar Art Festival. Last year, they started the "Taiwan Focus" section. This year, it continues as "Taiwan Focus II."</p>
            <p>The five groups and their works include: Bulareyaung Dance Company's dance performance "LUNA," Riverbed Theatre's "Open Room" VR trilogy, Horse Dance Theatre's artistic director Chen Wu-kang's dance "Wild Stage Ramayana," artist Liu Chen-hsiu's installation "Echoes of the Earth," and FOCASA Circus's work "Moss Marks."</p>
            <p>In September, 14 artists and groups will then go to the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, Austria. They will continue to show Taiwan's soft power. This time, C-LAB (Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab) planned an exhibition called "Polyphony." It responds to the festival's main theme, "PANIC-yes/no."</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-chih, director of C-LAB's Taiwan Sound Lab, said that the idea of the "Polyphony" exhibition is like "polyphonic music." This type of music has a complex structure but many different parts. The exhibition hopes to show thoughts about living together and existing in today's changing and unsure future. The 14 works will be shown mainly in three places. One of these is the main exhibition area of the Ars Electronica Festival, where six installation works will be shown.</p>
            <p>The six works include: "Sea Mirror: Tracing" by artists Ho Li and KLING KLANG KLONG; Liu Chen-hsiu's "Echoes of the Earth"; Chi Po-hao's "Water Loop"; Chang Yen-tzu's "In the Abyss, Again as a Perceiver"; Meimage Dance's "Colorful Forest | Pandanus - Sister A"; and Tseng Yu-juan's "Jane's Writing Project."</p>
