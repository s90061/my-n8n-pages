            <h1>Tainan's Guanshan Village in Nanxi District Will Close Schools and Offices on August 4th; Other Areas Remain Open</h1>
            <p>The Tainan City Government announced tonight that the weather agency predicted that Tainan's rainfall in the next 24 hours would not be enough to stop work and school. However, because several parts of Provincial Highway 179 have landslides and blocked traffic, and there is still a risk of more landslides or disasters due to the rain, Guanshan Village in Nanxi District will close schools and offices tomorrow. Other areas will remain open.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain in Kaohsiung Mountains: Home Care Worker Praised for Caring for Patients and Bravely Providing Services</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain has caused serious problems in the mountains of Kaohsiung. Emergency services are still working and helping people. Today, a home care worker worried that her patients would not be cared for. She bravely drove from Meinong to Liugui. She wrote about her experience online and hoped the heavy rain would stop. People online praised her, saying she had "a kind heart, very touching."</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration continued to issue warnings for very heavy or extremely heavy rain in the mountainous areas of Kaohsiung today. Since July 30th, the total rainfall in Maolin and Taoyuan districts has been over 2000 millimeters. Many main roads in the mountains are closed as a warning or due to damage. The Kaohsiung City Civil Affairs Bureau said that 3140 people have been moved to safety so far.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chu, the home care worker, wrote on a local Facebook group today. She said that even though work and school were stopped this morning, as a home care worker, she still bravely drove from Meinong to Liugui to help. She explained, "It's not that I love money too much." Many of the people who ask for home care are vulnerable and live alone. After many days of stopped work and school, if a patient cannot move easily, has no food, cannot wash, or cannot be fed, she thought, "Put yourself in their shoes, what would you do if this happened to you?"</p>
            <p>Ms. Chu told a Central News Agency reporter that she was just doing her job. She was lucky to have a car to drive, so she tried her best. She faced floods, standing water, and mudslides, but she was able to get through them safely. She only wished that the heavy rain would stop causing problems and give the people of Liugui a safe home.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kaohsiung City Indigenous Peoples Commission explained that in Namasia District, the Ziqiang Road towards Taiwan Provincial Highway 29 (4.5km mark), Yudashan towards Jiayi County Road 129-1, and the Lover's Valley connecting road in Maolin District all have problems like road collapses and mudslides. The steel temporary bridge connecting Fuxing Village to Lavulan Village in Taoyuan District is still being hit by strong river water. In the tunnel at Provincial Highway 29 (temporary 11-0K+100), the water is about 60 centimeters deep. People are asked not to go through the tunnel for now and not to enter the mountains unless it is very important.</p>

            <h1>Israel Office Rejects Gaza Hunger Videos: Hamas Stops Aid Convoys</h1>
            <p>There is still a hunger problem in Gaza. Hamas recently released a video showing a very thin Israeli hostage, mixed with images of what looked like hungry children. The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei stated today that Hamas claims Israel is stopping humanitarian aid. However, the office says Hamas is actually stopping the aid convoys. The office asked everyone to rely on facts that have been checked.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse and Reuters reported that Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, recently released a video. It showed a 24-year-old Israeli man named Evyatar David, who looked very thin, in a small concrete tunnel. The video also included images of what seemed to be hungry babies and children in the Gaza area.</p>
            <p>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei released a press statement today. It said that Israel respects open and honest discussions and protests. But it also asked the public to use facts that have been checked. They also asked everyone to fight against terrorism and the wrong use of humanitarian aid.</p>
            <p>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei said that the terrible video released by Hamas showed an Israeli hostage being purposefully starved. Hamas claims Israel is stopping humanitarian aid from entering Gaza. But the office says Hamas has actually stopped aid convoys. They have taken the supplies for their armed forces. They have even sold these supplies at high prices to poor people in Gaza to make money. While Palestinian families are struggling, Hamas leaders and fighters have plenty of food and clothes and appear smiling on camera.</p>
            <p>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei also said that to get international sympathy, Hamas used images of children with genetic illnesses. They wrongly showed these children as victims who were purposely starved by Israel. However, these children are actually receiving medical care outside of Gaza. Sadly, only a few international news organizations have corrected or explained this.</p>
            <p>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei mentioned that the U.S. government had already confirmed that Hamas again refused a plan that could have ended the suffering. Anyone who truly wants the war to end should call for the immediate release of all hostages, for Hamas to stop fighting, and support rebuilding Gaza with a civilian government. It should not be controlled by an armed terrorist group that does not care about peace or the well-being of its people.</p>
            <p>The Israel Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei emphasized that Israel thanks all its friends who chose to see through Hamas's false information. Only by working together with partners who value life, hope for the future, and strongly reject terrorism and kidnapping can true and lasting peace and stability be achieved.</p>
