Amazon has finally started using drones to deliver packages to customers in two US states, Texas and California. After years of planning and testing, the company is now offering this service in College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California.

Customers who live near the Amazon delivery centers in these areas can choose drone delivery for certain items. These items must be small and light enough to be safely carried by the drones. When a customer places an order and chooses drone delivery, the drone picks up the package and flies to the customer's home. It then lowers the package into the customer's yard using a cable. Amazon says that drone delivery is faster than traditional delivery methods, and it hopes to expand the service to more areas in the future. However, there are still some challenges to overcome, such as safety concerns and regulations. The company is working with the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure that the drone deliveries are safe and comply with all the necessary rules.

**The Rise of 'Quiet Quitting': Doing the Bare Minimum at Work**

A new trend called "quiet quitting" is becoming popular, especially among younger workers. Quiet quitting doesn't mean actually quitting your job. Instead, it means only doing the tasks that are strictly required of you, and nothing more.

People who are quiet quitting are not going above and beyond. They're not working late or taking on extra projects. They simply do what their job description says and then stop working when the workday is over. There are several reasons why people are quiet quitting. Some feel burnt out and overworked, while others feel that their efforts are not appreciated or rewarded. Some people believe that doing only what is required is a way to protect their mental health and create a better work-life balance. Managers are worried about the impact of this trend on productivity and teamwork. They need to find ways to motivate employees and make them feel valued so that they are willing to go the extra mile.

**Italy's Floating Homes: A New Way to Experience Venice**

Venice, a city famous for its canals and historic buildings, is now offering a new type of accommodation: floating homes. These homes are built on platforms that float on the water, providing a unique way to experience the city.

The floating homes are equipped with all the modern conveniences, such as bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, and living areas. They also have outdoor spaces, like terraces and balconies, where guests can enjoy the views of the canals and surrounding architecture. Staying in a floating home offers a different perspective on Venice. Guests can feel closer to the water and enjoy the peace and quiet away from the crowds of tourists. However, these homes can be more expensive than traditional hotels. Also, during periods of high water, access to the homes might be affected. Despite these challenges, the floating homes are becoming a popular choice for travelers looking for a unique and memorable experience in Venice.
