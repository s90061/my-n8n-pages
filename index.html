Many businesses in Asia and around the world are finding new and exciting ways to use artificial intelligence (AI). Experts say that AI is creating many big opportunities for companies. It can help them work more efficiently and even offer completely new types of products and services. For example, AI can analyze large amounts of data very quickly, which helps businesses make better decisions. It can also automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more creative and important work.

However, using AI successfully also means that companies need to train their employees. Workers will need new skills to work with AI technologies. This shift could lead to a future where businesses are much more productive and offer highly personalized services to their customers, changing how we do business daily.

**The Rise of Quick "Desk-Pop" Meetings at Work**

A new trend is growing in many workplaces: the "desk-pop." This happens when a colleague walks over to your desk for a very quick, unplanned chat instead of sending an email or scheduling a formal meeting. It's often for a brief question or to share a piece of information quickly. This informal way of communicating is becoming popular, especially in offices where people work closely together.

The idea behind desk-pops is to get instant answers and avoid the time it takes to set up longer meetings. Some people like them because they feel more personal and lead to faster solutions. However, others find them interruptive, especially when they are trying to focus on complex tasks. As workplaces continue to change, companies are looking for ways to balance quick communication with deep work time for their employees.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trip Tourists**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started a new rule for tourists visiting for just one day. From April 2024, day-trippers must pay a small fee to enter the historic city. This new measure aims to manage the very large number of tourists who visit Venice, especially during busy times. The city is trying to protect its delicate environment and make life better for its residents.

The fee is not for everyone; people staying overnight in a hotel or guesthouse in Venice do not need to pay. The money collected will help the city manage services and maintain its unique infrastructure, which is affected by millions of visitors each year. This move makes Venice one of the first major tourist destinations to charge visitors for a short visit, showing a new approach to managing global tourism.`;
