            <h1>NVIDIA H20 Unblocked, Hsiao Bi-khim: Must Ensure It Does Not Harm Taiwan's Security</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Yeh Su-ping, Taipei, July 21) The United States has changed its policy on selling computer chips to China. It has now allowed NVIDIA to sell its H20 chips to China again. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim recently talked with foreign reporters. She was asked if this might help China's AI technology grow and be used as a threat against Taiwan. The Vice President said that we must make sure that technology made and developed in Taiwan is not used to hurt Taiwan's safety or put the lives and property of Taiwanese people in danger.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of July 18, Vice President Hsiao attended an event called "Dialogue with Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim" at the Taiwan Foreign Correspondents' Club. The Presidential Office released a news statement today.</p>
            <p>The media was curious how the government would tell people that a strong relationship between Taiwan and the United States is still good for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao talked about the idea of "having many different plans." She said that the United States is indeed a very important trade partner for Taiwan. Taiwan gets a lot of help from the United States in new ideas, technology, and research. Also, the U.S. actively invests in Taiwan. Besides, this is a partnership where both sides help each other and both benefit.</p>
            <p>The Vice President stated that the United States is Taiwan's most important partner. It plays a key role in keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and helping Taiwan defend itself. She also thanked more and more countries around the world for saying that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important. These countries show their views through big meetings, regular meetings, rules, plans, and statements.</p>
            <p>About the tariff issue, which many people care about, Vice President Hsiao said that there is no more information to share right now. The teams talking about it are working very hard, almost day and night, even losing sleep. This is because they have to work with both American time and Taiwan time. Of course, she hopes an agreement can be reached soon. This will allow other agreements between the two sides to move forward, and these agreements are also very important for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Also, the media asked if the current discussions include the U.S. "Section 232 investigation" on semiconductors. They also asked if NVIDIA being allowed to sell H20 chips made in Taiwan to China might help China's AI grow and be used as a threat against Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that she could not share more details about the specific discussion plans and times for this round of talks about trade and semiconductors.</p>
            <p>She said that for talks about mutual tariffs or the "Section 232 investigation" on semiconductor trade, the final goal is the same: to create wealth together in a way that benefits both sides. Former U.S. President Trump once said he wanted to "Make America Great Again." In Taiwan, the goal is also to become stronger. She believes that a strong Taiwan with a good economy is good for the whole world. This is because Taiwan has always been a trustworthy and steady helper in the world's supply chains for a long time.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao stressed that she cannot speak for any foreign government, company, or even Taiwanese companies. But from a general view, NVIDIA has always been an important partner for Taiwan. Taiwan's technology industry has also been a reliable provider for top American tech companies like NVIDIA and other big companies. This is exactly how Taiwan wants to keep helping the world and people through different trade and investment plans.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that the questions from the media also touched on the topic of AI and controlling technology exports. She thinks that this is a difficult discussion for both the government and private companies. However, everyone generally agrees on one thing: the main purpose of controlling exports is to make sure that technology made and developed in Taiwan is not used to hurt Taiwan's safety or put the lives and property of Taiwanese people in danger.

            <h1>Bulareyaung Dance Company's First US-Canada Tour, Spreading Indigenous Aesthetics</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chao Ching-yu, Taipei, July 21) The Bulareyaung Dance Company will start its North American tour in late July. They will visit five cities in the U.S. and Canada. The company will show their important dance works like "LUNA" and "Beautiful Beautiful." This will show the original power of Taiwan's indigenous modern dance on the world stage.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture released a press statement today. It said that the Bulareyaung Dance Company's work "LUNA" mixes Bunun tribal songs and culture into dance. It won the 17th Taishin Arts Award. In the past, it has been performed in Canada, Japan, and Malaysia. It surprised audiences in many countries. It also received support from important American art festivals like the American Dance Festival and Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. This became the reason for this North American tour.</p>
            <p>The Bulareyaung Dance Company will also perform "Beautiful Beautiful" for American and Canadian audiences. In this dance, the clear blue sky and ocean of eastern Taiwan become blue and white canvas on the stage. The dance shows what "beauty" means to them. This is also the first time in 10 years that Bulareyaung Pagarlava is leading his group back to the United States as the company director. He will show international audiences dance works that mix Taiwan's indigenous culture with modern dance.</p>
            <p>The founder of the dance company, Bulareyaung Pagarlava, is from Taiwan's Paiwan tribe. He has strong ties with the United States. In 1998, he went to New York to study with help from the Asian Cultural Council. He was asked to create dances for Cloud Gate 2 and the Martha Graham Dance Company, among others. At the peak of his career in the U.S., Bulareyaung chose to return to his hometown, Taitung. In 2015, he started the Bulareyaung Dance Company. He uses indigenous culture as his inspiration and helps young dancers from his tribe find their roots.</p>
            <p>After many years of hard work, the dance company has achieved great success. Bulareyaung Pagarlava won the National Award for Arts in 2022. This year, as the dance company celebrates its 10th anniversary, it was chosen by the Ministry of Culture as a "Taiwan Brand Team." This tour is supported by the Ministry of Culture. It was made possible by the Taipei Cultural Center in New York, the Taiwan Academy of the Representative Office in the U.S., and the Taiwan Academy of the Representative Office in Houston working together.</p>
            <p>The Bulareyaung Dance Company will perform from July 23 to August 16. They will be at places like the American Dance Festival in North Carolina, the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur in Quebec, Canada, Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, and the SummerStage Taiwanese Waves Music Festival in Central Park, New York.</p>
            <p>Besides the performances, on August 6, the company's new documentary "Children Dancing into the Tribe" will be shown at the Museum of Chinese in America in New York. Members of the dance company will be there in person for a discussion after the showing. This will help American audiences fully understand the unique charm of the dance company through dance, music, and videos. (Edited by Chang Ya-ching) 2025/07/21.</p>

            <h1>Tainan Starts Cross-Agency Support to Help Farmers Apply for Disaster Relief</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Yang Szu-jui, Tainan, July 21) Typhoon Danas caused damage to farms and equipment in Tainan. The city's Agriculture Bureau has started a system to get help from different groups. They have asked staff from farmers' associations and young local farmers to go to 11 district offices. Their job is to help farmers apply for disaster relief. The goal is to make the rebuilding process after the disaster faster.</p>
            <p>Lee Fang-lin, the head of Tainan City's Agriculture Bureau, told Central News Agency reporters today that when sudden natural disasters happen, farmers often get tired dealing with saving their farms and planting new crops. Older farmers, especially, might not know much about preparing documents for damage or the official steps to get help. This can cause delays in applying for some relief money, which affects their rights.</p>
            <p>Lee Fang-lin said that the Agriculture Bureau worked with the Tainan City Farmers' Association. They brought together different district farmers' associations and young local farmers. These groups are now working in 11 district offices. They help farmers use the "Agricultural Natural Disaster On-site Photo App." This helps with applying for disaster relief. This makes sure that all affected farmers can finish their applications on time.</p>
            <p>He said that most of the people helping in the district offices this time are staff from farmers' associations and young local farmers. They know the local farming areas well and often talk with nearby farmers. They can help farmers use digital tools to quickly understand the damage and give real help.</p>
            <p>Lee Fang-lin urged farmers to make sure they apply for help before the deadline. They should also pay attention to any public announcements to protect their rights. If they have any questions about how to apply or what documents they need, they can ask the Agriculture Bureau or their local district office. The Agriculture Bureau will continue to work with the district offices to improve disaster prevention and response, making damage assessments and relief efforts faster.
