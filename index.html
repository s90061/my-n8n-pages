            <h1>NBA Clippers Accused of Paying Kawhi Leonard NT$860 Million for a Fake Job to Avoid Salary Cap</h1>
            <p>A sports journalist and podcast host named Pablo Torre has said that the NBA Clippers team and its owner, Steve Ballmer, are accused of paying their main player, Kawai Leonard, 28 million US dollars (about 860 million New Taiwan dollars). This money was supposedly for a "named position" to get around the NBA's salary cap rules.</p>
            <p>Yahoo Sports reported that Torre talked about this 'scandal' today on his podcast show, "Pablo Torre Finds Out." He showed many direct quotes from legal papers during the show.</p>
            <p>It is said that Steve Ballmer, the owner of the NBA Los Angeles Clippers, paid Leonard 28 million US dollars through one of his companies. But Leonard did almost no work for this money. Ballmer is accused of using this agreement to pay Leonard more money than NBA rules allow in his contract. If this is true, it breaks the league's rules.</p>
            <p>The whole issue is about a company called Aspiration. Ballmer put money into this company, but it is now out of business. Aspiration had a legal agreement with Leonard's company, KL2 Aspire, LLC, for 28 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Torre tried to find out if Leonard had done any marketing or promotions for Aspiration, but he found nothing.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the contract between Aspiration and KL2 Aspire, LLC had a special rule. This rule allowed Leonard to "refuse to do any actions the company asked." This basically meant he was paid for doing nothing. Another rule in the contract said he had to still be a Clippers player to get the money.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Leonard played for the San Antonio Spurs and the Toronto Raptors before. He joined the Clippers in 2019 after helping the Raptors win a championship. At that time, as a free agent, he accepted a lower salary than what the Raptors offered. He did this to play with another star player, Paul George, and to go back to his hometown, Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>In January 2024, Leonard signed a new contract with the Clippers. Reports say this contract is for 3 years and is worth 153 million US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says China Should Mention US Help for Freedom in War Speech</h1>
            <p>Chinese leader Xi Jinping gave a speech about the war, and he also went to a military parade with the leaders of Russia and North Korea. Today, US President Trump said that America helped China become free in the past, and Xi Jinping should talk about this in his speech. However, Trump did not give clear details about his claim that China, Russia, and North Korea are planning against the United States.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, Taiwan time, China held a military parade in Beijing to celebrate the "80th Anniversary of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were all there together. Xi Jinping gave a speech. He said that the Chinese people won their first complete victory against invaders in modern times, thanks to the anti-Japanese united front that the Chinese Communist Party started.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 2nd, US Eastern Time, Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social," that China, Russia, and North Korea are "planning against the United States."</p>
            <p>Today, when he met with Polish President Karol Nawrocki in the White House Oval Office, reporters asked him about this. He did not give clear details about his claim that China, Russia, and North Korea are planning against America.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I understand why they do that; they want me to watch, and I am watching." He added that he has a good relationship with all of them, and he will "see how good this relationship is in the next week or two."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that the United States helped China a lot in the past, but he feels America has not been thanked for helping China gain freedom. Even though Trump mentioned that Xi Jinping is his friend, he was still surprised. He said he watched Xi Jinping's speech and thought that the United States should have been mentioned because "we helped China very, very much."</p>
            <p>In addition, Trump said he has no message for Putin. Regarding the Russia-Ukraine issue, Putin knows what Trump thinks. Trump stated that no matter what Putin decides, "if we are not happy, we will see some things happen."</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for more than 3 and a half years. Since returning to the White House, Trump has been trying to find a peace plan and hopes the leaders of Russia and Ukraine can meet for talks.</p>
            <p>Foreign news reported that Putin said today he is ready to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy if Zelenskyy comes to Moscow. But Putin also said it is still unclear if such a meeting would be useful.</p>

            <h1>Putin: I See "Light at the End of the Tunnel" for Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told Ukraine today that if both sides "stay reasonable," there is a chance to end the war through talks. However, he also said that if fighting is the only way to solve the problem, he is ready to use force to end the war.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that after his trip to China, Putin said he sees "a little light at the end of the tunnel." He believes this because he thinks the US is truly trying to end this war, which is the biggest land war in Europe since World War II.</p>
            <p>Putin told reporters, "In my opinion, if we can stay reasonable, it is possible to reach an acceptable solution to end this conflict. This is what I believe."</p>
            <p>He continued, "Especially when we look at the attitude of the US government under President Trump, we see not only their statements but also their true wish to find a solution... I think there is a little light at the end of the tunnel. Let's wait and see what happens."</p>
            <p>"Otherwise, we will have to use force to solve all the difficult problems we face."</p>
            <p>However, Putin did not show any signs of changing his long-held views. These views include asking Kyiv to stop its plans to join NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).</p>
            <p>Putin said he is ready to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy if Zelenskyy visits Moscow. But he added that any such talks must be well-prepared beforehand and lead to real results.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's foreign minister replied that the idea of meeting in Moscow is "unacceptable."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy has been actively trying to meet with Putin to discuss possible peace terms, even though their positions are still very different. Zelenskyy has asked Washington to put more sanctions on Russia if Putin does not want to compromise.</p>
            <p>Trump has also been working to find a peace plan. He has said he hopes the two leaders can meet for talks. He also threatened to put more sanctions on Russia, but he has not done so yet.</p>
            <p>Russia's economy is under much pressure due to many sanctions from Western countries. Putin said that if possible, he prefers to end the war through diplomacy, meaning "peaceful ways."</p>
