Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved universities and colleges in mainland China. Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. This is the first change to the list in nearly ten years. After this change, there are still 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges on the list.

Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools controlled by China's United Front Work Department have special goals and are not purely academic. He stated that stopping cooperation with such schools is necessary and that Taiwan will no longer accept their degrees.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University because since 2019, it has been managed by China's United Front Work Department. The Ministry wants to make sure Taiwanese students study in a normal academic environment, free from political influence.

The Ministry also reminded that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools organizing trips to China should follow Taiwan's rules. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of events, the organizers, and the content to avoid political messages or one-sided offers.

The Ministry also advised schools to ask for help from the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education if they are unsure about any event organizers or plans. They want to encourage young people from both sides to learn together but also to be aware of possible risks and political intentions of event organizers.

**Video: First Car Fire on Kinmen Bridge - Surveillance Shows Car Bursting into Flames**

Today at 2:16 PM, the first car fire happened on Kinmen Bridge. A car likely had a flat tire, causing it to slide and hit the bridge's divider. The car then caught fire. The driver, Mr. Lin, and one passenger safely escaped. No one was hurt. Police and firefighters quickly arrived to control traffic and put out the fire. The car was completely destroyed. The cause of the accident is still being investigated.

The Kinmen County Fire Department received a call at 2:10 PM about a car on fire at the Lakexia end of Kinmen Bridge in Jincheng Township. The car was stuck on the divider and burning. The fire department sent four fire trucks and 12 firefighters.

When rescuers arrived, the car was on fire and stuck on the divider. Luckily, the driver and passenger had already gotten out. Firefighters used two water hoses to put out the fire quickly and cool down the car to prevent it from burning again. The car was a total loss, but no one was injured.

Police investigations show that Mr. Lin was driving towards Lieyu on Kinmen Bridge. About 1 kilometer in, he heard a tire burst. The car then slid out of control, hit the divider, and caught fire for an unknown reason. Police tested the driver for alcohol, and he was not drunk. The exact cause is still unclear.

After the accident, police first allowed one-way traffic in both directions. Then, the car was removed, and environmental workers cleaned up oil and debris. Traffic returned to normal after the road was cleaned.

The fire department advises drivers to always check their car's condition and keep a safe distance from other cars. If there's a car accident or fire, call 119 immediately and explain the situation and if anyone is hurt, to help rescuers arrive quickly.

Jincheng Police remind drivers that if a tire bursts, do not press the brakes hard. Instead, take your foot off the gas, slow down, keep the steering wheel steady, turn on hazard lights, and pull over. If you can't control the car, you can rub against the guardrail to slow down and avoid flipping over. If your car stops on the side of the road after an accident, follow the seven steps to keep people and the car safe. Especially at night or when visibility is poor, make sure your warning triangle is far enough away to warn other drivers.

**"So Scared I Can't Cry," Chinese Spouse Xiaowei Says After Returning to Guizhou, Reveals Late-Night Threat Call**

Xiaowei, a Chinese spouse, was forced to leave Taiwan in April. This was because she was found to be promoting "unification by force" on TikTok, and her residency permit was canceled. After returning to Guizhou, China, Xiaowei started sharing videos about rural life. However, she kept her direct style. She made a video accusing the Party Secretary of Xinchang Village in Guanzhou Town of not helping. She complained that she had not received compensation for her land being flooded by a reservoir. Today, she said that she received a threatening phone call from Chinese police late at night. She sadly said, "I am so scared, I can't even cry."

Xiaowei posted a video on TikTok today, saying she is very scared. She said she is a farmer, a common person, and a good citizen who has not broken any laws. She only asked the village committee why she didn't get her compensation money. Then, after 12 AM on June 28, she received a warning and threatening call from the Guanzhou police station.

In the video, Xiaowei said she is a good farmer and cannot handle being scared. She questioned why the police station would call to threaten her and for what reason. She said, "I am shaking while making this video. Is there still law? Is there still justice?" She angrily asked the Chinese police, "Is it wrong for me to defend my rights legally? How do you people work at the police station and enforce laws? Is this how you treat farmers? Calling to show off your power?"

Xiaowei said she is truly scared and cannot cry from fear. At the end of the video, she called out, "Please, relevant departments, protect us farmers. The more I think about it, the more scared I get. We farmers have no powerful connections, so we can only use the internet to ask for justice. Please pay attention."
