France's Finance Minister said that Europe needs to put stronger taxes on goods coming from China. He believes this is important to protect European businesses from being hurt by cheap Chinese products. He also mentioned that the European Union (EU) might agree on these taxes with the United States this weekend.

Europe has already put taxes on steel and cars from China. But the minister said they need to change the rules to tax more types of Chinese goods. He explained that if Europe doesn't act, China's plan to make more than half of the world's products in every industry could harm European industries a lot.

This shows that France is worried. They are concerned about new taxes from the U.S. on European goods and how the U.S. President is changing world trade. European and U.S. officials are talking this weekend to make a deal by July 9. If they don't, Europe might have to react more strongly. China recently put taxes on European brandy, after the EU taxed Chinese electric cars.

**Iran's Leader Khamenei Seen Publicly After Conflict with Israel**

Iran's top leader, Ali Khamenei, was seen in public today. This is the first time he has appeared since Iran and Israel had a 12-day conflict. State TV showed him at a mosque, greeting people and receiving cheers.

Khamenei had spoken in a video last week. However, he had not been seen publicly since Israel attacked Iran on June 13. Earlier reports said he was in a safe place during the conflict, which led to the deaths of some important Iranian military leaders and scientists.

The TV showed many people at a religious event. When Khamenei walked into the hall, people shouted supportive words. The 86-year-old leader was wearing black clothes on the stage. People in the crowd raised their fists and shouted, "Our warm blood in our veins, we give to our leader!" Khamenei avoided public appearances during the conflict to stay safe. On June 26, in a video, he promised that Iran would never give up, even though the U.S. President asked them to.
