Police in Turkey found 825 kilograms of heroin and arrested 30 people. This happened in many raids, mostly in the southern part of the country. The Interior Minister, Ali Yerlikaya, shared this news.

Turkey is a place where many drug routes cross, connecting Asia and Europe. It's one of the main ways heroin gets into Europe. The police operation started in the city of Adana and went to 7 other areas. They also found illegal weapons and many electronic devices during their searches.

A report from Europol in 2024 said that heroin is the most common illegal opiate drug in the European Union. They also said that more heroin is being moved by sea, especially through container ships and ferries coming from Turkey.

**Taiwan Women's Basketball Team Wins Big in Jones Cup First Game**

The Taiwan women's basketball team won their first game at the Jones Cup, beating the Philippines. Sidney Cooks, who might become a naturalized player for Taiwan, scored 17 points and got 11 rebounds. Lin Wen-yu also scored 14 points. Taiwan won the game 85 to 59.

Lin Wen-yu said after the game that this win is very important. She explained that Taiwan's team is now in the second division of the Asia Cup, but the Philippines is in the first division. This win shows that Taiwan's team has the skill to be in the top division. She hopes to bring Taiwan back to the first division in the Asia Cup this year.

The coach, Michael Olson, said that any new player needs time to fit in, but he thinks Cooks is a great scorer and rebounder. He believes she helps the team's offense become stronger. Cooks said that the team was a bit nervous at the start because they were playing at home, but they played much better in the second half and found their rhythm.

**iPASS MONEY and LINE Pay to Separate, Affecting 7 Million Users**

iPASS MONEY and LINE Pay will stop working together at the end of this year. This change will affect almost 7 million users in Taiwan. iPASS MONEY announced today that from January 1, 2026, all features currently in the LINE Pay wallet for iPASS MONEY will move to a new app called "iPASS MONEY."

Starting July 3, new businesses that want to use iPASS MONEY services will register through the iPASS website. iPASS MONEY has nearly 7 million users. All services like paying bills, adding money, taking out money, sending money to friends, and making payments will move to the new iPASS MONEY app. The new app will also have new features, like paying with TWQR codes and buying TPASS tickets.

LINE Pay said they are applying for their own license to operate electronic payment services. They hope to get this permission this year. Because of this, iPASS MONEY and LINE Pay plan to end their partnership on December 31, 2025. LINE Pay said they will try their best to help users before the change, so users' rights are not affected.
