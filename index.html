            <h1>New Talks Between the US and China in Madrid Focus on Trade and TikTok Deadline</h1>
            <p>An official from the US Trade Representative's Office (USTR) said today that US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with Chinese officials in Madrid, Spain, starting on September 14. They will talk about trade and other money-related issues. The deadline for TikTok to sell its US assets by September 17 is also part of these talks.</p>
            <p>Greer will go to Spain with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. They will have discussions with China's Vice Premier He Lifeng and other senior Chinese economic officials.</p>
            <p>The US Treasury Department said that the Madrid talks will cover many trade and economic topics. These include worries about national security because of TikTok, and efforts by both the US and China to stop money laundering.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce stated that the Madrid talks will focus on US tariffs, the "wrong use" of export controls, and trade issues like TikTok.</p>
            <p>Greer, Bessent, and He Lifeng last met in July in Stockholm, Sweden. China's chief trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, was also there. At that time, both sides generally agreed to stop trade disagreements for an extra 90 days. This also meant greatly reducing their very high taxes on each other's goods and allowing rare earth minerals from China to enter the US again.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump has approved extending the current 55% tax on Chinese goods until November 10.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Bessent asked the G7 group of countries to add "meaningful taxes" on goods imported from China and India. This is to make these two countries stop buying oil from Russia. This action is meant to lower Russia's oil income and encourage Moscow to join peace talks about Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Far-Right Group Marches in UK, London Police Say About 110,000 People Joined</h1>
            <p>British police said today that about 110,000 people took part in a march organized by far-right person Tommy Robinson in central London.</p>
            <p>The Metropolitan Police Service in London reported, "We believe around 110,000 people attended the 'Unite the Kingdom' march and protest."</p>
            <p>The Metropolitan Police also said that they used cameras and police helicopters to take videos to estimate the number of people.</p>
            <p>Robinson, who is against immigration and Muslims, told the crowd, "The quiet majority will not be quiet anymore... Today is the start of a cultural change."</p>
            <p>At the same time, about 5,000 people gathered nearby for a counter-march organized by "Stand Up to Racism." Police sent about 1,000 officers to keep the two groups separated.</p>
