            <h1>US Treasury Secretary Says There's No Reason for Fed Chair to Leave Now</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 22, combined foreign reports) US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had asked for a full review of the Federal Reserve (Fed) yesterday. Today, he said he sees no reason to ask Fed Chair Jerome Powell to leave his job right away.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Bessent spoke about this during an interview with Fox Business Network. Powell is feeling more and more pressure from Donald Trump's government to lower interest rates. Trump recently also attacked Powell more strongly because of the Fed's plan to spend $2.5 billion on renovations.</p>
            <p>But Trump said it's not likely he will fire Powell before his term ends next year. Trump also told the media today, "I think he's doing a very bad job, but he will be gone soon anyway."</p>
            <p>Bessent also said when talking about Powell during the TV interview, "There is no sign that he should leave right now."</p>
            <p>Bessent pointed out that Powell's term as Fed Chair will end in May 2026. If Powell wants to, he should finish his full term. But Bessent also said that if Powell wants to leave earlier, he should do that too.</p>
            <p>Last night, Bessent wrote on social media, asking the Fed to "do a complete internal review of its non-money policy actions." He said the Fed has gone away from its main job.</p>
            <p>Bessent wrote on X, a social media platform, that the Fed's "ability to act alone is very important for the US economy to keep growing and stay stable."</p>
            <p>He also said, "However, this way of governing itself is now in danger because the Fed's duties are growing into areas outside its main job." But he did not say exactly which policy areas these were. (Translator: Chang Hsiao-wen/Editor: Hung Chi-yuan) July 23, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Trump: US and Philippines Finish Trade Deal, Philippines to Pay 19% Tax</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hou Tzu-ying, Washington, July 22 special report) US President Donald Trump met with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. today. After the meeting, Trump said that the US and the Philippines "finished a trade deal." The Philippines will open its market to the US and have no taxes on goods. The US will put a 19% tax on goods coming from the Philippines. This is 1% lower than the 20% tax Trump had said he would put in an earlier letter about taxes.</p>
            <p>Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is the first leader from Southeast Asia to meet with Donald Trump since Trump returned to the White House. Since Trump started putting equal taxes on goods in early April, the US has made trade deals with other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Trump told reporters during his meeting with Marcos Jr. in the White House Oval Office that they would talk about trade. He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal," but he did not share more details.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Trump quickly wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that the meeting was good. He said, "We completed the trade deal." Based on the deal, the Philippines will open its market to the US and have no taxes on goods. The Philippines will pay a 19% tax to the US. Also, both sides will work together on military matters.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that Marcos Jr. is "a very good and tough negotiator."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an important friend of the US in Asia. Foreign reports say that last year, the US bought $5 billion more goods from the Philippines than it sold to them. The total value of goods traded between the US and the Philippines was $23.5 billion.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Trump sent letters about taxes to more than 20 trade partners, including Marcos Jr. The letters said that starting August 1, the tax on goods from the Philippines to the US would go up from 17% (which was suggested in April) to 20%. Manila wants to get a better trade deal before the August 1 deadline. (Editor: Hung Chi-yuan) July 23, 2025.</p>

            <h1>White House to Announce New AI Plan, Says US Should Export Technology to Grow AI</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 22, combined foreign reports) A document seen by Reuters shows that the US White House plans to announce a new plan tomorrow. This plan will ask to send American artificial intelligence (AI) technology to other countries. It will also try to stop state rules that are seen as too strict and stop AI from growing well.</p>
            <p>Based on a short summary of the plan seen by Reuters, the White House will stop federal money for AI from going to states that have very strict rules for AI. It will also ask the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to check if state rules conflict with federal rules.</p>
            <p>This plan will also support the growth of "open source" and "open weight" AI. It will "export American AI technology" by using "full-stack deployment" methods and the Commerce Department's data center plans.</p>
            <p>According to this document, the plan will "focus on making jobs and new successes in industries through AI, giving American workers more skills."</p>
            <p>Janet Egan, a researcher at the US think tank "The Center for a New American Security," said that, as Reuters described, this plan shows a change in market strategy. It moves from policies under Joe Biden that "mostly limited AI" to focusing on "how to start spreading the infrastructure and technology that supports the world."</p>
            <p>The summary says that even though the plan focuses on growth, it does mention how important it is to "prevent misuse and be ready for future AI-related risks."</p>
            <p>In January this year, US President Donald Trump told his government to make a plan. This plan would make "the US the world's main center for artificial intelligence" and lower rules that stop AI from growing quickly.</p>
            <p>This report, which includes ideas from the National Security Council (NSC), will be released tomorrow. Trump is planned to give an important speech tomorrow at an event called "Winning the AI Race." This event is organized by White House AI and crypto experts David Sacks and co-hosts of the All-In podcast. (Translator: Chang Hsiao-wen/Editor: Hung Chi-yuan) July 23, 2025.</p>
