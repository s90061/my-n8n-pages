            <h1>Singapore's Important Computer Systems Attacked; Experts Think China is Involved</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Singapore, July 19th) Singapore said yesterday that its important computer systems were attacked. Security experts believe a spy group linked to China carried out the cyberattack. The government is now dealing with this attack.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that K. Shanmugam, Singapore's Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, spoke about the attack. He said, "UNC3886 is a serious danger to us. It could harm our country's safety. This group attacks important strategic places and systems that provide necessary services."</p>
            <p>Mr. Shanmugan did not share many details about the attack or what happened because of security reasons.</p>
            <p>Mandiant, a security company owned by Google, said that UNC3886 is "a spy group connected to China." This group has attacked defense, technology, and communication companies in the United States and Asia before.</p>
            <p>Beijing has always said that it does not do any cyber spying.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Reuters also reported that hackers linked to China have been trying to spy on Taiwan's computer chip industry and people who study investments.</p>
            <p>Researchers from Proofpoint, a cybersecurity company, said that at least three different groups from China carried out these hacker attacks. These attacks were mostly from March to June this year, and some might still be happening.</p>
