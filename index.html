            <h1>US and Japan Make a Trade Deal: Japan Will Buy 100 Boeing Airplanes</h1>
            <p>Washington/Tokyo, July 23 (CNA) â€“ US President Trump has announced that the US and Japan have made a trade deal about taxes on goods. White House officials said that as part of the deal, Japan will buy 100 Boeing airplanes, 8 billion US dollars worth of farm goods, and other items from the US. Japan will also buy 75% more rice from the US.</p>
            <p>On the evening of July 22, Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform "Truth Social" that Japan will invest 550 billion US dollars in the US as he instructed. The US will get 90% of the money earned from this investment.</p>
            <p>He also said that Japan will open its market to more trade, including cars, trucks, rice, and other farm goods. In addition, Japan will pay a 15% equal tax on some goods to the US.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that White House officials stated that based on the agreement, Japan will buy 100 Boeing airplanes. Also, Japan will spend more money on defense from US companies each year, increasing it from 14 billion US dollars to 17 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>For the car industry, which makes up more than a quarter of Japan's exports to the US, the current taxes of 27.5% will go down to 15%.</p>
            <p>Also, other Japanese goods were supposed to have a 25% tax starting August 1st. This tax will now be lowered to 15%.</p>
            <p>White House officials also said that Japan will buy 8 billion US dollars worth of farm goods and other products. They will also increase their purchase of US rice by 75%.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that the amount of US rice imported might increase under the current rules. He added that this deal "does not hurt" Japanese farming.</p>
            <p>Shinichi Uchida, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, called this agreement a "very big step forward." He said that the deal makes the future of the economy more certain.</p>
            <p>Some economists had thought that the taxes could cause Japan, the world's fourth largest economy, to have an economic downturn. (Translator: Yang Zhaoyan) July 23, 2025.</p>

            <h1>US and China Trade Talks to Start Soon; US Finance Minister Says Tax Deadline Might Be Delayed by 90 Days</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 23 (CNA) â€“ Today, US Finance Minister Scott Bessent said that the deadline for extra taxes on goods from China, set for August 12th, might be "delayed by 90 days." The third round of trade talks between the US and China will happen next week.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that high-level officials from the US and China, the world's two biggest economies, will have their third round of trade talks on July 28th and 29th. The talks will be in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Scott Bessent will lead the US group, and He Lifeng, China's Vice Premier, will lead the Chinese group.</p>
            <p>Today, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, Bessent said, "Our relationship with China is very good right now." He also said that the upcoming talks might include more than just rare earth elements and export rules; they could be a "bigger discussion."</p>
            <p>When asked about the original August 12th deadline, Bessent said he was willing to make it much longer. He said, "I think we can delay it, maybe by 90 days."</p>
            <p>Bessent pointed out, "The stress between both sides has gone down. I think we can have good regular meetings with them."</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China made an agreement during talks in Geneva. Both sides agreed to greatly lower high taxes on goods for 90 days. The break in the trade conflict between the US and China will end on August 12th. (Translator: Shi Shi / Editor: Chen Cheng-Yi) July 23, 2025.</p>

            <h1>US Finance Minister: Japan Offers New Ways to Fund and New Money; Both Sides Agree</h1>
            <p>New York, July 23 (CNA reporter Liao Han-Yuan) â€“ The United States and Japan have reached a trade agreement. Today, US Finance Minister Scott Bessent told Bloomberg that Japan offered to be a partner. Japan will provide shares, loan guarantees, and money for investment plans in the US. He also said that the European Union (EU) could make a similar deal.</p>
            <p>Earlier, US President Donald Trump announced that a 25% tax would be put on Japanese goods starting August 1st. But recently, the US and Japan made a deal. This deal includes lowering taxes on Japanese cars and other related products sent to the US to 15%. Also, Japan will invest a total of 550 billion US dollars (about 16.115 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) in the US.</p>
            <p>US Finance Minister Scott Bessent said on Bloomberg TV that Japan is willing to offer new and creative ways to fund things in the US. Because of this, Japan received the 15% tax rate.</p>
            <p>Bessent said that Japan offered a US-Japan partnership idea. They will provide shares, loan guarantees, and money for important projects in the US. This direct investment in the US will be "brand new money."</p>
            <p>He stressed that the EU could lower taxes with the US, just like Japan did, and reach a similar agreement. Japan offering new ways to fund things was the reason for this success.</p>
            <p>News reports said that the EU is ready to put a 30% tax on 117 billion US dollars worth of goods from the US that are sold in Europe. Bessent thinks this is a plan for talks. He said if he were in Europe's position, he would respond in the same way.</p>
            <p>Bessent pointed out that the EU has not yet offered any new ideas, but the talks are going better than before; there is good progress. The EU has 27 member countries, so it is hard for them to act as one. Bessent noted that he has visited Japan 52 times since 1990. Compared to the EU, Japan can "act as one."</p>
            <p>In 2024, the EU sent almost 200 billion US dollars more goods to the US than it bought. So, rising trade problems would affect the EU more.</p>
            <p>The US team for talks will have their third meeting with China in Stockholm, Sweden, at the end of the month. Bessent said that the situation between the US and China is very good. Both sides can have wider talks, including Beijing buying oil from Russia and Iran (who face economic rules against them), and other security issues. They will also talk about many buying agreements, especially for farm goods.</p>
            <p>The pause in high taxes between the US and China will end on August 12th. Bessent said he believes it can be extended again, maybe for another 90 days. Both sides have lowered their tough positions and are taking good steps to meet regularly. (Editor: Wei Hsu) July 23, 2025.</p>
