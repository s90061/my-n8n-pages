            <h1>Cheung Kong: Selling Port Business Will Take Longer, Won't Finish in 2025</h1>
            <p>Chinese financial news reports say that Cheung Kong company managers in Hong Kong spoke today at a meeting for analysts. They said that selling Cheung Kong's port business is now in a "new phase." For example, they are asking big Chinese investors to join the talks. They want to get "approval from all important government groups." They expect this will take longer than planned, and the sale will not be done in 2025.</p>
            <p>The Daily Economic News reported that Cheung Kong managers said at the meeting that selling the port business needs "different things to be thought about by government groups in different countries."</p>
            <p>Cheung Kong managers said the company had already said it would not do any deal before getting approval from all important government groups and departments. Now, the deal is in a "new phase." For example, they are asking "mainland (Chinese) major investors" to join the talks. They hope to get "approval from all important government groups."</p>
            <p>The report says Cheung Kong managers said this process is expected to take longer than first planned, and the deal will not finish in 2025.</p>
            <p>On March 4, Cheung Kong announced that it had an agreement with BlackRock from the US and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). This group of companies wanted to buy 43 port businesses overseas, including two ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. China was very unhappy about this, and Cheung Kong felt a lot of pressure.</p>
            <p>After that, on July 28, Cheung Kong announced on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that their special talking period with the group of companies had ended. But Cheung Kong is still talking with the members of this group. They also plan to ask "major strategic investors" from China to join and become "important members" of the group. To get approval from all important government groups for the deal, the members of the group and how the deal is set up need to change. Cheung Kong will not do any deal before getting approval from all important government groups and departments.</p>

            <h1>1 Volunteer Firefighter Dies in Spain, Summer Wildfire Deaths Reach 3</h1>
            <p>Spanish officials said today that a volunteer firefighter died while putting out a fire in Leon province, in the northwest. This means that three people have now died in summer wildfires.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Nicanor Sen Velez, the head of the Castile and Leon area, wrote on X (a social media site): "Today, we are sad for the firefighter who died while fighting fires in the Valderia area of Leon province. He is the latest person to die in the summer wildfires."</p>
            <p>Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Spain's Interior Minister, confirmed the death during an interview on Spanish TV. He expressed sadness to the family, co-workers, and community of the person who died.</p>
            <p>Before this, Grande-Marlaska asked the European Union (EU) for help to put out the fires.</p>
            <p>The Spanish government specifically asked for two water-dropping planes to help fight the fires. Before this, local governments said that almost 6,000 people had to leave their homes in 26 towns.</p>
            <p>Spain is one of several European countries that have had very hot weather this week. This hot weather has made the wildfires worse. Scientists say that this problem is getting worse because of climate change caused by humans.</p>
            <p>So far this year, Spain has had 199 wildfires. These fires have burned almost 98,784 hectares of land. This is more than twice the area burned during the same time last year.</p>
