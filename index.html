Microsoft has recently launched a new, more advanced version of its AI assistant, Copilot, for individuals. This new service, called Copilot Pro, costs $20 per month. It brings powerful artificial intelligence tools to personal computers, helping people with their daily tasks.

With Copilot Pro, users can access AI features directly within popular Microsoft programs like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. This means the AI can help write documents, create spreadsheets, design presentations, and manage emails more easily. Subscribers also get faster access to the newest AI technology and can even create their own special AI tools for specific needs. This move by Microsoft aims to make advanced AI more available to everyone, hoping to make people more productive at work and in their personal projects.

**Earth and Daily Life: 2023 - The Hottest Year**

A recent report has confirmed that 2023 was the warmest year our planet has ever recorded. This news is a serious concern for scientists and people around the world, as temperatures continue to rise at an alarming rate. The global average temperature in 2023 was significantly higher than in any previous year, breaking the record set in 2016.

Scientists explain that this increase in temperature is mainly due to human activities, especially the release of gases like carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, causing the Earth to get hotter. Experts warn that if we do not reduce these emissions, we will see more extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, heavy floods, and severe storms, impacting daily life and the environment even more. This makes it very important for countries and individuals to take action against climate change.

**Work and Travel: The Rise of 'Bleisure' Trips**

A new trend called "bleisure" travel is becoming popular, where people combine their business trips with personal leisure time. This means after finishing work tasks in another city or country, employees extend their stay to enjoy sightseeing, local culture, or simply relax.

This trend allows people to explore new places and get more enjoyment out of their travel, rather than just focusing on work. It can help improve a person's work-life balance and make them feel happier with their job. Companies are noticing this and are starting to support "bleisure" trips more. They see it as a good way to keep employees satisfied and also to attract new talent. By offering more flexibility for combining work and holidays, businesses are making travel more appealing and beneficial for their staff.`;
