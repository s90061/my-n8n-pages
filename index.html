            <h1>Minister Kuo Chih-hui Attends Kaohsiung Startup Expo, Says "I'll Stick to My Script"</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Asia Bay InnoVEX Greater South Expo opened today in Kaohsiung. Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, came to attend. When he gave his speech, he joked about himself by saying, "I will still stick to my script," and took out his prepared speech.</p>
            <p>This is the 5th "Meet Greater South Asia Bay InnoVEX" expo. Today, it opened with Minister Kuo Chih-hui, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai, and Director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Kaohsiung Branch, Brent Christensen, among others. When Minister Kuo gave his speech, he held his prepared script and smiled, saying, "I will still stick to my script." After he finished, the audience applauded warmly.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo said that the Asia Bay InnoVEX Greater South has become an important event for new businesses in Southern Taiwan. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has fully supported it since the first year. The "Asia Bay Startup Park" has now brought in 13 international startup accelerators, creating over 2.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars in investments and business chances.</p>
            <p>Also, to help local industries change and grow, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has connected with 15 research organizations. They are bringing advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to old production lines. This helps local small and medium-sized businesses improve their smart manufacturing and create new products faster.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that the InnoVEX Greater South Expo has been held in Kaohsiung for 5 years in a row. It gets bigger every year. This year, 260 groups are taking part, including 31 international teams. This time, 9 big companies also added job recruiting plans. Kaohsiung is working hard to make things digital. It gives a platform and help to new companies. Mayor Chen also thanked "Business Next" for working with the city government to create the best stage for startups.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen said that many big international companies, like TSMC with its 2-nanometer factory, NVIDIA, and Cisco, are coming to Kaohsiung. Pier-2 Art Center will become one of the research centers for the Smart Kaohsiung Lighthouse project. The Banana Pier, which used to transport bananas, will be finished being rebuilt by the end of the year and will become an AI research center.</p>
            <p>Ho Fei-peng, the honorary publisher of "Business Next," said in his speech that he couldn't wait to put on his running shoes and run in Asia Bay this morning. He said Kaohsiung has really changed a lot in recent years. Kaohsiung is showing two beautiful things in technology: one is TSMC and NVIDIA, which are "national treasures" on the world stage. The second is the 300 promising startup teams at the expo.</p>
            <p>Liberty Times reported today that Deputy Secretary-General of the Presidential Office, Chang Tun-han, will become the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. He will be responsible for connecting the government and different political groups. The current Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Kung Ming-hsin, who has good knowledge of finance, will become the Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

            <h1>Water Company to Replace Pipes and Use Technology to Reduce Water Leaks in Penghu</h1>
            <p>In Penghu, more than 10% of the water for homes is lost because of leaks. Today, during a meeting about the "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan, Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) said they will work in two ways. They will replace pipes in areas where there are many leaks, and they will hire outside companies to use technology to find leaks. This will help stop pipes from breaking and water from being cut off, making sure people have a steady supply of water.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Lee Chia-jung, the chairman of Taiwan Water Corporation, led a team to meet with Penghu County Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu and his team. They talked about how to keep water resources available for a long time and how to supply water to people. Today, they held a public meeting about the "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan at the Penghu Youth Activity Center. Tsai Bo-yuan, the head of TWC's Leakage Prevention Department, explained the plan and how it will be carried out to people from different parts of the government and businesses.</p>
            <p>Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu thanked Taiwan Water Corporation for their long-term help in providing water for Penghu and building important water systems. He also praised the "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan. He said that about 60% of Penghu's water comes from changing seawater into fresh water. Besides building more seawater treatment plants, it is also very important to replace old pipes and reduce water leaks. He asked people to support this and to save water together.</p>
            <p>Tsai Bo-yuan said that rain in Penghu does not come evenly throughout the year. The need for water keeps growing as more people live there, especially in the larger Magong area. But the rate of water leakage for household water supply is as high as 12% to 13%, which is a big problem. From 2019 to 2024, Taiwan Water Corporation spent over 700 million New Taiwan Dollars. They finished the first part of replacing water pipes and looking for leaks. They replaced 102 kilometers of pipes, and 83 kilometers of these were in the Magong area.</p>
            <p>He also said that to use water resources better, Taiwan Water Corporation will start a "Reducing Water Leakage Rate" plan this year, which will continue until 2032. They will spend 2.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars. They will replace 50 to 100 kilometers of pipes in areas with many leaks. At the same time, they will use AI technology from private companies to help check for leaks. They hope this will greatly reduce broken pipes and water cuts. This will provide a more stable and good quality water supply for the Penghu area.</p>
