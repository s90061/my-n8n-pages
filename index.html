            <h1>23-year-old Vietnamese Youth Writes About a Rooftop Hair Salon and Wins Migrant Literature Award</h1>
            <p>The 10th Migrant Literature Award winners were announced today. Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Hi·ªÅn, a 23-year-old from Vietnam, won the first prize. She wrote about the warm human stories and feelings in "The Rooftop Hair Salon."</p>
            <p>The story talks about a hair salon on the top floor of an old building in a Taichung night market. A Vietnamese woman named A-Mei runs it. She does not ask for money. Instead, she accepts mangoes, cookies, or a "thank you." She has been away from home for many years and has no family here. With her scissors and kind greetings, she asks migrant workers from different countries in Taiwan, "How have you been lately?" Her words comfort many people who feel lost.</p>
            <p>The event organizers said in a press release that the judging panel this year had many famous people. Director Wu Nien-jen, actress Janine Chang, former director of the National Museum of Taiwan Literature Lin Chin-li, writing teacher Tsai Chi-hua, and Professor Kuan Chung-hsiang from National Chung Cheng University were the judges.</p>
            <p>Wu Nien-jen praised "The Rooftop Hair Salon." He said the story flowed well and felt very real. It did not have too many extra feelings. It was full of clear pictures in the mind, and the ending was very strong. He said it would be very good for a movie. He even thought about calling Public Television Service to suggest making it into a film when he was halfway through reading it.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-li said, "This article has a complete structure. It describes the scene and builds up emotions deeply. It creates very clear pictures in the mind and shows excellent literary quality."</p>
            <p>This year, 166 works from 5 countries joined the competition. There were 88 from Indonesia, 33 from Vietnam, 27 from the Philippines, 13 from Thailand, and 5 from Myanmar. Judges who spoke the native languages chose 35 good works. After translation, the final judges picked the winning entries.</p>
            <p>What was special this year was the first "Youth Jury." Nearly 60 young people aged 15 to 20, who were talented and enthusiastic, were considered. Factors like region, gender, education, life experience, and being a "new second generation" (children of immigrants) were thought about. Finally, 5 young people were chosen to be judges. This brought new ideas and energy to the Migrant Literature Award.</p>
            <p>For the full list of winners, please see the "Migrant Literature Award" Taiwan Literature Award for Migrants Facebook fan page.</p>

            <h1>Trump Changes Rules for Commercial Rocket Launches, SpaceX Might Benefit</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C., August 13 (CNA) ‚Äì U.S. President Trump signed an order today. It makes federal rules for commercial rocket launches simpler. Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) and other private space companies might gain from this.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the White House said in a statement that Trump's order tells the U.S. Secretary of Transportation to stop or speed up environmental checks by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for rocket launch permits.</p>
            <p>This order also asks the Secretary of Transportation to check and remove old, repeated, or too strict rules for rocket launches and returns. It says that "slow approval processes stop investment and new ideas, and they limit American companies from leading the global space market."</p>
            <p>The order also states, "Rules about the environment and other permits that are too complicated can slow down commercial space launches and building space infrastructure. This gives an advantage to old companies that can pay for these rules, and it is bad for new companies that cannot afford the high costs."</p>
            <p>Even though Musk and Trump have had disagreements and their relationship has gotten worse recently, Musk's SpaceX is expected to be the biggest and most direct winner from this new order.</p>
            <p>Trump's order did not name SpaceX directly. However, SpaceX launches rockets much more often than all other U.S. space groups, including NASA.</p>
            <p>Musk has complained that environmental reviews and accident investigations often slow down the testing of SpaceX's new "Starship" rocket at its launch site in South Texas.</p>

            <h1>Four Big Restaurant Groups Are Opening More Stores in New Malls and Street Locations</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 14 (CNA) ‚Äì The demand for food in Taiwan is strong. Four large restaurant groups are opening new stores faster this year. They are moving into good street locations and new shopping malls. Lion Travel Group's food business wants to double its income in three years. Kanpai Group is still growing its hot pot brands.

            <p>Kanpai said that since Kurogeya started, most of its stores have been inside department stores and shopping centers. So far, they have opened 15 stores. As there are fewer new spots in department stores, the brand is now opening street-side stores.</p>
            <p>Lion Travel Group announced today that its food business, "Shinshokuryo," is growing. Its brand gonnaEXPRESS opened a new store on July 25 in DREAM PLAZA mall in Xinyi District. This is the 11th store for Shinshokuryo. It aims to get customers from offices and gyms in the Xinyi area.</p>
            <p>Shinshokuryo currently owns the coffee shop brand "Guangyi" and its own brand "gonna." It has 6 "gonnaEAT" stores, which include independent street-side stores and mall locations. It also has 2 "gonnaEXPRESS" stores for food courts and office areas, and 1 "gonna+" store with special design.</p>
            <p>Shinshokuryo said that all its brands are doing well. Their goal is to earn 500 million NTD in 2025. In the first half of this year, their income grew by over 20% compared to last year. Next year, the brand will grow quickly. They plan to open 12 more stores in three years and expect their yearly income to double.</p>
            <p>Wowprime Group's income in the first half of the year was the highest ever, reaching 3.052 billion NTD. After tax, the company's profit was 175 million NTD, and the earnings per share were 4.47 NTD. In the second half of the year, they will open stores faster and start to open stores abroad. Besides opening "1010 Hunan Cuisine" and "YABI KITCHEN" in Dream Plaza in July, the group is also expanding into central and southern Taiwan. Wowprime will open stores in shopping malls in Taichung and Tainan in August.</p>
            <p>Wowprime said that in Taiwan, they are focusing on having many different brands. Their "Global Research and Development Center" in Zhongli, Taoyuan, is expected to open in the fourth quarter. It will help with expanding into overseas markets. Their first two stores in the U.S. are planned to open in the fourth quarter in a main business area of Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>Doufu Group, which owns brands like "Dubu House," had a total income of 1.959 billion NTD in the first half of the year. This was a 14.14% increase from last year and the highest ever for that period. Because of exchange rates in the second quarter, the profit belonging to the parent company in the first half was 183 million NTD, which was a 9.31% decrease from last year. The earnings per share (EPS) was 6.85 NTD.</p>
            <p>Doufu Group said that its brand "Han Jiangxi's Little Kitchen" opened 3 new stores in June and July. This brand now has 20 stores. The group's "Jiang Man Tang" also opened its first store in Taipei and New Taipei City in Dream Plaza in July. The group's 7 brands had 87 stores across Taiwan by the end of July.
