            <p>Taipei, October 11 (CNA) â€“ The Golden Bell Awards for radio shows were held tonight. Ni Peipei, a well-known DJ who has worked in radio for over 50 years, received a special award. She thanked her brother, Ni Minran, who has passed away. She said, "He was like a star in the sky who taught me how to be professional at work."</p>
            <p>This year, the Minister of Culture, Li Yuan, personally gave the Special Contribution Award to Liao Jianghua, a recording engineer, and to DJ Ni Peipei, who has worked in radio for half a century.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s, Ni Peipei became a very popular DJ with her show "Tonight's Stars." She helped and inspired many people. She then moved from being a radio person to managing a radio station. She has been working for 50 years without stopping.</p>
            <p>Ni Peipei spoke with feeling and said her first teacher was her late brother, Ni Minran. "He was like a star in the sky. He was very talented and full of new ideas. He influenced me a lot. He taught me how to speak well and how to be professional at work."</p>
            <p>Also, in the past, recording engineers were very important for radio shows. They had to create all sound effects by hand. This made radio shows feel alive.

He said that because of them, recording engineers exist today. He hopes that this art and culture can continue.</p>

            <p>Jerusalem, October 11 (CNA) â€“ Israel's prison service said today that Israel has started moving prisoners to two jails. This is part of the plan to release prisoners following a ceasefire agreement with Gaza. The main goal of this agreement is to free hostages held by the Palestinian group Hamas.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip states that Israel will release 250 prisoners. Some of these prisoners were jailed for life because of deadly attacks. Hamas, on the other hand, must release the remaining 48 Israeli hostages by October 13 at the latest, whether they are alive or not.</p>
            <p>The Israeli prison authority said in a statement today that thousands of staff, including prison officers, worked through the night. They did this to carry out the government's decision to "make sure all Israeli hostages are released."</p>

            <h1>Man in Taichung Drives Under the Influence, Hits a Tea Shop, Causing 1 Death and 1 Injury; Ordered to Be Held Without Contact</h1>
            <p>Taichung, October 11 (CNA) â€“ A man named Liu drove his car into a tea shop in West District, Taichung, early on October 9. This caused one death and one injury to a mother and son inside the shop. Tests showed that Mr. Liu had drugs in his system. Today, after being released from the hospital, he was sent to the police. He is accused of causing death by negligence and endangering public safety. The Taichung District Court decided he should be held in custody and not allowed to see anyone.</p>
            <p>At 3:21 AM on October 9, a car crashed at high speed into a tea shop at the corner of Wuquan West Road and Wuquan Road in Taichung's West District. A mother and son inside the shop were hurt, leading to one death and one injury. The 43-year-old driver, Mr. Liu, had drugs in his urine. After he was released from the hospital today, the police took him to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the prosecutor believed that Mr. Liu committed serious crimes. These include driving under the influence of drugs, causing death, and using and having Class 2 drugs. He could face at least 3 years in prison. He will also have to pay a lot of money for damages. The prosecutor thought he might try to run away. Also, the police still need to find out where he got the drugs, and there was a risk he might talk to other people involved. Because of this, the prosecutor asked the Taichung District Court to hold him in custody and not allow him to see anyone. The court agreed.</p>
