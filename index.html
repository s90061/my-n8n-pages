            <h1>Japanese Poll: 53.6% Believe Sanae Takaichi as Prime Minister Will Worsen Japan-China Relations</h1>
            <p>A senior Japanese politician, Sanae Takaichi, has been chosen as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). This means she might become the first female Prime Minister in Japan's history. A recent survey by Kyodo News showed that 53.6% of people think that if Takaichi becomes Prime Minister, the relationship between Japan and China will get worse.</p>
            <p>Because Sanae Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, Kyodo News conducted a quick national phone survey from October 4th to 6th. The results showed that 68.4% of the people surveyed have "hopes" for Sanae Takaichi.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi Dongshi Ocean Festival Fireworks Show: 18,000 Explosions Light Up Mid-Autumn Night</h1>
            <p>The 2025 "Dongshi Ocean Festival" in Chiayi County held a wonderful fireworks show over the sea tonight at 7 PM. In just 12 minutes, 18,000 fireworks were set off. About 70,000 people watched the beautiful display and made happy memories during the Mid-Autumn Festival. People also praised how quickly the traffic left the area.</p>
            <p>A photographer at the event told the news that "when several 16-inch fireworks exploded over the sea, they spread out in circles in the sky. They were over 2 to 3 kilometers wide. Almost everyone watching was very surprised." He added that the fireworks in the sky and their reflections in the sea were incredibly beautiful.</p>
            <p>Ms. Shen Ya-ju, a section chief from the Chiayi County Culture and Tourism Bureau, which organized the "Dongshi Ocean Festival," said that the weather was very good tonight. A light breeze blew the smoke out to sea, so it did not block what the audience could see. The wind also did not change the shape of the fireworks, so they looked clear and beautiful.</p>
            <p>Ms. Shen explained that the "Dongshi Ocean Festival" was originally planned for the summer. But due to bad weather, it was moved to the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. The sea fireworks show was also moved from 9 PM to 7 PM because night comes earlier in autumn. Police started managing traffic and guiding cars at noon to stop too many vehicles from going into Dongshi Fisherman's Wharf.</p>
            <p>Ms. Shen pointed out that last year, it took until midnight for all people and cars to leave after the fireworks. This did not happen tonight. People and cars left within an hour after the fireworks finished. The event ended successfully.</p>
            <p>Chiayi County Magistrate Weng Chang-liang thanked the local people and visitors for coming and supporting the event. He said, "See you next year at the Ocean Festival."</p>
