            <h1>Poll: More Than Half of Americans Think Redrawing Election Districts is Bad for Democracy</h1>
            <p>A new poll from Reuters and Ipsos shows that most Americans believe that changing the maps for how federal House of Representatives districts are drawn, to help one political party, is bad for democracy. This has happened in places like Texas and California.</p>
            <p>The poll found that 57% of people asked are worried that American democracy itself might be in danger. 80% of people who support the Democratic Party shared this idea, while 40% of people who support the Republican Party felt the same way.</p>
            <p>The poll also showed that people are very worried about the increasing political disagreements in Washington and state capitals. Currently, the Republican Party controls both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This poll lasted for 6 days and ended on August 18th. 4446 adult Americans took part in it.</p>
            <p>The poll discovered that 55% of the people surveyed, including 71% of Democrats and 46% of Republicans, think that the current plans to redraw district maps, which governors in Texas and California are doing using a method called "Gerrymandering," are "bad for democracy."</p>
            <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, called a special meeting of the state government because President Trump asked him to. They are planning to redraw the Congressional districts before the 2026 midterm elections. This is to help the Republican Party keep their current majority in the House, which is 219 seats compared to 212 seats.</p>
            <p>Historically, the party of the sitting president often loses seats in the House during midterm elections. This can stop new laws from being passed. In Trump's first time as president, it led to two investigations that could have removed him from office.</p>
            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who might run for president in 2028, said he would try to redraw California's district map as a response. He wants to add 5 Democratic seats to make up for the seats Republicans expect to gain in Texas.</p>
            <p>This way of drawing maps is not new, but it is getting attention because it is not being done at the usual time, which is after the population count every ten years. This means that most elections for the House of Representatives are not very competitive in general elections. In recent decades, about two-thirds of House elections were won by a big difference of more than 20 percentage points.</p>

            <h1>New Use for Korotkoff Sound Technology: Comai Measures Blood Pressure with Vibrations</h1>
            <p>Checking blood pressure regularly is important for staying healthy. However, for people with stiff arteries or diabetes, electronic blood pressure machines might not give correct readings. This can happen because of how the machine is set up, how the person sits, or how the measurement is taken. Comai Medical is working hard to create a blood pressure monitor that uses Korotkoff sounds. This aims to solve a difficult problem in medicine. The company will also work with a supplier in the United States to sell its product around the world.</p>
            <p>Most people know that doctors use a stethoscope and a cuff that tightens around the arm to take blood pressure. They listen to the pulse and watch a mercury column change. This method has been used for over a hundred years. It was improved by a Russian doctor, Nikolai Korotkoff, during a war in 1904-1905. As the arm cuff pressure goes down, doctors use a stethoscope to listen to the sound of blood pushing through the blood vessel. This sound helps them measure blood pressure and is called "Korotkoff Sounds." It is still seen as the medical standard for measuring blood pressure today.</p>
            <p>It has been difficult to make the Korotkoff sound method automatic. The main reason is that there hasn't been a cheap electronic way to measure these sounds as precisely as a human ear can. Because of this, it has not become common for use at home. Most electronic blood pressure machines sold today use a different method called the oscillometric method. This method is easy to use, but sometimes its results can be slightly different from the Korotkoff sound method.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi, who is the CEO of Comai Medical Technology Co., Ltd., said, "Scientists create models to make hard problems simpler once they find a good model." He explained that the oscillometric method works by creating a model of how blood pressure changes. It calculates blood pressure numbers by finding the connection between the highest pressure, lowest pressure, and the pressure in the arm cuff.</p>
            <p>He pointed out, "If these connections are always fixed, you can build a model that works for everyone." "But that's where the problem is." The first model for the oscillometric method was made for young people who have flexible blood vessels and are quite similar to each other. But as people get older, especially after age 50, they are more likely to get long-term health problems like kidney disease, diabetes, and stiff arteries. Their blood vessels are very different from when they were young, which makes the measurements less accurate.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi has worked with medical devices for more than 20 years. He believes that if they cannot use Korotkoff sound technology to improve on the limits of the oscillometric method, they cannot truly make blood pressure monitoring more accurate.</p>
            <p>In 2013, a Japanese company that studied stiff arteries introduced a new technology. It used a very sensitive sensor to pick up tiny vibration signals from blood vessels. The first goal of this technology was to create a sensor that could tell how stiff arteries were.</p>
            <p>This made Lin Kun-yi very excited. He quickly decided to sell his house to buy the patent. In 2018, he started Comai Medical to develop this technology, which he felt "should exist but was always missing."</p>
            <p>Before, Lin Kun-yi tried to use a microphone to catch Korotkoff sounds. But most sounds inside the human body are low-pitched, like the quiet rumbling from the stomach or soft heartbeats. He said, "If there's a problem with the heart, the sound is like a horse running on sand â€“ it's hard to understand and catch." Even though Korotkoff sounds are loud enough for a human ear to hear, a normal microphone cannot record them clearly. "To record them accurately, you would likely need a microphone like those used in big concerts, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi was inspired by the Japanese team and changed his approach to measuring vibrations instead. He bought their patent and improved it to use a semiconductor strain gauge as the main sensor. This technology was originally used in earthquake warning systems, installed on bridges and buildings, to detect very small and hidden signals within vibrations.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi described it, "A normal sensor is like a low-power telescope, only showing the outline of distant mountains. But a semiconductor sensor is like a high-power telescope, clearly showing every tree on the mountain and how the branches move."</p>
            <p>After many years of research, the Comai team successfully brought this small vibration sensing technology into blood pressure measurement. They created an innovative device called "K-sensor," named after the first letter of Dr. Korotkoff's last name, to honor him.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi is grateful for many important supporters. In 2019, Comai received money from the National Development Fund. Also, Wang Chong-chih, the CEO of TAcc+, a national program to help new businesses, liked Comai's idea and helped share their technology. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also chose Comai to be part of the "2025 SelectUSA Tech" group. Lin Kun-yi said that the K-sensor had not applied for any related grants from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. "Normally, we wouldn't be chosen, but the Ministry of Economic Affairs saw Comai's potential and took us to the US to find business partners." Comai is still in the process of getting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Taiwan's Food and Drug Administration (TFDA). Luckily, Comai has already made a plan to work with EXEL, a US company that supplies medical products, at the "SelectUSA Investment Summit." After getting FDA approval, they will enter the international market.</p>
            <p>Lin Kun-yi stated, "Comai's long-term goal is for everyone to be able to use Korotkoff sound technology. We want to create more ways to understand human body signals and even develop patterns of vibration signals for diseases like heart failure." If this technology works well, they hope to use it in more areas and explore more ways to monitor body signals in the future.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Says He Can Meet Putin, But Only with Security Guarantees from Allies First</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that he can meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. However, his allies must first agree to give Ukraine security guarantees. These guarantees would help stop Russia from attacking again after the fighting stops.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Zelenskyy warned in talks made public today that both sides are preparing for more fighting. He said that Russia is gathering troops in the southern part of the country, and Ukraine is testing new long-range cruise missiles.</p>
            <p>Russia stated today that Ukraine does not seem interested in "long-term peace." It accused Ukraine's government of asking for security guarantees that do not match what Moscow wants.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump is working to arrange discussions between Zelenskyy and Putin to end Russia's war against Ukraine, which has lasted three and a half years.</p>
            <p>Trump's actions are different from the Western countries' policy of not dealing with the Russian leader for many years. However, there has been no real progress towards a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy told reporters in talks made public today, "We want to understand the structure of security guarantees within 7 to 10 days... We need to know what each country is ready to do at each specific moment."</p>
            <p>Allied countries, led by the UK and France, are forming a military group to support Ukraine's security guarantees.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that once this plan for security guarantees is agreed upon, Trump wants to see Putin and Zelenskyy meet face-to-face.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that his meeting with Putin should take place in a "neutral" European country. He ruled out having a meeting in Moscow.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also did not agree with the idea of China helping with Ukraine's security guarantees. He said this was because Beijing is said to support Moscow.</p>
