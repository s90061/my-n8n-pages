The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to greatly increase the use of co-packaged optics (CPO), which will benefit many chip and component suppliers, including Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). J.P. Morgan predicts that the CPO market will grow to $5 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing demand for faster and more efficient data centers. CPO technology combines optical and electrical components into a single package, reducing power consumption and improving performance, which is essential for the high demands of AI workloads.
