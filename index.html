            <h1>President Lai Plans to Increase Military Spending for Taiwan's Defense; US Strongly Supports This</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te announced that Taiwan will increase its defense budget and quickly build a "Taiwan Shield." The US State Department said today that it strongly supports Taiwan's decision to spend more on defense. The US's main goal is to keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It will make sure Taiwan has enough ways to defend itself from any threats, as required by law.</p>
            <p>On October 10th, President Lai said in his National Day speech that the new defense budget will help build the "Taiwan Shield" faster. He also said that by 2030, the defense budget will be 5% of Taiwan's total economic output (GDP). This shows Taiwan's strong wish to protect itself.</p>
            <p>The US State Department replied that it strongly supports Taiwan making its defense stronger and better at stopping attacks. This will happen through changes and a promise to increase military spending. "We are happy that President Lai announced Taiwan plans to spend more than 3% of its GDP on defense by 2026, and reach 5% by 2030."</p>
            <p>About the "Taiwan Shield," the Ministry of National Defense said it will continue to plan to buy new air defense systems. It will also combine existing air defense missiles with advanced sensors like radar. This will create a strong, multi-level air defense system.</p>
            <p>The US State Department said that keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is their top priority. The US will continue to follow the Taiwan Relations Act. This law helps ensure Taiwan has enough ways to defend itself against the threats it faces.</p>
            <p>The US State Department's comments today about Taiwan's military changes and increased spending are similar to what John Noh, the person nominated to be Assistant Secretary of Defense for Indo-Pacific Security, said on October 7th in the Senate.</p>
            <p>At that time, he said that Taiwan needs to make big changes in many areas. These include training, getting people ready for defense, combining military and civilian efforts, making important buildings safer, and improving cyber security. Former President Trump once said that Taiwan faces a big threat from the Chinese army. He believed Taiwan should increase its defense spending to 10% of its GDP, and Mr. Noh strongly supports this idea.</p>
            <p>Before he started his job, Elbridge Colby, a former Under Secretary of Defense, also stressed that Taiwan's military spending is too low and should be close to 10% of its GDP.</p>
            <p>However, most experts say that spending 10% of GDP on defense is probably not possible. Ambassador Yu Tai-san, Taiwan's representative to the US, was recently interviewed by "Fox Business News." He also pointed out Taiwan's investments in other important areas.</p>
            <p>He said that most people only think about the military side of an attack. But in reality, an attack on Taiwan also includes using social media for propaganda, controlling the media, stopping coast guard ships, and cutting undersea cables. So, Taiwan is not only making its military stronger but also making its whole society more resilient.</p>

            <h1>McKinsey Report: China's Rare Earth Rules Could Affect One Million German Jobs</h1>
            <p>A new study from the consulting company McKinsey shows that about one million workers in Germany have jobs that depend heavily on rare earth materials. These jobs are in industries like car making, energy, and aerospace. If China stops supplying these materials, up to 4 million direct and indirect jobs, and about 370 billion euros worth of production, could be at risk. This is equal to 9% of Germany's total economic output.</p>
            <p>On October 9th, China announced that all exports of technology for mining and processing rare earths will now need official approval first. This means China is controlling these exports even more strictly. The world relies heavily on China for rare earths. As the US and China continue their trade disagreement, China's new rare earth rules are also making German industries worried.</p>
            <p>According to an internal McKinsey report obtained by the German business newspaper "Handelsblatt," industries that use rare earths in their production, such as car manufacturing, renewable energy equipment, semiconductors, machinery, and aerospace, add about 150 billion euros (around 5.3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) to the German economy each year. They also support about 3 million indirect jobs.</p>
            <p>If China limits rare earth exports, the total direct and indirect impact could reach 370 billion euros (around 13.1 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). This is about 9% of Germany's total economic output (GDP). It would affect jobs and Germany's main industries.</p>
            <p>Cornelius BÃ¤hr, an expert at the German Economic Institute (IW), said that McKinsey's numbers are reasonable. Earlier research by IW showed that about 1.3 million workers in Germany make products that contain rare earths. If the supply stops, it would have a big effect on jobs.</p>
            <p>Christian Hoffmann, a partner at McKinsey's German office, told Handelsblatt that in the past, industries mainly focused on how raw material prices changed. Now, it is more important to know if there will be enough supply to keep production going.</p>
            <p>For example, take "germanium," which is an important material for making optical fibers, semiconductors, and military equipment. At the end of last year, China said it would stop exporting germanium to the US and greatly reduce its supply to the European Union. This caused Europe's imports to drop by nearly 60% in the first half of this year compared to the same time last year. One raw materials company said that European businesses at first did not think the risk was serious. Now, "the market is in a panic, and the industry is shocked."</p>
            <p>Hoffmann pointed out that in recent years, Germany has suggested ways to make sure it gets key raw materials many times. But whenever the market became stable for a short time, these plans were put aside. He said that many companies only recently understood that having a secure supply of raw materials needs a long-term plan.</p>
            <p>Hoffmann praised the "Raw Material Fund" program that the German government set up last year. He believes it is the right step to help companies find new sources of rare earths outside of China.</p>
            <p>This fund is managed by the German state-owned KfW bank, which takes responsibility for project guarantees. This helps lower risks for companies and encourages them to invest. The government will also help pay for the extra costs to make China's cheap rare earths less competitive.</p>
            <p>Hoffmann suggested that different industries should work together. Manufacturers, mining companies, universities, banks, and private investment firms should all join to create a complete supply chain, from mining and processing to storage. Also, special groups or trading platforms could be formed to buy materials. This would give Germany more power in talks in the international raw materials market and better protect German jobs and future industries.</p>

            <h1>US Trade Representative: Beijing Is Slow to Talk About Rare Earth Controls, China's Growing Power Will Not Be Accepted</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai said on the 12th that China's Ministry of Commerce has been slow to talk with the U.S. about its new rules for rare earth exports. She said that the U.S. will not accept China getting more power in the rare earth market. Tai also said that the U.S. is checking how it can use the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules to stop other countries from taking too much control of global trade in important goods like rare earths.</p>
            <p>China announced on October 9th that it will need special approval for all exports of technology related to mining and processing rare earths. This new rule will start on October 31st. This is a big step to control the supply of rare earth elements, which are very important for making things like electric cars and missiles.</p>
            <p>Tai spoke to reporters after a meeting of trade ministers from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group in Seattle. She said that the U.S. has been trying to talk with China's Ministry of Commerce about these new rules, but they have not moved quickly.</p>
            <p>She emphasized that the U.S. will not allow China to get too much power in the market for these important materials. Tai stated, "We will not allow one country to get too much control over key parts of global trade. We will not let one country control things that the rest of the world needs to survive and prosper."</p>
            <p>Tai mentioned that China's Ministry of Commerce has not yet shared enough details about the new export rules. Because of this, the U.S. cannot truly understand the reasons behind them or what effects they will have.</p>
            <p>Tai also said that she and her team are looking at how to use existing WTO rules. They want to prevent countries from using their control over certain important goods to gain unfair trade advantages. She explained that this could be a new way for countries to use trade rules to deal with challenges in today's global economy.</p>
            <p>Rare earths are a group of 17 chemical elements. They are very important for many new technologies, including electric vehicles, wind turbines, and military equipment. China controls a very large part of the world's rare earth mining and processing. For example, China mines about 70% of the world's rare earths and processes about 90% of them.</p>
