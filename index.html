            <h1>Zelenskyy Says Ukraine Makes Almost 60% of Its Own Weapons</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that almost 60% of the weapons used by the Ukrainian army are made in Ukraine. This is more than the goal he set two months ago.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy said in his evening speech: "During this war, Ukraine has reached a point where almost 60% of the weapons we have, the weapons in the hands of our soldiers, are made in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>He also said, "These weapons are very strong and have many modern features."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy and other officials have always said that making more weapons in Ukraine is very important. It helps Ukraine protect itself in the future.</p>
            <p>Ukraine has been focusing on making drones. It also provides air defense systems. These systems help stop Russia's many drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>
            <p>Officials also said that making drones to stop enemy drones is a good and cheap way to fight against Russia's attacks from the air.</p>

            <h1>Cable Break Might Be Why Portugal Cable Car Crashed</h1>
            <p>On September 3rd, a cable car in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, crashed. 16 people died. Investigators said today that the cable connecting the two cars broke shortly before the crash. This happened even though the cable passed a visual check earlier that day.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Portugal's accident investigation agency for air and rail (GPIAAF) released a statement. It said: "Based on the evidence we have now, the cable car had regular maintenance. Also, a normal visual check was done on the morning of the accident. At that time, no problems were found with the cable or brake system."</p>
            <p>However, the statement also said that it was not possible to visually check the part where the cable connects to the car just before the accident.</p>
            <p>Investigators found in their first look that the cable car hit at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. The whole accident happened in just 50 seconds.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that investigators said they have not yet given a final reason for the accident. They will give a full first report within 45 days.</p>
