            <h1>Some National Highway Sections Were Crowded This Morning; Look Out for 12 Busy Sections This Afternoon</h1>
            <p>Taiwanâ€™s National Freeway Bureau said that this morning, the main crowded part of the national highway was National Freeway 1, heading north from Yuanshan to Xizhi. This afternoon, they expect 12 sections, like the Xiluo-Puyan System on National Freeway 1 North, to be very busy with many cars. Drivers should pay attention to this.</p>
            <p>Today is the second day of the Teachersâ€™ Day long weekend. The Ministry of Transportation and Communicationsâ€™ National Freeway Bureau sent out a press release. It said that by 11 AM today, the total traffic on all national highways was 31.2 million vehicle kilometers. They expect the total traffic today to be 113 million vehicle kilometers.</p>
            <p>The National Freeway Bureau stated that this morning, the busy parts of the national highway were mainly National Freeway 1, going north from Yuanshan to Xizhi, and National Freeway 1, going south from Hukou Service Area to Hsinchu. Other parts of the road were flowing normally.</p>
            <p>The National Freeway Bureau believes that there will be a lot of travel traffic during peak hours today. They expect the main crowded sections this afternoon to be: National Freeway 1 North (Xiluo-Puyan System, Nantun-Houli, Miaoli-Hukou); National Freeway 3 North (Zhushan-Zhongxing, Caotun-Wufeng, Dashan-Xiangshan, Guansi-Daxi); National Freeway 5 South (Nangang System-Toucheng), and National Freeway 5 North (Yilan-Pinglin); National Freeway 4 West (Tanzi System-Fengshi); National Freeway 6 West (Jiuzheng-Wufeng System); and National Freeway 10 West (Renwu-Zuoying End).</p>
            <p>The National Freeway Bureau suggests that drivers going south on National Freeway 5 should leave after 5 PM to avoid traffic jams. They also recommend that drivers use the "1968" website and app for the highway. While driving, they can listen to the Police Radio Station for real-time traffic updates.</p>

            <h1>US H-1B Visa Fees Will Rise Greatly; Foreign Engineers Rushing Back to US Find Booking Systems Stuck</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C., September 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ The US government under President Trump plans to greatly increase the fees for H-1B visas. This has caused a strange online problem. Some people on the right-wing forum 4chan asked others to flood airplane ticket booking systems. This created a false idea that tickets were hard to find and prices were going up, which made people worried.</p>
            <p>The cost to apply for a US H-1B visa will jump from a maximum of $4,500 to $100,000.</p>
            <p>Amrutha Tamanam, a software engineer living in Austin, Texas, was on vacation in India recently. Because of the new visa rule from the Trump government, she had to quickly return to the US. But she found that 4chan users were attacking flight booking systems, trying to stop Indian H-1B visa holders from buying tickets.</p>
            <p>This mischievous action was called "clog the toilet." In the end, Tamanam bought a ticket to return to the US for twice the usual price.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that related discussions on 4chan also spread on Telegram and other forums. Many far-right supporters of Trump joined in.</p>
            <p>Some messages posted said: "Indians just heard the new H-1B visa news. Want to keep them stuck in India? Just clog the booking system!"</p>
            <p>Later messages even had racist words. They also told users to go to big airline and booking websites. They told them to block seats on flights from India to the US without paying. This was to make it seem like no seats were available and to make ticket prices go up.</p>
            <p>It's hard to measure the real effect of this bad prank. But Heidi Beirich, who started the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said its clear goal was to "make H-1B visa holders worried."</p>
            <p>Beirich said that the truly scary thing about 4chan is how quickly users can be brainwashed by extreme ideas and go down the wrong path. Several people who committed mass shootings in the US had posted their plans there.</p>
            <p>The US H-1B visa lets companies bring in skilled workers from other countries, like scientists and computer programmers. It is first valid for three years and can be extended to six years. About 85,000 visas are given out each year, and Indian applicants make up about three-quarters of these.</p>
            <p>Brian Levin, who started the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, said that in this age of information warfare, this prank shows that bad people can attack systems with just "a few lines on a keyboard."</p>
            <p>Levin said: "With nationalism growing around the world, some groups of people who are against things, loosely connected across countries, will use strong tools, including cyber attacks."</p>
            <p>He added: "It is important to notice that this hatred not only spreads quickly, but the people involved come from many different countries. They can easily cross borders and quickly gather online."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Choreographer Liu Yi-ling's Dance Performed at New York City Center's Fall for Dance Festival</h1>
            <p>New York, September 27th (Central News Agency) â€“ Taiwanese choreographer Liu Yi-ling's duet dance, "And Or...", was performed on September 26th and 27th at the New York City Center's "Fall for Dance Festival." It was shown with performances by the famous Stuttgart Ballet from Germany and the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater from the US. The show successfully held the audience's full attention without music, using only body movements.</p>
            <p>On the stage of the "Fall for Dance Festival" at the New York City Center, dancers Lin Chun-yi and Hung Wei-ting performed without music. There were only the sounds of their moving feet and bodies hitting each other. At first, the audience didn't understand the dance. Then, they became very focused on the dancers' movements, which were different from traditional ballet. Sometimes, they even laughed when they understood something. "And Or..." received loud applause.</p>
            <p>After the performance, choreographer Liu Yi-ling said she was very excited that her work was performed in a big theater for the first time. Both shows went well, and she was very happy with the good performance. She said the work challenges whether a dance can attract an audience only with body movements, without music. It tests the audience's attention and was also a challenge for herself.</p>
            <p>She said she was very happy that the audience was very involved. Sitting in the audience, she could feel everyoneâ€™s involvement, and the dancers received clear responses for every small detail. She held her breath the whole time and could only breathe out and relax during the curtain call.</p>
            <p>"And Or..." was performed between two shows, one by the German Stuttgart Ballet and one by the New York Alvin Ailey Dance Theater from the US. It was a mix of modern ballet and lively, multi-ethnic movements. It brought together theater, martial arts, and stretching and twisting body movements. This simple Taiwanese dance stood out greatly in a large theater with over 2,000 seats.</p>
            <p>"And Or..." was also performed at the "East Asia Contemporary Dance Festival" in New York late last year. New York audiences had another chance to see the performance, which had some changes in its arrangement and costumes.</p>
            <p>This dance piece, with only two dancers, relied on their good understanding, breathing, steps, and touching movements. It also kept the audience completely focused and captivated. Dancer Lin Chun-yi said it was hard to say if their relationship was love or hate; it had all kinds of connections and many complex feelings.</p>
            <p>The New York City Center has held the Fall for Dance Festival since 2004. It shows dances from all over the world at affordable prices, and tickets are very popular. This year's event was from September 16th to 27th. Dance groups from Taiwan, the US, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Argentina, Germany, and other countries took part. It included different dance styles such as modern dance, tap dance, ballet, tango, and hip-hop.</p>
