<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%A4%9A%E5%80%AB%E5%A4%9A%E5%90%8C%E5%BF%97%E5%A4%A7%E9%81%8A%E8%A1%8C-%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E9%9A%8A%E8%8A%B1%E8%BB%8Adj%E8%A1%A8%E6%BC%94%E7%82%BA%E5%8F%B0%E7%99%BC%E8%81%B2-233033252.html">News Link</a>

Toronto, June 23 (CNA) - Canada's largest LGBTQ+ event, the Toronto Pride Parade, will be held on June 29. The non-profit organization "Taiwan With Pride Association" in Toronto will participate in the parade for the third time this year to speak up for Taiwan.

The "Taiwan With Pride Association" was formed by a group of Taiwanese in Toronto who care about gender and social issues. In 2024, it was officially registered as a non-profit organization in both Taiwan and Canada, becoming a cross-national community advocacy platform. This organization is actively recruiting volunteers and parade team members, hoping that this year the Taiwan team participating in the Toronto Pride Parade will once again exceed a hundred members, conveying values of diversity and inclusion through collective action.

Chen Sheng-hua, Vice President of the Association, told CNA on June 22 that Taiwan With Pride's participation in the parade this year has been further upgraded. For the first time, they will rent a float and set up large rainbow balloon decorations with a live DJ performance. While moving, they will play a selection of Taiwanese popular music by famous singers such as Jolin Tsai and Cyndi Wang, creating a dynamic and culturally identifiable mobile exhibition space to attract more attention from the audience.

Toronto Pride Month activities have always been grand, but this year, LGBTQ+ month events across North America have been affected by the US Trump administration's opposition to "Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion" (DEI) policies. Many former major sponsors, including Google, Nissan, Home Depot, and Clorox, have withdrawn their sponsorships, leading to very tight budgets for related activities in various places. As the Toronto organizers insist on holding the event despite difficulties, the Toronto city government has decided to "increase funding" to help the event proceed smoothly.

This year's Toronto Pride Parade is expected to have over 200 participating teams and is hoped to attract hundreds of thousands of participants. Chen Sheng-hua stated that it is unfortunate this year that some large companies have withdrawn due to the political environment; however, despite opposition, this event is still supported by many people who hope to create a friendly environment where everyone can comfortably participate and support the LGBTQ+ community.

Chen Sheng-hua also emphasized that this year, nine sponsoring companies supported Taiwan With Pride's participation in the Toronto Pride Parade, which is more than in the past two years, and volunteer registrations have been very enthusiastic. Taiwan With Pride thanks many enthusiastic companies and individual sponsors for their support, which has allowed this year's upgrade plan to proceed smoothly. They also hope to secure more stable resources and community participation in the future, so that the Taiwan team can continue to participate in the parade every year and extend its reach to gender equality events in other overseas cities.

**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%A5%A8%E5%83%B9%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train (ÂçÄÈñìËªä) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

TRA fares will be fully adjusted on June 23, with an average increase of 26.8%. This adjustment covers various train ticket prices, lost and found return fees, luggage, and bicycle transportation fees. For example, the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will increase by NT$153. In addition to fare adjustments, TRA will implement a major timetable change on June 26, and revise its refund policy for delays and other promotional measures. Taiwan PASS prices will also be adjusted, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version seeing the highest increase.

This fare adjustment marks the end of a 30-year freeze on TRA prices. Specifically, local train fares from Taipei to Banqiao will increase from NT$15 to NT$22, and the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will increase to NT$975. Luggage and parcel fees will see an average increase of 36%, with items under 70 kg for distances within 300 km increasing from NT$70 to NT$100, a hike of 43%. Transportation scholar Huang Tai-sheng noted that TRA's price increase is significant, roughly one-third.

In addition to fare increases, TRA's discount measures have also been reduced. The free mileage for using EasyCard or iPASS on Tze-Chiang Limited Express trains will be shortened to 50 km. The "Love Child Ticket," which used to cost one-quarter of the full fare for children aged 6 to 12 with disabilities, will also be canceled, though children aged 6 to 12 will still receive a half-fare discount. For residents of Hualien and Taitung, TRA offers point rewards, with 8 times points on weekdays and 5 times on holidays, which can be used to offset ticket purchases.

Regarding train delays, TRA has also set new rules. If a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes due to a malfunction or reasons not attributable to the passenger, or if the departure time is uncertain, passengers can choose not to travel and apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Huang Tai-sheng pointed out that if the High-Speed Rail were to follow suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to manage demand by adjusting prices. He hopes that TRA passengers will not switch to the High-Speed Rail.

It is worth noting that the TPASS commuter monthly pass is not affected by this price increase, but the government's subsidy amount will increase. Transportation scholar Chang Sheng-hsiung believes that while it will not create a financial black hole, it will indeed increase the financial burden. He explained that the increased burden mainly comes from the TRA portion, while the use of MRT, city buses, and national highway buses remains unaffected.

The Taiwan PASS offered by the Tourism Administration will also see price adjustments, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version having the largest increase, from NT$1900 to NT$2500. This comprehensive fare adjustment means that the public will face higher costs for their daily commuting and transportation.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgrades to "International Semiconductor Week"**

<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E5%91%A8-201000087.html">News Link</a>

Taipei (CNA) - SEMICON Taiwan 2025, a major annual event for the global semiconductor industry, officially launched on June 17. Celebrating its 30th anniversary, SEMI (Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International) announced that the exhibition will be upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." This move comes amid the U.S.-China tech war, where former U.S. President Trump's high tariffs have pressured allied companies to return their manufacturing to their home countries. Major manufacturers like TSMC are facing increasing pressure to invest in the U.S.

In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "choose sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional restructuring. Semiconductors have transitioned from commercial goods to strategic assets, shifting decision-making from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

SEMICON Taiwan 2025 will run from September 8 to 12. SEMI estimates that the overall scale of the exhibition will grow by over 20% compared to last year, with visitor numbers expected to reach a new historical high. This year's event will feature various forums and exhibitions focusing on topics like advanced manufacturing, heterogeneous integration, sustainable manufacturing, and smart manufacturing.

The upgrading of SEMICON Taiwan to an "International Semiconductor Week" highlights Taiwan's crucial role in the global semiconductor industry. It also reflects the increasing importance of collaboration and innovation in addressing current geopolitical and technological challenges. The event will bring together over a thousand global industry leaders, showcasing the latest technologies and fostering partnerships to drive future growth and resilience in the semiconductor ecosystem.
