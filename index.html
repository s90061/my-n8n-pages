            <h1>Rain in Taitung Lessens, Roads in Shangwu and Xiama Reopen</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lu Tai-cheng, Taitung County, July 21) The rain in Taitung has become lighter. Road workers are quickly fixing the roads. The Shangwu and Nanxing sections of the Southern Link Highway, and the Xiama section of the Southern Cross-Island Highway, are now open again.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau said that this morning, at 10:30 AM, the water level of a river near Shangwu Chaoyong Bridge (Taiwan Provincial Highway 9, 420k+950) went down after getting very high.

            <h1>Nearly 20% of Teenagers Find It Hard to Say No to Smoking; Smoking Does Not Give Ideas, It Only Hurts the Brain Permanently</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chen Chieh-ling, Taipei, July 21) In TV shows, smoking is often shown as something that gives people good ideas or makes them look like heroes. But the Health Promotion Administration (HPA) warns that these are tricks by tobacco companies. A survey shows that almost 2 out of 10 teenagers cannot say no to smoking. This can cause permanent damage to their brains.</p>
            <p>A report from 2023 by the HPA, which looked at 42,000 junior and senior high school students, shows that 82.1% of students said they would never smoke. However, almost 20% of students could not firmly refuse smoking. Most studies show that when smoking is shown in media, or when teenagers see their friends smoking, it makes them more interested in trying tobacco.</p>
            <p>Summer break is a free time for students without schoolwork. But it is also a time when teenagers might try tobacco products, like e-cigarettes. The HPA said today in a news release that 9 out of 10 people who smoke regularly started before they were 18. Tobacco and e-cigarettes have nicotine. Nicotine is a substance that makes you addicted, so do not think it is not important or that you can control it. Many people try it once and then become addicted.</p>
            <p>The HPA shared studies that show teenagers are more sensitive to nicotine. They also become addicted to nicotine faster than adults. Teenage years are important for physical and mental growth. So, tobacco products hurt teenagers even more. They can cause lasting damage to the brain, making it harder to learn and remember things. It can also make teenagers easily angry, anxious, or sad.</p>
            <p>The HPA has four ways to help people say no to smoking. People can practice these methods beforehand. Not smoking is the right decision, and you do not need to feel bad about it. The first way is to be the main organizer of social events and choose places where smoking is not allowed. The second way is to make friends who also do not smoke. Agree with your friends beforehand not to smoke. Support each other. If someone offers you a cigarette, your friends can help you say no.</p>
            <p>The third way is to have reasons ready to refuse. For example, you can say, "My throat is sensitive, so smoking makes it hurt," or "My family is sensitive to the smell of smoke, and I worry about the smell staying on me and making them sick." The fourth way is to "directly and firmly refuse." The HPA says to explain why smoking is harmful and clearly state your choice not to smoke. True friends will respect your decision.</p>
            <p>The HPA also said that if you see a friend struggling with smoking, you can encourage them to quit. The government has many ways to help people quit. You can call the free quit-smoking hotline "0800-636363." Professional counselors will give support and help you make a personal plan to quit. You can also get help at about 2700 hospitals, clinics, health centers, and pharmacies across Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>EU Adds More Sanctions on Russia, Including Chinese Companies; China is Not Happy</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Li Ya-wen, Shanghai, July 21) The European Union (EU) recently approved its 18th set of sanctions against Russia. These sanctions aim to put more pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The sanctions include some financial groups and companies from China. Today, China's Ministry of Commerce said it is very unhappy and strongly against these sanctions.</p>
            <p>On July 21, China's Ministry of Commerce replied to questions from reporters about the EU's 18th set of sanctions, which include Chinese financial groups and companies.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce in China stated that the EU ignored China's repeated talks and objections. In this 18th round of sanctions on Russia, the EU continued to put some Chinese companies on a list. They also punished two Chinese financial groups with "unproven" accusations. China is very unhappy and strongly against this.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce said that China has always been against sanctions that are not based on international law or approved by the United Nations Security Council. The EU's actions go against what leaders from China and the EU had agreed on. This will have a very bad effect on trade and financial cooperation between China and the EU.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce in China stressed, "China asks the EU to stop this wrong action of listing Chinese companies and financial groups immediately. China will take steps to protect the fair and legal rights of Chinese companies and financial groups."</p>
            <p>The EU recently approved its 18th set of sanctions against Russia. At that time, Kaja Kallas, a top EU official for foreign affairs and security, said that the EU had just approved one of the strongest sets of sanctions against Russia so far. She said they would continue to put pressure on Russia until ending the war is the only choice for Moscow.</p>
