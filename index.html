**Shei-Pa National Park Celebrates 33 Years with New Film**

Shei-Pa National Park is now 33 years old. To celebrate, the park showed a new documentary called "Sunrise in Syuejian." The film shows the beautiful nature and culture of the Syuejian area. It also tells about how local people pass on their traditions and work together to protect the mountains.

Director Chen Chin-fa made the film over three years. The main person in the film is Chung An-liang, an elder from the Atayal tribe and a former park ranger. He shares stories of his family and how they protect their home in the mountains. The park hopes the film will encourage more young people to help protect nature and their culture.
