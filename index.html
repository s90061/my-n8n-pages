            <h1>China and Russia want to challenge the US through the SCO summit, but the real impact is still unclear</h1>
            <p>Leaders from Russia, India, and 8 other countries that are part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) met in Tianjin, China. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Modi were among them. They held the latest meeting of the organization. This meeting might challenge the United States, but we don't know the real effects yet.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the SCO has 10 member countries. They will meet in Tianjin today and tomorrow. This group started 24 years ago and has grown bigger and more important. However, its goals and plans are still not clear.</p>
            <p>The official member countries of the SCO are Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
            <p>At first, the SCO was seen as a group to balance the United States' power in Central Asia. It started with 6 countries. Later, 4 more countries joined. India and Pakistan joined in 2017. Iran joined in 2023, and Belarus joined in 2024.</p>
            <p>Some SCO members clearly do not agree with Western countries, especially Iran and Belarus. Other members like India, China, and Russia have a less clear relationship with the West. This is partly because Washington's view on Russia's war in Ukraine is not firm, or because of problems caused by US tariffs.</p>
            <p>Since it started in 2001, China, a strong economic power in the area, has led the SCO. Russia tries to use this group to keep its influence over the Central Asian countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union, like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
            <p>Russia's economy has become much weaker, mostly because of strong penalties from Western countries. However, Russia and China still see the SCO as a way to work together on military matters in the region. For now, this only includes joint training exercises.</p>
            <p>After the war between Russia and Ukraine started, India became a main buyer of Russian oil. This made relations with Washington more tense. After meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August, Prime Minister Modi said that India and China were making "steady progress" in making their relationship better.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press noted that India joining the SCO might challenge Russia's and China's lead in the group. Even though these countries trade with each other, India will probably not give much help to Russia's war in Ukraine or to China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>June Teufel Dreyer, a China expert from the University of Miami in the US, said that the SCO seems to want to change from a place for talks to a "complete system for practical cooperation that brings real results for the people in member countries." But questions remain about "what its goals are and how it will reach them."</p>

            <h1>Indonesian Parliament's self-enrichment causes riots, public anger spreads, Finance Minister's home looted</h1>
            <p>People in Indonesia are unhappy because of the country's economy and the high salaries of members of parliament. This has caused protests against the government. The anger of the crowd continued to grow, and last night, the home of Indonesia's finance minister was robbed. Indonesia's defense minister said today that strong actions will be taken against those who caused the riots and robbed homes.</p>
            <p>Protests started in Jakarta, Indonesia's capital, on August 25. Protesters said that members of parliament received too much money for salaries and housing. On August 28, the protests turned into riots after a police armored car hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver. Some politicians' homes and government buildings were robbed or set on fire.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that a neighbor said Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Indonesia's finance minister, had her home robbed early this morning. Her house is in South Tangerang, a city near the capital, Jakarta. Two groups of people robbed her home.</p>
            <p>The neighbor said, "The first group of robbers rode many motorcycles, with 2 to 3 people on each bike. The second group had about 150 people. They stole TVs, sound systems, living room decorations, clothes, and dishes."</p>
            <p>Indonesia's Defense Minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, warned today in a press conference, "Law enforcement will act strongly against rioters and robbers who enter private homes or government buildings. They will not hesitate."</p>
            <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto held a press conference today with leaders from different political parties next to him. He said he has told the army and police to take strict action against rioters and robbers. He also warned that some actions during the recent protests across the country are "treason" and "terrorism."</p>
            <p>President Prabowo also said, "Leaders in parliament have promised to remove some internal rules. These changes include lowering how much money members of parliament receive and stopping their trips abroad."</p>
            <p>The protests in Indonesia have continued for several days and have spread outside the capital, Jakarta. Several local parliament buildings were even set on fire. Because of this, President Prabowo cancelled his planned trip to China.</p>
            <p>President Prabowo has been in power since October last year. For almost a year, his government faced almost no political problems. These protests are the biggest challenge he has had so far.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Women's Volleyball Team wins second place at East Asian Cup, Head Coach Deng Yan-min moved by players' growth</h1>
            <p>In the East Asian Women's Volleyball Championship held in Hong Kong, the Taiwan team played against China in the final today. Taiwan lost with scores of 26-24, 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. They won second place. The head coach, Deng Yan-min, said she was very touched to see her players grow.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team had won the East Asian Volleyball Championship three times before. But for 9 years, they could not reach the top 4. This time, setter Liao Yi-jen, also known as "Volleyball Sweetheart," led the team. Other players included Hung Chia-yao, Hsu Heng-yun, Weng Tzu-yun, Chien Yi-wen, and Chiu Shih-ching. The head coach, Deng Yan-min (also called "Calf"), said their goal was to reach the final. They wanted to end their last international game of the year well.</p>
            <p>In the group stage, the Taiwan women's volleyball team beat Mongolia and the host team, Hong Kong. This helped them get back into the top 4. Yesterday, they also beat South Korea 3-0, so they reached their goal of playing in the final. But today, they played against the strong Chinese team. Taiwan scored first, but then China won the next three sets with scores of 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. So, Taiwan missed winning the championship trophy.</p>
            <p>After the game, Head Coach Deng Yan-min talked to the media. She said that she used to play for the national team herself. She knows that players feel pressure and want to win for Taiwan. So, she told everyone to focus on the game and not worry about anything else. She wanted to create a "happy volleyball" atmosphere. This way, the players would naturally train hard and play with all their effort.</p>
            <p>From the Asian Nations Cup to the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade, and now this East Asian Volleyball Championship, Deng Yan-min believes these players have changed after playing in these games. They are not afraid of tall opponents anymore. Also, their blocking, defensive positions, and attack positions are getting smoother. This made her feel very touched. She also thanked the players for trusting the team quickly and working together to achieve good results.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team plans to start the second phase of training for the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games on September 8. Deng Yan-min said that more experienced older players will join, along with new players who show promise. Next year, there will be big games like the Nations Cup, the East Asian Volleyball Championship, the Asian Championship, and the Asian Games. "Next year will be a great year," she said, "and we hope to use this time to train hard."</p>
