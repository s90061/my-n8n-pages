            <h1>Xie Feng Says US Should Stop Spreading Idea That Taiwan's Status Is Undecided</h1>
            <p>China's ambassador to the U.S., Xie Feng, spoke at a dinner in Washington on September 28. The dinner celebrated the 76th anniversary of China's government. Xie Feng said that this year is the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return. He stated that "Taiwan returning to China" is a key part of the results of World War II and the international rules after the war. He believes the U.S. should "respect the facts" and stop saying that "Taiwan's status is not yet decided."</p>
            <p>China's embassy in the U.S. shared this news on its official website today. It said Xie Feng made these comments at a dinner for Chinese people living in the U.S. on September 28, Eastern U.S. time. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. President Donald Trump showed interest in making an economic deal with China. Because of this, Chinese President Xi Jinping plans to ask Trump to officially state that the U.S. "opposes" Taiwan's independence.</p>
            <p>According to the announcement, Xie Feng said that U.S.-China relations have "faced some difficulties" this year. But with guidance from the leaders of both countries, U.S.-China relations are "mostly stable." This shows that the U.S. and China have many shared interests and chances to work together. They can both succeed and grow together, helping both countries and the world.</p>
            <p>Xie Feng also said that because the U.S. and China are two big countries, it's normal to have disagreements. The most important thing is to "respect each other's main interests and big concerns, and respect each other's choices for their social systems and ways of development."</p>
            <p>He then claimed that Taiwan is "an inseparable part of China's land." He repeated that this year is the 80th anniversary of Taiwan's return. He said "Taiwan returning to China" is "a key part of the results of World War II and the international rules after the war." He added that the U.S. "should respect the facts and stop spreading the wrong idea that Taiwan's status is not yet decided."</p>
            <p>Xie Feng also said that trade between the U.S. and China helps both sides. Tariffs and trade wars do not create winners. He believes that fairness, respect, and helping each other are the best ways to solve problems. He hopes the U.S. will work with China and carry out the important agreements made by both leaders. He wants them to follow the three rules of "mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation." This will help them understand each other better, have fewer misunderstandings, and work together more. He hopes this will keep the U.S.-China relationship moving in the "correct direction."</p>

            <h1>Canadian Chinese School Holds Teacher Appreciation Event, Taiwanese-Canadian MP Shares Challenges and Benefits of Learning Chinese</h1>
            <p>On September 28, Confucius's birthday, the West Canada Chinese Schools Association held a tea party to thank Chinese teachers in overseas Chinese schools. They thanked the teachers for their hard work in teaching Chinese to children abroad. Taiwanese-Canadian Member of Parliament (MP) Wade Chang remembered how hard it was to learn Chinese when he was young. He said that thanks to his parents and teachers who never gave up, his Chinese skills kept getting better. This opened up more job opportunities for him later in life.</p>
            <p>Wade Chang attended the tea party today with nearly one hundred teachers. He looked a little embarrassed and said, "I'm shaking a bit because when I was a child, I was most scared of my teachers. And my Chinese teacher was very strict."</p>
            <p>Wade Chang moved to Canada with his parents when he was in the 6th grade. He told CNA, "I thought school in Canada would be easy. But besides regular elementary school, I also had to go to Chinese school on weekends."</p>
            <p>He remembered how his teacher made him write essays, memorize Tang poems, and read the Analects of Confucius. He said, "It was really hard. Sometimes I had to stay up late to finish my Chinese homework."</p>
            <p>Because his parents and teachers kept pushing him, Wade Chang's Chinese skills got better and better. This greatly helped his career. "I have worked as a lawyer in Canada, Australia, and Taiwan. Being able to speak both Chinese and English allowed me to have more clients. Now that I am an MP, I can also serve my voters better using Chinese."</p>
            <p>Yu-Han Mei also moved to Canada with her parents when she was two years old. Her parents "forced" her to go to Chinese school when she was little. Now, she herself is a Chinese teacher. "I use my own experiences to encourage students to learn Chinese. For example, when I was in 8th grade, I went to Spain with a school trip. One day, our group went into a restaurant where only Spanish was spoken. We didn't know how to order food. But we were surprised to find a waiter who understood Chinese. So I used Chinese to talk with her, and everyone was able to enjoy a big meal."</p>
            <p>At the tea party, awards were given to excellent teachers who had taught for 10, 20, and 30 years. This made Liu Li-Hsin, the Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Vancouver, very touched. She said that teaching Chinese overseas is very challenging. Things like students' attitudes towards learning and cultural differences in the environment can make teaching Chinese difficult. However, many teachers still work very hard and try to improve themselves. They use technology to make their teaching better.</p>
            <p>She told CNA, "A good teacher can really change a student's life. When I was at Beiyi Girls' Senior High School, my geography teacher included art and music in her lessons. This made the place names on paper feel more alive. It started my dream of exploring the world and motivated me to become a diplomat."</p>
            <p>Kuo Shu-Chen, the head of the Overseas Community Affairs Council in the Vancouver office, thanked the teachers for their hard work in promoting traditional Chinese characters. This helps more students learn about traditional Taiwanese culture. "Only traditional characters can show the beauty and deep meaning of Chinese characters. Although they seem to have many strokes, their structure is actually easier to understand and learn."</p>
            <p>Some teachers from Hong Kong and China also told CNA that they joined the overseas Chinese school system because they liked the beauty of traditional characters and the richness of Taiwanese culture. Teacher Deng Muling from Guangzhou said, "I grew up learning simplified characters, but I really like traditional characters. Language is part of human culture, and I hope more people can learn about the beauty of traditional characters."</p>

            <h1>TPBL Taishin Mars Team Gets Stronger, Raymon Manu Aims for Player of the Year Award</h1>
            <p>The TPBL Taipei Taishin Mars team held a press conference today for the new season. Head coach Hsu Hao-Cheng said that the team's goal is still to reach the championship finals. Raymon Manu, a popular player who won Rookie of the Year last season, proudly announced his goal to become the league's Player of the Year.</p>
            <p>The 2025-26 season of the Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL) will be the third season for the Mars team. Last season, the Mars made it through the playoff challenge games. However, they were sadly defeated by the New Taipei Kings in the first round of the playoffs, losing all 4 games.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hao-Cheng spoke to the media today and said that all four foreign players for the new season are new. He explained that when they chose foreign players, their main focus was "team spirit," which is also important to the team's culture. All the foreign players arrived in mid-September, and they are now working hard to play well together.</p>
            <p>Among the new players, American guard Zach Lofton is expected to be a key scorer. He is 193 cm tall. Last season, in the Lebanese basketball league, he averaged 26.4 points and 7 assists per game, with a 38% three-point shooting rate. He also had an amazing game where he scored 51 points. He won 7 awards, including the league's Player of the Year.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hao-Cheng pointed out that the team's strength has also improved for the new season. There are two players competing for each position. "The team also hired a skills coach, Edison Jones, to help each player get more complete individual training."</p>
            <p>Raymon Manu, who won Rookie of the Year in the 2024-25 season, has more ideas for the new season after training during the summer. He has set "Player of the Year (MVP)" as one of his goals.</p>
            <p>Raymon Manu said, "This summer, I improved my shooting skills and changed my shooting form a little bit. I feel that I have improved in all areas. Of course, the most important things are consistent shooting and scoring."</p>
            <p>Raymon Manu confidently stated that he hopes to become the best player in the league this year, have more good performances on the court, and help the team win more games.</p>
