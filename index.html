            <h1>Wang Hung-wei Questions Document About Failed Recall; Presidential Office Says It's Misleading</h1>
            <p>On August 16th, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang party, Wang Hung-wei, again said that the Presidential Office sent a letter to the Executive Yuan. She claimed this letter was to review why the "726 recall vote" failed. The Presidential Office showed the letter publicly. They said Wang Hung-wei was lying by calling a "regular monthly summary of public complaints" an official statement admitting the recall failed. The Presidential Office said certain politicians are using small pieces of information to confuse people and cause division.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Wang Hung-wei showed a letter from the Presidential Office. She said it was a document from the Presidential Office to the Executive Yuan to check why the 726 recall failed. She called it "the first time the government officially admitted a big recall failed." The Presidential Office spokesperson, Kuo Ya-hui, showed the official document. She said Wang Hung-wei was distorting the truth and openly lying. The document was a "monthly summary of public opinions" from the Presidential Office's public affairs department. All its content showed what the public cared about. It was not, as Wang Hung-wei said, an order from the Presidential Office and Executive Yuan for a work task.</p>
            <p>However, Wang Hung-wei said today through a media group that the document the Presidential Office showed was exactly the same as the one she showed. This means the Presidential Office also confirmed that her document was real and correct.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei explained that the Presidential Office just wants to change the topic. She said the Presidential Office did ask the Executive Yuan to review why the 726 recall vote failed. This, she said, means President Lai Ching-te admitted the big recall was a big failure. It also proves that President Lai started this big recall.</p>
            <p>Kuo Ya-hui replied in the afternoon. She said it was sad that politicians were saying "a regular monthly summary of public complaints" was "the government's first time admitting the recall failed." She asked politicians to base their political work on facts and avoid spreading lies that lead to them losing in court again.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi-chuan, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party, also posted on social media. He said the Presidential Office gets complaints and suggestions from the public every day. Every month, they gather these for government departments to use for policy making. He said Wang Hung-wei purposefully twisted this long-standing practice and used it for political attack. He added that the court has already proven Wang Hung-wei a liar, and this is another example. Wang Yi-chuan pointed out that Wang Hung-wei only showed the first part of the document and hid the other seven parts on purpose. He questioned why she did not show the full document. If she showed the other seven parts, it would be clear that it was a summary of public opinions from July. This would prove she intentionally made a political attack. He said "people's opinions about the recall" were twisted into "the Presidential Office admitting the recall failed." He wondered if she did this to release her anger about being recalled half a year ago, so she just lied directly.</p>

            <h1>Government Will Study Burying All Power Cables Underground; Will Make Wind-Facing Areas Stronger Where It's Not Possible</h1>
            <p>When typhoons come, they often damage power lines. Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the government will start studying how to bury power cables underground across the whole country. A government official added that after the study, suitable areas will have cables buried year by year. In places where it's not good to bury them, like coastal areas in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan where the land might be sinking, they will instead make the power lines stronger against the wind. This means changing how far apart power poles are and making them stronger.</p>
            <p>Typhoons often cause problems with sending electricity. Today, when Premier Cho Jung-tai went to Taitung to check damage from Typhoon Yang Liu, he said that Typhoon Damrey caused power to go out for over 1 million homes across the country. Heavy rain on July 28th also caused power outages for over 50,000 homes. Typhoon Yang Liu caused over 300,000 homes to lose power. The government wants to solve the problem of power outages from typhoons. In Orchid Island (Lanyu), the power cables are already underground, so fixing things after the recent disaster was much easier. Because of this, he will ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) to start planning and studying burying power cables underground across the country. In suitable areas, this work will happen step-by-step each year.</p>
            <p>A government official told reporters that it will take some time to study burying all power cables underground in Taiwan. So, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower will start this work right away, as Premier Cho instructed.</p>
            <p>The government official said that coastal areas in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan, which were badly hit, have problems like land sinking. This makes it hard to bury cables there. So, for now, they are focusing on fixing damaged power equipment and making power lines stronger in windy and easily damaged areas. This includes changing power tower routes, adjusting the distance and strength of power poles, making disaster resistance better, and changing how overhead power lines are set up. All of these aim to make the whole power grid system stronger.</p>
            <p>Regarding good road areas in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan, the official said that Taipower Chairman Tseng Wen-sheng once mentioned that main power lines are often on provincial highways. In the western coastal areas, there are highways 17 and 19. These are usually places with good road bases, so burying cables underground could be considered there first.</p>
            <p>The government official said that a special law for disaster recovery and rebuilding after Typhoon Damrey and the heavy rain on July 28th was passed recently. This law includes a NT$10 billion plan to make the power system stronger in disaster areas. The money for this plan will come from a special budget set aside in this law.</p>
            <p>Also, the Executive Yuan recently approved changes to a special law. This law is about making Taiwan's economy, society, and people's lives stronger in response to global events. The total money set aside was increased to NT$590 billion. An extra NT$20 billion from this will be used to make power systems in industrial parks stronger across Taiwan. This plan will be sent to the legislature for review.</p>
            <p>The government official stated that the NT$20 billion for industrial parks is to make sure the power supply is stable. They will also think about moving and changing power lines to make them stronger. They will also study if all power lines can be buried underground at the same time. The goal is to make sure power distribution is stable.</p>
            <p>In 2023, Typhoon Koinu caused serious damage to Orchid Island's power system. After that, the Executive Yuan approved a plan to bury all power cables underground on Orchid Island. This project costs about NT$1 billion. The total length of the power lines to be handled is about 23.7 kilometers, and the work will be finished within 2 years.</p>

            <h1>First Robotaxis in Shanghai Lingang Start Operating</h1>
            <p>The first group of self-driving taxis, called Robotaxis, have officially started working in Shanghai's Lingang New Area. They can be used in areas that include schools, office buildings, and main shopping spots. This new step comes after self-driving taxis started operating in Jinqiao and Huamu parts of Pudong New Area in early August.</p>
            <p>On August 15th, the first group of self-driving taxis in Shanghai's Lingang New Area officially began taking passengers. According to a news report, they now serve 58 places in the main Lingang city area, like schools, office buildings, and shopping areas. They run every day from 8 AM to 8 PM.</p>
            <p>To call a self-driving taxi, you do the same steps as ordering a regular taxi online. You order through a phone app, and a self-driving taxi will accept your request. Your phone screen will show the car's license plate number and its route. After you get in the car, you need to tap "Start Now" on a screen behind the front passenger seat. Only then will the car start moving.</p>
            <p>Ma Liyin, an official in charge of driverless car services at the Shanghai Lingang New Area Management Committee, told the media that Lingang New Area will improve its system that connects industries, real-world uses, and rules. It will use its special ability to try new policies first. This will ensure that smart connected vehicles without drivers operate safely. They also plan to steadily make self-driving taxi services bigger and more common for business.</p>
            <p>The "2025 World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) and High-Level Conference on AI Global Governance" held a forum on July 26th called "AI Empowering Innovation and Development of Autonomous Driving." At this forum, the first "Smart Connected Vehicle Demonstration Operation Licenses" were given out in Shanghai. This means companies got permission to offer self-driving taxi services in certain areas.</p>
            <p>Eight companies received the first "Smart Connected Vehicle Demonstration Operation Licenses." These include Pony.ai (Shanghai), Baidu Apollo (Shanghai), SAIC AI Lab (Shanghai), Dazhong Transportation, Shanghai SAIC Mobility Service Co., Ltd., Shanghai Qiangsheng Taxi Co., Ltd., Shanghai Jinjiang Taxi, and Shanghai Youdao Zhitu.</p>
