            <h1>Doncic Scores 42 Points, Slovenia Beats Italy to Reach EuroBasket Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>Luka Doncic, an NBA star for the Los Angeles Lakers, played amazingly today. He scored 42 points and led Slovenia to an 84-77 win against Italy. This exciting victory means Slovenia moves on to the quarterfinals of the European Basketball Championship.</p>
            <p>Slovenia, who won EuroBasket in 2017, was ahead by as many as 19 points today but almost lost. In the end, Doncic helped them get their fourth win in a row against Italy. Slovenia now has 9 wins and 2 losses against Italy in their history. The last time Slovenia lost to Italy was in the 2006 World Cup.</p>
            <p>The official EuroBasket website reported that Doncic fell down just 36 seconds into the game, but he was not hurt. He then scored 10 points during a 15-2 run, which helped his team lead 15-4. Because their main player was playing so well, Slovenia increased their lead to 32-13, a difference of 19 points.</p>
            <p>However, Italy showed how strong they are, like when they came back from behind to beat Spain in the group stage. They then made the score closer, 38-45. At halftime, they were behind by 40-50. After halftime, Italy scored 4 points first, making Slovenia's lead only 6 points.</p>
            <p>But Slovenia quickly responded with a 9-0 run. This made their lead bigger again, to 15 points. When there were 6 minutes left in the game, Slovenia was leading 78-65. But then Italy scored 12 points in a row. With 100 seconds left, Italy was only behind by one point, with a score of 77-78.</p>
            <p>In the important last moments, Doncic made all 4 of his free throws. This helped his team win the game.</p>
            <p>Doncic is one of the best players in this EuroBasket. He has already gotten one triple-double. He is also number one in how effective he is, how many points he scores, and how many steals he makes. Italy could not stop Doncic. He controlled the game completely. He scored 22 points in the first part of the game and 30 points in the first half.</p>
            <p>In the end, Doncic scored 42 points in the whole game. This is only 5 points less than his record of 47 points against France in EuroBasket 2022. In this game, he made 11 out of 19 shots, 5 out of 11 three-point shots, and 15 out of 16 free throws. He also got 10 rebounds and 3 steals.</p>
            <p>This is Doncic's fourth game in this EuroBasket where he scored more than 30 points. The last time a player had more games with over 30 points in one EuroBasket was in 1989. That player was the Greek legend Nikos Galis, who had 5 such games.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine Suffers Another Big Air Attack; Trump Says He Is Ready for More Sanctions Against Russia</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump said today that he is ready to put "Phase 2" sanctions on Russia. This means he is not happy with the war in Ukraine and is getting closer to punishing Russia and the countries that buy its oil more seriously.</p>
            <p>AFP news reported that U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said earlier today on NBC's "Meet the Press" show that Washington is ready to "increase pressure" on Russia. But he also said that European countries must act too, to truly make Russia's government come back to talks.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump tried many times to get Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting. But Russia launched another attack with drones and missiles late last night. This attack was the biggest since its full invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago.</p>
            <p>Reuters news reported that Trump did not say today if he had decided on the sanctions or what the "Phase 2" sanctions would be. When reporters asked him at the White House if he was ready to do this, he only answered: "Yes, I am ready."</p>
            <p>Bessent said today that Trump and his Vice President, JD Vance, had a "very helpful phone call" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on September 5th. Bessent also spoke with von der Leyen himself.</p>
            <p>Bessent said: "We talked about what actions the U.S. and the European Union can take together. We are ready to put more pressure on Russia, but our European partners need to do the same."</p>
            <p>He also explained that if Europe and the U.S. agree to more sanctions, for example, extra taxes on countries that buy Russian oil, "the Russian economy will completely crash. This will force President Putin to come to the negotiating table."</p>
