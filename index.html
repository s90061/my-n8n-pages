            <h1>Russian Army Keeps Attacking Along Ukraine Front, Says Russian General</h1>
            <p>General Gerasimov, Russia's top military official, said today that Russian soldiers are always attacking along almost the whole front line in Ukraine. He also said that Russia now has the "strategic advantage."</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Gerasimov spoke to his officers in a speech released by the Russian Ministry of Defense. He said, "Our forces are constantly attacking along nearly all of the front line. The Russian army now has full control of the main war strategy."</p>
            <p>Gerasimov also said that Russia has hit Ukraine's military factories 76 times this spring and summer. These attacks were meant to destroy places that make long-range missiles and drones.</p>
            <p>Gerasimov stated that Russia now controls most of eastern Ukraine. He said Russia holds 99.7% of Luhansk, 79% of Donetsk, 74% of Zaporizhzhia, and 76% of Kherson.</p>
            <p>He also claimed that since March this year, Russia has taken over 3,500 square kilometers of land in Ukraine and now controls 149 villages.</p>
            <p>Maps that anyone can see show that this month, Russian soldiers started to move closer to Dnipropetrovsk in southeast Ukraine. Gerasimov said Russia now controls seven villages there.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Ukrainian officials said today that Russia launched a big air attack on southern Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Ivan Fedorov, the governor of Zaporizhzhia, said that Russian air attacks continued until early this morning. They hit a five-story apartment building. At least one person died and 28 people were hurt, including children.</p>
            <p>The Ukrainian Air Force reported that Russia sent 537 drones and fake drones, and 45 missiles. Ukrainian forces shot down or stopped 510 drones and fake drones, and 38 missiles.</p>
            <p>On August 28, Russia also made a big air attack on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. That attack killed at least 23 people and hurt 38.</p>

            <h1>Modi and Zelenskyy Talk, India Says It Supports Peaceful Solution</h1>
            <p>India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, spoke with Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, today. Modi's office said that he once again stated his support for finding a peaceful way to solve the problem in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy said in a video speech later that evening that Modi agreed with Ukraine's request for a ceasefire in the war. Zelenskyy hopes this idea will be discussed at the next Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting in China.</p>
            <p>Modi's office released a statement saying that Zelenskyy agreed with Modi's thoughts on the current situation in Ukraine. Modi also said that India wants to help bring peace back very soon.</p>
            <p>Modi's office also said, "The two leaders looked at how well India and Ukraine are working together. They also talked about how to make their cooperation stronger in areas that are important to both countries."</p>
            <p>Modi will go to the SCO summit in Tianjin, China, which begins tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said, "I just spoke with Prime Minister Modi of India. We talked about what is happening now. Russia is still fighting this war and still killing people."</p>
            <p>He added, "It is very important that the Indian Prime Minister believes there must be a ceasefire. This would clearly show that Russia is ready to talk and try to find a solution. We hope this idea will be taken seriously at the meeting in China."</p>

            <h1>Indonesian Protests Get Stronger, President Prabowo Cancels Trip to China and Won't Attend Parade</h1>
            <p>Protests in Indonesia have been going on for several days. They have now spread outside Jakarta, the main city. Some local government buildings were even burned. Because of this, Indonesia's President Prabowo decided today not to go to China as he had planned.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that President Prabowo was supposed to go to a military parade in Beijing on September 3. This parade was to celebrate China's 80th anniversary of winning the war.</p>
            <p>People in Indonesia are angry about the high salaries of their government leaders. This week, many protests started in Jakarta. Yesterday, the protests became even bigger when a police armored car hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver. This is the first big problem for President Prabowo's government, which has been in charge for almost one year.</p>
            <p>Prasetyo Hadi, the president's spokesperson, said in a video today, "The president wants to keep watching the situation in Indonesia closely. He also wants to find the best way to solve the problems."</p>
            <p>"So, the president is sorry to the Chinese government that he cannot come to the important event, even though he was invited."</p>
            <p>Prasetyo also said that another reason President Prabowo canceled his trip to China is because of a big meeting at the United Nations in September.</p>
            <p>Because of the protests, TikTok, a video app from China, announced today that it will stop its live streaming service in Indonesia for a few days.</p>
            <p>This week, leaders in Jakarta asked companies like Meta Platforms and TikTok to send their staff to a meeting. They asked these social media companies to check content more carefully. This is because wrong and harmful information was spreading online. The Indonesian government said this bad information caused the protests against the government.</p>
