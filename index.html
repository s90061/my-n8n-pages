            <h1>Before Trump-Putin Summit, Russia and Ukraine Start New Prisoner Exchange</h1>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine said today that they each exchanged 84 war prisoners. This is the latest exchange in a series of exchanges this year, which have already freed hundreds of people.</p>
            <p>The prisoner exchange happened before the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump. Their meeting is planned for August 15 in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media that the exchanged prisoners included "soldiers and also civilians." Some of them "had been held by Russians since 2014, 2016, and 2017."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that "people who strongly defended Mariupol" were on the exchange list. Mariupol is a port city in Ukraine that fell to Russian forces in February 2022 after being surrounded for almost three months.</p>
            <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense stated on Telegram that the United Arab Emirates helped with the exchange. The released Russian people are now getting "psychological and medical help."</p>
            <p>Large prisoner exchanges were the only real progress made during three rounds of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives. These talks happened in Istanbul from May to July.</p>
            <p>In the last round of talks, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1200 prisoners from each side.</p>
            <p>A Russian negotiator said that Moscow also offered to return the bodies of 3000 dead soldiers to Kyiv.</p>

            <h1>US-Russia Leaders' Summit Coming Soon; Trump: There's a 25% Chance of Failure</h1>
            <p>Before his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US President Donald Trump spoke to the media. He said that if his meeting with Putin does not go well, he will not call anyone.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to Fox News Radio today. He said that if his meeting with Putin goes well, he will call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. But he also guessed that there is a 25% chance that his meeting with Putin might fail.</p>
            <p>He also said that if the meeting with Putin is successful, a second meeting would be held. This second meeting would include Putin and Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Trump said that any agreement to stop Russia's attack on Ukraine would be made at this second meeting, which would have three people (Trump, Putin, and Zelenskyy). He said it would not happen at tomorrow's summit in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Trump stressed, "The second meeting will be very, very important, because that's when they will make an agreement."</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump are expected to have their meeting in Alaska at 11:30 AM local time on August 15. This is 3:30 AM in Taiwan on August 16.</p>
