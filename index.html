            <h1>Oxford University Stops Publishing Chinese Journal After Reports of Forced Blood Samples in Xinjiang</h1>
            <p>The Forensic Sciences Research (FSR) journal recently announced on its website that Oxford University Press (OUP) in the UK will no longer publish it after 2025. FSR is a quarterly journal supported by China's Ministry of Justice. The journal caused controversy because it published articles about gene research in the Xinjiang region, which included suspected forced blood sampling.</p>
            <p>FSR is China's only English-language journal for forensic medicine that is read by people around the world. It started working with Oxford University Press (OUP) in 2023.</p>
            <p>According to FSR's statement, any articles submitted since July of this year that pass review will be published by FSR's new partner, "KeAi." KeAi is based in Beijing and is a joint company of China's "Science Press" and the Dutch academic publishing company Elsevier. Both FSR and Elsevier have had problems with publishing ethics in the past.</p>
            <p>In June 2022, FSR published an article about finding genetic markers in the Uyghur population. The article looked at gene data from blood samples collected in Xinjiang. The research project received money from the Xinjiang Police College, and the main author, Halimureti Simayijiang, is Uyghur. The article said that all 264 Uyghurs who gave blood samples had signed "informed consent forms" and that their gene data was kept private.</p>
            <p>However, in 2023, The Guardian newspaper in the UK reported that Professor Yves Moreau from the University of Leuven in Belgium, who studies gene science and ethical issues, had written to the head of Oxford University. He said that "informed consent" should mean "free informed consent," which is not possible in Xinjiang.</p>
            <p>Moreau also said that this kind of research might help the government watch the Uyghur people on a large scale. A spokesperson for OUP said at that time that the article was published in 2022 before OUP started publishing FSR. But OUP would work with the FSR editors to look into the worries people had. The chief editor of FSR at that time said that the money from China's Ministry of Justice did not affect how they chose articles.</p>
            <p>The Uyghur gene research article, which was in the printed version of FSR in June 2022, was first put online in September 2020. The article is still available and can be read in full online.</p>
            <p>However, The Guardian reported today that after OUP became FSR's publishing partner in 2023, OUP took down two past FSR articles about Chinese gene samples because of ethical concerns.</p>
            <p>FSR's new partner, Elsevier, also took down an article in 2023 that was published in 2019. This article was about gene research on Uyghur and Kazakh people. Elsevier said they removed the article because the way the gene samples were collected for the study did not follow ethical rules.</p>
            <p>This study collected blood and saliva samples from 203 Uyghur and Kazakh people in Xinjiang. The goal was to see how well gene sequencing technology made by Thermo Fisher Scientific worked on these two groups. The authors mentioned in the article that gene sequencing could help police with their work.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that the same three-person team from the University of Copenhagen, led by Halimureti Simayijiang, was listed as authors in both the article Elsevier took down in 2023 and the article that Moreau questioned to Oxford University that same year.</p>
            <p>According to reports, the University of Copenhagen said Halimureti Simayijiang left the university in 2020. The controversial gene research articles he led were submitted before the university said they stopped working with him.</p>
            <p>Problems with ethics in China's gene research have caused more and more concern recently. Last year, the American gene research journal Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine (MGGM) removed 18 articles from China. The reason was also related to research ethics and human rights worries.</p>

            <h1>China Now Lets Private Companies Attack US Websites, Creating a "Golden Age" for Hackers</h1>
            <p>In the past, China's spy agencies often carried out cyberattacks against the US themselves. But now, Beijing has changed its rules, allowing private companies to hack the US. American media today quoted experts saying that the US is definitely facing the worst Chinese cyberattacks ever. "We are in a golden age of Chinese hacking," they are everywhere.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported this morning that the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike found that the number of suspected Chinese government hacking attacks more than doubled from over 330 in 2023. This number is still going up as the new US government starts its work.</p>
            <p>Officials and outside researchers say that even though Chinese hacking seems to be done by different government groups and has different goals, all these attacks are better because of new technology and because Beijing is allowing more cyberattacks.</p>
            <p>Before, Chinese intelligence, military, and security groups would choose targets and have their own employees hack them. But US officials say the Chinese government has decided to be more aggressive, letting private companies carry out cyberattacks and hacking themselves.</p>
            <p>These companies are hiring the best hackers. They find new weaknesses in software that no one knows about yet. Then, they find systems that use this weak software and launch big attacks all at once. After that, they sell the secret access they gain (called "backdoors") to the Chinese government and other security companies.</p>
            <p>An official from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that this way of "outsourcing" hacking has harmed hundreds of Americans. It also makes stopping the attacks very difficult. It's hard to tell who China's main targets are and who was attacked by accident.</p>
            <p>The unnamed official said, "They find zero-day vulnerabilities, scan for any weak spots, and then sell the backdoors."</p>
            <p>A "zero-day vulnerability" is a hidden flaw in software that hackers can use to damage computer programs, get private information without permission, or get into computer networks. Software companies do not yet have a way to fix these flaws.</p>
            <p>Last week, the US Department of Justice announced charges against a Chinese man arrested in Italy for hacking into US computer systems. Prosecutors said the man worked for "Shanghai Powerock Network Co.," which is one of many Chinese "partner" companies that do hacking for the government.</p>
            <p>Several former officials said that in the past, US charges, public criticism, and punishments could stop China from hacking, but now they don't seem to work anymore.</p>
            <p>China has learned how to move through US computer networks without being noticed. Their attacks look like they come from inside the US, avoiding security systems that block connections from other countries. They also avoid the US National Security Agency (NSA), which, by law, cannot check most communications within the US.</p>
            <p>Matthew F. Ferraro, a senior advisor to the Homeland Security Secretary during the Biden government, said, "Compared to a few years ago, Chinese hackers are now bigger, more skilled, and more experienced."</p>
            <p>"Before, they would attack from networks in Shanghai, working during China's time, so you could always find them. Now, it's different. They are everywhere."</p>
            <p>The increase in China's hacking against the US started with iSoon. iSoon is a Chinese company based in Shanghai that sells hacked information from other hackers to Chinese government offices, security groups, and state-owned companies.</p>
            <p>Last year, iSoon leaked very rare documents that showed China's increasingly strong hacking plans and intelligence. This included 459GB of road mapping data from Taiwan. It even listed prices for hacking services, such as $25,000 (about NT$730,000) to hack an iPhone remotely.</p>
            <p>Ken Dunham, an analyst at the cybersecurity company Qualys, said that besides working more with private Chinese cybersecurity companies, Beijing also sometimes works with criminal groups. Before, US and private experts had said that Chinese government teams used ransomware to encrypt US company data and then demanded money from the victims to unlock it.</p>
            <p>Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the US, called these accusations "false and without reason." He said that the US has, in fact, been carrying out long-term, organized, and large-scale cyberattacks on China, and China has complained about this many times.</p>
            <p>Another hacking group, "Volt Typhoon," is suspected by US officials of being run by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It has been breaking into US power and water systems, which has made national security officials very worried. US intelligence agencies and lawmakers believe that "Volt Typhoon" aims to cause confusion if there is a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Even though the FBI stopped some of "Volt Typhoon's" actions last year, officials and researchers say that "Volt Typhoon" has started again and is now active in many more places than where it was first found near ports in the Pacific Ocean.</p>

            <h1>Strong Earthquake Near Alaska, USA, Causes Tsunami Warning</h1>
            <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said today that a 7.3 magnitude earthquake happened off the coast of Alaska, which led to a tsunami warning.</p>
            <p>The USGS reported that the earthquake's center was about 87 kilometers south of the town of Sand Point in Alaska. The earthquake was 20.1 kilometers deep. After the earthquake, a tsunami warning was sent out for southern Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula.</p>
