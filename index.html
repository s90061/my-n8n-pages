Scientists at Google DeepMind have announced a major breakthrough with AlphaFold 3, a new artificial intelligence (AI) model. This advanced AI can accurately predict the shapes and interactions of all of life's molecules, not just proteins. This includes DNA, RNA, and other crucial molecules that make up living organisms.

AlphaFold 3 builds on the success of its predecessor, AlphaFold 2, which was already highly skilled at predicting protein structures. The new model can now show how these molecules interact with each other, which is vital for understanding biological processes and developing new medicines. For example, it can predict how a drug molecule will bind to a protein, offering new possibilities for designing treatments for various diseases. Researchers believe this technology could speed up the development of new drugs and help us understand the causes of illnesses better. Google DeepMind is making a free version of AlphaFold 3 available for non-commercial scientific research, hoping to accelerate discoveries worldwide.

**The Four-Day Work Week: A Growing Global Trend**

The idea of working four days a week instead of five, while still receiving the same pay, is becoming increasingly popular around the world. Recent trials in various countries, including the UK, Ireland, and Australia, have shown promising results. Companies participating in these experiments reported a significant increase in employee well-being and a decrease in stress levels. Many employees also felt more motivated and less likely to leave their jobs.

Beyond improving staff morale, businesses often saw a rise in productivity during these trials. With an extra day off, employees typically return to work feeling refreshed and more focused. This model aims for "100:80:100" â€“ 100% of the pay for 80% of the time, while maintaining 100% productivity. While some challenges remain, such as adapting customer service or specific industries, the overall trend suggests that the four-day work week could become a more common way of working in the future, offering a better balance between work and daily life.

**Venice Introduces Entry Fee for Day-Trippers**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging a â‚¬5 entry fee for day visitors as part of a new trial to manage overtourism. This fee, which began on April 25, 2024, applies to people visiting the city for just one day, especially during peak times and holidays. The aim is to reduce the pressure of large crowds on the city's delicate infrastructure and cultural heritage, making tourism more sustainable.

Visitors who are staying overnight in Venice, as well as residents, commuters, and children under 14, are exempt from the fee. Those required to pay must register online and receive a QR code before entering certain areas of the city. This move makes Venice one of the first major global cities to implement such a system. The trial is expected to continue on selected days throughout 2024, with authorities monitoring its effectiveness in balancing the city's needs with the desires of its many visitors.`;
