            <h1>Broadcom Gets Big Order for AI Chips, Stock Price Rises 15%</h1>
            <p>A US company called Broadcom, which makes computer chips, announced a new order. A new customer wants to buy $10 billion (about 300 billion New Taiwan Dollars) worth of chips for Artificial Intelligence (AI). People think the customer is OpenAI, the company that created ChatGPT. Because of this big news, Broadcom's stock price went up by 15% today when the market opened.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this new order for Broadcom makes people think the company will do very well in making generative AI. It also shows that Broadcom is a strong leader in making special custom chips. This is important because big technology companies want to buy chips from different places. They do not want to depend only on Nvidia's AI processors, which are expensive and not always easy to get.</p>
            <p>Experts from famous financial companies like J.P. Morgan, Bernstein, and Morgan Stanley all said that the new customer is probably OpenAI. They believe this because of when the deal happened and how much money it involves.</p>
            <p>Last year, Reuters reported that OpenAI was already working with Broadcom to make its own first computer chip.</p>
            <p>Broadcom now expects that the money they earn from AI products will "get much better" in their financial year 2026.</p>

            <h1>Tesla Suggests Pay Plan, Elon Musk Could Become the First Trillion-Dollar Person</h1>
            <p>The group of leaders at the US electric car company Tesla today suggested a plan for how much to pay CEO Elon Musk and how well he performs. If Tesla reaches certain goals under Elon Musk's leadership, he could become the first person in the world to be worth one trillion dollars.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that documents given to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission show that this 10-year plan for Tesla needs approval from its shareholders (the people who own parts of the company). The plan states that Musk will receive shares in the company based on how much the company is worth.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that the most shares Musk could get would be equal to 12% of Tesla. However, this depends on Tesla reaching various important steps, including the company being worth $8.5 trillion.</p>
            <p>If the company is worth $8.5 trillion, then these shares would be worth a little more than $1 trillion.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Tesla is currently worth about $1 trillion. This new, very large pay plan is something that has never happened before in the history of American companies.</p>
            <p>According to the documents Tesla gave today, the extra shares Musk might get would make his total ownership in Tesla at least 25%.</p>
            <p>Robyn Denholm, who is the chairperson of Tesla's board, wrote a letter to investors. She said, "It is very important to keep Elon (Musk) and to make him want to work hard so that Tesla... can become the most valuable company in history."</p>
            <p>Denholm also said that this pay plan "wants to connect great, long-term value for the shareholders with ways to make our visionary leader perform at his very best."</p>
