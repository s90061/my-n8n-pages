            <h1>Finance Minister Zhuang Cuiyun Hopes for Changes to New Financial Law Due to 3 Main Problems</h1>
            <p>Finance Minister Zhuang Cuiyun said today that the new financial allocation law has three main problems. She hopes the law can be fully reviewed and changed. The problems are: the law makes it harder for the central government to balance money, it makes the gap between cities and countryside bigger, and mistakes in the formula mean some money cannot be given out. Premier Cho Jung-tai will meet with local governments on September 13 to talk about how money and responsibilities are shared.</p>
            <p>The central government gives money to local areas in three main ways: shared tax money, general grants, and special project grants. For shared tax money, the Ministry of Finance said that next year, local governments will get NT$884.09 billion. This is NT$416.51 billion more than this year, almost a 90% increase. This amount will be 31% of the central government's yearly income. However, even with this calculation, NT$34.5 billion cannot be given to local governments, and many local governments think the calculation is wrong.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai will hold two meetings on September 13 with local governments to fix problems with the financial allocation law. The meetings will be at the Executive Yuan. The first meeting at 10 AM will include Taipei City, New Taipei City, Keelung City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, Kinmen County, Lienchiang County, and Penghu County. The second meeting at 2 PM will include Miaoli County, Taichung City, Changhua County, Nantou County, Yunlin County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, Yilan County, Hualien County, and Taitung County.</p>
            <p>Top government officials, including Premier Cho Jung-tai, Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chiun, and Secretary-General Chang Tun-han, along with finance officials, will be at the meetings. Government spokesperson Li Hui-chih said today that Chang Tun-han has been calling local leaders. The government will keep track of their answers. The meetings will discuss problems with the financial allocation law, how responsibilities are shared, mistakes in the formula, and the growing gap between cities and rural areas.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih explained that Taipei City will get NT$40 billion more in shared tax money, but Lienchiang County will get NT$0 more. This makes the gap between cities and rural areas bigger. Also, a lot of central government money is given out. With limited money, to help areas where the gap is growing, they need to talk about how responsibilities can be given back to local areas. She hopes city and county leaders can come to the meetings.</p>
            <p>Minister Zhuang Cuiyun said at the press conference that changing the financial allocation law means changing how money is shared. She explained that it's important to think about what local areas need. But it's also important for the central government to have enough money to deal with changes at home and abroad. Also, they must consider how different cities and counties are developing, their populations, and social situations. This way, the law can truly balance money and help all areas grow fairly.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Cuiyun explained that the new financial allocation law has three problems. First, there is a problem with how money is shared between different levels of government. This change gives local governments a lot more shared tax money. It also says that general grants from the central government to local areas cannot be reduced. This means the central government has less money to use and directly changes how money is shared between the central and local governments. But they did not also look at how responsibilities are shared. This makes it harder for the central government to balance its money.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Cuiyun also said there are problems with how shared tax money is given out. For example, population is 45% important, and business sales are 30% important. Together, these are 75%. But cities with many people and businesses already have a lot of money. These rules make it so that rich cities get even more money. This goes against the idea of balancing money and helping all areas grow fairly. It makes the gap between cities and rural areas even wider.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Cuiyun pointed out that mistakes in the formula for sharing money horizontally mean some money cannot be given out. This also affects how much money each city and county gets. Before, the Ministry of Finance could work with the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to make rules for sharing money. But this power was removed in the new changes, so the Ministry of Finance cannot make these rules anymore.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Cuiyun said that the Ministry of Finance will keep talking with local governments about the financial allocation formula. They hope to find the best way to share money and create a good system. She also said that the NT$34.5 billion that cannot be given out right now will not be used by the central government. They will fix this through new changes to the law later. She hopes the financial allocation law can have a complete review and be changed.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Reports 4 New Dengue Cases from Outside Taiwan; Managers of 2 Migrant Workers Fined for Not Reporting</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau announced today that from September 9 to 10, four new cases of dengue fever came from outside Taiwan. This makes a total of 18 cases so far. Two of the people who got sick were Filipino migrant workers. Their dormitory managers did not tell the authorities within 24 hours after they arrived and got a fever. Because of this, the managers will be fined between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000 by law.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said in a press release that the four new cases include two Filipino migrant workers. The other two are a new resident returning from visiting relatives in Vietnam and her daughter. The two migrant workers had fevers after they arrived in Taiwan. Their dormitory managers did not report this within 24 hours, as required by law. All cases were found after the workers went to the doctor and were tested. The Health Bureau will fine the managers according to the "Communicable Disease Control Act." The fine will be between NT$3,000 and NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said that among the four new cases reported today, one is a 37-year-old male migrant worker from the Philippines who lives in Daliao District. He arrived on September 5 and started having a fever and other symptoms the next day. He went to the emergency room on September 8. A quick test for dengue (NS1) was positive. On September 9, a PCR test also showed positive results for Dengue Type 3.</p>
            <p>Another migrant worker lives in Qianzhen District. He arrived on September 7 and had a fever the next day. He went to the doctor in September. His quick test for dengue (NS1) was positive, and a PCR test also showed positive results for Dengue Type 1.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau also said that the other two people who got sick are citizens who got sick after returning to Taiwan. One is a female teenager from Zuoying District. She went to Vietnam with her family during the summer holidays. She arrived on September 2 and had dengue symptoms on September 8. She went to the doctor again on September 10 because her symptoms did not get better. Her quick test (NS1) was positive, and today, a PCR test also showed positive results for Dengue Type 2.</p>
            <p>The other person is a female new resident in her 40s from Ziguan District. She went back to Vietnam in mid-August to visit family. She had a fever when she arrived in Taiwan on September 9. At that time, her quick test (NS1) was negative, but she did not want to stay in the hospital and went home. On September 10, a PCR test showed positive results.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said that both migrant workers had fevers after they arrived at their homes. They were diagnosed after going to the doctor and being tested. According to Kaohsiung City rules, if someone has any symptoms that might be dengue fever, they need help from a doctor. Also, the local health office must be told within 24 hours. This is to stop the dengue virus from spreading in the community. According to the rules, the managers of the two migrant workers' dorms will be fined.</p>

            <p>This morning, the Taiwan stock market went up to a new high of 25541 points. Then it moved up and down a lot, by 367 points.
