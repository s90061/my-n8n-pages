            <h1>Israel Confirms Identities of Four Hostage Bodies, Including an Israeli Youth and a Nepali Student</h1>
            <p>Israel's army announced today that they have identified four bodies of hostages. These bodies were given to them by Hamas yesterday. Among them are Guy Iluz, a 26-year-old Israeli man, and Joshi, a 22-year-old student from Nepal. The names of the other two people who died have not been shared, as their families asked for privacy.</p>
            <p>According to the AFP news agency, Guy Iluz, who was 26, was at the Nova Music Festival when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Iluz tried to drive away from the festival. Later, he hid in a tree. He last spoke to his parents from there. Soon after, fighters caught him and took him to the Gaza Strip, where he was kept captive.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army stated that Iluz was hurt and captured alive, but he later died from his injuries because he did not get medical help. The army did not say when he passed away, but he was declared dead in December 2023.</p>
            <p>Iluz worked as a sound engineer for many famous Israeli musicians.</p>
            <p>Joshi was part of a group from Nepal learning about farming. This group arrived in Israel three weeks before the Hamas attack. Joshi was 22 at that time.</p>
            <p>Joshi was taken from Kibbutz Alumim, a farming community. Not long before the fighters arrived, he was seen hiding with other workers from Thailand.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said, "Based on our information, he was killed during his time as a prisoner in the first few months of the war."</p>
            <p>Himanchal Kattel, a Nepali friend of Joshi's and the only survivor from their farming group, told AFP that the attackers threw a hand grenade into their hiding spot. Joshi threw the grenade away before it exploded, saving Kattel's life.</p>
            <p>The "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" in Israel said in a statement that getting Iluz and Joshi's bodies back brought some comfort to their families. However, they are against moving to the next step of the peace process until all 24 other hostage bodies are returned.</p>
            <p>As part of a ceasefire agreement arranged by US President Donald Trump, Hamas released all 20 surviving hostages yesterday. After that, they gave back the four bodies of the hostages.</p>
            <p>Hamas still has 24 other hostage bodies. These are also expected to be returned according to the rules of the ceasefire agreement.</p>

            <h1>Alice Ko is Nominated for Best Actress at Golden Bell Awards, Playfully Teases Kunda for Not Being Nominated</h1>
            <p>Actress Alice Ko has been nominated for Best Actress in a TV series at the 60th Golden Bell Awards for her role in "The Fairy Tale's Next Chapter." She said she really liked trying new things and improving her acting in this show. She also made a joke about her husband, Kunda, who played a "nerdy" character in "Authentic Precinct" but was not nominated. She said, "He worked so hard, even looking like that, and still didn't get nominated."</p>
            <p>The main director and writer for "The Fairy Tale's Next Chapter," Li Nien-hsiu, along with producer Huang Wei-hsia, executive producer Sun Chia-chi, and Alice Ko, attended a party for the Golden Bell nominees. Alice Ko was happy to be nominated for a comedy role. She felt proud of her acting in the show because she tried many new things and challenged herself. When asked about her husband Kunda, Alice Ko joked, "He changed his look so much for 'Authentic Precinct,' but he still wasn't nominated!"</p>
            <p>When asked if she was eager to win, Alice Ko laughed and said she wasn't thinking too much about it, but having a few more awards would be nice. Li Nien-hsiu also said that Alice Ko's acting this time was very surprising and that the judges noticed it.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-chi openly said she really wanted Alice Ko to win. However, she felt that the male lead, Liu Yi-hao, was unfairly left out of the nominations. Alice Ko added, "He showed a new side of his acting, different from before. He is a big 'gem' in my heart that was missed." Li Nien-hsiu and Huang Wei-hsia both agreed. They said, "We talked a little with Liu Yi-hao, and he said he will keep working hard. He took a very big step and let everyone see a different side of him. He is not just a bossy CEO; he works very hard and shows everyone his other talents."</p>
            <p>Li Nien-hsiu was also nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay for "The Fairy Tale's Next Chapter." She shared that there was a time when she almost gave up. She said, "I used to be an editor, then I wrote scripts for 10 years. But for 10 years, no one noticed my work. I started to wonder if I was good enough. At that time, I went to Xingtian Temple, and surprisingly, I wrote 'The Fairy Tale's Next Chapter.' It was quite a mystical experience."</p>
            <p>Winnie was nominated for Best Newcomer for her role in "Authentic Precinct." She remembered that she received a lot of criticism at first. She said, "I never thought about being nominated. The director and my co-actors gave me a lot of feedback, and I really enjoyed it. I never thought I would have the chance to be part of the Golden Bell Awards." Winnie also thanked Mayday Ashin, saying, "On the day I was nominated, he shared it on his Instagram story. He is a great senior."</p>

            <h1>Ho Hsin-chun Says She Will Respect Party's Decision on Taichung Mayoral Race</h1>
            <p>For the 2026 Taichung mayoral election, it seems that President Lai Ching-te, who is also the head of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has a preferred candidate. This candidate is said to be DPP legislator Ho Hsin-chun. Today, Ho Hsin-chun stated that she will respect the DPP Central Party Headquarters' process and decision for the Taichung mayoral nomination.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te met with DPP city council members from Taichung today for a lunch meeting. During the meeting, he mentioned that he has a favored person for the 2026 Taichung mayoral election. He said he hopes DPP legislator Tsai Chi-chang will continue to work hard in the central government. He added that he wants "DPP legislator Ho Hsin-chun to work hard in Taichung."</p>
            <p>People who were at the meeting told CNA reporters that President Lai Ching-te talked about having a favored person for mayor. Many people believe he was talking about two local legislators. Tsai Chi-chang has a lot of experience in government and was once the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. Given the current political situation, President Lai wants Tsai Chi-chang to stay in the Legislative Yuan and work there. He wants Ho Hsin-chun to work hard in Taichung. This suggests that Ho Hsin-chun might be the DPP's candidate for the 2026 Taichung mayoral election.</p>
            <p>Ho Hsin-chun wrote in a media group message that she explained this after attending a temple visit with Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim at Tan Shui Ting Guanyin Temple. She said that Taichung city council members Hsiao Lung-tse and Chou Yung-hung also attended the lunch meeting with President Lai Ching-te. They shared many ideas, such as how to develop the Tanzi area in the future and how to reduce the differences between city and country areas. Some council members also talked about the difficulties faced by small and medium-sized traditional businesses, and they asked the central government for more attention and help.</p>
            <p>Ho Hsin-chun said that she will find more time to listen to what people want in the future. She will turn these ideas into actions to make Taichung a better city. As for the nomination for Taichung mayor, she will respect the Central Party Headquarters' process and decision.</p>
