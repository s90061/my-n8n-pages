            <h1>Penghu Environmental Volunteers Gather to Promise Sustainable Future</h1>
            <p>The Penghu County Environmental Volunteers Gathering started today at the multi-purpose sports arena. Sixteen teams, with almost 300 environmental volunteers, came together. They showed their promise for a sustainable environment through their actions. They will continue to help Penghu become a low-carbon island where people can live well for a long time.</p>
            <p>This event brought together environmental volunteers from different communities, schools, and water patrol teams across the county. County Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu, Speaker Chen Yu-jen, Councilors Hsu Kuo-cheng, Lu Huang Chun-chin, Su Chen Hsiu-se, Legislator Yang Yao's assistant Tuan Hsiang-ling, and Environmental Protection Bureau Director Tsai Chi-hsien all came to show their support. They praised the volunteers for their long-term effort and hard work in protecting Penghu's environment.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu said in his speech that environmental work is not something that can be done quickly. It takes a long time and much effort. Penghu wants to create a green and lasting island environment. Besides government policies, everyone needs to help. Environmental volunteers are the strongest support. He asked everyone to keep supporting environmental protection with their actions to keep a clean and beautiful home for the next generation.</p>
            <p>The event began with an environmental oath from volunteer representatives, including Huxi Village Chief Hsin Tien-tse. Chen Kuang-fu and Chen Yu-jen rang a gong to start it. The competitions included "Environmental Mastermind," "Recycling King," "Resource Slam Dunk," and "Clean-up Team Relay." These events mixed environmental knowledge with practical skills. Participants competed for a total prize of NT$140,000 and the chance to represent Penghu at the national environmental volunteer gathering.</p>
            <p>The Penghu County Environmental Protection Bureau said that protecting the environment and living sustainably are not just words. They need everyone to take action in their daily lives. They asked people to use fewer single-use items, recycle well, sort trash correctly, and choose products that can be recycled. Only then can everyone work towards zero carbon emissions and a sustainable life.</p>

            <h1>China Restarts Collecting Value-Added Tax on Interest from Government Bonds</h1>
            <p>China will start collecting value-added tax again on interest earned from new government bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds from August 8. Some experts say that big organizations mainly invest in bonds, and individuals invest very little. Also, if individuals meet certain rules, they don't have to pay the tax. So, this change in policy will mostly not affect individual investors.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported on August 1st that China's Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration jointly announced that from August 8th (including that day), they will start collecting value-added tax again on interest income from government bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds issued on or after that date.</p>
            <p>According to the announcement, interest income from government bonds, local government bonds, and financial bonds issued before August 8th (including parts issued again after August 8th) will continue to be tax-free until the bonds expire.</p>
            <p>Li Xuhong, Vice Dean of the National Academy of Accounting in Beijing, said that bond investments are mainly by organizations. Individuals invest very small amounts. Also, if individual investors earn interest income, they can use the policy for small-scale VAT taxpayers. This means if their monthly income is less than 100,000 Chinese Yuan (about 410,000 New Taiwan Dollars), they don't have to pay value-added tax. So, this policy change will not affect regular individual investors.</p>
            <p>Li Xuhong explained that this policy change is a way to make things better, based on how the bond market is growing now. It will make the tax burden more similar between different kinds of bonds. This helps government bond yields work better as a standard for pricing. It also helps the bond market and the financial market grow well over time.</p>
            <p>Liang Ji, Director of the Public Revenue Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences, said that China has already issued many bonds, and the market can handle them well. New bonds are a small part of the total. Also, bond prices are affected by many things, and tax policy is just one of them. So, this policy change will not affect the market much.</p>
            <p>"Securities Times" quoted Wang Feng, an associate professor at the China Institute for Public Finance Research at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. He said that the new policy might cause prices of new and old bonds to become different in the short term. In the long term, it might make bond investments less attractive compared to other types of investments. Big organizations that invest might slowly change their investment plans. They might choose investments that have better tax benefits or higher returns.</p>
