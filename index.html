            <h1>Jensen Huang Leads Fortune's Top 100 Business People List, Surpassing Elon Musk</h1>
            <p>Fortune magazine recently announced its list of the 100 most important business people in the world. Jensen Huang, who is the head of Nvidia, is now number one. He took the top spot from Elon Musk, who was number one last year. Lisa Su, the head of AMD, and C.C. Wei, the chairman of TSMC, are also on this important list.</p>
            <p>This is the second time Fortune magazine has published this list of 100 business leaders. The list includes people from 28 different types of businesses around the world, like money, technology, shops, and cars. There are 19 women on the list this year. Some of them are Julie Sweet, the head of Accenture (number 11); Jane Fraser, the head of Citigroup (number 12); Lisa Su, the head of AMD (number 14); and Ana Patricia Botin, the president of Banco Santander (number 20).</p>
            <p>The top ten most important business people on Fortune's list this year are: Jensen Huang (Nvidia), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (Meta), Elon Musk (Tesla), Wang Chuanfu (BYD), Sundar Pichai (Alphabet), Ren Zhengfei (Huawei), Sam Altman (OpenAI), Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase), and Mary Barra (General Motors).</p>
            <p>Under Jensen Huang's leadership, Nvidia has become the first company worth more than 4 trillion US dollars. This happened because there is a very high demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. This big achievement shows how important Nvidia is in the fast growth of generative AI technology.</p>
            <p>Nvidia does have other companies trying to compete with it. But as Fortune magazine said, "Right now, no other company can truly threaten Nvidia's strong position."</p>
            <p>C.C. Wei, who is the chairman and president of TSMC, is ranked number 40 on the list.</p>

            <h1>Trump Signs Order to Add 25% Tax on Indian Goods, Starts August 27</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, signed a special rule. This rule adds another 25% tax on goods coming from India. The reason is that India buys oil from Russia, either directly or indirectly. With this new 25% tax, plus an earlier 25% tax, goods from India that enter the US will face a total tax of 50%. This new tax will start on August 27.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, President Trump said, "We have put a 25% tax on India, but I think I will greatly increase that tax in the next 24 hours because they are buying Russian oil."</p>
            <p>So, today, Trump signed the special rule. It says that because India buys Russian oil, the US will add another 25% tax on goods from India. Before this, the US had already said it would add a 25% equal tax starting on August 7. So, in the future, Indian goods coming to the US will have a very high tax of 50%.</p>
            <p>A paper from the White House says that the extra 25% tax on India will begin on August 27.</p>
            <p>News from other places said that on August 4, India's foreign ministry stated that the US and the European Union were "targeting" India because it buys Russian oil. India said these actions were "not fair" and that India would protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>India is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil. This oil money helps Russia pay for its military actions in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for more than three years, and there is no sign of it stopping soon. President Trump had previously said he would put "extra taxes" on countries that keep trading with Russia, such as China and India.</p>
