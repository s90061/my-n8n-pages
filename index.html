            <h1>Huang Shih-chung: Using NVIDIA Platform to Create Humanoid Robot Brains, Aiming for Mass Production Next Year</h1>
            <p>Techman Robot is one of the top three companies worldwide for robots that work with people. People are excited to see what they will do with humanoid robots (robots that look like humans). Huang Shih-chung, the company's chief operating officer, and the head of their AI visual application and humanoid innovation center, recently spoke to CNA. Huang Shih-chung shared that their humanoid robots, which use NVIDIA's main control system, might start being mass-produced by 2026.</p>
            <p>Techman Robot's lab for humanoid robots, located at their main office in Guishan, Taoyuan, was shown to the public for the first time. Huang Shih-chung said that Techman Robot plans to enter the humanoid robot market, building on their experience with robots that work with people.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-wei, a manager at Techman Robot's Humanoid Innovation Center, explained that the company plans to control the making of important parts for humanoid robots themselves. They will use their skills in making parts for robots that work with people to develop technology for connecting humanoid robot parts. Techman Robot also plans to develop full-body controllers and parts for robots to keep their balance. Currently, their team for humanoid robot research and development has tens of people.</p>
            <p>Huang Shih-chung also said that Techman Robot has been working with NVIDIA, a big company that makes AI chips, for a long time. For humanoid robot technology, Techman Robot regularly meets with NVIDIA. Techman Robot is using NVIDIA's platform for humanoid robots to develop the main control system's hardware. They are still testing it internally. They expect to start making many of these humanoid robots by 2026.</p>
            <p>Looking at how much humanoid robots will add to the company's sales, Huang Shih-chung believes that after three to five years, there will be a strong demand from the market. Humanoid robots might then start to be sold in small numbers and make money for the company.</p>
            <p>Regarding how these robots will be used, Huang Kuo-wei said that some large companies, including those that make semiconductor wafers, package and test them, and other electronics manufacturers, are already talking to Techman Robot about using humanoid robots. Quanta Group, Techman Robot's parent company, is also very interested. They expect that in the future, these robots will be used in manufacturing for production, checking, visual inspections, and testing. They will also be used for things like checking AI server cabinets.</p>
            <p>In the field of robots that work with people, Techman Robot continues to build its brand. Experts in the industry say that Techman Robot is already one of the top three manufacturers of such robots in the world. The other two big companies are Universal Robots from Denmark and Fanuc from Japan. Other companies like the Swiss ABB robot department (which was recently sold to SoftBank Group in Japan), KUKA, Yaskawa Electric from Japan, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries from Japan are also working hard in this area.</p>
            <p>Huang Chung-hsien, the head of Techman Robot's visual application department, leads the company's team for robot vision software. He works with hardware and electrical control engineers. The team started with only 2 to 3 people and has now grown to almost 30 people. He said that combining visual sensing technology with robot arms was something new in the market. This is what makes Techman Robot's robots that work with people different from others.</p>
            <p>Techman Robot has also developed AI visual recognition technology. In 2022, they released a solution with robots that work with people and have built-in AI visual recognition. This has made Techman Robot's collaborative robots useful in more ways. AI applications have also created new business opportunities for collaborative robots in automated quality control.</p>
            <p>Huang Chung-hsien pointed out that Techman Robot's AI visual collaborative robots are not only used in wafer factories to pick up wafer boxes. They are also widely used in other electronics industries for assembly, testing, and packaging on production lines. This includes printed circuit boards, checking AI servers for big OEM manufacturers, and production lines in semiconductor packaging and testing factories.</p>
            <p>Besides the semiconductor and electronics industries, Huang Shih-chung revealed that Techman Robot's AI collaborative robots are also used in aerospace. For example, AIDC (Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation) and JPP-KY (Jih Pao Precision) use Techman Robot's collaborative robots to make aerospace parts.</p>
            <p>In addition, Techman Robot is working with AMET, an American company that makes smart welding technology, on welding robots that work with people. These robots are used in shipbuilding, for welding large steel structures in airport terminals, and in offshore wind power sites. This helps them compete in the global market for automated AI welding. Huang Chung-hsien also mentioned that Techman Robot's AI visual collaborative robots are used in the production inspection process for a major Japanese car manufacturer.</p>
            <p>Techman Robot's AI visual collaborative robots are expanding into markets worldwide, and they have more than 100 distributors. Huang Shih-chung said that Europe and mainland China each make up about 20% of their sales. Taiwan accounts for about 10%. Techman Robot is actively growing in the US market and works with Taiwanese OEM electronics manufacturers who have factories in Mexico.</p>
            <p>Huang Shih-chung stated that the North American market currently makes up less than 10% of their sales. He expects that by 2026 to 2027, the North American market will account for more than 10% of their sales.</p>

            <h1>A Look Inside Techman Robot's Production Line: Humanoid Robot Lab Shown Rarely</h1>
            <p>Techman Robot has worked for ten years to build its robot brand in Taiwan. Their AI visual collaborative robots (robots that work with people and can see) are now widely used in the semiconductor and electronics industries. The market is very excited about their humanoid robots (robots that look like humans). Recently, a team from CNA visited Techman Robot's main office in Guishan, Taoyuan. They were able to see the robot testing lines, which are rarely shown to the public.</p>
            <p>As you enter the testing line on the 7th floor of Techman Robot's office building, you see rows of collaborative robots working. Some are lifting heavy things and twisting them, while others are moving at different angles.</p>
            <h2>Testing Collaborative Robots: Using Data for Smart Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>During the testing, only a few Techman Robot staff members were at nearby workstations, watching the process. The testing area was almost silent, with only faint sounds from the collaborative robots twisting. The photographers and video colleagues who came along said it sounded "like white noise that helps you sleep."</p>
            <p>Techman Robot's public relations person, who showed the team around the testing lines, explained that the collaborative robots are tested 24 hours a day without stopping. This is to make sure they can last a long time when used in customer factories. At the testing site, Techman Robot's own monitoring system can quickly show how well the products are doing during testing. This test data is used for big data analysis to help with smart manufacturing and managing production lines.</p>
            <p>Huang Shih-chung, the chief operating officer of Techman Robot, said that in 2014, when Techman Robot was still the robot department of Quanta Group's Quanta Storage Inc., they already planned to develop collaborative robots with visual sensing technology. Since then, these robots have been widely used in manufacturing lines in the semiconductor and electronics industries. They have gained a lot of practical experience. This experience is a very important base for Techman Robot to build its robot brand and to develop humanoid robots.</p>
            <p>Barry Lam, the chairman of Quanta Computer, used a Taiwanese phrase meaning "golden grandchild growing up" to describe Techman Robot's ten years of hard work to create robot solutions from nothing, before Techman Robot went public. He said that Quanta went public in 1999, and Quanta Storage Inc. went public in 2002. It took so long for Techman Robot to go public at the end of September this year. He said, "This shows how hard it is to make robots, it's not easy."</p>
            <p>Lam pointed out that Techman Robot has skills in AI vision, machine learning, and collaborative robots. These skills can help customers make more valuable products. He said that Techman Robot no longer just makes products for other companies. It is the first Taiwanese company with its own brand of collaborative robots. He added, "It's not just that the price is good, but they can also help customers solve problems."</p>
            <p>On the day of the interview, Techman Robot also took the CNA team to see their humanoid robot lab, which is rarely shown to the public. With the help of the engineers there, the humanoid robot, which has AI visual recognition, showed various body movements and answered questions in a human-like way.</p>
            <p>Huang Shih-chung said that Techman Robot is slowly developing humanoid robots, focusing on understanding what industries and customers really need. He clearly stated that for humanoid robots to be popular with businesses, "lower costs and better value for money" are most important. More importantly, humanoid robots must be able to truly solve customer problems. With a "killer application" (a very useful main function), humanoid robots can truly become a part of industries.</p>
            <h2>Humanoid Robots Without Lower Bodies: Reducing Safety Risks on Production Lines</h2>
            <p>Huang Shih-chung revealed that Techman Robot's humanoid robots first focus on designing the upper body's functions. They are developing the hardware and software for the brain, two arms, and two hands. They are focusing on the needs of manufacturing production lines. They will first use the existing strengths of Taiwan's semiconductor and electronics industries to encourage the use of humanoid robots in semiconductor and electronics factories.</p>
            <p>This is why Techman Robot's current humanoid robot samples do not have lower bodies and feet. Techman Robot explained that the first design of the humanoid robot is to meet the real needs of factory production lines. If a robot stands on its feet to work, there might be unexpected safety risks, such as suddenly falling over. By first designing the brain and upper body functions like the two hands, the humanoid robot can first help industries improve how much they produce.</p>
            <p>Looking at their plans for humanoid robots, Huang Shih-chung said that by using the brand they have built for collaborative robots, Techman Robot plans to offer complete humanoid robot solutions in the future. They will continue to use their brand to reach global markets, finding the most important uses in different industries to create more value. This will allow Techman Robot's humanoid robots to be known worldwide.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Fengshen Forms: Wu Der-rong Warns Northern and Eastern Taiwan to Watch Out for Heavy Rain</h1>
            <p>This year's 24th typhoon, Fengshen, formed early this morning. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that the northeast monsoon will start moving south tonight. This will bring rain to Taipei and the eastern parts of Taiwan, and temperatures will slowly drop. From tomorrow until October 22, the "autumn typhoon effect" will cause significant rain in northern and eastern Taiwan. People need to be careful of "very heavy rain" that could cause damage.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration announced today that a tropical low-pressure system, which was east of the Philippines, became a light typhoon at 2 AM. It is the 24th typhoon, named Fengshen (international name: FENGSHEN). It is expected to move through the central Philippines towards the sea near the Zhongsha Islands. It will not directly affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote in his "Xietianji Classroom" column for the Weather Application and Promotion Foundation that the latest path prediction from the Weather Administration shows that Typhoon Fengshen is expected to pass northwest through Luzon Island and enter the South China Sea. Later, it will get close to Hainan Island and slowly turn southwest. The exact path might change a bit on either side.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the newest European weather model (ECMWF) shows that by 8 PM tomorrow, Fengshen will have passed Luzon Island and entered the South China Sea. Taiwan will then start to be affected by the "autumn typhoon effect" (which is when the outer parts of Typhoon Fengshen and the northeast monsoon work together).</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that today, most places will be sunny and hot during the day. There is a small chance of some rain in mountain areas in the afternoon. The north coast and eastern Taiwan also have a small chance of light, short rain. He said that starting tonight, the northeast monsoon will begin to move south, bringing rain to Taipei and the eastern parts of Taiwan, and temperatures will gradually fall.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, Wu Der-rong said that today, northern Taiwan is expected to be 23 to 36 degrees Celsius, central Taiwan 23 to 36 degrees, southern Taiwan 23 to 37 degrees, and eastern Taiwan 21 to 35 degrees.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong stated that the latest weather models show that from tomorrow until October 22, there is a chance of rain everywhere. High temperatures in northern Taiwan will drop more because of more clouds and rain. The cold air is not very strong, so temperatures will drop slowly each day. The lowest temperature in northern Taiwan might reach about 20 degrees Celsius, making it noticeably cooler. He said that because of the "autumn typhoon effect" (Typhoon Fengshen's outer parts working with the northeast monsoon), northern and eastern Taiwan will have significant rain. People need to watch out for "very heavy rain" that could cause damage. The chance is highest in the northern mountains and northeastern Taiwan, followed by Hualien and Taitung, which should also be careful.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that on October 23 and 24, Fengshen will weaken and move away. Taiwan will be affected by the northeast monsoon, and northern and eastern Taiwan will still have significant rain. There is still a chance of very heavy local rain. Also, northern Taiwan will remain cool.</p>
