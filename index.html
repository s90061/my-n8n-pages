            <h1>US Government May Shut Down Again, Asian Stock Markets Show Mixed Results</h1>
            <p>The US government might stop working again, which means important economic news might not come out on time. Because of this, investors are being careful. But they also think the US central bank (Fed) will lower interest rates again. So, Asian stock markets today had different results, some went up and some went down.</p>
            <p>News reports say that the Fed lowered interest rates this month for the first time since December last year. Recent important US economic numbers make investors believe that interest rates will be lowered two more times this year.</p>
            <p>This week, many US job market numbers are expected to be announced, like new job openings, new hires by private companies, and the number of people working in non-farming jobs in September. Experts think these numbers will show that the job market is still slowing down. This would give Fed officials more reason to make money policies easier.</p>
            <p>However, investors are worried that if the Republican and Democratic parties in the US cannot agree on how to pay for the government by midnight tonight, some economic news might be delayed.</p>
            <p>Leaders from both parties in the US Congress met with President Trump yesterday to try and solve the problem. But after the meeting, Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democratic leader, told reporters that there are still "big disagreements" between the two sides.</p>
            <p>Asian stock markets started today by continuing to go up, just like yesterday. However, some of these markets could not keep going up.</p>
            <p>China announced today that its factory activity went down for the sixth month in a row. But the Shanghai stock market still went up by 0.5% at the end of the day. The Hong Kong stock market also went up by 0.9%. Stock markets in Taipei, Singapore, and Wellington also closed higher.</p>
            <p>But the Tokyo stock market went down by 0.3% at the end of the day. Stock markets in Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok, and Jakarta also closed lower.</p>

            <h1>Woman from New Taipei Accused of Threatening Man for Not Paying for Trip</h1>
            <p>A woman from New Taipei went on a trip with a man she met online. She was unhappy because the man did not pay for his part of the trip. She is accused of sending threatening messages to him, saying things like "I will make your life difficult" and "I have people ready." She also threatened to say he sexually assaulted her if he didn't pay her back. The New Taipei District Prosecutors' Office has charged her with threatening to harm someone.</p>
            <p>Court papers say that Ms. Lin met Mr. Lin online. They planned a trip to Taichung. Late at night on May 23 this year, when they returned to Ms. Lin's home in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei, Ms. Lin was angry that Mr. Lin did not pay for the trip. She asked him to pay, or she would call the police and accuse him of sexual assault. She also said, "If you try to run away, I will tell my father to deal with you right away."</p>
            <p>After that, Ms. Lin sent many LINE messages to Mr. Lin. She said, "I will make your life in Taichung difficult, give me back the money I spent," and "I have people ready." Mr. Lin felt scared. He reported it to the Xinzhuang police station in New Taipei. He believed Ms. Lin was trying to get money by threatening him and would not let him leave her home. He thought she committed crimes like threatening to harm someone, attempted blackmail, and illegal detention.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors have now charged Ms. Lin with threatening to harm someone. For the attempted blackmail part, prosecutors said that Ms. Lin was only trying to get back the money for the trip because she paid for all of it. So, they decided she did not intend to illegally take money. Therefore, it was not blackmail.</p>
            <p>For the illegal detention part, Ms. Lin's ex-boyfriend said that he rented Ms. Lin's home in Xinzhuang. He also said that Mr. Lin was free to come and go and use his phone while he was staying there. So, it is difficult to believe Mr. Lin's side of the story that his movements were limited.</p>
