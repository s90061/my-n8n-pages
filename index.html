            <h1>European Stocks Change as Investors Watch Trump's Actions</h1>
            <p>Today, stock markets in Europe showed mixed results. Investors were carefully watching what new things US President Trump was doing, like his tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and his plan to meet with Russian President Putin. After news came out that the US would also put tariffs on gold, the price of gold futures (agreements to buy or sell gold later) reached the highest price ever.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went down by 5.04 points, which is 0.06%, and closed at 9095.73 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 29.64 points, which is 0.12%, and closed at 24162.86 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 33.68 points, which is 0.44%, and closed at 7743.00 points.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times newspaper in the UK reported that the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sent a letter. This letter said the US would put a tax on imported 1-kilogram gold bars. Because of this, the price of gold futures for December on the Comex exchange reached $3534.10 per ounce today.</p>

            <h1>Thai Art Center Removes Works About Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang Due to Chinese Pressure</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that a major art gallery in Bangkok, Thailand, called the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, changed or removed some artworks from an exhibition. This happened because China asked them to. The exhibition included works about how Beijing treats minority groups and Hong Kong. Artists said this is another time China has tried to stop people from criticizing it outside of China.</p>
            <p>The exhibition at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre was called "Constellation of Complicity: Visualizing the Global Machinery of Authoritarian Solidarity." It looked at how strict governments in different countries work together. The art came from artists who had to leave their homes in places like Tibet, Xinjiang, Russia, Iran, and Syria.</p>
            <p>When a Reuters reporter went to the exhibition today, they saw that some artworks that were advertised before and photographed had been removed. This included a multimedia art piece by an artist from Tibet. Other artworks were changed. Words like "Hong Kong," "Tibet," and "Uyghur," or the artists' names, were covered up.</p>
            <p>Sai, an artist from Myanmar and one of the exhibition's organizers, said that the exhibition opened on July 24th. Three days later, people from the Chinese embassy, with officials from Bangkok city, came to the exhibition. They asked for the exhibition to be stopped.</p>
            <p>Reuters saw an email from the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre dated July 30th. In the email, it said, "The Chinese Embassy put pressure on us through the (Thai) Ministry of Foreign Affairs and especially our main supporter, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration. We were warned that this exhibition could create diplomatic problems between Thailand and China."</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre also said in the email that they "had no choice but to make some changes," which included covering up the names of artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and Uyghur regions.</p>
            <p>According to Sai, the Chinese embassy later asked for even more artworks to be removed. He said these works included the Tibetan snow lion flag, the East Turkestan flag of the Uyghur people, several postcards showing Chinese President Xi Jinping, and one postcard showing the relationship between China and Israel.</p>
            <p>The removed work by Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron included a video showing Tibetans holding Palestinian flags and asking for people to be held responsible for genocide. It also included a video called "Listen to Indigenous People."</p>
            <p>The Reuters reporter at the scene saw that the video player showed a black screen. Another video by a Uyghur artist was playing, but the artist's name was covered with black paint.</p>
            <p>Sai said he has left Thailand because Thai police are looking for him. He also shared recent news from his contacts in Bangkok. He said Chinese officials returned to the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre yesterday. They asked for a flyer to be removed and repeated that they wanted to "enforce the One-China policy."</p>
            <p>Sai stated, "It is sadly ironic that an exhibition about strict governments working together was censored by a strict government. For a long time, Thailand has been a safe place for people who disagree with their governments. But this event sends a worrying message to all artists and activists who have fled to this region."</p>

            <h1>Survey Says Taipei is the World's Most Desired City to Live in, Beats Singapore</h1>
            <p>Gensler, a global company for design and architecture, recently shared a survey report called "City Pulse 2025: The Magnetic City." This report says that Taipei is the world's most desired city to live in for a long time. It won against big international cities like Singapore, Sydney, and Berlin.</p>
            <p>Gensler's worldwide survey, "2025 City Pulse: The Magnetic City," collected opinions from 33,000 people living in 65 cities around the world. It looked at why and where people choose to live.</p>
            <p>The survey recorded the percentage of people in each city who said they were "unlikely" to move. The top 10 international cities where people most want to live for a long time are: Taipei (64%), Ho Chi Minh City (61%), Singapore (59%), Sydney (58%), Berlin (51%), Monterrey (50%), Munich (49%), Sao Paulo (49%), Vancouver (49%), and Seoul (47%).</p>
            <p>According to Gensler's survey, there were 152 factors. The top 5 most important factors that make people want to stay in a city for a long time are: "I don't feel bored in this city," "I feel at home in this city," "I am proud of this city," "This city is becoming better for old age," and "My sense of belonging in the city grows over time."</p>
            <p>For cities in the United States, the top 10 most desired cities to live in were: Minneapolis (53%), San Antonio (53%), San Diego (50%), Raleigh (49%), Chicago (47%), Tampa (47%), Portland (47%), Phoenix (46%), San Francisco (46%), and Austin (46%).</p>
            <p>Also, in this report, Taipei got good scores in many areas. For economic strength it scored 73%, for safety and stability 78%, for city energy 76%, for climate readiness 69%, for improving quality of life 71%, for community investment 70%, for helping homeless people 60%, and for reducing crime 71%. All of Taipei's scores were higher than the average scores for all cities in the survey.</p>
