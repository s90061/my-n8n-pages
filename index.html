            <h1>Three Female Divers Lost in New Taipei Gongliao Sea, Found Safe by Fishing Boat</h1>
            <p>The New Taipei City Fire Department said today that around 10:40 AM, the Coast Guard reported that three female divers were missing near the Lailei fishing area in Gongliao District. They had not come back to shore. At noon, a fishing boat found the three divers. They were all fine and did not need to go to the hospital. They were taken to Shicheng Fishing Port in Yilan.</p>
            <p>The Second Offshore Flotilla of the Coast Guard sent a message saying that a group of 12 divers went diving. They entered the water around 8:40 AM. Later, three female divers in the group went missing.</p>
            <p>It is believed that the divers might have been affected by ocean currents or rip currents. They did not appear at their planned diving spot. The other divers in the same group quickly told the Coast Guard.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Fire Department said that around 11:41 AM, a fishing boat seemed to have found the divers. At 12:14 PM, it was confirmed. The fishing boat took the three divers to Shicheng Fishing Port in Yilan County. The three divers were okay and said they did not need medical help.</p>

            <h1>Expert Says China's New Rare Earth Rules Affect US Defense, Talks Are Needed</h1>
            <p>China has made its rules for exporting rare earth materials stricter. This has made the trade conflict between the US and China worse. A meeting between Trump and Xi might be canceled. Experts say that China's action affects America's defense industry. The US will need to start talks. Both sides still have time to discuss things before the new rules start in December.</p>
            <p>On October 9, China's government announced six new rules. American media called these new export controls "almost unheard of." Even foreign companies must get permission from China to export if their products contain 0.1% or more of rare earth materials from China. The rules for products made outside China will start on December 1.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump wrote a long message on Truth Social on October 10. He said, "Some very strange things are happening in China! They have become very unfriendly." He criticized China's export controls on rare earth minerals. He also said that he was supposed to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in Korea later this month, but now "there seems to be no reason to do so."</p>
            <p>Trump also stated that because China has put in place "very strong" export controls on rare earth minerals, he will add a 100% tariff on goods from China starting November 1.</p>
            <p>Today, BBC Chinese quoted Jonathan Czin, an expert on China at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Czin said that Xi Jinping's recent actions are meant to control the upcoming talks. Also, looking at China's reaction after the US announced matching tariffs in early April, Czin does not think China is worried about America's response.</p>
            <p>However, Gracelin Baskaran, who leads the Critical Minerals Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, said that China's newest export rules target foreign defense manufacturers. This makes the situation very serious.</p>
            <p>She said, "Nothing makes the US act more than something that targets the American defense industry." She added, "The US will definitely need to start talks because we have limited choices. And in a time of more global tension and possible conflicts, we must make our defense industry stronger."</p>
            <p>Even though a meeting between Trump and Xi seems unlikely now, Baskaran said this does not mean talks are completely impossible. She pointed out that China's new rules will not start until December. This means both sides still have time and space to discuss things, and talks might start soon.</p>

            <h1>Hau Lung-pin Says Online Army Affects Election, Chao Shao-kang Asks China to Stop</h1>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin, a candidate for chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, said that a huge online army is spreading false rumors to attack him. Chao Shao-kang, the former chairman of Broadcasting Corporation of China (BCC), said today that the KMT chairman election is a matter for the KMT itself. However, mainland China is getting heavily involved. He hopes the Chinese government will stop this. If the Chinese government allows it, then it is involvement. This has become a national security issue, and Taiwan's security agencies should investigate who is behind these actions.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairman election will be held on October 18. Hau Lung-pin said recently that this election campaign has been a big shock for him. The attacks from the online army are widespread and stronger than a national team, which is more than he has experienced before. Many fake accounts from inside and outside Taiwan are using false information to attack him online. He wonders where these online armies come from. The attacks he has received are more powerful than the so-called "1450" online army of the Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
            <p>This morning, Chao Shao-kang, who supports Hau Lung-pin and is the former chairman of BCC, and Liu Tsai-wei, a Taipei City Councilor for the KMT, held a press conference. The press conference was called "Warning the Mainland Authorities: Do Not Interfere in the KMT Chairman Election."</p>
            <p>Chao Shao-kang said that recently, there have been many false messages online attacking Hau Lung-pin. Based on the language used, these fake messages seem to come from mainland China. Of course, some are from Taiwan too, but many are from China, and many are made by AI. The number of fake messages is very large, too much for a normal internet celebrity to do. It must be done with a lot of people and resources.</p>
            <p>Chao Shao-kang pointed out that the KMT chairman election should just be an internal matter for the KMT. But now, mainland China is getting heavily involved. He hopes the Chinese government will stop this. If they do not stop it, they are allowing it. If the Chinese government allows it, then it is interference. This has become a national security issue, and Taiwan's security agencies should also investigate who is doing these things.</p>
            <p>Regarding the idea that Hau Lung-pin was talking about his opponent Cheng Li-wen, Chao Shao-kang said that he did not mention Cheng Li-wen, and Hau Lung-pin did not say who it was. He said that pointing out this situation does not mean accusing anyone. Instead, he just does not want to see this kind of situation.</p>
            <p>When asked why China might be interfering in the KMT chairman election, Chao Shao-kang said that mainland China might want to find a KMT chairman candidate they can control. Hau Lung-pin has repeatedly said he will not "lick the Communist Party." In the past, when Hau Lung-pin went to mainland China, he always spoke about the need to face the existence of the Republic of China. So, for the Chinese government, Hau Lung-pin might not be a good KMT chairman. He also announced that Hau Lung-pin will hold talks on mainland policy on October 14.</p>
            <p>At the press conference, many examples of false online content were shown, including an AI-made video of Hau Lung-pin and Liu Tsai-wei kissing. Liu Tsai-wei said she felt disgusted and sad. She said the party chairman election should not be like this, as it hurts the party's reputation. She believes the hidden person behind these actions should stop. She announced that she and Chao Shao-kang will report this to the police and sue tomorrow. This is a warning to the "black hand" behind it, and she will not let it go.</p>
