            <h1>Baolvte Sees Good Future for Food-Grade Recycled Trays; New Production Line Starts in November</h1>
            <p>Lin Yujun, the Chief Financial Officer for Baolvte-KY, shared today that they are not only recycling PET bottles but are also positive about the market for food-grade recycled flat containers. A new production line that the company invested in and set up in Pinghu, Zhejiang, China, is expected to begin working in November. Baolvte explained that their system for recycling, cleaning, and reusing flat containers (trays) has solved difficult cleaning issues. They plan to use their own cleaning lines to make this technology ready for selling.</p>
            <p>Baolvte-KY held a meeting for investors today. Lin Yujun mentioned that their production line for recycled PET bottles makes 20,000 tons each year and supplies the American market. The new production line for food-grade recycled flat containers will also make 20,000 tons annually. It will first supply the Chinese market. However, in the future, the company hopes to focus on selling the equipment itself to China, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and America.</p>
            <p>Ouyang Yifeng, the Deputy General Manager of Zhejiang Baolvte, explained that Europe and America already have machines to make new products from food-grade recycled flat containers. But these machines are much less effective than the ones Baolvte makes. Because of this, Baolvte's new production line for food-grade recycled flat containers, which will start in November, is actually a demonstration line. Its main purpose is to show other recycling companies how well it works, so they will buy equipment from Baolvte.</p>
            <p>Also, Baolvte is positive about the recycled plastic market in India. They have started a company there to make products locally, improve their service, and build a supply chain in the country. Baolvte reported that the Indian recycled plastic market is expected to be worth 5.277 billion US dollars by 2028, growing by 5.6% each year on average.</p>
            <p>Baolvte also said that the need for recycled PET bottles is increasing in India. India currently recycles 400,000 tons of PET bottles per year. They plan to increase this to 750,000 tons by 2027. By 2030, they expect this amount to grow to 1 million to 1.2 million tons each year.</p>
            <p>According to Baolvte's numbers, their total income in the first half of this year was 2.45 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is about 6.5% more than the same time last year. Their profit per share in the first half was 2.28 New Taiwan Dollars, which is about 15.7% more than last year.</p>
            <p>Regarding exchange rates, Lin Yujun pointed out that there were big changes in exchange rates in the second quarter. However, this only affected their income. This is because many payments they needed to receive or pay were in the Chinese market. Even though the New Taiwan Dollar got much stronger against the US dollar in the second quarter, the Chinese Renminbi stayed quite steady against the US dollar. This helped protect them from financial risk. In the second quarter, they not only avoided losses from currency exchange but also made money from it.</p>

            <h1>TSMC: US Government Cancels Nanjing Plant's Special Permission; Company is Looking at How to Respond</h1>
            <p>TSMC, a company that makes computer chips, said today that the US government has told them that the special permission for their Nanjing plant, called "Verified End-User" (VEU) authorization, will end on December 31, 2025. TSMC is now carefully checking the situation and planning what to do. They want to make sure that their Nanjing plant can continue to operate without any problems.</p>
            <p>The US government recently announced that it would remove special permissions for American companies like Intel, and South Korean companies Samsung and SK Hynix, to get American equipment for making computer chips in China. Today, TSMC confirmed that they also received a notice from the US government. This notice states that the "Verified End-User" permission for TSMC's Nanjing plant will also finish on December 31, 2025.</p>
            <p>TSMC stated that they are looking at the situation and will take suitable actions. This includes talking with the US government. Their main goal is to keep the TSMC Nanjing plant running without any problems.</p>
            <p>In 2024, the US Department of Commerce gave TSMC Nanjing the "Certified End-User" permission. This official VEU permission took the place of a temporary written permission that the Department of Commerce had given since October 2022.</p>
            <p>This VEU permission from the Department of Commerce did not give TSMC Nanjing new rights. It just confirmed that goods and services covered by US export control laws could keep being supplied to TSMC Nanjing for a long time. Suppliers did not need to get separate licenses. This VEU permission kept things as they were for TSMC Nanjing's chip production. Now that the VEU permission will be taken away, there will be more things that could change for TSMC Nanjing's operations in the future.</p>

            <h1>The Real-Life 'Devil Wears Prada' Steps Down; New Leader for US Vogue Announced</h1>
            <p>Anna Wintour, who used to be the main editor of the American "Vogue" magazine, left her job in June this year. After many months of people guessing who would take her place, this very famous person finally announced today that Chloe Malle, who was the editor of Vogue's website, will take over. She will be the new Editorial Director of American Vogue.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Anna Wintour, who was in charge of American Vogue for almost 40 years, announced in June this year that she would leave her job as editor-in-chief. This very important job was advertised publicly on LinkedIn, a website for jobs and social networking, this summer.</p>
            <p>Even though Wintour is no longer the main editor of American Vogue, she still has important jobs. She is the Global Editorial Director of Vogue and the Chief Content Officer for Conde Nast, which is the company that owns Vogue. In these jobs, she checks the editing work of other magazines like GQ, Teen Vogue, and Vanity Fair.</p>
            <p>Chloe Malle, who is 39 years old, will now be in charge of the daily work of American Vogue across all its different online and print platforms. She will report directly to Anna Wintour.</p>
            <p>Vogue's website also shared this news about the new person in charge today. In the article, Malle said, "Fashion and media are changing very quickly. I am very excited and feel deep respect to be a part of this. I also feel very lucky that Anna (Wintour) is still here to guide me."</p>
            <p>Malle first started working at Vogue in 2011 as a social editor. Her job was to write articles about weddings, parties, and other fun topics.</p>
            <p>In 2016, she became a contributing editor, which means she wrote articles for the magazine. Since 2023, she has been the editor of the Vogue website, where she manages all the magazine's online content. She has also interviewed famous people for cover stories, such as supermodel Gigi Hadid and Greta Gerwig, who directed the movie "Barbie."</p>
            <p>Besides managing what appears on the website, Malle also became a "voice" for Vogue in 2022. She hosts the magazine's only podcast show, "The Run-Through with Vogue," along with Chioma Nnadi, who is the editorial director of British Vogue.</p>
            <p>Malle also recently released the second issue of "Dogue." This is a special digital-only magazine from Vogue that is all about celebrity dogs. In addition, she interviewed Lauren Sanchez, the wife of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, for Vogue's June cover story. At that time, they had a big wedding.</p>
