            <h1>Nvidia H20 Chip Allowed Again: Hsiao Bi-khim Says Taiwan's Safety Must Be Protected</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 21 (CNA) The United States has changed its rules for sending computer chips to China. Now, Nvidia's H20 chip can be sent to China again. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim recently talked with foreign reporters. She was asked if this might help China's Artificial Intelligence (AI) grow and be used against Taiwan. The Vice President said that technology made and produced in Taiwan must not be used to harm Taiwan's safety or put the lives and property of Taiwanese people in danger.</p>
            <p>On July 18, Vice President Hsiao attended an event called "Dialogue with Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim" at the Taiwan Foreign Correspondents' Club. The Presidential Office released a press statement today.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked how the government will make people believe that a good relationship between Taiwan and the US is still good for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao talked about "diversifying" relationships. She said that the US is a very important trade partner for Taiwan. Taiwan gets a lot of help from the US in new ideas, technology, and research. Also, the US invests a lot in Taiwan. She added that this is a two-way partnership, and both sides gain from it.</p>
            <p>The Vice President stated that the US is Taiwan's most important partner. It plays a key role in keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and helping Taiwan defend itself. She also thanked more and more countries around the world for saying that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important. These countries show their support through meetings, policies, plans, and statements.</p>
            <p>Regarding concerns about taxes on goods, Vice President Hsiao said she doesn't have more information yet. She said the negotiation teams are working very hard, almost day and night, even losing sleep because they are working on both US and Taiwan time. She hopes they can reach an agreement soon. This would help move forward with other agreements that are also very important for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Another reporter asked if the current talks include the US's "232 investigation" on semiconductors. They also asked if Nvidia being allowed to send H20 chips made in Taiwan to China might help China's AI grow and be used as a threat against Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said she could not share details about the specific negotiation plans and timeline for trade and semiconductor issues at this time.</p>
            <p>She said that for both discussions about taxes and the "232 investigation" on semiconductor trade, the main goal is the same: to create wealth for both sides in a fair way. US President Trump once said he wanted to "Make America Great Again." In Taiwan, the goal is also to be stronger. She believes a strong Taiwan with a good economy is good for the whole world. This is because Taiwan has always been a trustworthy and steady helper in the global supply chain.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao stressed that she cannot speak for any foreign government, company, or even Taiwanese companies. But looking at the bigger picture, Nvidia has always been an important partner for Taiwan. Taiwan's technology industry has also always been a reliable supplier for top US technology companies like Nvidia. This is how Taiwan hopes to keep helping the world and people through different trade and investment plans.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that the questions from the media also touched on AI and rules for selling technology to other countries. She believes this is a difficult topic for both governments and private companies. However, there is a general agreement: the main reason for these rules is to make sure that technology developed and made in Taiwan is not used to harm Taiwan's safety or put the lives and property of Taiwanese people in danger.

            <h1>Bulareyaung Dance Company Tours US and Canada for the First Time, Sharing Indigenous Beauty</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 21 (CNA) The Bulareyaung Dance Company will start its North American tour in late July. They will visit five cities in the US and Canada. They will perform their important dance pieces, "LUNA" and "Beautiful Beautiful." This will show the new and creative power of Taiwan's indigenous modern dance on the world stage.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture announced today in a press release that the Bulareyaung Dance Company's work "LUNA" uses Bunun tribal songs and culture in its dance. It won the 17th Taishin Arts Award. In the past, it has been performed in Canada, Japan, Malaysia, and other places, impressing audiences in many countries. It also caught the attention of important US art festivals, like the American Dance Festival and Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. This led to the current North American tour.</p>
            <p>The Bulareyaung Dance Company will also perform "Beautiful Beautiful" for US and Canadian audiences. This dance uses blue and white canvas on stage to represent the blue sea and sky of eastern Taiwan. It expresses what "beautiful" means to them. This is also the first time Bulareyaung Pagarlava has led his group back to the US as the leader in 10 years. He wants to show international audiences works that combine Taiwan's indigenous culture with modern dance.</p>
            <p>The founder of the dance company, Bulareyaung Pagarlava, is from the Paiwan tribe in Taiwan. He has strong connections with the US. In 1998, he went to New York to study with help from the Asian Cultural Council. He has also been invited to choreograph for Cloud Gate 2 and the Martha Graham Dance Company. At the peak of his career in the US, Bulareyaung chose to return to his hometown, Taitung. In 2015, he started the Bulareyaung Dance Company. He uses indigenous culture as his creative source and helps young dancers from the tribe learn about their roots.</p>
            <p>After many years of hard work, the dance company has achieved great results. In 2022, Bulareyaung Pagarlava won the National Award for Arts. This year, as the company celebrates its 10th anniversary, it was chosen as a "Taiwan Brand Team" by the Ministry of Culture. This tour is supported by the Ministry of Culture. It was made possible by the Taipei Cultural Center in New York, the Taiwan Academy at the US Representative Office, and the Taiwan Academy at the Houston Office working together.</p>
            <p>From July 23 to August 16, the Bulareyaung Dance Company will perform at places like the American Dance Festival in North Carolina, the Festival des Arts de Saint-Sauveur in Quebec, Canada, the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, and the SummerStage Taiwanese Waves music festival in Central Park, New York.</p>
            <p>Besides performing, on August 6, a new documentary about the dance company called "Children Who Dance into the Tribe" will be shown at the Museum of Chinese in America in New York. Members of the dance company will be there for a Q&A session after the film. This will allow American audiences to fully understand the dance company's special charm through dance, music, and videos.

            <h1>Tainan Starts Cross-Agency Help to Aid Farmers with Disaster Relief Applications</h1>
            <p>Tainan, July 21 (CNA) Typhoon Danas caused damage to crops and farm buildings in Tainan. The city's Agriculture Bureau has started a system where different groups work together to help. They have asked staff from farmers' associations and young local farmers to go to 11 district offices. They will help farmers apply for disaster relief. The goal is to speed up the recovery after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-lin, the head of Tainan City's Agriculture Bureau, told CNA reporters today that when sudden natural disasters happen, farmers often get very busy trying to save their land and replant. Older farmers, especially, are not very familiar with preparing information about damage and the necessary paperwork. This can cause delays in getting some relief money and affect their rights.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-lin said that the Agriculture Bureau worked with the Tainan City Farmers' Association. They brought together farmers' associations from different districts and local young farmer teams. These teams will be at 11 district offices. They will help farmers use the "Agricultural Industry Natural Disaster On-site Photo App" and provide help with applying for disaster relief. This is to make sure that all affected farmers can finish their applications on time.</p>
            <p>He said that most of the people helping at the district offices this time are employees from farmers' associations and local young farmers. They know the local farming areas well and often talk with neighboring farmers. They can help farmers use digital tools to quickly understand the damage and give real help.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-lin asked farmers to make sure they apply for relief before the deadline. They should also pay attention to public announcements to protect their rights. If they have any questions about how to apply or what documents they need, they can ask the Agriculture Bureau or their local district office. The Agriculture Bureau will continue to work with the district offices to improve disaster prevention and response, making damage assessments and relief efforts more efficient.
