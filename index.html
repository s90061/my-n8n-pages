Have you noticed that your favorite snacks or food items seem smaller, but the price is still the same? This is called "shrinkflation." It means companies are selling less of a product for the same amount of money, or sometimes even for a slightly higher price. A recent report says that shrinkflation is making daily life more expensive for people. It's like a hidden way that prices are going up. For example, some chocolate bars, packets of crisps, or even toilet paper rolls are getting smaller. Experts say that shrinkflation adds to the problem of inflation, which is when prices rise generally. This trend is a challenge for families trying to manage their money. Consumers might not even notice it at first, but over time, they are getting less for their money.

**工作：辦公室回歸潮**

After a few years of working from home, many big companies are now asking their employees to return to the office. Some want workers back full-time, while others prefer a mix of office and home work. This change is causing some problems between companies and their staff. Many employees enjoyed the freedom and flexibility of working remotely. They often feel more productive at home and save time and money on commuting. Because of this, some workers are not happy about coming back to the office. This situation shows a big difference in what companies want and what employees want. Companies often believe that working together in person helps teams work better and improves company culture. But employees value their new work-life balance. This trend might continue to be a difficult topic for a while.

**旅行：威尼斯旅遊費**

The famous Italian city of Venice will start asking day visitors to pay a fee to enter the city from 2024. This new rule is a trial to help manage the very large number of tourists, a problem known as "overtourism." Venice is a beautiful city with many canals and old buildings, but it is also very small. Too many tourists cause problems for the city's everyday life and its delicate structures. The city wants to protect its unique character and make life better for its residents. The fee will be about five euros and will be charged on specific busy days. The goal is not to stop people from visiting, but to encourage fewer people to come on the busiest days. Many popular travel spots around the world are facing similar challenges with overtourism.
