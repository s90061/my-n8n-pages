            <h1>Trump Family Business Plans to Raise $1.5 Billion to Create WLFI Public Company</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported on August 8th that the crypto business of US President Trump's family, called "World Liberty Financial," plans to raise 1.5 billion US dollars. They want to create a public company that will own the cryptocurrency $WLFI.</p>
            <p>Sources said that the details of the deal are not final yet. However, the company has already talked to big investors in the crypto and technology fields about this new business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that World Liberty Financial is a "decentralized platform." Their official website says that Trump and his son are the co-founders of the platform. Since it started, the platform has made 500 million US dollars for the Trump family.</p>
            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet called $WLFI a security. This means it will not be checked as strictly as investments like stocks.</p>

            <h1>Putin's Envoy: Some Countries Do Not Want Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire and Will Strongly Disrupt Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced yesterday that he will meet with Russian President Putin on August 15th. Today, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy for international economic and investment cooperation, said that some countries will try very hard to stop this meeting.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had previously said that Russia and Ukraine are close to a ceasefire agreement. This agreement could end the conflict that has lasted for three and a half years. The details of the agreement are not public yet. However, Ukraine might be asked to give up a lot of its land, and many European countries do not agree with this.</p>
            <p>Today, Dmitriev accused some countries of wanting the war to continue. He wrote on his Telegram account, "Some countries that want the conflict to go on will certainly try very hard to spoil the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump."</p>
            <p>Dmitriev also said that these efforts mean "provocation and spreading false information." But he did not say which countries he was talking about or what kind of "provocation" it might be.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin had already confirmed that this meeting between the Russian and US leaders will happen. Putin's assistant, Yuri Ushakov, said that the two leaders will "focus on discussing options to find a long-lasting peaceful solution to the crisis in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said, "This will clearly be a difficult process, but we will work hard and actively on it."</p>

            <p>In Singapore, at the World Aquatics Masters Championships, Taiwan's amazing swimmer, Grandma Tang Cheng-yao, won a gold medal today. She swam the 100-meter breaststroke in the 95-99 age group in 5 minutes and 44.50 seconds. She also broke the competition record.</p>
            <p>The World Aquatics Masters Championships started in 1986. They usually happen every two years. These championships include swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and artistic swimming. Since 2015, they have been held at the same time as the World Aquatics Championships.</p>
            <p>Tang Cheng-yao is now 97 years old. She was the only person in the 95-99 age group for the 100-meter breaststroke. Even so, Tang Cheng-yao swam strongly to the end. She was happy to break the competition record, and the audience cheered for her after the race.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Tang Cheng-yao competed in both swimming and land sports at the Taipei World Masters Games. She won a total of 5 gold medals. She will turn 98 in October this year. She has said that she wants to stay active as she gets older. "I hope to become an athlete who is over a hundred years old," she said.</p>
