            <h1>Trump Threatens to Use 'Department of War' in Chicago, Hints at More Immigrant Deportations</h1>
            <p>In Washington, D.C., September 6th â€“ Former US President Donald Trump today said he might use his newly named "Department of War" in Chicago. This makes the situation more tense as he wants to send soldiers to cities led by Democrats.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump is trying to do what he did in Washington, D.C. There, he sent the National Guard and more federal agents to arrest and deport immigrants. But people in the city strongly disagreed with this.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that "Chicago will soon know why this unit is called the Department of War."</p>
            <p>His post also said, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." He included an image of himself that looked like it was made by AI. Both these things referred to the 1979 movie "Apocalypse Now."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump signed an order to change the name of the Department of Defense to the "Department of War." He said this was to send "a message of victory" to the whole world.</p>
            <p>Chicago is in Illinois. Its governor, JB Pritzker, who is a Democrat, was very angry about Trump's post.</p>
            <p>Pritzker wrote on social media platform X, "The President of the United States is threatening to declare war on an American city. This is not a joke. This is not normal."</p>
            <p>Besides Chicago, Trump has also said he would send soldiers to other cities run by Democrats, such as Baltimore and New Orleans.</p>

            <h1>Salvadoran Migrant in US Worries About Being Sent to Uganda; Authorities Plan to Send Him to Eswatini</h1>
            <p>In Washington, D.C., September 6th â€“ The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sent a letter yesterday. It said that after a man from El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, showed concern about being sent to Uganda, they now plan to send him to another African country, the Kingdom of Eswatini.</p>
            <p>Fox News first reported on the letter that ICE sent to Abrego Garcia's lawyers.</p>
            <p>The letter stated that Abrego Garcia's concerns about possibly facing harm or torture in Uganda are "hard to take seriously." This is because he (through his lawyers) had said he worried about harm or torture in at least 22 different countries. However, the letter added, "we are now telling you that your new country for removal is the Kingdom of Eswatini."</p>
            <p>Today, a spokesperson for the Eswatini government told the Associated Press that they have not received any notice about Abrego Garcia being sent there.</p>
            <p>Abrego Garcia has lived in Maryland, USA, for over ten years. In March this year, he was wrongly sent back to El Salvador. In June, he was returned to the United States.</p>
            <p>He was arrested again in late August when he reported to ICE. At that time, it was said that he might be sent to Uganda.</p>
            <p>Abrego Garcia is at the center of the debate about former US President Donald Trump's actions against immigrants. His case has started a big legal fight and is seen as a test of Trump's strict immigration policies.</p>

            <h1>US Senator: Taiwan is Important to the US; Pacific Defense Line Would Break if China Takes It</h1>
            <p>In Washington, D.C., September 6th â€“ After his visit to Taiwan, US Senator Roger Wicker, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that Taiwan is very important for the national security of the United States and the world economy. He warned that if China takes Taiwan, the defense line in the Pacific that protects the US from China's military threats would collapse. He also repeated that he is hopeful about the US and Taiwan making more weapons together.</p>
            <p>Important US lawmakers Roger Wicker and Senator Deb Fischer visited Taiwan at the end of August. This was Wicker's first trip to Taiwan as the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was also the first time a leader of this committee visited Taiwan in nine years. During his visit, Wicker said he believes the US and Taiwan will produce weapons together in the future.</p>
            <p>When Wicker returned to the US, his office published a new weekly report online that focused on his trip to Taiwan. The report highlighted Taiwan's strong stand against China and its importance to US national security.</p>
            <p>Wicker stated that Taiwan is "a republic that is very important for US national security and the global economy." He added that 23 million Taiwanese people, who love freedom, are facing growing threats from China. Chinese President Xi Jinping's main goal is to take this island, which is only about 90 miles from China's coast.</p>
            <p>He warned that if China takes Taiwan, many Taiwanese people would die, and the Taiwanese people would lose their freedom. It would also cause a global economic crisis, and the Pacific defense line that protects the US from China's military threats would break down. He said his visit to Taiwan was part of a larger international effort "to help prevent this terrible situation."</p>
            <p>During his visit, Wicker met with Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, and Defense Minister Wellington Koo. He told them that the US Congress promises its long-lasting friendship with Taiwan. Wicker said that the people of Taiwan are determined to live freely. He called "their determination a beacon of hope for the world" and said he was happy to support Taiwan's right to decide its own future, which is "a value that Americans hold dear."</p>
            <p>Wicker also visited Hawaii, Guam, Palau, and the Philippines during his trip to the Indo-Pacific region as the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
            <p>In his weekly report, he noted that he visited several US military bases in the Pacific. Democratic countries in the region have invested a lot over the past decades to support the US military stationed there. He said, "Our network of bases makes it harder for enemies to reach the US West Coast and provides security for the host countries."</p>
            <p>Wicker believes that if China attacks Taiwan and the US fails to protect Taiwan, these countries might become less willing to host US troops. This could eventually lead to US forces moving back to Hawaii or Guam, making the US mainland more vulnerable. "A free Taiwan helps free countries in the Pacific feel secure and helps support the US defense forces based there."</p>
            <p>In the late 1970s, the US Congress passed the "Taiwan Relations Act." This law says that the US agrees to help Taiwan get the defense materials it needs to stay safe. Wicker said, "We should continue this tradition." He also said again that he is positive about the US and Taiwan making more weapons together. He believes "this will benefit both countries' economies and also protect the principles of freedom."</p>
