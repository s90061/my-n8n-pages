            <h1>A Taiwanese Woman Works as an Interpreter in Italy and Wants to Share Cultures</h1>
            <p>A Taiwanese woman with cool hair often works at big international meetings and business talks in Italy. She can speak Chinese, Italian, and English very well. She is Xiao Naiyan, a professional interpreter in Italy for 10 years. For her, this job is not just about changing words from one language to another. It is also about sharing and connecting different cultures.</p>
            <p>Xiao Naiyan is 31 years old. She studied Italian at Fu Jen Catholic University and started working as an interpreter in Italy in 2015. She told Central News Agency that she has not met any other Taiwanese people who are full-time interpreters in Italy. This shows her job is special.</p>
            <p>‚óè The Biggest Challenge: Many Different Topics, from Medicine to Food</p>
            <p>Xiao Naiyan was very interested in foreign languages from a young age. She believes that learning a language is best done in a place where people speak it every day. She studied in Rome for 8 months during university and found that her speaking skills improved much faster than in 3 years in Taiwan. While traveling in Europe, she saw many international meetings that needed a lot of interpreters. This made her want to do this job. So, after university, she went to Italy to study more and become an interpreter.</p>
            <p>"The biggest challenge as an interpreter is that the topics are always different. Today, I might work at a dental conference. Two days later, it could be a food show, then a business meeting or a government visit. The range of industries is very wide," Xiao Naiyan said. She thinks speaking many languages is not the hardest part. Understanding the special words and terms for each field is what truly shows a professional interpreter's skill, which takes "one minute on stage, ten years of practice backstage."</p>
            <p>Xiao Naiyan explained that interpreters do a lot of preparation. They need to understand different industries or the backgrounds of two companies having a discussion. If it's a food show, they need to know about different ingredients and what the chef wants to express with each dish. "I don't call it difficult, but it is a challenge. This challenge helps me keep getting better," she said.</p>
            <p>‚óè Machines Cannot Fully Understand Human Jokes; AI Cannot Completely Replace Interpreters</p>
            <p>As artificial intelligence (AI) gets better, some people think that translation will be one of the first jobs to disappear. But Xiao Naiyan is not worried. She believes AI translation is usually "direct conversion." It often cannot correctly explain the cultural meaning of words. This is especially true for Chinese, which does not have a strict grammar structure. The same sentence can mean different things in different situations.</p>
            <p>"For example, when someone receives a compliment, Chinese people often humbly say 'no, not really.' If a machine translates this directly as a negative sentence, the meaning would be very different," Xiao Naiyan said. She added that choosing the right word when translating is very important for a professional interpreter. A small mistake can change the outcome of a big negotiation.</p>
            <p>She explained that interpreters must accurately say what both sides mean. But in diplomatic situations, it's harder. Interpreters must decide carefully, considering how each side speaks and what their country hopes to achieve. "If a conversation becomes aggressive, an interpreter needs to be very careful about how much to translate. If a mistake in interpreting causes a misunderstanding or makes someone angry, the talks might fail," she said.</p>
            <p>Xiao Naiyan said that even professional interpreters need training and years of experience to understand the mood in a room. AI cannot easily do these small things right now. Also, if AI makes a mistake, people who know the languages need to fix it.</p>
            <p>‚óè Interpreting Market Changes After Ten Good Years; Price Cuts After the Pandemic</p>
            <p>The Chinese-Italian interpreting market has busy and quiet times. Except for summer or Chinese New Year when there are fewer events, Xiao Naiyan usually has 3 jobs a month, or sometimes 5 to 10. But she feels sad that after "ten good years" in interpreting, many businesses started cutting costs after the COVID-19 pandemic. They would rather hire non-professional interpreters and not worry about quality.</p>
            <p>In Italian companies, it is common to hire friends or family members for jobs. Xiao Naiyan said that if a company needs an interpreter, they often ask someone in their family or group of friends who can speak English. But just speaking a language does not mean someone can be an interpreter. Interpreting has many small details that people who have not learned the right skills cannot manage.</p>
            <p>Xiao Naiyan also noticed that after the pandemic, many companies and government offices prioritized saving money over quality. They would choose interpreters who charged less, without considering their experience. "Translation is a very specific market, and we should respect everyone's choices. But I often get jobs where I have to fix problems because the translation wasn't good, or the message wasn't clear. In the end, professional interpreters are still needed," Xiao Naiyan said. She explained that she often gets these "fix-it" jobs now. People might even pay for interpreting twice. Because of this, she hopes more people will understand and value the professional skills of interpreters.</p>

            <h1>A County Head from "German Hollywood" Visits Taiwan, Showing a Welcoming Culture to Attract Semiconductor Business</h1>
            <p>A group of 60 people from Saxony, Germany, is going to Taiwan this weekend. They will have many meetings about business and education. The head of G√∂rlitz county, Mr. Meyer, is also with them. G√∂rlitz is sometimes called "German Hollywood." He hopes to get investments and workers for the semiconductor industry from Taiwan. He wants to show that his county welcomes foreign people.</p>
            <p>G√∂rlitz county is in the easternmost part of Germany, next to Poland and the Czech Republic. For a long time after Germany became one country again, many people moved away, and there were not enough workers. Last year, TSMC announced it would build a factory in Dresden. G√∂rlitz, which is about an hour's drive from Dresden, saw this as a chance to grow. It is actively inviting Taiwan to join the "semiconductor train" with Dresden.</p>
            <p>The group of 60 people is led by the Prime Minister of Saxony, Michael Kretschmer. They started their visit to Taiwan today. Other members include the Minister of Economy, Dirk Panter, the Minister of Science, Sebastian Gemkow, and members of the state parliament. Mr. Meyer is the only county head from Saxony's five counties to visit Taiwan with the group.</p>
            <p>According to the newspaper *S√§chsische Zeitung*, Mr. Meyer brought an English paper that lists industrial lands and factories in G√∂rlitz county that are good for businesses. Before his trip, he also asked the Taiwanese office in Germany about what kind of investments Taiwan might need.</p>
            <p>Mr. Meyer said that G√∂rlitz wants to create a place where foreign skilled workers want to stay. He believes that only if foreign talents feel safe and respected in their daily lives, the local area can truly benefit from the growth of the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>In Germany, the phrase "welcoming culture" first described how German society welcomed refugees in 2015 during a crisis. Now, local governments and businesses also use it to mean creating a friendly living and social environment that helps keep foreign skilled workers.</p>
            <p>The AfD party, which is against immigration, became the second-largest party in Germany after this year's national election. This makes foreign people more worried about possible unfair treatment or unfriendliness at work in Germany. In this political situation, the efforts of local governments to create a "welcoming culture" are seen as very important for attracting international talent.</p>
            <p>Because of this, Mr. Meyer has actively worked on creating a "welcoming culture" since he started his job. He has made multicultural weeks bigger. Last year, he even held a "Taiwan Day" during this week. Through shows, talks, and market events, local students and residents learned about Taiwan in different ways.</p>
            <p>G√∂rlitz is known for its beautiful old buildings. It is called "German Hollywood" because many international movies, like "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and "Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore," have filmed there. The county government also hopes to use this cultural special point to show a friendly "welcoming culture" to international workers.</p>
            <p>When he was a student, Mr. Meyer visited Taiwan with the youth group of the CDU party. He feels a connection to Taiwan. Last year, he contacted the Taipei office in Germany. He is the most active local leader in Saxony trying to work more with Taiwan and get Taiwanese semiconductor investments and talent because TSMC is building a factory in Germany.</p>

            <h1>Stampede at Indian Political Meeting Kills 36 People</h1>
            <p>A stampede happened at a political meeting in Tamil Nadu, India. The state's Chief Minister said that at least 36 people died, and about 58 people were hurt. This happened at a campaign event for Vijay, a famous actor who became a politician.</p>
            <p>Chief Minister M.K. Stalin wrote on X (a social media platform): "I am very sad to hear that 36 people have died. This includes 8 children and 16 women."</p>
            <p>A politician named V. Senthilbalaji said that around 58 people were injured and have been taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>Vijay, who uses only one name, was giving a speech to the crowd when the situation became very chaotic. He had to stop his speech.</p>
            <p>The 51-year-old actor said he was "heartbroken" by this sad event.</p>
            <p>Vijay wrote on X: "I send my deepest sympathy and sadness to the families of my dear brothers and sisters who died in Karur district."</p>
            <p>The *Hindustan Times* newspaper reported that a very large crowd pushed hard against the fences near the stage to see Vijay. This caused the stampede.</p>
            <p>Chief Minister Stalin has asked a committee, led by a retired judge, to look into "this terrible event." He also said that the families of those who died will get 1 million rupees (about 34,000 New Taiwan dollars) as payment.</p>
            <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the event was "very saddening."</p>
            <p>He wrote in a social media message: "My thoughts are with the families who lost loved ones. I hope they can be strong during this difficult time."</p>
