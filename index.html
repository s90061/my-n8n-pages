            <p>He also added, "Today, I will step off the court, but I will not leave basketball. Basketball will always be a part of my life. As new chances come, I feel now is the right time to confidently move into the next part of my life."</p>

            <h1>Expert: If Ukraine Loses Donbass Defenses, It Could Be Like Czech Republic Losing Sudetenland in 1938</h1>
            <p>It is said that Russia wants Ukraine to give up Donbass as one condition to end the war. A Czech expert says that if Ukraine loses its important defenses in Donbass, Russia could then easily attack open land in Ukraine. This would be like Czechoslovakia losing the Sudetenland in 1938, which then led to the Nazi occupation.</p>
            <p>After talks between the US and Russian leaders, it was reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Ukraine give up Donbass as one way to end the war.</p>
            <p>Zdeňka Petráš, an expert from Brno Defence University, told the Czech News Agency (ČTK) today: "Even without talking about money, Donbass is an industrial area with coal and oil. But what is more important for Ukraine is that this area creates a very important defense line."</p>
            <p>This defense line refers to the Ukrainian forts and barriers spread across important areas in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This line was slowly built after fighting started between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian groups in 2014. It was made much stronger after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 to stop Russian forces from moving west.</p>
            <p>In the north, this defense line includes Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. In the middle, it covers the area around Lyman, and in the south, it is near Pokrovsk.</p>
            <p>Petráš pointed out that this defense line is very important for Ukraine's protection. "If Ukraine loses this defense line, it will truly become an open land with no protection against another Russian attack, and it won't be able to build new defense points."</p>
            <p>Petráš compared this situation to Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement in 1938. At that time, because it lost its defenses in the border area of Sudetenland, Nazi Germany could easily take over the rest of the country.</p>
            <p>In the current international talks, one topic discussed is security guarantees for Ukraine. Petráš noted that these guarantees are not yet clearly defined; it is only said that they should be strong. "But in reality, Russia has an advantage on the battlefield, so if we talk about security guarantees, they must be in a way that Russia also accepts."</p>
            <p>On August 18, US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, representatives from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, and Finland, along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, met at the White House to discuss how to end the war that has lasted over three years. The outcome of the meeting was that a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin will be arranged.</p>
