            <h1>China Airlines to Start Phoenix Flights on December 3; Starlux to Fly Direct in January 2026</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese airlines are now flying to Phoenix, USA. China Airlines announced today that it will start new flights to Phoenix on December 3 this year. It will use an Airbus A350-900 plane and fly three times a week. Starlux Airlines also said it will start flights to Phoenix on January 15, 2026.</p>
            <p>Phoenix is becoming an important technology center in the southwestern part of the United States. Because of this, more business people need to travel there. China Airlines said in a press release that its direct flights from Taipei to Phoenix will start on December 3 this year. This makes China Airlines the first airline from Asia to fly there directly. From Phoenix, passengers can easily connect to other cities in the US.</p>
            <p>China Airlines said that the Taipei-Phoenix route is their seventh direct passenger flight to North America. Flights will be every Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. The flight from Taipei to Phoenix (CI036) will leave Taoyuan Airport at 10:55 AM and arrive in Phoenix at 8:00 AM local time, without stopping. The flight from Phoenix to Taipei (CI035) will leave at 11:55 AM, stop in Los Angeles at 12:20 PM, and then fly to Taipei, arriving at Taoyuan Airport at 9:30 PM the next day Taiwan time.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines today announced details for its Phoenix route. Flights will begin on January 15, 2026. Both the flights to and from Phoenix will be direct, with no stops. Tickets will be available for sale soon. Starlux will also use the Airbus A350-900 plane for these flights.</p>
            <p>According to Starlux's plan, there will be three flights a week from January 15 to February 28, 2026 (on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays). Starting in March 2026, the number of flights will increase to four times a week (on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays).</p>

            <h1>Hepatitis C Rate at 1.5%; National Health Agency to Expand Free Screening in August</h1>
            <p>The National Health Agency (NHA) said today that the number of people in Taiwan testing positive for Hepatitis C has gone down. In 2011, 3.6% of people tested positive, but this year it is 1.5%. Starting in August, the NHA will offer free screening for Hepatitis B and C to more people. Anyone born before 1986 and up to 79 years old can get one free screening in their lifetime. About 2 million more people are expected to benefit from this.</p>
            <p>July 28 is World Hepatitis Day. The World Health Organization (WHO)'s theme for this year is "Hepatitis: Letâ€™s Break It Down." This theme asks countries to act faster to remove things that stop them from preventing hepatitis and liver cancer. These problems include high costs, social prejudice, and not enough medical resources for everyone.</p>
            <p>The NHA said in a press release that to find and treat hepatitis early, they started offering Hepatitis B and C screening as part of health check-ups in 2011. This service gave people aged 45 to 79 one free screening in their lifetime. By combining health data and improving their online systems, and with hospitals actively helping with screening and sending positive cases for tests and treatment, the NHA is working hard to find and treat cases early.</p>
            <p>The NHA reported that by March this year, over 7.34 million people aged 45 to 79 had been checked for Hepatitis C. The rate of people testing positive for Hepatitis C in Taiwan dropped from 3.6% in 2011 to 1.5% this year. The rate for Hepatitis B also decreased from 15.6% to 9.5%. This progress helps Taiwan reach its goal of eliminating Hepatitis C by 2025.</p>
            <p>Wu Chao-chun, the head of the NHA, said that starting August 1 this year, they will announce and start the new policy to offer Hepatitis B and C screening to more age groups. The free lifetime screening, which was for people aged 45 to 79, will now be for people born before 1986 and up to 79 years old. This step helps Taiwan move closer to the WHO's goal of "eliminating viral hepatitis" by 2030.</p>
            <p>Wu Chien-yuan, who leads the NHA's Chronic Disease Prevention group, said that about 2 million more people will get free screening compared to the old rules.</p>
            <p>Wu Chao-chun also said in the press release that the NHA wants to eliminate Hepatitis C by 2025. He asked people to get tested and follow treatment. If they do, they have a good chance to be completely cured. This will help them avoid developing serious liver problems like liver cirrhosis or even liver cancer later.</p>
            <p>The NHA reminds everyone that besides getting screened, daily habits are also very important for preventing hepatitis. Hepatitis B can spread through blood and body fluids. People should avoid sharing personal items like needles, toothbrushes, and razors. If you have not had the Hepatitis B vaccine, you can ask a medical center about getting it. Hepatitis C mainly spreads through blood. So, avoiding unsafe ear piercing, tattoos, and acupuncture is also an important way to protect yourself.</p>

            <h1>Man with Recall Fan Asked for Photo by Security; Taipei Metro Says It Will Improve Staff Training</h1>
            <p>A person was riding the MRT (Taipei Metro) with a fan that had words about a recall vote on it. A security guard thought it was a problem and asked to take a photo of the fan for a report. Taipei Metro said today that the security guard was not trying to stop the person, but the way he spoke made the person feel bad. Taipei Metro will now train its staff better to avoid such misunderstandings.</p>
            <p>Someone wrote online on Threads that yesterday, after attending an event about an anti-communist group, they went home on the MRT. They had a fan that said "agree to recall." On the train, a security guard thought it was controversial and asked to take a picture to report it.</p>
            <p>The person online felt they did nothing wrong. The fan was in a bag, placed quietly between their feet. They were not waving it or speaking. Also, many people carried similar items about the recall vote when entering and leaving the MRT during the event. The person wondered what rule they had broken.</p>
            <p>Taipei Metro replied in a message that if a passenger is simply riding the train and not putting up, hanging, giving out, or announcing any kind of advertising, and not blocking paths or affecting other passengers, the station staff will usually not stop them.</p>
            <p>Taipei Metro explained that the security guard was checking the train cars and saw the passenger carrying an item related to the recall vote. So, the guard asked the passenger if they agreed to have a photo taken to confirm. The guard was not trying to stop or tell the passenger not to carry the item.</p>
            <p>However, Taipei Metro said that the way the security guard talked caused the passenger to feel uncomfortable. Taipei Metro will now teach its staff more about how to handle these situations. This will help prevent people from misunderstanding their actions.</p>
