Chipmaker Nvidia recently announced its latest and most powerful artificial intelligence (AI) chips, named Blackwell. This announcement took place at a major conference in San Jose, California, where the company's CEO, Jensen Huang, introduced the new technology. These chips are designed to significantly improve the performance of large AI models, which are used for advanced applications like ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.

The Blackwell series is expected to be much faster and more energy-efficient than Nvidia's previous chips. This is important because training and running large AI models requires immense computing power. Nvidia currently holds a leading position in the market for AI chips, with many tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft relying on their technology to build and expand their AI capabilities. The companyâ€™s continued innovation in this area shows its commitment to staying ahead in the rapidly growing AI industry. This development is crucial for the future of AI, making it more accessible and powerful for various uses, from business to daily life.

**US House Passes Bill That Could Ban TikTok**

The U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a bill that could lead to a ban on the popular short-video app, TikTok, in the United States. The bill requires TikTokâ€™s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the platform within a certain period, or the app would be removed from U.S. app stores. Lawmakers supporting the bill express concerns that the Chinese government could access the data of American users or influence the content shown on the app.

TikTok has strongly denied these accusations, stating that it does not share U.S. user data with the Chinese government and has measures in place to protect user privacy. The company has also argued that a ban would harm free speech and negatively impact millions of American small businesses and creators who use the platform. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration, where its future is uncertain. If passed and signed into law, it would significantly affect how many Americans interact with culture and daily life online.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging a small fee for day visitors as part of its effort to manage the overwhelming number of tourists. From late April, anyone visiting the city for the day, and not staying overnight, must pay a five-euro (about $5.30) fee during peak times. This new rule aims to reduce overcrowding and protect the city's delicate infrastructure and unique cultural heritage.

Visitors can book their entry online and receive a QR code, which may be checked at various entry points. There are some exceptions to the fee, including residents, commuters, students, and those staying in hotels within the city. This initiative makes Venice one of the first major global tourist destinations to introduce such a fee for day-trippers. The city hopes this measure will help create a more sustainable tourism model, balancing the needs of its residents and the environment with the desire for people to experience its beauty.`;
