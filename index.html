**Taipei Film Awards: Thai Actor Wanlop Wins Best Actor in First Vote**

Taipei, July 5 (CNA) â€“ The 27th Taipei Film Awards ended tonight. Thai actor Wanlop became the first foreign actor to win Best Actor in the history of the Taipei Film Awards. Lee Ya-mei, the director of the Taipei Film Awards, said that he won with 7 votes in the first round, competing with Lan Wei-hua. The Best Actress, Kao Yi-ling, also won with 8 votes, beating Sylvia Chang.

Lee Ya-mei said that this year, the jury mostly agreed on the awards. Many awards were decided in the mock vote, with more than half of the votes. For Best Actor, Wanlop Rungkumjad from "White Bone, Black Dog" had a comforting power despite limited language and a heavy story. He made the audience believe in the character's kindness, so he won against Lan Wei-hua, who was also nominated for the same award.

For Best Actress, it was a competition between two mothers. Kao Yi-ling from "Our Family Matters" and Sylvia Chang from "Daughter's Daughter" competed until the end. The jury thought Sylvia Chang used her experience in her role and was a dream actress for the director. But Kao Yi-ling showed the mother's patience and strength very well, which was very difficult. For Best Supporting Actor, Lee Kang-sheng won with 7 votes in the first round for "The Silent Record." Tseng Ching-hua from "Our Family Matters" was close behind. The jury praised Tseng Ching-hua for acting in Taiwanese, without his usual commercial or idol image. He also controlled the comedy timing very well, which was different from his past performances.

Chang Chih-liang, the head of the jury and a director from Hong Kong, said in an interview that Taiwanese films and actors are very brave. They try new ways to tell stories and have improved a lot compared to the past. Especially the attempt in "Wave Breakers," which is rare among Hong Kong actors. He added, "I am not familiar with Taiwanese actors. Their faces are new to me. As an outsider, I think their performances are very natural."

**Taiwan's Wu Shih-yi Wins Bronze at Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament**

Taipei, July 5 (CNA) â€“ Taiwan's "Boxing Fairy" Wu Shih-yi lost 2-3 to Brazilian boxer Jucielen Romeu in the semifinals of the Women's 57kg category at the WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament today. She won a bronze medal. Her coach, Ko Wen-ming, said he saw great improvement in his student.

Wu Shih-yi, who won a bronze medal in the Women's 60kg boxing at the Paris Olympics, is still performing very well after moving to the 57kg category this year. She won a gold medal at the Strandja International Boxing Tournament in early March and a silver medal at the Thailand Open in May. She has adapted well to her new weight class.

This week, Wu Shih-yi competed in the WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Tournament, organized by the World Boxing Federation (WB), which offers world ranking points. She won two matches to reach the semifinals in the Women's 57kg category, guaranteeing at least a bronze medal. She was the last hope for Taiwan. Today, she faced the strong Brazilian boxer Jucielen Romeu. They had fought before in late March at the WB Cup Brazil Boxing Tournament, where Wu Shih-yi lost 1-4.

In today's rematch, Wu Shih-yi controlled the distance well in the first round and counter-attacked when needed. However, before the round ended, she was hit hard and even received a "standing count" from the referee. This put her behind after the first round. Even though she tried to attack more in the second and third rounds to catch up, she still lost 2-3 in the end and could not go to the gold medal match.

Compared to their match in March, coach Ko Wen-ming told CNA after the fight that Wu Shih-yi's performance was much better this time, especially in using her strategy. This was due to good scouting and discussing tactics before the match. "I am very happy with her performance this time, and I saw Shih-yi's improvement," he said. Ko Wen-ming believes that Wu Shih-yi has a physical advantage and good quality punches. However, she has not reached her "strongest form" yet because her focus is not consistent towards the end of each round. She needs to use sports science to slowly improve her concentration training. "She is getting better. Once she overcomes this, she will be an excellent boxer," he added.
