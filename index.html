            <p>To show appreciation for the soldiers, three big airlines in Taiwan offered free upgrades to business class for military personnel. Many large stores, supermarkets, and convenience stores also gave special deals like discounts on coffee or money off when you spend a certain amount. The General Association of Chinese Culture also held an event for the first time called "National Army Heroes, Thank You" to show their gratitude.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Health and Welfare Says Social Welfare Budget for Local Areas Not Cut, Despite Online Rumors</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 3rd (CNA) - Today, news spread on social media saying that the central government had cut NT$34.112 billion from local social welfare budgets. However, Deputy Minister Lu Chien-te of the Ministry of Health and Welfare explained that the money was not cut. Instead, social welfare funds that used to be given as special project grants are now part of the general grants to local governments.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te responded in writing this evening, saying that the social welfare grants for next year will stay the same. The central government will continue to give money to local areas through general grants. He explained that after changes to the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, the money was not removed. General grants still include money for social welfare. The money that was for specific social welfare projects is now included in the general grants. This is just a change in how the central government gives money to local governments.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te also explained that the system for giving money follows the principle of "fair distribution, not equal for everyone" from the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures. This means they will consider things like the number of people in an area, how well off it is financially, and its economic situation. The Social and Family Affairs Administration will give money based on the financial levels set by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, working together with local and central governments.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te stated that the central government will keep working closely with city and county governments. They will plan carefully how to use money for social welfare. This is to make sure that people who need help get the right support and assistance.</p>
            <p>Chou Tao-chun, the acting director of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Social and Family Affairs Administration, explained that central government grants can be divided into two types: general grants and project-based grants. Project-based grants are usually listed in the budget books of each government office. However, to match the changes made to the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, the project-based grants have been moved to the general grants. This is a change in how the budget is organized, not a cut in funding.</p>
            <p>Chou Tao-chun pointed out that some plans, like the plan to address the low birth rate, including childcare allowances and daycare subsidies, are now part of this change. Also, the amount of these grants changes each year based on changes in the population. Because the birth rate has gone down in recent years, the budget numbers have also been adjusted downwards, in addition to the money being moved.</p>
