Young people, known as Generation Z, are starting to buy old-style flip phones. This new trend is happening because many young adults want to spend less time looking at smartphone screens. They feel that too much time on social media and apps is bad for their mental health and focus.

Flip phones are simple and can only do basic things like calls and texts. They don't have internet browsing or many apps, which means people can't easily get distracted. Users say that switching to a flip phone helps them live more in the moment and enjoy real-life activities. They feel less pressure from social media and can concentrate better on their studies or work. This choice shows a growing desire among young people to disconnect from the digital world and find a healthier balance.

**AI Changes the Job Market: What Workers Need to Know**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on the world of work. Experts say that AI will change many jobs, and some jobs might even disappear completely. However, AI will also create new kinds of jobs that we don't even know about yet. This means that people need to learn new skills to be ready for the future.

Companies are starting to use AI for tasks that are repeated often, which can make work faster and more efficient. For workers, it's important to develop skills that AI cannot easily do, like creative thinking, solving complex problems, and working well with others. Learning how to use AI tools is also becoming very important. Staying updated with new technologies and continuing to learn throughout your career will help people succeed in this changing job market.

**Popular European Cities Struggle with Too Many Tourists**

As summer gets closer, many well-known cities in Europe are facing a problem called "over-tourism." This happens when too many visitors come to a place at the same time, making it difficult for both tourists and local residents. Famous places like Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona are seeing huge crowds, which can make the experience less enjoyable.

The large number of visitors can cause several issues. Historical sites and natural areas can get damaged, prices for daily life (like food and housing) can go up for local people, and the cities become very crowded. In response, some cities are trying to find solutions. They are introducing new rules, limiting how many people can visit certain areas, or charging higher taxes for tourists. The goal is to find a balance where tourism can continue to grow, but in a way that is good for the environment and the people who live there.
