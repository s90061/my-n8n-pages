            <h1>Typhoon Kagasa Stops Sea and Air Travel; Penghu Arranges Extra Flights to Taipei for September 23rd</h1>
            <p>Penghu County, September 22nd (CNA) - Typhoon Kagasa is coming closer. Because of this, all flights and boats between Taiwan and Penghu were canceled today. The Penghu County Government worked with Mandarin Airlines. They arranged one extra flight to Taipei for tomorrow, September 23rd. This is to help people who are stuck in Penghu. For flights to Kaohsiung, they will decide tomorrow based on how many people are waiting for a spot.</p>
            <p>The Penghu Airport said that due to Typhoon Kagasa, all domestic air travel stopped after noon today. A total of 29 flights were canceled. About 1,800 people who had booked tickets were affected.</p>
            <p>The Penghu Airport also said that all flights and boats between Taiwan and Penghu will start running normally again on September 23rd. Currently, about half of the seats on flights are booked. People who are stuck because of the typhoon should be able to get on other flights if there are empty seats.</p>
            <p>However, more than 100 people are waiting for seats on flights to Taipei. So, in the evening, the Penghu County Government asked Mandarin Airlines to add two extra flights between Taipei and Penghu on September 23rd. These flights will depart at 9:45 AM and 11:35 AM. You can now book tickets on their website. For flights to Kaohsiung, they will check the number of people waiting tomorrow and then decide what to do.</p>

            <h1>Warren Buffett Sells All BYD Shares After 17 Years; Stock Price Grew by 3890%</h1>
            <p>New York, September 22nd (CNA) - Berkshire Hathaway, the investment company of American investor Warren Buffett, has now sold all its shares in the Chinese electric car company BYD. Berkshire Hathaway owned shares in BYD for 17 years, and during that time, BYD's stock price went up by 3890%.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a business news channel in the US, reported that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway bought 225 million BYD shares on the Hong Kong stock market in 2008. They paid 230 million US dollars. At that time, this was about 10% of all BYD's shares. Charlie Munger, who was the vice chairman then, strongly suggested this investment.</p>
            <p>Berkshire Hathaway started selling its BYD shares in August 2022. By June last year, they had sold almost 76% of their shares. Their ownership went down to less than 5% of BYD's available shares. Li Yunfei, the general manager of BYD's brand and public relations, also confirmed this today on Weibo, a Chinese social media site.</p>
            <p>Li Yunfei also wrote, "In stock investing, buying and selling is very normal!" He also thanked Munger and Buffett for believing in BYD, and for their investment, help, and support over the past 17 years. Munger passed away at the end of November 2023.</p>
            <p>CNBC pointed out that during the years Berkshire Hathaway held BYD shares, the stock price increased by about 3890%.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, the financial report for the first quarter of this year from "Berkshire Hathaway Energy," a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway that held the BYD shares, showed that the value of this investment was zero by March 31st.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Berkshire Hathaway also confirmed that all BYD shares have indeed been sold.</p>
            <p>Buffett has not fully explained why Berkshire Hathaway started selling its BYD shares. But he told CNBC in 2023 that BYD is a "special company" run by "special people." However, he also said, "I think we will find a better way to use this money."</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Ban-Shu Social Housing Project Canceled; National Land Management Agency Says 5% Land Will Be Used for Social Housing in Flood Control Area</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 22nd (CNA) - News reports said that a planned social housing project in New Taipei City, located where Banqiao and Shulin meet, has been canceled. This is because a lot of construction waste was found underground at the building site. Today, the National Land Management Agency confirmed this. They also said that these two land areas will become part of the Shulin Flood Control Phase 3 development project. In this new project, 5% of the land will still be saved for building social housing, as required by law.</p>
            <p>Media reports stated that the National Land Management Agency originally wanted to build social housing on two pieces of government land. These lands were in the Shulin Flood Control Phase 3 development area, between Banqiao and Shulin. However, after drilling, they found a lot of old construction waste buried in the ground. They decided it would be very expensive and take too long to remove the waste. Also, they were not sure how long it would take. Because of these reasons, they asked the New Taipei City Urban Planning Committee to cancel the project.</p>
            <p>Today, the National Land Management Agency of the Ministry of Interior announced in a press release that the two sites, named "Banqiao-4" and "Banqiao-19," have buried waste. They decided that dealing with the waste would make it impossible to build the social housing on time. So, on August 22nd this year, the New Taipei City Urban Planning Committee agreed to cancel the project.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency said that these two land areas will be included in the Shulin Flood Control Phase 3 overall development area in the future. In this development, 5% of the land will still be used first for social housing, as the rules state.</p>
            <p>The agency also noted that the central government has already built 9 social housing complexes in the Banqiao and Shulin areas of New Taipei City, with a total of 1341 homes. They will continue to look for more land from government and state-owned companies. They will also use other methods to get land for social housing, like setting aside land in new development areas, or through urban renewal projects. This is to help people find places to live.</p>
