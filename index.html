            <h1>Study Shows Air Pollution in US and Canada is Getting Worse Because of Wildfires</h1>
            <p>A study released today says that air pollution around the world is getting worse. It is especially bad in the United States and Canada. This is because big wildfires, caused by climate change, are making all the hard work to clean the air over many years useless.</p>
            <p>The "Air Quality Life Index" report looks at how much small pollution particles are in the air. It uses information from satellites since 1998. The report changes these pollution levels into how many years people might lose from their lives.</p>
            <p>Michael Greenstone, an economics professor and one of the report's creators, said that small pollution particles are the biggest danger to human health on Earth. He said it is worse than smoking, not eating enough food for children and mothers, car accidents, or HIV/AIDS. He added that it causes more harm than anything else.</p>
            <p>The report shows that in 2023, big wildfires in Canada caused the amount of small pollution particles to go up by more than 50% compared to 2022. In the United States, these particles went up by 20%.</p>
            <p>This problem will likely continue. Human activities cause more heat and dry weather, which leads to more wildfires in both countries.</p>
            <p>The year 2025 has been the second-worst year for wildfires in Canada's history.</p>
            <p>Greenstone said he was very surprised that air pollution, which they thought was gone, is now back like a "zombie" in some parts of the world, like Canada, the US, and even parts of Europe.</p>
            <p>In the US, the areas with the worst air pollution used to be mostly in California. But now, the problem is moving to states that are getting smoke from Canadian wildfires. These include Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, as well as areas further south.</p>
            <p>More than half of Canadians are now breathing air that has more small pollution particles than the country's yearly limit. This is a big change from five years ago when less than 5% of people did.</p>
            <p>The worst places are the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and Alberta. In these areas, the air pollution is as bad as in countries like Bolivia and Honduras. This means people there might live two years less, on average.</p>

            <h1>Four Workers Taken to Hospital After Gas Leak at Micron Factory in Taichung</h1>
            <p>Today, an unknown gas leaked from the Micron factory in Houli, Taichung. The Taichung City Fire Bureau said it looked like a white gas that leaked during the making of products. Four workers breathed in the gas and felt sick, throwing up. But they were awake and ambulances took them to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The Fire Bureau got a call about the gas leak at 3:25 PM in Section 4, Sanfeng Road, Houli District. They quickly sent seven fire trucks and eighteen firefighters to help.</p>
            <p>The Fire Bureau said that people were throwing up because of the gas leak. They believe it was a white gas, or waste gas, that came from the factory's work. Four people felt bad after breathing it and were taken to the hospital. Also, eight other people went to the hospital on their own. The leak was stopped at 4:29 PM.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan to Practice for a Big Tsunami in Yilan on National Disaster Prevention Day; National Alert on September 19</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Interior announced that for National Disaster Prevention Day, Taiwan will practice for a very strong earthquake, measuring 8.5, and a tsunami. This will happen because of a fake earthquake in the Ryukyu Trench. Starting on September 17, there will be emergency drills in Yilan County and New Taipei City. These drills will focus on rescuing people after a big earthquake and tsunami. At 9:21 AM on September 19, a "national alert" message will be sent to everyone.</p>
            <p>At a press conference today, Deputy Minister Ma Shih-yuan said that this year's National Disaster Prevention Day has the theme "Survive Big Earthquakes, Prepare Well." The main drill will be in Yilan from September 17 to 19. It will pretend that an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in the Ryukyu Trench causes a tsunami. Another drill will take place in New Taipei City's Xinzhuang Sports Park on September 18 and 19. This drill will practice how to get many people to help after an earthquake. The goal is to check how well rescue teams can work and to make Taiwan better at handling disasters.</p>
            <p>Ma Shih-yuan explained that the Ministry of Interior will bring together rescue teams from different cities, along with private groups and international helpers. They will all work together in the big earthquake and tsunami rescue drill. They will also use warning systems. This will show how well the government and people can work together to help themselves and each other in a real situation. It also shows that everyone wants to build a strong society.</p>
            <p>Ma Shih-yuan reminded people that on September 19 at 9:21 AM, they will get a "national alert" message from the Central Weather Administration. He asked everyone to practice the three steps to stay safe during an earthquake: "Drop, Cover, Hold On." Also, at 9:30 AM on the same day, a tsunami warning will be sent through special phone messages and air raid sirens. From 10:59 AM to 11:01 AM, all TV channels will automatically show the Public Television Service channel. This channel will broadcast disaster information to help people learn what to do in an emergency.</p>
            <p>Feng Chun-yi, the Deputy Director of the Fire Agency, said that as part of the government's National Disaster Prevention Day activities, many different drills for preventing and dealing with disasters will happen from September 1 to October 31. For example, on September 2 at 10:30 AM, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the Council of Indigenous Peoples will start the National Disaster Prevention Day events with a press conference at Taipei Main Station.</p>
            <p>He also said there will be other ways to teach people about disaster safety. These include "disaster prevention areas in stores and on online shopping sites," "an online practice for earthquake safety for everyone," and "an online quiz about disaster knowledge for everyone." These will be promoted in many ways to encourage people to take part.</p>
