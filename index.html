            <h1>Vietnamese Young Woman Helps Six Poor Children, Continuing a Cycle of Love</h1>
            <p>In Hue, Vietnam, a young woman named Ngo Thi Thien used to go to school hungry as a child. Her family sometimes had no food. She received help from the Zhi Shan Foundation, which helped her escape poverty. Now, she is helping six poor children in the same way, making sure love continues. She was once a child who received help, and now she is an adult who helps others. She wants to support the dreams of more children.</p>
            <p>One day in early October, Ngo Thi Thien visited a simple, unfinished house. The walls were not painted, and the windows had no bars. This was the home of Phan Thi Quynh Tram, a junior high school student she helps, and her family. It was their first time meeting.</p>
            <p>Ngo Thi Thien wore a white suit and a small round hat. She looked very elegant. It was hard to imagine she came from a difficult and poor family. Her parents separated when she was young. Her mother sold fish at the market, earning little money to raise Ngo Thi Thien, her older brother, and older sister. When they had money problems, they sometimes had no food, and she had to go to school hungry.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Ngo Thi Thien was more thoughtful than other children her age. She knew that studying was her only chance to have a better life. She worked hard and was very talented. After she finished school, she found a stable job at a big company in Vietnam. She earns about 1450 US dollars a month (around 44,000 New Taiwan Dollars). She successfully changed her life.</p>
            <p>Since 1998, the Zhi Shan Foundation has run a program to help poor students in central Vietnam. It gives money for school and books to smart students. Ngo Thi Thien received help from the foundation from junior high school until she finished university. From 2021, she changed from someone who received help to someone who helps others. She has adopted six children, supporting them to finish their studies.</p>
            <p>Quynh Tram is one of the six children Ngo Thi Thien helps. Quynh Tram's father died in 2016 from a stroke caused by working too hard. Her family now includes only her, her mother, her older sister, and her younger brother. To earn money, her mother used to weave hats. But because her eyesight is not good, she cannot do it anymore. Now, the whole family makes paper offerings to earn money. Their income for three days is only about 150 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Her father's sudden death greatly affected Quynh Tram. She knows her family has problems and her mother works hard. So, she always studies by herself, helps with housework, and takes care of her brother. She also dreams of becoming a doctor, hoping to make her family's life better.</p>
            <p>Seeing how thoughtful Quynh Tram was, her mother started to cry. She said her biggest wish is "for my children to be able to go to school normally."</p>
            <p>Meeting Quynh Tram for the first time made Ngo Thi Thien remember her own childhood. She felt "very sad." She also shared why she decided to help children. She wants children like Quynh Tram, who come from poor families, to see that "studying hard will help you overcome difficulties and make your dreams come true." She made a promise with Quynh Tram, saying, "You must study hard."</p>
            <p>Hoang Trong Si, the head of the Zhi Shan Foundation's office in Vietnam, said that central Vietnam is not well-developed. Many poor children have to help with housework or work, so they cannot focus on studying and stop going to school. The foundation's program hopes to help good students continue their education. Through education, they can break free from the cycle of poverty.</p>
            <p>Ngo Thi Thien also shared that when she first finished university, she felt she was not capable enough to adopt children. But one day, she saw an advertisement that said, "Start helping others now, or never help." This made her think deeply. So, she immediately contacted the foundation and adopted four children at once.</p>
            <p>Today, Ngo Thi Thien is only 30 years old, but she has already adopted six children. She says she wants to adopt more and help more children achieve their dreams.</p>
            <p>Since 1998, the Zhi Shan Foundation has been running a "Student Aid for Poor Children" program in Vietnam. It helps good students from poor families not to drop out of school because of their family's financial situation. So far, it has helped over 10,000 children achieve their dreams.</p>

            <h1>Musical "Ximending No. 1" Responds to Recent Events and Honors the "Shovel Man"</h1>
            <p>The musical "Ximending No. 1" by the National Creative Theatre is showing for its fifth run. This time, singer Fang Yu-hsin has joined the cast. The show also includes a touching story about the "Shovel Man" from Guangfu Township. This part of the musical honors Taiwanese people who love their hometowns.</p>
            <p>The musical "Ximending No. 1" tells 100 years of history about the Ximen Red House in just 90 minutes. It mixes many types of performances, like sumo, geisha dances, traditional songs and dances, silent film narrators, old-fashioned star shows, small theater acts, and classic musical numbers. It flows smoothly, is lively, and feels very Taiwanese.</p>
            <p>Director Hsieh Nien-tzu said in a press release from the National Creative Theatre that this performance adds two new parts that connect to current events. One part is based on the moving story of the "Shovel Man" from Guangfu Township. The other part is a song made from questions asked by Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Wang Shih-chien.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Nien-tzu said that the "Shovel Man" showed everyone the most beautiful side of Taiwan. The musical "Ximending No. 1" is already about Taiwan's stories, so it was important to add this heartwarming part. He wants to honor these kind-hearted heroes.</p>
            <p>Regarding Wang Shih-chien's questions becoming a popular song called "Worthless," Hsieh Nien-tzu said this part is both funny and interesting. He added that the National Creative Theatre is known for including current events, so they could not miss this opportunity.</p>
            <p>The actors include Fang Yu-hsin, Tsai Tsan-te, Joelle Lu, Wu Yi-pei, Kang Yin-yin, Mu Xing (Lin Mu-hsin), and Lin Bin. They will all play many different roles. Fang Yu-hsin, who is new to the cast, said she enjoyed watching "Ximending No. 1" before because it was fun and good. She said, "When the director invited me, I immediately said yes. I didn't expect rehearsals to be so tiring. But even though it's tiring, I feel like I'm really enjoying performing."</p>
            <p>The National Creative Theatre's musical "Ximending No. 1" will be performed from now until October 19th. It will take place at the Ximen Red House on the second floor theater.</p>

            <h1>UN Security Council Worries as US-Venezuela Tensions Grow</h1>
            <p>Today, many countries in the United Nations Security Council showed their concern about the growing tension between the United States and Venezuela. Russia even said that Washington used a "shoot first, ask questions later" approach by attacking ships thought to be carrying drugs.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Russia's Ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, spoke at a meeting of the 15-member Security Council. He said that Venezuela has good reasons to believe the US is ready to move from threats to real actions.</p>
            <p>US allies like France, Greece, and Denmark also asked for the situation to calm down. They want both sides to talk to each other to solve the problems. They also asked that international laws be followed.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, the US has attacked several ships near Venezuela's coast. These ships were believed to be carrying drugs. The US President Trump's government had said it was fighting drug groups. These attacks made some members of the US Democratic Party in Congress worried. They questioned if the attacks were legal, especially as President Trump was using more presidential powers.</p>
            <p>John Kelly, the US representative at the meeting, said that Washington "will keep acting strongly to protect our country from the threat of drug terrorists."</p>
            <p>Nebenzia said that Russia does not agree with these attacks. He said they are a serious break of international law and human rights. He stated that "shooting at ships with people on them in international waters without a trial or investigation" is like "acting on a 'shoot first, ask questions later' cowboy rule."</p>
            <p>He added, "And now they expect us to believe that there were criminals on board after the fact."</p>
            <p>Venezuela's Ambassador to the UN, Samuel Moncada, said at the meeting that because of US military movements in the area and Washington's "warlike words and actions," Venezuela "is facing a situation where it can reasonably expect an armed attack soon."</p>
            <p>Ricardo Moscoso, Panama's Deputy Ambassador to the UN, said Panama agrees that there are real worries about illegal activities like drug smuggling and piracy in the region's waters. He said, "We believe that these problems can be solved not only with military actions but also with planned and ongoing strategies."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Panama believes that the international threats in our region need countries to work together. This must be based on respecting international law and a shared promise to keep peace and stability in this part of the world."</p>
            <p>Jay Dharmadhikari, France's Deputy Representative to the UN, said that France supports countries working together to stop smuggling and improve border control. But he also said these actions must follow international law, including human rights law. He stated, "In this situation, countries must avoid any military actions on their own."</p>
