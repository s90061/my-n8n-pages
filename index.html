The US government plans to stop companies like Nvidia from sending special computer chips, called AI chips, to Malaysia and Thailand. This is because they believe these chips might then be sent to China illegally. The US has already stopped selling advanced AI chips directly to China.

Bloomberg reported that the US Commerce Department is working on a new rule. This rule aims to prevent China from getting these important parts through companies in these two Southeast Asian countries. The new rule is not yet final and could change.

Officials want to connect these rules for Malaysia and Thailand with bigger global rules about AI. These bigger rules were first suggested by the previous US government. Some other countries and tech companies like Nvidia did not like those old rules. The US will continue its existing rules from 2022 and 2023, which limit semiconductor sales to China and other countries to prevent smuggling.

**Two People Detained for Threatening Prosecutor**

A court in Taipei has decided to hold two people, Dai Ruey-ning and Lin Hui-chu, in jail. They cannot have visitors. They are accused of threatening a prosecutor who is working on a special case called the Jinghua City case. They are also accused of using the prosecutor's private information illegally. The court thinks they might hide evidence or talk to other people if they are not held.

This case started when someone posted the prosecutor's name, picture, and a frightening image on social media. The posts also included threatening messages, which made many people worried. The police began to investigate on July 3rd.

They found that a 39-year-old IT engineer, Dai Ruey-ning, who runs a Facebook page, was involved. He was questioned by the police. Later, the police also found Lin Hui-chu and her boyfriend. Lin is thought to have changed the threatening picture and shared it online. Lin was also arrested, but her boyfriend was let go because there wasn't enough proof against him.
