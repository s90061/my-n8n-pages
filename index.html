            <h1>Taipei Gets Most Money in 2026, New Taipei Gets Least Per Person</h1>
            <p>The central government has announced how much money will be given to local governments in 2026. This money is very important for local areas. Almost all cities and counties, except Lienchiang County (Matsu), will get more money. The total amount is NT$848.82 billion, which is a new high. It is 90.2% more than last year.</p>
            <p>Taipei City will receive the most money, over NT$114.92 billion. This means NT$46,000 for each person. New Taipei City, which has the most people, will get the least per person, less than NT$24,000. Lienchiang County will get less money than last year, but the Ministry of Finance will give it extra money to make up the difference. It will receive about NT$720 million in total, which is NT$53,259 for each person.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and Japan Ruling Parties Hold Important Meeting in Taipei</h1>
            <p>Taiwan and Japan's ruling parties will hold a "2+2" meeting today in Taipei. This meeting includes lawmakers from both sides who focus on foreign policy and defense. For the first time, there will be a bigger meeting afterward with leaders from Japan's Liberal Democratic Party's "Taiwan Policy Review Task Force."</p>
            <p>From Japan, Mr. Hoshino Takeshi, who leads the LDP's Foreign Affairs Department, and Mr. Iwata Kazuchika, who leads the LDP's Defense Department, will attend. In the meeting, they will talk about China's growing military actions near Taiwan and the safety situation in the Indo-Pacific area, including the Taiwan Strait. They will also discuss how Taiwan and Japan can work together to make communication networks stronger. This is because there have been cases where undersea internet cables near Taiwan might have been damaged by China.</p>
            <p>Taiwan and Japan do not have official diplomatic relations. This means they don't have regular ways to talk about their policies. So, these "2+2" meetings between lawmakers from the ruling parties are important. They help the two sides find common ideas and plan their policies. This is the first "2+2" meeting since Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru's government started late last year. The last meeting was held in Tokyo in August last year.</p>

            <h1>Dr. Chen Chao-long: The "Father of Liver Transplants in Asia"</h1>
            <p>Taiwan was once called the "Island of Liver Disease." For patients with very bad liver problems, a liver transplant was the only way to save their lives. Dr. Chen Chao-long, who is an honored director at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, was the first to do liver transplants in Taiwan. He successfully performed Asia's first liver transplant surgery and is known as the "Father of Liver Transplants in Asia."</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen studied at Kaohsiung Medical College. When he was a new doctor at Keelung Chang Gung Hospital, he drew pictures for a textbook about liver surgery for Professor Lin Tien-yu from National Taiwan University. This made him interested in liver transplants. Later, he went to study abroad and met Dr. Thomas Starzl, a famous expert in liver transplants in the United States, and became his helpful assistant. Even though Dr. Chen was asked to stay in the United States, he decided to come back to Taiwan to bring his knowledge and skills to his home country.</p>
            <p>Starting something new is always hard. Dr. Chen worked hard to make liver transplants happen. To make his hands more skilled, he even practiced tying 200 knots every day. On March 22, 1984, Dr. Chen performed a very long surgery, 32 hours, on a woman named Lin A-yan who had a liver coma. This was Taiwan's first liver transplant using a liver from a person who was brain-dead. It was also the very first liver transplant in all of Asia.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen also helped change important rules. In 1987, he helped Taiwan become the first country in Asia to make a law about organ donation from brain-dead people. This was 10 to 12 years before Japan and South Korea did the same. Dr. Chen knew that there were not enough organs for transplant. So, he worked hard to research liver transplants from living donors. His team at Kaohsiung Chang Gung has now done over 2,500 such surgeries. They hold a world record for living-donor liver transplants, with more than 90% of patients still alive after 5 years.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Dr. Chen received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the International Liver Transplantation Society (ILTS). He was the first Chinese person to ever get this award. Japanese doctors have praised his amazing surgical skills, saying they are at "the limits of human ability." His life story has also been made into a Japanese comic book called "Shine, Scalpel!", and also a novel, a movie, and a Japanese TV show called "The Lone Scalpel."</p>
