**Sou Fujimoto's First Big Art Show Features Small "Grand Roof Ring" Model**

Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto is having his first big art show at the Mori Art Museum. It shows his building designs and his life story. You can also see a small model, 4 meters tall, of the "Grand Roof Ring" for the 2025 Osaka World Expo. This way, people can see it even if they can't go to the Expo.

Sou Fujimoto was born in 1971 in Hokkaido. He has offices in Tokyo, Paris, and Shenzhen. He has designed many buildings like homes, universities, shops, and hotels. He also designed a famous building for the Osaka World Expo called "The Grand Roof Ring."

The exhibition, called "Sou Fujimoto: Futures of the Origin of Architecture," runs from July 2 to November 9. It shows his main projects from the last 30 years. Fujimoto says the show is inspired by the forests of his home, Hokkaido. He believes places like forests can hold many different things, which is why he used the word "Mori" (forest) in the title.
