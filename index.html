US President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Sean Duffy, the current Transportation Secretary, will become the temporary head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Trump praised Duffy for his efforts to improve the US air traffic control system. He wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that Duffy will be a great leader for NASA, even if his time there is short.

This decision comes after Trump withdrew his earlier choice for NASA chief, Jared Isaacman. Isaacman is a rich businessman and a friend of Elon Musk, who owns SpaceX. Isaacman had led the first private spacewalk in history.

**European Court of Human Rights: Russia Is Responsible for Human Rights Issues and MH17 Plane Crash**

On Wednesday, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) ruled that Russia has violated human rights. The court stated that Russia is responsible for supporting groups in eastern Ukraine since 2014, for shooting down flight MH17 in 2014, and for its full invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

This ruling is mainly symbolic because Russia left the Council of Europe in February 2022 and is no longer part of the European human rights agreement. However, the court still handles cases filed before that time.

The court, made up of 17 judges, found Russia guilty of several actions. These include killing civilians and Ukrainian soldiers outside of battle, torturing people, forcing them to work, illegally holding civilians, and stealing property. The judges also said Russia illegally moved Ukrainian children to Russia and allowed them to be adopted there.

The ruling was for four cases. Three were brought by Ukraine, covering events from 2014 to 2022, including the conflict in eastern Ukraine that killed about 14,000 people. The fourth case was from the Netherlands, about the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. On July 17, 2014, this plane, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur, was shot down by a Russian-made missile over eastern Ukraine, which was controlled by pro-Russian groups. All 298 people on board died, including 196 Dutch citizens.

Both Ukraine and the Netherlands welcomed the decision, calling it an important step towards justice.

**Japan Will Require Residence Certificates for Foreign Driver's License Conversions, Stopping Tourists from Getting Licenses**

Following several accidents involving foreign drivers, Japan is changing its rules for converting foreign driver's licenses. The Japanese National Police Agency announced new plans today. In the future, people who want to convert their foreign license to a Japanese one must provide a copy of their "juminhyo," which is a certificate proving their residence. This will largely prevent foreign tourists from getting Japanese driving licenses. Also, the written test will change from 10 true/false questions to 50 questions, and people must get at least 90% correct. These new rules could start as early as October 1st.

Many foreign visitors have used a system called "Gaimen Kirikae" to get a Japanese license. This system allowed them to get a license even if they were just tourists, without needing a long-term visa or a fixed address. This led to problems like hit-and-run incidents and driving on the wrong side of the road because foreign drivers were not familiar with Japanese traffic rules. For example, in May, a Chinese man hit elementary school students in Saitama Prefecture and left the scene, causing public anger.

After the new rules, all applicants, regardless of their nationality, will need to submit a copy of their "juminhyo." This means foreign tourists on short visits will not be able to convert their licenses. For Japanese citizens living overseas who are temporarily back in Japan, other documents like family registers can be used to confirm their address.

The written test will be much harder. Currently, it has 10 true/false questions with pictures, and you need to answer 7 correctly to pass. The new test will have 50 questions without pictures, and you will need to get 45 correct (90%) to pass. The test will still be offered in 20 languages.

In 2024, 68,623 foreigners converted their licenses in Japan, more than double the number in 2015. Most of these were from Vietnam, China, and South Korea. However, accidents involving foreigners also increased, reaching 7,286 in 2024.

People with Taiwanese driver's licenses can still drive in Japan without converting their license, thanks to an agreement between Taiwan and Japan. They just need their Taiwanese license and a Japanese translation. However, drivers from Taiwan should be careful because Taiwan drives on the right side of the road, while Japan drives on the left.
