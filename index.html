The reason given by the university during arbitration was that the scholar's resume stated "Taiwan, Republic of China," which the university found "unacceptable." They even demanded he change the wording. Despite the arbitration recognizing a short-term employment relationship, this incident highlights the political sensitivities surrounding Taiwan's official name in mainland China, impacting individuals' professional opportunities.

**Taiwan's Economic Future: Expert Predicts Continued US Tariff Waivers, Defying Trump's Pressure**

At the 8th "Business Today" magazine's "Taiwan's Grand Future International Summit," economist Hsieh Chin-ho boldly predicted that the 90-day tariff exemptions on certain goods from Taiwan, set to expire on July 9th, would be extended multiple times. He advised against being intimidated by former US President Trump's strong stance on tariffs, stating that ultimately, Trump would be the one to back down. This forecast suggests a continued period of trade relief for Taiwan, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions and the US strategy to encourage companies to move back. The discussion at the summit focused on navigating the complex global economic landscape.
