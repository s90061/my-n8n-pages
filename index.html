            <h1>Hsinchu County Yimin Creative Exhibition Starts: 12 Schools Show Painted Pig Art to Pass On Culture</h1>
            <p>Today, the "Good Luck Pig" Yimin Creative Exhibition opened in Hsinchu County. It shows painted pig artworks from 12 elementary schools. Deputy County Mayor Chen Chien-hsien was there and said he hopes this event will help children learn about the Yimin heroes' spirit of loyalty, respect, and justice. He also hopes it will help pass on traditional culture to younger generations.</p>
            <p>The 2025 National Yimin Festival is happening in Hsinchu County. The Hsinchu County Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau held a painted pig competition earlier. Twelve schools joined, and they submitted 208 artworks. Today, over one hundred small, creative, painted pigs are on display together. Their cute look has attracted many people.</p>
            <p>Chen Chien-hsien said that this year is the 237th anniversary of the Yimin Temple. Before the Yimin Festival, the county government is holding many events. Through the painted pigs, children can learn about the meaning and history of the Yimin Festival and keep the traditional culture alive.</p>
            <p>Chiu Hsing-wei, the Deputy Minister of the Hakka Affairs Council, explained that the Yimin Festival is a special Hakka culture. It shows the strong spirit of the Hakka people. The festival includes activities like offering food, showing sacred pigs, and floating water lanterns. The Hakka Affairs Council will keep supporting the Hsinchu Yimin Festival to help pass on Hakka culture.</p>
            <p>Cultural Affairs Bureau Director Chu Shu-min said that for this year's painted pig competition, the Cultural Affairs Bureau gave blank pig models. They asked elementary schools in the county to take them and create art. This helps to spread the Yimin Festival activities and its meaning.</p>

            <h1>China's Military Parade Shows Weapons; Experts Say It Hides Removal of High-Ranking Army Officials</h1>
            <p>Today, Chinese President Xi Jinping led China's biggest military parade ever. He warned the world that it must choose between peace and war. Experts say this parade made the world look at China's modern military weapons. But it also hid the problem of high-ranking army officials being removed from their jobs.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this big event was to remember 80 years since Japan lost in World War II. Most Western leaders did not come. But Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were guests. Western countries do not like them because of the war in Ukraine and their nuclear weapons plans.</p>
            <p>The parade was meant to show China's military power and how important it is in the world. At the same time, US President Donald Trump's taxes on goods and changing policies are causing more problems between his allies and opponents.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping spoke to more than 50,000 people in Tiananmen Square. He said, "Today, humanity again faces a choice: peace or war, talking or fighting, winning together or one side winning and one side losing." He also said that the Chinese people "firmly stand on the right side of history."</p>
            <p>Wen-Ti Sung, a researcher at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub in Washington D.C., said, "Xi Jinping believes the situation has changed. Now, China is taking the lead again."</p>
            <p>He added, "When we talk about the main things causing uncertainty in the world, it's Trump's way of doing things alone, not China's 'wolf warrior' diplomacy."</p>
            <p>In the past two years, more than ten generals in the Chinese army were removed because of a big anti-corruption effort. Many of them were close to Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Jon Czin, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution in the US, said, "This parade let Xi Jinping focus the world's attention on the big improvements in China's military weapons. At the same time, it hid the difficult problems that the Chinese army has, especially the continuous removal of high-ranking officials."</p>
            <p>CNN reported that today's parade sent a message. It showed that Xi Jinping's idea of a new world order, led by China, will be supported by advanced weapons. These weapons seem to be better than those of Beijing's rivals in many ways.</p>
            <p>CNN also pointed out that the huge amount of military equipment shown in the parade proves that China has the ability to make things. This can support what it says and might one day make Xi Jinping's world vision real.</p>
            <p>This ability to make things is what helped the US win World War II. But now, 80 years later, the US cannot produce weapons in large numbers like China can.</p>
            <p>Malcolm Davis, a senior defense strategy expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said, "What the Chinese are showing here is their ability to develop advanced military technology on their own. They can not only use it in real battles, but they can also do it faster than Western countries."</p>
            <p>He also said, "At the same time, China has many more weapons than other countries. This is truly worrying."</p>

            <h1>Airtac's August Sales Reach New High for the Period; Believes Tariffs Have Little Effect and Demand Slowly Returns</h1>
            <p>This afternoon, Airtac-KY, a company that makes air-powered parts, announced its own combined sales for August. The sales were NT$2.586 billion. This is 2.35% less than July but 5.92% more than August 2024. It is the lowest in six months, but still the highest for this time of year ever.</p>
            <p>Airtac-KY stated that tariffs (extra taxes on goods) still cause some delays in how customers decide to make more products. However, they expect that the overall market demand will slowly get better.</p>
            <p>Airtac-KY explained that in August, the value of new orders was still higher than the value of products sent out. This was better than the company expected. The average value of products sent out each day was also higher than in July and the same time last year. But because there were fewer working days, sales in August were lower than in July. Still, they grew well compared to August last year. In August, sales were better for the battery, car, and machine tool industries.</p>
            <p>From January to August this year, Airtac-KY's own sales reached NT$22.285 billion. This is 8.49% more than the same period last year.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to this year's business, Airtac-KY said that the Chinese government will continue to give support policies when needed. Also, the company will keep making new products, making its brand better, and creating sales plans for different industries to get more market share. In addition, sales in the second half of last year were lower, so it is easier to show growth now. Even though there are still unclear things in the world, Airtac-KY still has the same good outlook for this year as before.</p>
            <p>At an investor meeting at the end of July, Airtac-KY said that changes in exchange rates and tariffs would not affect them much. They expect that this year's sales of air-powered parts will grow more than the average in the industry. The company plans for overall sales to grow by a low double-digit percentage (about 11% to 13%).</p>
