            <h1>Tsai Chi-chang Attends Eastern Leaders Lecture, Says Running Pro Baseball is Like Running a Department Store</h1>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang, the head of Taiwan's professional baseball league, spoke at the "Eastern Leaders Lecture" today. He shared his experiences, including Taiwan's team winning the World Baseball Premier12, and the league breaking attendance records. He said that running professional baseball today is no longer like running a "sports shop," but rather like running a "department store."</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang went to the "Eastern Leaders Lecture" today. The Taiwan Listed Companies Association organized it. The topic was "How to Build a Successful Industry - Chinese Professional Baseball Reaches the World's Peak." He shared his experiences with professional baseball and national teams with many business leaders. Tsai Chi-chang first talked about the World Baseball Premier12 tournament last November, where Taiwan's team won the world championship. But he stressed, "Professional baseball must be good for the national team to be good."</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang mentioned during his talk that this year is a new era for Chinese Professional Baseball. First, it has entered a "big salary era." Many players, like Chen Chieh-hsien, Chen Tzu-hao, and Chiang Kun-yu, have signed contracts worth over NT$100 million. Also, Tsai Chi-chang said that the total number of people attending games this year has gone over 3.73 million. For the first time, more than 10,000 people attended each game on average. This is a 34.99% increase from last year. The two All-Star games also had full stadiums, with a total of 80,000 people.</p>
            <p>He remembered that during the worst time for professional baseball, there were more players, coaches, and staff than fans. "It was once very successful, and then it was very bad. At that time, companies supported baseball like it was charity." But Tsai Chi-chang emphasized that now, only by investing can professional baseball reach its peak again. If baseball is run like a business, not just charity, it can make more money.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang explained that the professional baseball market must grow bigger, and it needs to attract different kinds of customers (TA). He gave an example: in the past, professional baseball was like a sports shop. He said, "After I became the head, I wanted to make professional baseball like a department store. People who like sports go to sports shops, but everyone goes to department stores to buy things. So, the customer base will become wider. Only this way can the professional baseball market grow bigger, the industry become stronger, and good players can stay."</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang talked about "sports as a product" as one of his main points. Marketing is very important for this. This includes having good event experiences, design, and quality, and using popular topics and trends. Also, improving the stadium environment and making cheerleading more exciting are important.</p>

            <h1>Housing and Urban Development Bureau: 1,662 Social Housing Units Approved and Contracted by Q3 2025</h1>
            <p>The National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center announced today that by the end of last year, they had reached the goal of building 120,000 social housing units. This was part of former President Tsai Ing-wen's plan. This year, 10 new projects have been approved, which is a new achievement under President Lai Ching-te's time in office. By the end of September this year, these projects have been approved, and contracts for 1,662 units have been signed.</p>
            <p>Ko Mao-jung, the CEO of the National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center, held a press conference this morning. He stated that the center plays a key role in building social housing. By the end of last year, they had met former President Tsai Ing-wen's housing policy goal of "200,000 units in 8 years," specifically building 120,000 social housing units directly.</p>
            <p>Ko Mao-jung stressed that the 10 new projects with signed contracts this year are a new success under President Lai's "Million Rental Household Support Program." By the end of September this year, contracts for 1,662 units have been signed. About NT$41.9 billion was set aside for the budget this year. They have spent NT$29 billion, which is about 70%. They expect to spend all the money by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>Ko Mao-jung pointed out that more than 5,000 social housing units are expected to be finished next year. With other ways of getting housing, such as urban renewal and turning public buildings into homes, the number of social housing units will grow a lot. The National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center will keep working on building social housing. They hope to reach the goal of building 250,000 social housing units across Taiwan directly by 2032.</p>
            <p>The National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center added that the NT$29 billion spent from this year's NT$41.9 billion construction budget is for planning, design, and building costs for 166 social housing projects that have received contracts so far. This includes the 10 new projects with 1,662 units that got contracts this year. The remaining 30% of the money will continue to be used for future social housing projects.</p>
            <p>The National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center also noted that in 2025, there are still 6 projects with about 846 social housing units waiting for bids. These include 5 projects in Taipei City and 1 project in Taoyuan City.</p>

            <h1>President Marcos Orders Philippines to Resume E-Visas for Chinese Citizens in November</h1>
            <p>Today, the Philippine Embassy in China announced that starting in November 2025, it will offer electronic visas (e-visas) to Chinese citizens for trips of up to 14 days. This is to follow the president's order. The embassy stated that this will help improve cultural exchanges and increase trade and tourism. They also said it is an important step to celebrate 50 years of good relations between the Philippines and China. This announcement comes as conflicts between the Philippines and China continue in the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>After Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office in 2022, the arguments between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea became worse. The number of Chinese tourists visiting the Philippines dropped a lot. In August 2023, the Philippines tried to make it easier for Chinese citizens to get e-visas. But they stopped this after only three months. The reason given was problems with payment systems between the two countries.</p>
            <p>The Philippine Embassy in China said today that it will launch e-visas for Chinese citizens in November 2025. This aims to improve cultural exchange and boost trade and tourism.</p>
            <p>Jaime FlorCruz, the Philippine Ambassador to China, said, "I am happy to announce that the Philippine Embassy in Beijing and the consulates in Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Macau, Shanghai, and Xiamen will soon start giving Philippine e-visas to qualified people living in mainland China and its special regions. This will make the application process online, making it easier for people who want to visit the Philippines for a short time."</p>
            <p>The Philippines stated that Chinese citizens who want to visit the Philippines for tourism or business can apply for an e-visa. Their stay must be 14 days or less and cannot be extended. They must enter the Philippines through Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport or Mactan-Cebu International Airport.</p>
            <p>The Philippine Embassy in China said it will soon work with the Philippine Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and VFS Global in China. They will release more details about the e-visa, including the website and how to apply. Ambassador FlorCruz signed a document today with VFS Global. This document is "to follow the president's order."</p>
            <p>Ambassador FlorCruz said, "The start of the e-visa is happening at the right time." In July, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had joint talks about consular matters. These talks discussed "how important cultural exchanges are." This is also a main point for the Philippine Embassy this year as it celebrates 50 years of relations between the Philippines and China.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously announced that on July 22, 2025, the ninth round of consular talks between China and the Philippines happened in Beijing. Both sides discussed important topics like keeping citizens and groups safe and protecting their rights overseas, and making it easier for people to travel between the two countries. "China asked the Philippines to create a good environment for cultural exchange and business cooperation between the two sides."</p>
            <p>Finally, the Philippine Embassy in China stressed that China is still a main source of tourists. The e-visa was first started and tested in Manila in 2023. It is expected to make daily embassy work more effective and greatly improve public services.</p>
            <p>According to data from the Philippine Department of Tourism, 5.45 million people entered the Philippines in 2023. About 264,000 of these were from China, which is 4.8%. This is a drop of more than 70%. Before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, 1.74 million Chinese tourists visited the Philippines. This number was second only to South Korea.</p>
