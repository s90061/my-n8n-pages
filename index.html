On July 10, around 400 Russian drones and 18 missiles attacked Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, from many directions. This attack killed at least 2 people and injured more than 10. CNN reported that Russia's military tactics seem to have changed a lot.

This was the second night in a row that Ukraine was heavily attacked. CNN staff in Kyiv saw big explosions lighting up the night sky. Smoke and a burning smell filled the air, making it hard to see in the city center.

CNN said that Russia has increased its air attacks on Ukraine recently, and this attack shows a change in their tactics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is in Rome for a meeting, said on Telegram that Russia used 400 drones and 18 missiles, including 8 ballistic missiles and 6 cruise missiles. The report said that the drones and missiles flew at different heights and from all directions. Some drones even changed direction suddenly to fly towards Kyiv, making it harder for Ukraine's air defense system to cope.

**Credit Card Spending Down for 3rd Month in May, Expected to Rise in June Due to Tax Payments.**

On July 10, Taiwan's financial regulator announced that credit card spending in May was about NT$371.7 billion. This is about NT$1.55 billion less than April, marking the third month in a row that spending has fallen. The regulator explained that because of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday at the end of May, some spending will be recorded in June. Also, tax filing was delayed until the end of June, so credit card spending is expected to go up in June.

By the end of May, there were about 59.8 million credit cards in use, an increase of 410,000 from the month before. About 39.54 million cards were active, an increase of 120,000. Total spending in May was about NT$371.7 billion, which was NT$1.55 billion less than April and also less than May last year. However, from January to May this year, total spending was NT$1.8562 trillion, which is the highest for this period in history.

A spokesperson for the financial regulator said that the drop in May's credit card spending was mainly because of the Dragon Boat Festival holiday at the end of May, which pushed some spending to be recorded in June. Also, this year's tax filing was moved to the end of June, so its effect on spending will be seen in June. Looking at the banks, E.SUN Bank issued the most cards with 409,000. CTBC Bank was second with 78,000. Fubon Bank, Taishin Bank, and Cathay United Bank followed. Officials said E.SUN Bank is still replacing Carrefour co-branded cards, which will affect them until August. Cathay United Bank had the highest spending in May with NT$63.07 billion. CTBC Bank was second with NT$62.93 billion. Fubon Bank, E.SUN Bank, and Taishin Bank followed.

**WOOHOO, a Future Restaurant, Opens in Dubai with AI-Powered Menu and Service.**

Soon, food in Dubai restaurants might be like "computer code." A new restaurant called WOOHOO, which says it offers a "future dining experience," will open in September in downtown Dubai, very close to the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.

Reuters reported that at WOOHOO, human chefs still cook the food. But for everything else, like designing the menu, setting the mood, and providing service, an AI called "Chef Aiman" is in charge. "Aiman" is a mix of "AI" and "man." Ahmet Oytun Cakir, a co-founder of WOOHOO, said that this AI has learned from many years of food science research, data about how food is made, and over a thousand traditional recipes from all over the world.

The creators said that Chef Aiman cannot taste or smell food like a human chef. However, it can take apart and put back together flavors and ingredients, looking at things like texture, sourness, and umami, to create new and special dishes. Famous Dubai chef Reif Othman and his team will try the AI's first recipes and suggest changes. Aiman said in an interview, "Their feedback on my suggestions helps me understand how cooking works beyond just data." The creators also said that Aiman's goal is not to replace human chefs but to help them. Cakir, who is also the CEO of Gastronaut, said, "Human cooking will not be replaced, but we believe Aiman can improve cooking ideas and creativity."
