To deal with new drugs and smoking products spreading in schools, lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP), along with a Taipei City councilor, asked different government groups to create a plan to stop these problems. They said they will work with lawmakers from different parties to change laws. This will help stop these products from entering the country, control their sale, and prevent them in schools.

A KMT lawmaker said that the number of young people aged 12 to 17 involved in drug cases increased by 22.6% last year. Also, even after a new law about smoking started in March 2023, the number of middle and high school students using heated tobacco and flavored tobacco continued to be high or even increased.

Lawmakers also talked about problems with current drug tests, which only work 30% to 40% of the time. They asked the government to share information about how well different drug tests work and to buy better ones. They also want clear instructions for testing and new ways to prevent smoking. They believe that if laws and procedures are clear and strong, it can help stop drugs from spreading.

**Typhoon Hits Tainan Hard, Mayor Says Power Will Be Back Tonight and City Will Be Cleaned Up Quickly**

Typhoon Tapah caused two deaths and many power outages in Tainan. Mayor Huang Wei-che held a meeting today and said that power should be back on by tonight. He also asked for help from the army to clean up the city quickly.

The mayor said that rescue efforts are ongoing. For electricity, Taiwan Power Company has sent workers from northern and central Taiwan to help. The city's Public Works Bureau is also helping fix power poles. Some areas already have power again, and it is expected that all power will be back on by tonight.

The mayor stressed that the typhoon had very strong winds, up to 16-level. This caused many house roofs to be blown off and many trees to fall or lean. The city will work quickly to clean up the city, remove fallen trees, and make traffic flow smoothly again. He also reminded people to be careful when cleaning their homes to avoid being hit by signs or roofs that have blown off.

**One Dead, Two Hurt After Father and Daughters' Car Flips During Typhoon Night**

During the typhoon night, an 81-year-old man in Chiayi County was driving with his two daughters to check on their drink stand at a fishing spot. However, his car may have lost control and flipped over. The strong winds also made the situation worse. Sadly, the man's oldest daughter died, and the other two people were injured.

The police said that Typhoon Tapah landed in Chiayi County late last night with very strong winds, possibly over 14-level. The 81-year-old man and his 60-year-old and 58-year-old daughters were worried about their drink stand. So, around 1 AM, the father drove them to check on it.

Police said that the car was on a narrow road next to farms. The strong wind might have caused the car to flip into a farm field. Around 1:30 AM, someone saw the flipped car and called the police, who then called the fire department for help. The three people were rescued from the car and taken to the hospital. The man's oldest daughter had serious injuries and died at the hospital. The father and his 58-year-old daughter are still in the hospital. The police are still investigating to find out exactly what happened.
