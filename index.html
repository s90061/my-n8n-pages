            <h1>Trump Expected to Attend ASEAN Summit and See Thailand-Cambodia Truce Signed</h1>
            <p>Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Mohamad Hasan, said today that U.S. President Trump is expected to visit Malaysia on October 26. He will also be there to see Thailand and Cambodia sign a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Hasan explained that Malaysia and the U.S. will help Thailand and Cambodia stop fighting. As part of this agreement, both countries must remove all landmines and large weapons from their border.</p>
            <p>Leaders from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) will have a meeting from October 26 to 28. This meeting will take place in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.</p>
            <p>Hasan hopes that the peace agreement between Thailand and Cambodia will be signed during the ASEAN meeting.</p>
            <p>In July this year, Thailand and Cambodia had strong fights at their border. In just five days, at least 48 people died. Hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their homes because of this. It was the worst fighting between the two countries in over 10 years. The border between Thailand and Cambodia is 817 kilometers long, and some parts of it are still not clearly marked.</p>

            <h1>Over 100,000 Visitors in First Month at National Archives, Morris Chang's Documents a Highlight</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's first National Archives is in Linkou District, New Taipei City. It started a trial opening on September 2nd. In the first month, over 100,000 people visited it. The main exhibit, "Island Reads: Our Story," shows important records of how Taiwan's government helped high-tech industries grow. It also features a document from Morris Chang, the founder of TSMC, where he gave advice to the government.</p>
            <p>The National Archives has open spaces on floors 1 to 3. Floors 4 to 9 have special areas for keeping national records, electronic file services, and storage rooms for national archives.</p>
            <p>Also, on the second floor, there are a main exhibit hall and a special exhibit hall. The main exhibit is "Island Reads: Our Story." The special exhibit is called "Return to 1987: Martial Law Files." These exhibits use displays and technology to turn old documents into easy-to-understand stories. There is also a children's play area called "A Kai Jiang's House," a fun area for archives, and a gift shop and cafe.</p>
            <p>A special part of "Island Reads: Our Story" is about the Ten Major Construction Projects, which greatly helped Taiwan's economy. It also explains how Taiwan's government started developing high-tech industries in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
            <p>The Archives Bureau shows documents related to the "Industrial Technology Research Institute Establishment Act." It also has a report from Morris Chang to the Executive Yuan. In this report, he gave ideas for the future of Taiwan's electronics industry. In 1981, Morris Chang said that Taiwan's electronics industry grew fast because of low wages. But when this advantage disappeared, it was important for the industry to change from needing many workers to needing more technology.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the special exhibit "Return to 1987: Martial Law Files" shows the very important order to end martial law. Through videos and interactive displays, visitors can learn about life during that time.</p>
            <p>The National Archives began its trial opening on September 2nd. Many people have visited, and there has been a lot of talk about it on social media. Lin Chiu-yen, the director of the National Archives Administration, smiled and said that the number of visitors was much higher than expected. They also received many suggestions. They will work hard to make things better, like improving signs and tours. The official opening will be on November 22nd, which is the 25th anniversary of the Archives Bureau.</p>
            <p>The National Archives is at No. 1, Archives Museum Road, Linkou District, New Taipei City. It is open from Tuesday to Saturday, 9 AM to 5 PM (please check the official website for closing days). During opening hours, the museum provides a free shuttle bus between Taoyuan Metro A9 Linkou Station and the National Archives. Many bus routes, such as 858, 898, 936, 937, 945, and 946, also pass nearby. You can find more information about activities and transportation on the National Archives official website.</p>

            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: No Solar Panels in Reservoirs If Water Quality Cannot Be Managed</h1>
            <p>The cleaning of solar panels at Wushantou Reservoir has caused some concern. Premier Cho Jung-tai said today in the Legislative Yuan that the government has been checking the water quality of reservoirs with solar panels for a long time, and the water has not been affected. However, he also said that in the future, if the government cannot manage water quality problems related to solar panels well enough, they will not build new ones. They will only do so if they can fully control the technology.</p>
            <p>Recently, the floating solar panels at Wushantou Reservoir in Tainan have caused a lot of discussion. Today, the Legislative Yuan continued its general questions about government work. Legislator Huang Kuo-chang from the Taiwan People's Party asked about this issue. He looked at public information and found that besides Wushantou Reservoir and Fengshan Reservoir, other reservoirs like Yanshuipi, Jinhu, Neipuzi, and Agongdian also have solar panels. This has made people worry about their drinking water.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang pointed out that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) clarified on its official website that the solar panels at Wushantou are not toxic and will not pollute drinking water. But he wanted to ask if the government plans to keep putting solar panels in reservoirs or if they will stop.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai replied that developing different types of green energy is a very important government plan. He said that the government has checked the water quality of reservoirs with solar panels for a long time, and the water has not been affected. But in the future, if the government cannot handle problems with solar panels and water quality well enough, they will not build new ones. This is unless they can fully control the technology and safety checks.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang noted that in the past, before solar panels were installed, the law did not require an environmental assessment. This led to solar panels being placed on hillsides, protected areas, sea areas, and reservoirs. Currently, the Ministry of Environment is discussing whether to require environmental assessments. However, solar power companies are pushing forward. For example, one company mentioned in a meeting in August that they are planning the second phase of floating solar panels at Wushantou Reservoir. Huang asked if the government will allow this second phase to proceed.</p>
            <p>Minister of Economic Affairs Kung Ming-hsin said that the local government has not approved it, so this project is not happening right now.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang asked if an environmental assessment would be needed for solar panels placed in national scenic areas or sensitive areas, if they cover a certain size. Premier Cho Jung-tai said that vulnerable areas and scenic spots need government protection.</p>
