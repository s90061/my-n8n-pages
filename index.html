            <h1>Countries are fighting over Humanoid Robots; Taiwanese Companies are aiming for Key Parts</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Robot and Smart Automation Exhibition will take place from August 20th to 23rd. Artificial Intelligence (AI) humanoid robot uses will be a main topic at the show. Countries like China, the United States, Japan, the European Union, and South Korea are working hard to build robots. Taiwanese companies are trying to win business for important parts and pieces. Taiwanese companies are carefully hopeful about humanoid robots becoming widely used.</p>
            <p>Big technology companies like NVIDIA, Tesla, and Amazon, along with new AI robot companies such as 1X Technologies (funded by Open AI) and Figure, are actively creating humanoid robots. Also, Meta, Apple, Samsung, Hyundai, and LG want to be first in the humanoid robot market.</p>
            <p>Foxconn continues to work with NVIDIA to make humanoid robots. Foxconn recently said that they are developing brain technology and AI model training with NVIDIA. Foxconn is putting many humanoid robots to work in their smart AI factories. Foxconn keeps investing in automation and robots to make smart manufacturing better.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is planning a robot for desks, which might come out as early as 2027. Early this year, there were also rumors that Apple was working with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States to create the ARMOR humanoid robot.</p>
            <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in late July that the third version of the Optimus humanoid robot will be ready by the end of this year. He expects to start making Optimus in large numbers in 2026, with a goal of producing 1 million units per year within five years.</p>
            <p>Amazon has invested in the robot startup Agility Robotics. In May, Agility Robotics showed their Digit humanoid robot for warehouses and is still improving its design.</p>
            <p>Japan's Honda, the UK's Engineered Art, and the US's Boston Dynamics have been working on humanoid robots for a long time. New robot companies from Israel, Mentee Robotics, and Germany, NEURA Robotics, are also joining this area.</p>
            <p>Chinese companies like UBTECH, Unitree Robotics, Fourier Intelligence, Daru, Xiaomi, XPeng, Huawei, iFLYTEK, and Zhuiyuan are strongly entering the humanoid robot market.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that over 150 companies globally are making robots. China, the United States, and Japan are the top three countries, making up 65% of these companies together. Chinese companies make up about 37%, and their number has doubled in the last five years.</p>
            <p>When we look closely, the main software and hardware parts inside AI humanoid robots include AI chips, controllers, and AI software. These are for things like moving, controlling, and talking. There are also parts for movement like servo motor systems, linear guides, ball screws, harmonic reducers, planetary reducers, and servo couplings. Plus, there are sensors for things like cameras, position, pressure, force, touch, and sound, as well as important parts like batteries and microphones.</p>
            <p>In AI humanoid robots, joint modules are very important for the robot to move naturally and smoothly. These modules are made of motors, drivers, encoders, reducers, and sensors. People in the industry say that one humanoid robot needs 14 to 30 joint modules.</p>
            <p>Also, the robot's clever hands are made of small motors, drivers, encoders, small reducers, and sensors. One hand usually needs 6 joint modules, so a robot needs 12 modules for its two hands.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese companies are focusing on key modules and parts. This includes power systems, moving parts, chips, and sensors, which are already important for automated machines. Taiwanese companies already have a good base in these areas.</p>
            <p>Experts point out that in reducers, companies like Taiwan Chelic, U-Shin, Allied Precision, Jyun Hsing, and Li Ming are actively working. For screw transmission parts, there are Hiwin, U-SCREWS, and CPC. For control software and hardware, there are Nexcom, Delta, and Syntec. Teco and Hiwin are working on joint modules. For servo and drive motors, there are Moxa, Fukuta Electric, Teco, and Daido. For machine vision and sensing modules, there are Solomon, Adlink, Techman Robot, Largan, Altek, and Rate.</p>
            <p>Looking at how much joint modules cost for humanoid robots, industry people say that joint modules make up about 15% to 20% of Tesla's Optimus cost. For China's Unitree Robotics, they make up 40% to 50%.</p>
            <p>Industry experts say that Tesla spends more on the brain chip and software for its robots. Unitree Robotics might focus more on the robot's physical parts. If the control and sensing software gets better, the cost can go down a lot.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, the industry is carefully hopeful about humanoid robots becoming widely used. TSMC Chairman and CEO C. C. Wei said in mid-July that humanoid robots will not be a main driver of growth for the industry this year, and probably not in 2026 either. He expects that the first use of humanoid robots will likely be in healthcare.</p>
            <p>Wei analyzed that humanoid robots need not only a "brain" (computing processor) but also the integration of various sensors and software. Making humanoid robots is very complex. Also, since humanoid robots will work directly with humans, their design needs to be very careful.</p>
            <p>TM Robot COO John Huang from Quanta Group said that cost and intelligence level are key to humanoid robot development. Humanoid robots that move like humans need good sensors and AI technology. He expects that humanoid-like robots will start to show up in about 10 years.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Chelic General Manager Guo Chongzhe noted that the exact uses for humanoid robots are not yet clear, and the technology still needs to get better. Standards for parts also need to be defined. The widespread use of humanoid robots is still something to watch. </p>

            <h1>Japan's Osaka to Raise Accommodation Tax from September; Travel Writer Says Be Ready with Cash Upon Check-in</h1>
            <p>Osaka Prefecture in Japan announced that it will change its accommodation tax starting from September 1st. From that date, people staying at hotels that cost 5,000 Japanese Yen or more per person per night will pay an extra accommodation tax. This tax will be between 200 and 500 Japanese Yen. Travel writer 943 reminded travelers that this tax is usually collected in cash when you check in.</p>
            <p>Osaka Prefecture recently announced that from September 1st, the tax-free amount for accommodation tax will change from 7,000 Japanese Yen (about 1,429 New Taiwan Dollars) to 5,000 Japanese Yen (about 1,021 New Taiwan Dollars). Starting September 1st, if a person stays at a hotel costing between 5,000 Japanese Yen and 15,000 Japanese Yen (about 3,063 New Taiwan Dollars) per night, an extra 200 Japanese Yen (about 41 New Taiwan Dollars) accommodation tax will be added.</p>
            <p>For stays costing between 15,000 Japanese Yen (about 3,063 New Taiwan Dollars) and 20,000 Japanese Yen (about 4,083 New Taiwan Dollars), an extra 400 Japanese Yen (about 82 New Taiwan Dollars) accommodation tax will be added. If the stay costs 20,000 Japanese Yen (about 4,083 New Taiwan Dollars) or more, an extra 500 Japanese Yen (about 102 New Taiwan Dollars) accommodation tax will be added.</p>
            <p>Travel writer 943 said today that many tourist cities in Japan, including Tokyo, Kyoto, and Kanazawa, already have an accommodation tax.</p>
            <p>943 pointed out that many people book their rooms early, but the booking price does not include the accommodation tax. So, travelers going to Osaka from September will need to pay this tax in cash when they check in, if their stay falls under the tax rules. She advised travelers to always have Japanese Yen cash with them so they can pay the accommodation tax and check into their hotels without problems.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin's Meeting: No Agreement on Ukraine Ceasefire, Ukrainians Feel Upset and Angry</h1>
            <p>Today, people in Ukraine were angry and sad because the presidents of the United States and Russia did not agree on stopping the war in Ukraine during their meeting. Also, they were upset about how US President Trump welcomed Russian President Putin with great respect in Alaska.</p>
            <p>A 26-year-old soldier, who called himself Dzha, said: "He (Putin) won. Trump showed how he feels about him, and also about us. This meeting was not good for Ukraine... We must stop this war. We need to really sit down and talk to make a deal, because soldiers are dying or getting hurt every day."</p>
            <p>Some Ukrainians were angry that Trump invited Putin to visit the United States and treated him with so much respect, as if they were equal.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that a changed photo was shared online. It showed Trump and Putin shaking hands on an airport runway, with bombed-out houses in Ukraine in the background.</p>
            <p>Tetiana Vorobei, a retired person from Kyiv, said: "I don't know what Trump is thinking? I feel he is just like him (Putin). They are exactly the same!"</p>
