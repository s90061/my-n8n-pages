            <h1>Biden is Getting Treatment for Prostate Cancer</h1>
            <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden is now getting radiation and hormone therapy. This is to fight prostate cancer that doctors found in May this year.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Biden said, "President Biden is currently receiving radiation therapy and hormone therapy. This is part of his plan to treat prostate cancer."</p>
            <p>Biden's office announced in May that the 82-year-old former president went to the doctor because of problems with his urinary system. Doctors found a lump in his prostate. They then said he had aggressive prostate cancer, and the cancer had moved to his bones.</p>
            <p>At that time, Biden wrote on X, a social media site: "Cancer affects all of us. Like many of you, Jill and I have learned that people are strongest when they are going through tough times. Thank you for your love and support."</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society says that prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, especially older men. Studies guess that about 80% of men over 80 years old have cancer cells in their prostate.</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society also said that if doctors find prostate cancer early, it can often be cured. But it is still the second biggest cause of cancer death for men.</p>
            <p>Hormone therapy is a common way to treat it. It can make tumors smaller and slow down how fast the cancer grows, but it cannot cure it completely.</p>

            <h1>6.0 Earthquake Hits Off Southern Philippines, No Injuries Reported</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said that a 6.0-magnitude earthquake happened late tonight off the southern coast of the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that USGS data showed the earthquake was 59 kilometers deep. Its center was about 10 kilometers from Cagwait town in Surigao del Sur province.</p>
            <p>Local firefighters told AFP that no injuries or deaths have been reported so far after the earthquake.</p>
            <p>It is not clear yet if this 6.0-magnitude earthquake in Surigao del Sur is an aftershock. The day before, two strong earthquakes, one 6.7 and one 7.4, happened off the coast of Manay town in the Mindanao area. Those earlier earthquakes caused at least 8 deaths.</p>

            <h1>Soldier Accused of Giving Secrets to Chinese Spy, Charged with Corruption</h1>
            <p>A soldier named Tsai from the Navy's Hai Feng unit has been charged. He took money from a former soldier, Lin, who was removed from the military because of gambling. Tsai took photos of many manuals for Hsiung Feng II missiles. He then gave these photos to a Chinese spy through Lin. Tsai earned 38,000 New Taiwan Dollars for this. Tsai is charged with corruption, and Lin is charged under the National Security Act.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors' Office said that a spy from the People's Armed Police Force of Shanxi Province in China used fake names, "Chu Ting" and "Ti Ying." To hide her real job, she said she was a reporter for the Epoch Times in Hong Kong. In 2023, she met Lin, the former navy soldier, using a dating app.</p>
            <p>Lin talked with "Chu Ting" many times. He knew she was a spy sent by China or another country. Still, he introduced his fellow soldier, Tsai, to her. Lin asked Tsai to give military information. He told Tsai that the more secret the information was, the more money "Chu Ting" would pay him after checking it.</p>
            <p>Tsai knew that as a soldier, he should not give out military information. But he wanted the money. In May 2023, he filled out a form with his personal details, military unit, and job. He sent this to "Chu Ting" through Lin and received 8,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>In the same month, Tsai used his phone to take photos of the full "Deployment and Drill Handbook" and the missile vehicle's operation manual from a Hsiung Feng II missile launcher. He sent these outside the military. "Chu Ting" thought this information was useful for military intelligence. Tsai then got another 30,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors believe that Tsai, as a navy soldier, knew that Taiwan and China are in a military stand-off. He should not have shared information about his unit, official secrets, or sensitive military data that is not public with Chinese agents. He did this for his own benefit. This broke the Constitution, the National Defense Act, and the Military Service Act, which say soldiers must be " loyal to the Republic of China" and "keep military secrets." He took bribes and did not do his duty.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said that Tsai was trained by the military. His job was to operate Taiwan's own missiles to protect the sea. This is a very sensitive and important job. But he shared his personal military information and took photos of secret military weapon operation details. Even if the information was not top secret, it still harmed national security and military morale. It also damaged the good name and fighting spirit of soldiers.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors' Office charged Tsai with corruption for taking bribes and not doing his job. Lin was also arrested and charged under the National Security Act.</p>
