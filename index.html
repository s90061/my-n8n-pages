            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: Working on a New Finance Act for Fair Resources</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the government is working on changing the "Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures." He hopes that the responsibilities and money will be shared fairly between the central and local governments. He said that if local governments get more money, they should also take on more local tasks. The Premier will talk to local governments to create a complete plan.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan held a question-and-answer session about government policies. Before the session, Premier Cho talked to the media. He spoke about the government's plans for the finance act and when the new draft law would be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that the government wants to create a finance act that will work well for a long time. He also said that the government is listening to what finance experts, lawmakers from different parties, and other people think. But first, they need to fix some problems from a previous version of the act that the government had asked to reconsider.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun and financial departments have already talked with local governments many times. They will keep discussing how to divide responsibilities and share money fairly. He hopes that if local governments get more shared tax money, they will also take on more local tasks.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho added that they will try hard to talk with local governments and present a complete plan within the expected time. They will also try to include reasonable suggestions from lawmakers to push for the law's changes.</p>
            <p>The media asked about opposition parties being unhappy that the budget for next year (2026) does not include a pay raise for the military. The Premier said that if the Constitutional Court decides it is against the constitution, then the pay raise cannot be included or carried out. But if it is constitutional, the government will include the budget, carry it out, and it can be applied to past periods.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho noted that the Legislative Yuan is currently busy with policy questions, so there might not be enough time to discuss the budget bill for next year. However, he hopes to talk with Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu again and asked all political parties to discuss it well. He hopes they won't repeat past mistakes and will have more time to review and pass the 2026 central government budget bill soon.</p>

            <h1>Restaurant Business Slow in September, Expected to Grow in Q4</h1>
            <p>Restaurant companies had mixed results in September. Many brands saw lower sales compared to last year because the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday was in September last year. However, brands like Wangzao and Bafang Yunji had their best sales for the third quarter. Wowprime also had its second-best sales for a quarter. Companies generally think that sales will get better in the fourth quarter due to holidays in October and year-end parties.</p>
            <p>Wowprime Group's total sales in September were NT$1.75 billion, which is 2.09% less than last year. Their Taiwan businesses earned NT$1.44 billion, a 1.1% decrease, and their China businesses earned NT$310 million, a 6.41% decrease. If we look at sales in Chinese Yuan, the decrease was only 0.77%.</p>
            <p>Wowprime also announced that its total sales for the third quarter were NT$5.839 billion. This is a 1.5% increase from last year and a 6.55% increase from the previous quarter. It was their second-highest quarterly sales, just below the NT$5.95 billion they made in the first quarter of this year. Their total sales for the first nine months of the year were NT$17.2 billion, which is a new high for that period.</p>
            <p>Wowprime explained that September is usually a slow month for restaurants. Last year, the Mid-Autumn Festival was in September. This year, some areas had to close because of Typhoon Habagasa. So, Taiwan's sales in September were a little lower than last year. The company plans to open new stores in the fourth quarter. They are positive about October, which has three long holidays, adding up to 11 days. Also, the government's "NT$10,000 cash handout" might encourage people to spend more money.</p>
            <p>Thai Town Cuisine Group's sales in September were NT$456 million, down 8.65% from last year. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$4.617 billion, down 0.65% from last year. Thai Town Cuisine also said that fewer customers came in September because of fewer holidays. They expect sales in the fourth quarter to be better than before, which will help their yearly performance.</p>
            <p>Thai Town Cuisine also said that their three main brands will reopen at Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi at the end of the month, which will boost their business. Their first store in the U.S. is expected to open in Los Angeles in December 2025. Their global research and development center in Zhongli will start operating in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Hansheng Food's sales in September were NT$512 million, up 3.59% from the previous month but down 1.46% from last year. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$4.617 billion, up 4.31% from last year. Hansheng noted that even though some restaurants were opened or renovated, which meant slightly fewer business days, overall sales continued to rise.</p>
            <p>Hansheng Food is looking forward to the busy restaurant season in the fourth quarter. They said that in November this year, there will be many year-end and holiday gatherings. By the end of September, Kaohsiung Hansheng Grand Hotel and Hansheng Dome Banquet Hall had already taken bookings for almost 10,000 tables. The Nankang Hansheng Grand Hotel Banquet Hall is almost fully booked for the end of the year. Sales for the year-end party period at a single store are expected to go over NT$100 million. In September, the buffet brand "Daoyu" had sales of almost NT$100 million from its two stores.</p>
            <p>Wangzao's total sales in September were NT$156 million, a 43.47% increase from last year, helped by five new stores. Their total sales for the third quarter were NT$517 million, up 29.26% from the previous quarter and 45.88% from last year, reaching a new high for a single quarter. Their total sales for the first three quarters were NT$1.281 billion, a 24.69% increase from last year.</p>
            <p>Wangzao stated that this year, they bought 51% of Yangxin Catering Group and got the rights to operate the Japanese brand "Torisawa" and two direct stores in Taiwan. They will keep expanding their business to increase sales. Their total sales for the whole year are expected to grow by a double-digit percentage.</p>
            <p>Kanpai's total sales in September were NT$360 million, a 12.43% decrease from last year. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$3.364 billion, a 1.14% decrease from last year.</p>
            <p>Kanpai Group explained that September's sales were lower because the Mid-Autumn Festival was in a different month and there were fewer holidays, which made it harder to compare with last year. However, their hot pot brand "Kuromon" saw good results from opening new stores, with sales growing by over 50% compared to last year. Their retail business also showed good growth, increasing by almost 20%. Kanpai said that "Kuromon" opened in Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and Kaohsiung Hanshin Arena in October. Their barbecue brand also returned to Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi at the end of September, which will help increase sales.</p>
            <p>Bafang Yunji, a chain restaurant group, had total sales of NT$721 million in September, a 7.36% increase from last year, setting a new record for September sales. Their total sales for the third quarter were NT$2.202 billion, a 7.41% increase from last year, setting a new record for quarterly sales since they went public. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$6.488 billion, a 10.11% increase from last year, continuing to show double-digit growth.</p>
            <p>Bafang Yunji said that their record-breaking sales in the third quarter were mainly due to opening new stores and introducing new products with high profits. In terms of expanding their sales channels, Bafang Yunji entered online e-commerce for the first time, which will further boost sales.</p>

            <h1>Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Finds Key Gene to Stop Medulloblastoma for Treatment</h1>
            <p>Medulloblastoma is a common and dangerous brain tumor in children. After treatment, children often have bad side effects. A research team at Yang Ming Chiao Tung University found that stopping a gene called TTBK2 can make tumor cells lose their tiny hair-like parts (cilia). This stops the tumor from growing. This discovery might lead to new treatments.</p>
            <p>Yang Ming Chiao Tung University announced today that medulloblastoma is the most common serious brain tumor in children. It causes a lot of problems for children and their families for a long time. Right now, doctors mostly treat it with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. But these treatments often cause serious long-term side effects, like problems with thinking and new cancers.</p>
            <p>Medulloblastoma is closely linked to problems with how the cerebellum develops. The cerebellum needs special cells called "granule neuron precursor cells" to grow and change correctly. These cells have small, antenna-like structures called primary cilia on their surface. These cilia help the cells receive signals to grow.</p>
            <p>Professor Wang Wan-ching from the Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Professor Tsai Chin-wu from the Institute of Brain Science at Yang Ming Chiao Tung University led a research team. They used models with mice and zebrafish. For the first time, they found out how two important genes, TTBK2 and HUWE1, play a main role in the development of the cerebellum and the growth of medulloblastoma. Their research was published in an international journal.</p>
            <p>The research team found that TTBK2 acts as a "cilia protector" for the granule neuron precursor cells. It helps keep the primary cilia stable, allowing these cells to keep getting growth signals and multiply. After the growth task is done, HUWE1 breaks down TTBK2, which helps the cells change into different nerve cells. These two genes work in a balanced way, but in medulloblastoma, this balance is broken.</p>
            <p>The research team explained that in medulloblastoma, TTBK2 cannot be broken down. This makes the granule neuron precursor cells grow too much, which leads to tumors. By stopping TTBK2, tumor cells not only lose their cilia and get fewer growth signals, but also stop growing effectively. This means TTBK2 could be a good target for future treatments.</p>
            <p>Professor Tsai Chin-wu said that brain cancer has always been a difficult medical problem. Although current treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation can help children live longer, they have very serious side effects. The research shows that carefully stopping tumor growth can help reduce the harm that traditional treatments cause to the brain.</p>
            <p>Professor Wang Wan-ching explained that scientists once thought primary cilia were just leftover parts from evolution. But now they know these cilia are like real antennas and are important for cells to receive signals from outside. This research not only shows how important primary cilia are for brain development but also suggests that cilia might be linked to cancer and resistance to drugs. This opens new doors for treating brain cancer more precisely.</p>
