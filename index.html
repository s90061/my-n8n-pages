A new report from the China Strategic Risks Institute (CSRI) warns that the UK is not adequately prepared for an increasing number of sabotage attacks on vital undersea cables by China and Russia. The report, which looked at 12 incidents since 2021, found that eight of them were linked to China or Russia. It highlights the UK's limited ability to monitor these cables, which are critical for the global economy. These "grey zone" operations pose a serious threat, and the UK needs to improve its defenses to protect this crucial infrastructure.

**Taiwan Adds Chinaâ€™s Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List**

Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision comes as trade and technology tensions between Taiwan, China, and the United States continue to grow. Both Huawei and SMIC have already faced sanctions from the U.S. These two companies are currently producing China's most advanced self-developed artificial intelligence chips, aiming to compete with U.S.-based Nvidia and to supply Chinese tech firms with essential chips despite export restrictions.
