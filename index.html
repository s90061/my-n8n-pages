            <h1>School Year Starts Soon: Pingtung Police Tell University Students, "Don't Trade Your Diploma for a Car Accident"</h1>
            <p>The new school semester is starting soon. Pingtung police reported that from January to August this year, there were over 3,600 traffic accidents involving university students. The police have made a video called "Don't Trade Your Diploma for a Car Accident." It uses real accident videos to teach students how to drive safely.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Police Department's data shows that from January to August this year, there were 3,650 road accidents involving university students aged 18 to 22. These accidents caused 2,147 injuries or deaths. Compared to the same time last year, the number of accidents went down by 549, and the number of injuries or deaths went down by 392. So, overall, the numbers are lower, but there are still many accidents.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Police Department said in a press release today that many new university students are riding scooters for the first time. They don't have enough driving experience, don't know the roads well, or don't know how to drive defensively. This often leads to accidents. To make university students understand the dangers of riding, the police made the "Don't Trade Your Diploma for a Car Accident" video. It uses real accident scenes and strong words to help students learn safe driving habits.</p>
            <p>The video says, "If you don't yield to a straight-moving vehicle when turning, it's not just breaking the law, it can also kill you." It also says, "Wait three more seconds, and you can have a lifetime of safety." The video uses lively language to remind young riders that "speed is not a guarantee of safety. Being fast does not mean you will arrive safely; going slow gives you a chance to arrive safely."</p>
            <p>Police looked at common causes of accidents. These include not keeping a safe distance from other vehicles, turning vehicles not yielding to straight-moving vehicles, driving while distracted, and running red lights. This shows that many students, after getting their driving licenses, still don't fully understand driving safety.</p>
            <p>Pingtung police ask everyone to be careful. They will continue to stop people for serious traffic violations like driving without a license, dangerous driving, speeding, and running red lights. This is to keep students safe and maintain good traffic order around schools.</p>

            <h1>Department of Defense Might Change Name to Department of War; White House Looks for Other Ways to Follow Trump's Idea</h1>
            <p>After US President Trump asked to change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, his team is actively working on plans to do this. The Wall Street Journal reported that White House officials said this change might need Congress's approval. However, the White House is looking for other ways to make this plan happen.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense is the biggest department in the US federal government. Reuters reported that Greg Steube, a Republican Congressman from Florida, has already suggested a change in the yearly defense policy law. This shows that some Republican members of Congress support Trump's idea.</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said, "As President Trump has stated, our military should focus on attacking, not just defending. That's why the President prioritizes fighters at the Pentagon, not diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI) policies, nor woke ideologies. Please wait and see!"</p>
            <p>Trump has talked about this idea many times since he became president. On August 25, he said, "When it was called the Department of War, we won all wars. We won everything."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that on that day, when Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung in the Oval Office, he said the old name "sounds stronger." He also said the change would be done "in about a week." Trump was talking about US wars that happened before World War II ended and before the Department of Defense was created.</p>
            <p>A former official said that the Pentagon started making plans for new laws in the first few weeks of Trump's second term to make this change happen. One idea was to ask Congress for permission to use the old name again during a national emergency. Also, the highest civilian official of the Department of Defense would be called the "Secretary of War" again.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the White House did not give many details about this plan. However, they strongly supported what Trump said this week about the US military's ability to attack.</p>
            <p>The US Department of War slowly became the Department of Defense after many changes. This change started in 1947 with the National Security Act. This law combined the Army, Navy, and Air Force into one group called the "National Military Establishment."</p>
            <p>In 1949, a new law officially used the name "Department of Defense." This created the way the department is organized today.</p>
            <p>Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are working to make the US military look tougher. They are also making other changes, such as removing many high-ranking military officers who did not agree with Trump.</p>
            <p>Also, the Trump government tried to stop transgender people from joining the military and wanted transgender soldiers who were already serving to leave. The Pentagon said that transgender people are not fit for military service. But civil rights groups said this is not true and is illegal discrimination.</p>
