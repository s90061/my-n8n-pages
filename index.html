            <h1>UN: Over 1,000 People Looking for Help Killed in Gaza Since May</h1>
            <p>The United Nations (UN) said today that more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli army in Gaza. These people were trying to get food. This has happened since the "Gaza Humanitarian Fund" (GHF) started working in late May. This fund is supported by the United States and Israel.</p>
            <p>Thameen Al-Kheetan, a spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office, told a news agency, "As of July 21, we have recorded a total of 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food."</p>
            <p>Al-Kheetan said that 766 of these people were killed near GHF places. Another 288 people died near aid vehicles from the UN and other groups. He clearly stated that the Israeli army killed these people.</p>
            <p>Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, told reporters today that 21 children have died from not getting enough food or from hunger in different parts of Gaza in the last three days.</p>

            <h1>United States Leaves UNESCO Again; Leader Expresses Sadness</h1>
            <p>The United States announced today that it has left the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). It said that staying in UNESCO is not good for America. Audrey Azoulay, the head of UNESCO, said she was very sad about this.</p>
            <p>Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, said that America has left UNESCO. She said that UNESCO is unfair to Israel and promotes "ideas that cause disagreements in society and culture." So, staying in UNESCO is not good for America.</p>
            <p>Audrey Azoulay, the head of UNESCO, said she was very sad. She stated, "I am very sad that President Donald Trump has decided again to make the US leave UNESCO." But she also said she was not surprised.</p>
            <p>America leaving UNESCO is a problem for the organization. UNESCO was started after World War II to help countries work together in education, science, and culture to create peace. Its main office is in Paris.</p>
            <p>During his first time as president, Trump also left other groups like the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Human Rights Council, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
            <p>When Joe Biden became president in 2021, he changed these decisions. He made America rejoin UNESCO, WHO, and the Paris Agreement.</p>
            <p>Now that Trump is president again, the US is leaving these international groups once more. He has also decided to make America leave WHO. He also stopped giving money to the UN group that helps Palestinian refugees (UNRWA). These decisions are part of a review of America's involvement in UN organizations, which should finish by August.</p>
            <p>UNESCO is most known for choosing World Heritage Sites. These include the Grand Canyon in the US and the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria.</p>
