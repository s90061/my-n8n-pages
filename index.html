            <h1>Sources: US Justice Department Plans to Charge Former National Security Advisor Bolton</h1>
            <p>People with knowledge of the matter say that the US Justice Department plans to ask a grand jury today to charge John Bolton. He was the former national security advisor to President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, court papers made public last month show that Bolton is under a federal investigation. This is for possibly handling secret information in the wrong way. It is not yet clear what specific charges prosecutors will bring.</p>
            <p>If the grand jury decides to charge Bolton, it will be the third time in recent weeks that the US Justice Department has filed criminal charges against someone who criticized Trump.</p>
            <p>Abbe Lowell, Bolton's lawyer, did not immediately answer questions from the media. Lowell has said before that Bolton did nothing wrong.</p>
            <p>Bolton used to be the US Ambassador to the United Nations. He was also the White House National Security Advisor during Trump's first term. But later, Bolton became one of Trump's strongest critics. In his book last year, he wrote that Trump was not fit to be president.</p>

            <h1>Trump Warns Hamas: Stop Killing or Face Attack</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that if Hamas keeps killing ordinary people in Gaza, the United States will "march in and destroy" Hamas. This warning comes after Hamas reportedly shot Palestinian civilians, even though Israel and Hamas recently agreed to stop fighting.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump's statement follows his earlier comments where he said he was "not too worried" by these shootings, which included public executions by the Palestinian armed group Hamas. He called these acts "gang member killings."</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his own social media site, Truth Social: "If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which is not part of the agreement, we will have no choice but to go in and destroy them."</p>
            <p>However, Trump did not clearly say who "we" refers to. Yesterday, he had stated that the US military does not need to be involved in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Since the 20-point ceasefire deal, supported by the US, was put into action, Israeli troops have partly left Gaza. Hamas has taken more control of the war-damaged cities. They have increased harsh actions and killed people in the streets who they accused of working with the enemy.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Admiral Brad Cooper, the top US commander in the Middle East, asked Hamas to stop shooting Palestinian civilians and to follow Trump's plan.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Made Progress with Putin on Call, They Will Meet in Hungary</h1>
            <p>US President Trump will talk with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy tomorrow. But today, he first spoke with Russian President Putin on the phone. Trump said this call made "important progress." He also said they agreed to meet in Hungary, but Trump did not give a date.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, that their meeting in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, would aim "to see if we can end this 'shameful' war between Russia and Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Trump also added that high-ranking US officials, like US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, will have "first meetings" with high-ranking Russian officials next week. The place for these meetings is not yet decided.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Trump posted on Truth Social: "I am speaking with President Putin right now. The talk is happening, a long talk. After it finishes, President Putin and I will both explain what we discussed."</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special representative, called the talk "positive and fruitful." Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said the call between Trump and Putin "lasted for more than 2 hours."</p>
            <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban wrote on X (formerly Twitter): "The plan for the US and Russian presidents to meet is great news for all people around the world who want peace. We are ready!"</p>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump at the White House tomorrow. He wants the US to give Ukraine American-made Tomahawk cruise missiles. These missiles can fly about 1600 kilometers and can hit targets deep inside Russia.</p>
            <p>Even though Trump and Putin recently had a big meeting in Alaska, Putin still refused to stop his attack on Ukraine that started in 2022. Trump has shown more and more that he is unhappy about this.</p>
