The girl group GENBLUE Fantasy Girls performed at the Children's Amusement Park today. Talking about their experience at the Golden Melody Awards yesterday, the leader XXIN took the winning words of the new Golden Melody winner Sam as their motto: "I want to thank myself for not being afraid and not giving up."

The girl group GENBLUE Fantasy Girls held a concert at the Children's Amusement Park today. They turned the place into a K-POP playground. They also had a summer water gun fight with fans, getting everyone wet and cool. To fit the refreshing mood, Fantasy Girls also performed "TT" by TWICE and "Whiplash" by aespa. This was their way of showing respect to older artists and enjoying K-POP's past and future.

Fantasy Girls have been very busy lately. Before their concert at the Children's Amusement Park, they went to the Golden Melody Awards with their teachers Yu Chuan-yong and Kim Ji-ho. Even though they didn't win for their song "COCOCO," the six members said they learned a lot from their first time at the Golden Melody Awards.

XXIN, the leader of Fantasy Girls, made Sam's winning words her new motto. She said: "Sam said, 'I want to thank myself for not being afraid and not giving up.' This really inspired me. I also want to tell myself that even if I'm not perfect, I should accept how I am at each stage and how I change. I hope to carry this belief and continue to make good music."

GENBLUE Fantasy Girls, who will have been a group for one year in September, also shared good news at the Children's Amusement Park concert. Leader XXIN announced to fans that the group will have a big concert in Kaohsiung Pop Music Center on November 8th. The six members will use their talent and popularity to reach a new level in their music careers.

**Yung-Jui Charity Foundation Gives Awards to 150 Students**

The Yung-Jui Charity Foundation gave scholarships today to 150 elementary and middle school students. Li Yi-pei, who once won the Presidential Education Award, said that being recognized and getting help is very important for the students who received the awards.

The Yung-Jui Charity Foundation scholarship ceremony was held today at the Sunshine Theater in Taoyuan City. Evergreen Marine Corporation General Manager Chiang Chien-ting said that the Yung-Jui Charity Foundation was started in 2003 with money from Evergreen Marine duty-free shops, and it does not ask for donations. It helps children in Taoyuan City from poor families who have done well in school. Even when the duty-free shops earned less money during the COVID-19 pandemic, the help did not stop.

Chiang Chien-ting said that this is the 23rd year the scholarships have been given. About 2,400 elementary and middle school students have received over NT$6.5 million in scholarships. This year is the first time the ceremony has been held openly since the pandemic. 70 middle school students and 80 elementary school students received awards, getting NT$3,500 and NT$2,000 respectively.

He believes that character education is important for the future. He thinks that helping others with what you learn and working together can lead to better results.

Li Yi-pei also received an award today. She said that being recognized helps more people know about her efforts to achieve her dreams. This also helps more students who need help. She hopes to become a psychologist in the future to help students who are also in difficult situations.

The Yung-Jui Charity Foundation said that it follows the idea of "helping others" from its founder, Mr. Chiang Song-hua, who is also the chairman of Evergreen Marine duty-free shops. The foundation has always helped poor families and those in emergencies or disasters.

The foundation added that today's event also had a charity market with food trucks, creative small items, games, a second-hand sale, and other charity activities with 25 stands. The Paper Windmill Theatre group, which children love, also performed their show "Taiwan Fantasy." This play uses creative and imaginative theater to encourage children to chase their dreams bravely and confidently.

**Heavy Rains in China: Red Alert for Flash Floods in Sichuan and Chongqing**

Because of heavy rains moving from Guangxi and Guizhou to Sichuan, China's government has given the highest alert for flash floods. This "red alert" means there is a very high chance of flash floods in parts of eastern Sichuan and western Chongqing from 8 PM tonight to 8 PM tomorrow. They also issued an "orange alert," which is the second highest, for places like northeastern Yunnan.

Interface News reported that China's Ministry of Water Resources and the China Meteorological Administration jointly issued the flash flood warning at 6 PM tonight. The warning is for the time between 8 PM on June 29th and 8 PM on June 30th. The red alert covers 12 areas in eastern Sichuan and two areas in western Chongqing (Dazu and Rongchang). The warning says there is a "very high" chance of flash floods in these areas.

Also, the orange alert covers another 12 areas in eastern Sichuan, Yongchuan District in western Chongqing, and Weixin and Zhenxiong counties in northeastern Yunnan. The warning says there is a high chance of flash floods in these areas.

According to this warning, there are also "yellow" and "blue" alerts, which are lower levels of warning. These cover 52 and 47 areas across China. Most of these areas are still in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Chongqing, but some are also in Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jilin provinces.

The Ministry of Water Resources and the China Meteorological Administration said that other areas might also have flash floods due to heavy rain in a short time. Local areas should watch the weather, give warnings, and move people to safety as needed.

Before this, Sichuan has had heavy rain since June 28th. This morning, Chengdu, the capital city, had the top three highest hourly rainfalls in all of China and broke its own record for the most rain in one day. This caused serious flooding in the city, with a subway station having water leak like a waterfall. Also, a community's underground parking lot was filled with water in half an hour, soaking over 50 cars.
