            <h1>Kinmen Local Leaders Charged for Road Fight</h1>
            <p>In Kinmen, two local leaders, Mr. Weng and Mr. Cai, had a problem with each other. Mr. Weng is accused of driving his car into Mr. Cai's car. Then, Mr. Weng and his friends attacked Mr. Cai with weapons. Later, Mr. Cai told the police it was just a verbal fight and there was no physical contact. But after checking, the Kinmen District Prosecutor's Office charged Mr. Weng with starting a group fight and other crimes. They also charged Mr. Cai with lying to the police.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen District Prosecutor's Office announced today that on the evening of October 30, 2024, Mr. Weng and his friends had a fight in front of Mr. Cai's house. After this, Mr. Cai drove his car around his house while drunk. Mr. Weng was still angry about the earlier fight, so he drove with his friends to get revenge on Mr. Cai. Mr. Weng first crashed his car into Mr. Cai's car. Then, Mr. Weng and his friends used unknown weapons to attack Mr. Cai and his friends who came to help, all on a public road. Mr. Cai and his friends were hurt in many places.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they checked Mr. Cai. His breath test showed 0.49 milligrams of alcohol per liter. The police then sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor said that Mr. Cai had promised to tell the truth, but he lied. He said there was only a verbal argument and that no one used weapons or fought physically. He also said his injuries were from broken glass. He tried to hide the fact that Mr. Weng and others were involved in a group fight.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor explained that Mr. Weng and his friends are charged with breaking laws about public safety. They are also charged with carrying weapons and fighting in a group of three or more people in public, which caused danger. Mr. Cai is charged with driving unsafely and lying in court. The police have finished their investigation, and the case will go to court.</p>

            <h1>Bali Love Care Center in New Taipei Holds Pottery Exhibit, Showing Strength with Hands and Feet</h1>
            <p>From today until September 7, the New Taipei City Bali Love Care Center is holding a special pottery show. It is called "Pottery, Joy" and is at the Huwei Art and Leisure Park. The show has hundreds of pottery pieces made by the residents of the center. They used their fingers to shape the clay and their feet to turn the pottery wheel. This shows their strong spirit and imagination.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare Department of New Taipei City Government said that this pottery art show is taking place at the "Huwei Story House" in the Huwei Art and Leisure Park. The opening ceremony started with residents from the wheelchair ballroom dancing group. Volunteers from the Yizhu Charity Association were with them as they performed a lively dance.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhang Yao-quan, the pottery club teacher, said he teaches each resident in a special way based on their body and mind. For example, Chen Wei-ru, who has cerebral palsy, can only use her left thumb and pointer finger. In each class, she can only make four or five leaves at most. But she still finished a four-step artwork called "Pottery Bamboo." This is truly amazing.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei-ru shared that making the art was hard. Especially in summer, the clay dries quickly, so she had to spray water on it often to keep it wet. But she kept working hard. She once made 50 ducks in three months. After they were baked in the kiln, they became yellow ducklings and green-headed ducks. She said the happiest time is when she sees her finished work.</p>
            <p>Lin Xiu-hui, a specialist from the Social Welfare Department, said that the residents use art to get past their body limits. They create unique signs of their lives. She thanked Huwei Art and Leisure Park for giving them free space to show their art. This helps society see the great talent of these artists.</p>
            <p>The park's general manager, Ji Wei-qi, said that in the future, the residents' artworks will be made into special creative products. These could be things like calla lily flowers, mushroom-shaped chopstick rests, or small plates. This will turn their art into useful things. It will also help them create more art and earn money.</p>
            <p>Director Liu Wen-xiang said that the residents will also plan regular times to teach eight "Penguin Clay DIY Experience Classes." They will personally guide people to feel the calming power of pottery art.</p>

            <h1>Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival Starts on September 26, Many Mazu Statues from Taiwan Will Tour Yilan</h1>
            <p>The "Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival" is a big religious event in Yilan County. It will happen for three days starting on September 26. Besides the Coral Mazu statue from Jih-an Temple in Su-ao, 16 other Mazu statues from all over Taiwan will come together to travel around Yilan. This will allow people who believe in Mazu to worship many statues at one time and make their wishes.</p>
            <p>Today, the Yilan County Government held a press conference for the "2025 Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival" in the county hall. The Coral Mazu statue from Jih-an Temple in Su-ao, Yilan, and the Taiping Mazu statue from Fuxing Temple in Xiluo, Yunlin, entered the hall with loud gongs and drums. The place was very lively.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Department of the county government said that the Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival started in 2019. Each year, different temples, like Nan-tien Temple in Su-ao, have been the main temple for the event. This year, Jih-an Temple in Su-ao is the main host. The event's main idea is "Patrol on Land and Sea, Bless Yilan." On September 26, the first day of the event, a group of fishing boats will gather at Su-ao fishing port. They will welcome the Mazu statues onto the boats to start their journey north by sea. The boats will go around Guishan Island, which is a special landmark in Yilan. Then, they will enter Wushi Port in Toucheng Town for a special ceremony. After that, a parade on land will begin and last for two and a half days.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Department said that during the land and sea parade, besides the Coral Mazu from Jih-an Temple, 16 other Mazu statues will also join. These statues come from many different temples around Taiwan. They include temples like Gang-tien Temple in Hualien, Chao-lung Temple in Donggang, Jhen-lan Temple in Dajia, and Kuandu Temple in Beitou. All these Mazu statues will gather for the parade.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Department hopes that this event will bring together the power of Mazu believers from all over Taiwan. They wish that Mazu's kind light will protect Yilan and keep all areas safe and well. The event will show how faith and culture can come together in different ways. People are invited to join the Mazu parade when it happens.</p>
