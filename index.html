The growing field of generative AI, like popular services such as ChatGPT, hasn't yet created many new jobs in the technology sector. A recent report shows that money invested in AI companies increased a lot in the first half of 2023. However, overall tech hiring is still slow. June had the fewest new tech jobs advertised since 2021. This suggests that the current AI trend isn't creating a large number of new jobs just yet.

Some experts are concerned it might even reduce the need for certain jobs over time, especially in areas like content creation or customer support. But, there is a strong demand for special AI engineers and data scientists. This indicates that the types of skills needed are changing, rather than hiring stopping completely.

**Record Heatwaves Impact Daily Life Across the Globe**

Many places in the Northern Hemisphere have been experiencing extremely hot weather lately. These heatwaves have broken records and caused serious problems for health and daily life. Countries in Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia and North America have seen temperatures much higher than usual. This has led to many wildfires, a lack of water, and more people going to hospitals.

Scientists say these very hot events are happening more often and are stronger because of climate change. They warn that this extreme weather will become more common if the world continues to get warmer. Governments are telling people to drink enough water, avoid being outside during the hottest parts of the day, and save water. The unusually hot weather is also affecting holidays and farming. Crops are not growing well, and some popular travel spots are closing or have fewer visitors because of the extreme heat.

**Post-Pandemic Travel Faces Rising Costs and New Trends**

After the pandemic, many people are traveling again, leading to a strong recovery for the travel industry. However, new trends are changing how and where they travel. A lot of travelers now want more authentic and eco-friendly experiences instead of just visiting famous tourist places. There's also a growing trend called 'workcations' or 'bleisure' travel, where people mix work trips with holidays, often staying longer in a destination.

However, travel is becoming more expensive because of rising prices everywhere. Flights, hotels, and daily costs are all going up. Because of this, some travelers are choosing places closer to home, taking shorter trips, or looking for cheaper options. Even with higher costs, the desire to explore and reconnect after years of restrictions remains strong. This means airports and popular destinations are very busy, especially during peak times. The travel industry is adapting by offering more flexible ways to book and highlighting deals for traveling when it's less busy.`;
