<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8836633">https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8836633</a>

Yesterday, temperatures reached between 36 and 38 degrees Celsius across various regions. Wu Derong, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, stated in his "Weather Insights Classroom" column that from today until next Monday, Taiwan will experience clear skies with scattered clouds in the afternoons and hot weather. Today's temperatures are expected to be 21-36Â°C in the north, 20-35Â°C in the central region, 21-36Â°C in the south, and 21-36Â°C in the east.

Localized brief showers or thunderstorms are expected in mountainous areas in the afternoon, potentially affecting some nearby flatlands. Wu Derong noted a chance of localized severe thunderstorms with lightning, strong winds, and sudden heavy rainfall, advising the public to pay attention to immediate alerts from the Meteorological Administration.

Wu Derong added that from next Tuesday until July 7, moisture will slightly decrease, leading to clear skies across most areas with occasional localized brief showers or thunderstorms in mountainous regions in the afternoons. The weather will be intensely hot, like mid-summer, with strong ultraviolet (UV) radiation, necessitating sun protection and measures to prevent heatstroke. There is a possibility that temperatures on next Tuesday and Wednesday could set new highs for the year.

Regarding the potential for typhoon formation, Wu Derong mentioned that a tropical disturbance is developing in the waters east of the Philippines next week. Around the latter half of next week, light typhoons are expected to form consecutively north of Guam and south of Okinawa, but both are predicted to move northeastward and away from Taiwan.

Wu Derong stated that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ensemble model for July 7 shows a low probability of light typhoons extending westward from the waters southeast of Japan to near Taiwan, with the highest probability (only 30%) distributed from east of Okinawa to the waters southeast of Japan. This indicates highly divergent simulated formation locations, significantly reducing the chance of impact on Taiwan.

He added that the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) also shows highly varied simulated paths. Since models from various countries will continue to adjust, patience is advised for observation.

**Han Kuo-yu Criticizes Malicious Recall as Political Struggle, Declares "If Grand Recall Succeeds, Taiwan's Democracy Will Be Nothing"**

<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8836105">https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8836105</a>

As the large-scale recall effort intensifies, Legislator Wan Mei-ling held an anti-recall briefing tonight in Taoyuan. Mayor Chang San-cheng, Legislator Hsieh Lung-chieh, and Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu attended, emphasizing that Wan Mei-ling has worked diligently in the central government to secure infrastructure and welfare benefits for Taoyuan, and has helped advance beneficial legislation. They condemned the recall as a malicious political struggle, asserting that "if the grand recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be nothing." They urged the public to vote "disagree" on July 26.

Han Kuo-yu humorously remarked that the "Wudang and Shaolin sect leaders" had come to support Wan Mei-ling today, referring to Chang San-cheng as the "Wudang leader" and himself as the "Shaolin leader," which drew laughter from the hundreds of supporters present.

Han Kuo-yu stated that it feels like elections are beginning again right after the last one, which is not democratic politics but rather political struggle and is unacceptable. He praised Wan Mei-ling's constituent services, which are widely commended. Despite her busy schedule with constant meetings, Wan Mei-ling has maintained a perfect attendance record in her five terms as a city councilor and two terms as a legislator, securing over 55 billion NT dollars for local construction projects. He questioned, "She is so diligent, and now she is facing a recall. Does this imply that the more excellent someone is, the more likely they are to be recalled? This contradicts democratic principles."

Han Kuo-yu also said that from his position as Legislative Speaker, he is well aware of which legislators are diligent in their interpellations. He expressed sadness hearing the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) constantly shouting "grand recall, great success." He likened Taiwan's democracy to a wall that Taiwan has painstakingly built, and now with the recall, the wall is on the verge of being destroyed.

Han Kuo-yu declared that "if the grand recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be nothing," and Taiwan will no longer be able to boast about the preciousness of its democracy to the international community. He urged everyone to vote, stating that not voting means not supporting Wan Mei-ling.

**Medical Groups Dissatisfied with Expanded Medical Student Quota; Ministry of Education: Not Exceeding Total Cap**

<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8836056">https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8836056</a>

Eleven medical professional organizations today issued a joint statement expressing dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Education's (MOE) intention to increase the medical student quota from the current 1,300 to nearly 1,600, fearing it could negatively impact the healthcare system and teaching quality. The MOE clarified this evening that while it has adjusted the admission quotas for post-baccalaureate medical programs at three national universities for the 115th academic year, this was done in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) and adheres to the MOE's authority to maintain the overall quota of 1,300 students. Therefore, even for the 115th academic year, the number of general medical students will not exceed 1,300.

The 11 medical groups today issued a joint statement, stating that the MOE's decision in June to approve the increase in medical student admissions, specifically for the post-baccalaureate medical programs at Tsing Hua University, National Chung Hsing University, and National Sun Yat-sen University, has sparked strong opposition from grassroots doctors. They vehemently oppose the expansion from 1,300 to nearly 1,600 students, warning that this could severely impact the entire healthcare service system and the quality of medical education.

However, the MOE responded this evening, stating that since 1998, the MOE has collaborated with the MOHW's physician manpower planning, allocating 1,300 quotas annually within its authority to 11 university medical departments. Tsing Hua, NCKU, and NSYSU established post-baccalaureate medical programs in coordination with the MOHW's "Key Specialty Public-Funded Physician Training Program," operating on a public-funded basis. Following a resolution at the 2021 application review meeting, it was decided that after the public-funded program concludes, adjustments could be made within the total medical student admission quota. This was done with the MOHW's approval to grant public-funded student admission quotas.

Furthermore, the MOE pointed out that the MOHW's public-funded program will not continue after 2025. Therefore, in February this year, the MOE invited the MOHW and other relevant units to discuss the admission quotas for the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs for the 115th academic year. After several inquiries to the MOHW between February and April, the MOHW replied that, provided the MOE's overall allocation of 1,300 medical student admissions is not exceeded, self-funded student quotas could be allocated to the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs starting from the 115th academic year.

Consequently, the MOE emphasized that considering the significant resources, curriculum, and equipment already invested by the three universities, and the fact that students are still enrolled, as well as the fact that public-funded students are not general high school graduates, it was assessed that this adjustment would not affect existing university medical school admissions. Thus, in consensus with the MOHW, 35 self-funded student quotas were allocated to each of the three national universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs, ensuring that the total number of general medical students for the 115th academic year still does not exceed the overall quota of 1,300.`;
