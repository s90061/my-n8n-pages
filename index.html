            <h1>Aid Ship 'Handala' Nears Gaza, Israeli Army Plans to Stop It</h1>
            <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition announced today that its aid ship, recently sent to the Gaza Strip, is getting close to the area. It is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. This ship aims to go against Israel's blockade.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that this aid ship, named Handala after a famous Palestinian cartoon character, is now only 194 kilometers from its goal. This is closer to Gaza than another ship from the fleet, 'Madleen', was when it was stopped in June.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Navy said it will stop the 'Handala' from reaching Gaza.</p>
            <p>An Israeli army spokesperson told AFP today that the army "is carrying out a legal sea blockade in the Gaza area. They are ready for any situation and will act based on orders from the government."</p>
            <p>The 'Handala' ship left Sicily on July 13th. It has 19 activists and 2 journalists from different countries. Its goal is to get past Israel's blockade of Gaza and bring help to the people there.</p>
            <p>The crew of the 'Handala' posted on social media X that if the Israeli army stops the ship and holds the people on board, they will start a hunger strike.</p>

            <h1>Japan: $550 Billion Investment Plan May Help Taiwan Chip Makers Build Factories in the US</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, July 26 (CNA) â€“ Japan's Economy Minister, Akazawa Ryosei, who handles trade talks with the US, said today that a trade agreement with the US includes a $550 billion investment plan. This money could help Taiwanese companies build factories for computer chips in the US.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tokyo has agreed to this large investment plan for the US. It includes buying shares, giving loans, and offering guarantees. In return, Washington will lower taxes on Japanese goods sent to the US. However, the exact details of this plan are still not clear.</p>
            <p>Akazawa told NHK, Japan's public broadcaster, that "Japan, the United States, and other like-minded countries are working together. They want to create industry supply chains that are very important for economic safety."</p>
            <p>He pointed out that because of this, the money from Japan's investment plan for the US is not only for American or Japanese companies.</p>
            <p>Akazawa explained, "For example, if a Taiwanese chip maker builds a factory in the United States and uses Japanese parts, or if its products are made specially for Japan's needs, that is also fine." But he did not name any specific Taiwanese companies.</p>
            <p>Japan will make these investments through the state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). Japan recently changed its laws to let JBIC give money to foreign companies that are very important for Japan's supply chain.</p>
            <p>Akazawa told NHK that in this $550 billion investment plan, buying company shares will only be about 1% to 2% of the money. This means most of the money will be given as loans and guarantees.</p>
            <p>When asked about the White House statement that "the US will keep 90% of investment returns," Akazawa stressed that this number only refers to returns from share investments, which is a small part of the total money.</p>
            <p>Akazawa said that Japan first wanted to get 50% of the investment returns. But in the whole agreement, the loss from giving up some returns is small compared to saving about 10 trillion Japanese yen (around $67.7 billion) in taxes.</p>
            <p>He also said that Japan's goal is to put this $550 billion investment into action during this term of President Trump.</p>
