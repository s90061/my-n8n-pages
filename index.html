            <h1>Homeless Man in Tamsui Accused of Stealing a Dog, Hurting It, and Leaving It in the Keelung River; Police Arrest Him</h1>
            <p>In August, a homeless man named Hu from New Taipei City was accused of stealing a black dog in Tamsui. He took the dog to a park, hurt it badly, and then threw its body into the Keelung River. The dog's owner called the police when they realized their dog was missing. The police investigated and found Mr. Hu. Today, they told him to come to the police station. After questioning, he was sent to court for stealing, damaging property, and breaking animal protection laws.</p>
            <p>Someone recently posted on social media (Threads) asking for help to find the black dog. They said that a couple saw the black dog being "hung up and beaten" in a park in Taipei City. The homeless man said at the time that it was his dog and he was "teaching it a lesson because it was naughty." The couple recorded what they saw and called the police. However, when the police arrived, the dog was already gone.</p>
            <p>The Tamsui Police Station of New Taipei City explained that on August 19, a man named Li reported that his black dog had been taken by a stranger. The police checked security cameras to find out what happened. They identified a 61-year-old man named Hu as a main suspect. They asked Mr. Hu to come in early this morning.</p>
            <p>It is understood that Mr. Hu said the black dog barked at him when he was near Fisherman's Wharf. He said he took the dog because it was too noisy. The police said that Mr. Hu admitted to stealing the dog. He then took it to a park in Taipei City and hurt it. After the dog died, he threw its body into the Keelung River. After the police questioning, the case was sent to the Shilin District Prosecutor's Office for further investigation.</p>

            <h1>Over 800 People Die in Afghanistan Earthquake; Villages Destroyed, Survivors Sleep Outside</h1>
            <p>Recently, a strong earthquake (magnitude 6) hit eastern Afghanistan. Many villages were completely destroyed. So far, over 800 people have died. Many people lost their homes and are now sleeping outside. Rescue workers are still trying to find people alive in the broken buildings today.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that the earthquake happened late at night on August 31. It badly hit Kunar Province, a far-off area near Pakistan.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said the earthquake's center was about 27 kilometers east-northeast of Jalalabad City in Nangarhar Province. The earthquake was not very deep, only 8 kilometers underground.</p>
            <p>Many simple houses made of mud and stone, located in steep valleys, fell down because of the earthquake. Rescue workers searched all night, trying to save people trapped under the broken pieces of buildings.</p>
            <p>Zafar Khan Gojar, a 22-year-old who lost his home, said, "The earthquake broke rooms and walls. Some children died, and some people were hurt." Gojar and his family have moved from Nurgal to Jalalabad City.</p>
            <p>Villagers wrapped the bodies of dead children in white cloth and prayed for them before they were buried. At the same time, helicopters kept taking injured people to hospitals.</p>
            <p>Other people told reporters, "Everyone is very scared and nervous... Children and women screamed in fear. We have never seen such a terrible situation in our lives."</p>
            <p>Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson for the Taliban government, said that about 800 people died and 2,500 were hurt in Kunar Province alone, which is near the earthquake's center.</p>
            <p>Ehsanullah Ehsan, who is in charge of disaster management in Kunar Province, told reporters that "many people are still trapped under the broken roofs of their homes." He also warned that the number of deaths might go up.</p>
            <p>United Nations groups told AFP that roads to some damaged villages in Kunar Province are broken, which makes rescue work difficult.</p>
            <p>Earthquakes often happen in Afghanistan, especially in the Hindu Kush Mountains. This area is where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement that the United Nations is working with Afghan leaders. They are "quickly checking what is needed, giving urgent help, and ready to send more supplies."</p>
            <p>He added that the UN's global emergency fund has already released 5 million US dollars (about 150 million New Taiwan dollars) to help.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Checks Ice Products: Over 25% Fail First Time, Almost 10% Still Fail After Re-check</h1>
            <p>Eating ice cream helps cool down in summer. Today, the Taipei City Health Department said that in May and June, they checked 108 different ice products and their ingredients. This included 47 ice products, 12 types of ice cubes, and 49 drinks. In the first check, 29 items failed, which is 26.85%. After re-checking, 10 items still failed, which is almost 10%.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Health Department shared the results of their second check of loose ice drinks and ingredients for the year 2025. Section Chief Lin Guan-zhen explained that they did the checks around May and June. They tested for different germs in food to meet health standards. These germs included Salmonella, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, and E. coli O157:H7.</p>
            <p>She said that 29 of the ice products first failed the rules. The businesses were told to fix the problems by a certain time. After checking again, 10 items still did not follow the rules. This means they broke Article 17 and Article 48, Section 8 of the "Food Safety and Health Management Act." Because of this, the businesses that made these products will have to pay a fine between 30,000 and 3,000,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>When asked if the products that failed the first check were taken off sale, she said that businesses have about two weeks to fix problems. Food safety law only gives fines if products fail the second check. There is no rule to stop selling them after the first check. However, most businesses will stop selling them on their own. They do this to quickly find out why there's a problem and fix it, so they don't get fined if they fail the second check.</p>
            <p>Lin Guan-zhen explained that Enterobacteriaceae is a type of germ used to check how clean water, ice products, and food are. It is also an important sign of whether there are hygiene problems during how things are made. If there are too many of these germs, it means the way the product was made, the ingredients, the tools, or the packaging might have become dirty. It could also be because workers didn't keep themselves clean. Keeping products at room temperature is the best way for these germs to grow. Too many Enterobacteriaceae can make ice products less good and make them go bad faster.</p>
