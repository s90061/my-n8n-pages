            <h1>Nvidia and OpenAI Work Together to Build Super AI Center</h1>
            <p>The chip company Nvidia and the artificial intelligence company OpenAI have announced they will work together. Nvidia will build a new AI data center for OpenAI. This data center will use 10 gigawatts of electricity and have millions of powerful computer chips (GPUs) to help develop advanced AI models.</p>
            <p>Nvidia will invest up to 100 billion US dollars (about 3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) over time. The first large system will be ready in the second half of 2026. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, said that Nvidia and OpenAI have worked well together for 10 years. This new investment will help create a 10-gigawatt system to start a new age of AI.</p>
            <p>OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, said that computing power is very important. He believes it will be the base for future economies. He added that the system built with Nvidia will lead to new AI discoveries. It will also help people and companies grow at the same level.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Nvidia and OpenAI, two big companies in the AI race, are now working as partners. OpenAI will be able to build and use Nvidia systems that use at least 10 gigawatts of power. They will use these to create their own AI data centers. These centers will train and run new AI models. The electricity used will be equal to the power used by 8 million homes.</p>
            <p>This huge investment in running AI models is meant to create "superintelligence." This means AI that is smarter, faster, and stronger than humans.</p>
            <p>This partnership shows a strong belief in making AI models better and better. It is a belief that hundreds of billions of dollars from investors, companies, governments, and banks will create AI models that can greatly change how the economy and society work today. It shows a future economy that will need much more computing power than we have now.</p>

            <h1>Porsche Lowers Expectations, European Stock Markets Fall</h1>
            <p>Porsche, a well-known sports car company, has said that its financial predictions for the future are lower. This made the company's stock price, and also the stock price of its main company, Volkswagen, drop a lot. Because of this, and because investors are still looking for new signs of economic growth, most major European stock markets closed lower today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little, by 10.01 points, or 0.11%. It closed at 9226.68 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 112.36 points, or 0.48%. It closed at 23527.05 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 23.48 points, or 0.30%. It closed at 7830.11 points.</p>
