            <h1>Palau's President Says UN Needs to Include Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Palau's President, Surangel Whipps Jr., spoke at the United Nations General Assembly today. He said that China has wrongly understood UN Resolution 2758. This has made Taiwan unable to speak at the UN. He stressed that including Taiwan would make the United Nations stronger, and this is an important issue that needs to be solved quickly. On September 24, the President of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, also said that if the situation in the Taiwan Strait or the Indo-Pacific region becomes unstable, it will make global security and trade unstable too.</p>
            <p>President Whipps Jr., who became the leader of Palau in 2021, has often spoken for Taiwan at the UN General Assembly meetings.</p>
            <p>He said that Palau believes in including everyone, and this means Taiwan too. He thinks that letting Taiwan join will make the United Nations stronger. He added that no groups should be stopped from sharing their ideas to help the world, and this is a very urgent matter.</p>
            <p>President Pavel of the Czech Republic, who always watches the situation around Taiwan, also spoke on September 24. He said that causing problems in the Taiwan Strait or other parts of the Indo-Pacific region will make international safety and trade even more unstable.</p>
            <p>He also said that being far away does not keep anyone safe. Safety in one part of the world is connected to safety everywhere else.</p>

            <h1>US Warns About Cisco Security Flaw, China Suspected in Cyber Attack</h1>
            <p>Today, a US government group for internet security told other government groups about an urgent problem. They warned that hackers are using a weakness in Cisco's security devices that was not known before. Researchers think China might be involved, but China says it is not.</p>
            <p>According to a report from Reuters, the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) gave an urgent order today. It said that government internet workers must check all connected devices in about a day. They need to look for bad activities and put in software updates to fix the problem.</p>
            <p>CISA said in a statement, "This big attack creates a serious risk for the computer networks that are affected."</p>
            <p>Some Cisco ASA 5500-X series devices are affected. These devices act like firewalls, which protect company computer networks from hackers.</p>
            <p>Devices like firewalls on the edge of a network are supposed to add more safety. But because they are directly connected to the internet and their software is often not updated quickly, hackers often try to attack them.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Verizon company released its yearly digital security report. It said that attacks on these "edge devices" have increased a lot in 2024.</p>
            <p>Cisco said in a blog post today that the attacks on its devices are very complex and skillful. They linked these hackers to a cyber spying operation found earlier, called ArcaneDoor.</p>
            <p>Researchers at Censys, an internet information company, connected ArcaneDoor to China. However, Beijing has said it is not involved in such hacking actions.</p>
            <p>Cisco is asking its users to follow its advice. Users should check if they are at risk and take the necessary steps.</p>

            <h1>Mackay Medical Team Helps in Ukraine, Injured Soldiers Hope for Treatment in Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Recently, a medical team from Taiwan's Mackay Memorial Hospital went to Ukraine for the sixth time. They offered free medical help and shared medical knowledge with local people. In just 6 days, the team saw over 650 patients. Many people were very interested in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Many older patients came back for several days of treatment. Also, some soldiers who were hurt in the war said they hope to go to Taiwan for a long time of treatment.</p>
            <p>This medical team had 8 doctors and 1 nurse. They came from departments like TCM, cardiology (heart care), dentistry (tooth care), and emergency medicine. Six of them went to the western areas of Volyn and Ostroh. They visited many villages to give free medical help. It was the first time these two areas had such a medical event. The team worked with local doctors, and the people there were very happy. Many locals hugged the doctors and gave them small gifts after getting check-ups and dental care.</p>
            <p>Older people there especially liked the TCM treatments. Dr. Chen Kuang-wei, who is the head of TCM at Mackay Memorial Hospital, said that many older Ukrainians are overweight and often have long-term back pain. The team used acupuncture (needles), cupping, and gua sha (scraping) to treat them, and the results were good.</p>
            <p>Besides helping local people, the medical team also helped soldiers wounded in the war. One soldier, Gennadiy, is in his 50s. In December 2022, he stepped on a landmine on the front line. A piece of it hit his spine, which made the lower part of his body unable to move. He needs a wheelchair and his family to help him every day. He said that the local government only gives one month of free treatment each year. He has to pay for other medical costs himself, which is a big problem for people in small towns.</p>
            <p>Gennadiy said he heard about the Taiwanese medical team from the news. He was unsure about acupuncture at first. But after he got the treatment, he now hopes he can go to Taiwan in the future or keep getting similar treatment in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen Kuang-wei, the Taiwanese TCM doctor, said that Gennadiy's condition is complex. He needs a long time of acupuncture treatment. This might help his symptoms, but it will be hard for him to fully recover. Because TCM is not common in Ukraine, Dr. Chen could only give him pain patches and an electric massager to help him feel better for a short time.</p>
            <p>Lu Hsin-kun, a board member of Mackay Hospital who joined the TCM medical trip, said they visited many far-away places. These areas were often poor and rural. Many young people had gone to fight in the war, leaving mostly old people, women, and children at home. It was his first time in Ukraine, and he said emotionally that it felt good to help people during their difficult time. People not only thanked him but also hugged him, which made him feel very warm. He called it an "unforgettable experience."</p>
            <p>Lu Hsin-kun said he will share this experience in Taiwan and will support future medical teams going to help. He said, "Love needs action, and only with action can we change the world."</p>
            <p>In addition to the free clinics, the Mackay medical team also held a 4-day Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) course at a local university in Vinnytsya. Thirty-five medical students and doctors joined the course. The course combined learning from books with practical training. It used fake emergency situations to help students react better and work together as a team.</p>
            <p>Roman, a military doctor from the front line, said that many middle-aged soldiers in the army have heart problems and high blood pressure. If doctors know how to give emergency care, it will help them respond faster on the front line. Ludmila, who works at a military hospital in Vinnytsya, said that medical education in Ukraine is mostly from books and does not offer many chances for hands-on practice. This kind of training is very helpful for real medical work. She said, "They were very professional and answered many questions we had before."</p>
            <p>Dr. Liao Chen-hao, one of the teachers for this course, said that Ukraine does not have many medical resources. So, the course focused on improving "soft skills" like communication and teamwork among medical staff. The goal was to improve the overall quality of medical care with the limited resources available.</p>
            <p>Dr. Liao Chen-hao, who has visited Ukraine six times, shared what he saw. During his many visits, he noticed that cities were slowly being rebuilt, and people's lives were slowly returning to normal. He said, "It's not that because there's a war today, everything stops, and nothing can be done." He thinks Taiwan can learn from this. He also felt that the local people still held onto hope and belief during the war. "If they didn't have enough faith, they probably couldn't keep going."</p>
