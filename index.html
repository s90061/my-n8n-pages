            <h1>Russia and China want to use SCO Summit to Challenge the US, but the Real Impact is Still Unclear</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and leaders from 8 other member countries of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) met in Tianjin, China. They held the organization's newest summit. This meeting might challenge the United States, but we don't know the real effects yet.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the SCO, which has 10 member countries, will meet for two days in Tianjin. This organization started 24 years ago. It has grown in size and influence, but its goals and plans are still not clear.</p>
            <p>The official member countries of the SCO are Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
            <p>At first, people thought the SCO was a way to balance the US's power in Central Asia. It started with 6 countries. Later, 4 new countries joined: India and Pakistan in 2017, and Iran and Belarus in 2023 and 2024.</p>
            <p>Some SCO member countries clearly oppose Western countries, especially Iran and Belarus. Other members like India, China, and Russia have a less clear relationship with Western countries. This is partly because Washington's stance on Russia's war in Ukraine is not always firm, or because of problems caused by US tariffs.</p>
            <p>Since it started in 2001, China, a strong economy in the region, has led the SCO. Russia has also tried to use the organization to keep its influence over former Soviet countries in Central Asia, such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
            <p>Russia's economic power has become much weaker, especially because of strong punishments from Western countries. But Russia and China still see the SCO as a way to work together on military matters in the region, even if it's only for joint training for now.</p>
            <p>After the war between Russia and Ukraine started, India bought a lot of oil from Russia. This has made things more difficult with Washington. After meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August, Modi said that India and China are making "steady progress" in improving their relationship.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press said that India joining the SCO might challenge Russia and China's strong position in the organization. Even though these countries trade with each other, India is not likely to strongly support Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>June Teufel Dreyer, a China expert from the University of Miami, said that the SCO seems willing to change. It wants to go from being a place for talking to a "full and practical cooperation group" that brings good results for its members. But questions remain: "What are its goals? And how will it achieve them?"</p>

            <h1>Riots Break Out in Indonesia Because Parliament Members Get Too Much Money; Finance Minister's House Robbed</h1>
            <p>Recently, people in Indonesia have been unhappy about the economy and the high salaries of parliament members. This has caused protests against the government. The anger of the people continued, and the Indonesian Finance Minister's house was robbed last night. Today, Indonesia's Defense Minister said that strong actions will be taken against rioters and robbers.</p>
            <p>On August 25th, protests started in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Protesters said that parliament members' salaries and housing money were too much. On August 28th, the protests turned into riots after a police armored vehicle hit and killed a motorbike taxi driver. Some politicians' homes and government buildings were robbed or set on fire.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that a neighbor said that two groups of people robbed the home of Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati. Her house is in South Tangerang, a city near Jakarta, early this morning.</p>
            <p>The neighbor said: "The first group of robbers rode dozens of motorbikes, with 2 to 3 people on each bike. The second group had about 150 people. They stole TVs, sound systems, living room decorations, clothes, and dishes."</p>
            <p>Today, Indonesian Defense Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin warned at a press conference: "Law enforcement will not hesitate to take strong action against rioters and robbers who enter private places or government buildings."</p>
            <p>Today, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto held a press conference with leaders from different political parties next to him. He said he has told the army and police to take strict action against rioters and robbers. He also warned that some actions during the recent protests across the country are "treason" and "terrorism."</p>
            <p>Prabowo also said: "Parliament leaders have promised to remove some rules within the parliament. These include changing the amount of money members get and stopping trips abroad."</p>
            <p>The protests in Indonesia have continued for several days and have spread outside the capital, Jakarta. Several local parliament buildings were even set on fire. Because of this, Prabowo canceled his planned trip to China.</p>
            <p>Since Prabowo started his presidency last October, his government has faced almost no political problems for nearly a year. This protest is the biggest challenge he has faced so far.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Women's Volleyball Team Wins Second Place in East Asian Cup; Head Coach Deng Yan-Min Touched by Players' Growth</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan team played in the East Asian Women's Volleyball Championship in Hong Kong today. In the final game, they lost to China with scores of 26-24, 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. They won second place. Head coach Deng Yan-Min said she was very moved to see her players improve.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team had won the East Asian Volleyball Championship three times before. But for 9 years, they could not get into the top 4 teams. This time, setter Liao Yi-Ren, known as "Volleyball Sweetheart," led the team. Other players included Hung Chia-Yao, Hsu Heng-Yun, Weng Tzu-Yun, Chien Yi-Wen, and Chiu Shih-Ching. Head coach Deng Yan-Min, also called "Little Cow," said their goal was to reach the championship game. She wanted to end this year's last international competition well.</p>
            <p>In the group stage, the Taiwan women's team beat Mongolia and host country Hong Kong. They came in first in their group and returned to the top 4. Yesterday, they also beat South Korea 3-0. This helped them reach their goal of getting to the final. However, today they faced a strong Chinese team. The Taiwan team won the first set, but then lost the next sets 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. They did not win the championship cup.</p>
            <p>After the game, Head Coach Deng Yan-Min spoke to reporters. She said that she used to play for the national team too. She knows that players feel pressure, and they want to do well for Taiwan. So, she told everyone to focus only on the game and not worry about anything else. She wanted to create a "happy volleyball" feeling. This helped the players naturally train hard and play with all their effort.</p>
            <p>Deng Yan-Min believes that after playing in the Asian Cup, the Universiade in Rhine-Ruhr, and now this East Asian Volleyball Championship, these players are no longer afraid of tall opponents. She said their blocking, defensive positions, and attacking movements are also getting smoother. This made her very emotional. She also thanked the players for trusting the team quickly and working together to achieve great results.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team will start the second part of their training for the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games on September 8th. Deng Yan-Min said that more experienced older players will join the team then, along with new players who have a lot of potential. She noted that next year there will be important games like the Asian Cup, East Asian Volleyball Championship, Asian Championship, and Asian Games. "Next year will be a very exciting year. I hope we can use this time to get stronger," she said.</p>
