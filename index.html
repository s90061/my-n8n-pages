            <h1>Lulu Cries while Hosting Golden Bell Awards; Chen Han-Dian Comforts Her: "Just Being There Makes You 100 Points"</h1>
            <p>Lulu is a host for the Golden Bell Awards. She was also nominated for the "Best Variety Show Host" award. Early this morning, she went to a celebration party. She said that the night before hosting, she cried a lot because she felt stressed. Chen Han-Dian, her husband, comforted her kindly. He told her, "You are already 100 points just by being there!" Lulu was very happy to hear this. She also said that her ex-boyfriend, A-Da, wrote the rap she performed at the start of the show.</p>
            <p>Lulu hosted the 60th Golden Bell Awards for TV shows. During the ceremony, her interactions with her ex-boyfriend A-Da and her husband Chen Han-Dian were very funny. Early this morning, Lulu went to two celebration parties. She admitted that hosting the Golden Bell Awards was very stressful. The night before, she cried a lot to let out her feelings. Chen Han-Dian told her gently, "You are either 0 or 100. 0 means you don't show up. If you show up, you are 100 points!" This made Lulu feel very happy.</p>
            <p>Last night, Lulu walked the red carpet with Chen Han-Dian and Jacky Wu. Usually, Jacky Wu stands in the middle. But after Lulu and Chen Han-Dian announced their marriage, Jacky Wu let Lulu stand in the middle. Even his clothes matched hers. He said, "The bride is the most important."</p>
            <p>Lulu also shared a funny story. When they were taking photos backstage, the photographer asked Jacky Wu to move. The photographer said, "We want to take pictures of Lulu and Han-Dian first!" Lulu felt nervous when she heard this. She said, "Don't do that!" But Lulu also said that her colleagues on the show are like family. They don't care about who is older or newer. She thanked Jacky Wu very much.</p>
            <p>The show "King of Night Market" won the "Innovation Program Award" at the Golden Bell Awards. Lulu, A-Da, and Mei Li Ben Ren, who are the hosts, went to a celebration party early this morning. Mei Li Ben Ren thanked the judges. But they were sad they didn't win the "Host Award." During the ceremony, A-Da and Chen Han-Dian sat together. A-Da said that he and Chen Han-Dian were talking about Luo Shi-Feng's performance. He also shared that Luo Shi-Feng was very happy when he performed with the girl group "Phantom Blue Bear." Luo Shi-Feng said, "The girls from Phantom Blue Bear are so young and smell so nice."</p>
            <p>When the "Best Variety Show Host" award was given out, Lulu sat between her ex-boyfriend A-Da and her current husband Chen Han-Dian. Lulu joked, saying that meeting again is a sign of fate. She said, "If one of us three is not funny, this whole part won't work." This part made everyone laugh a lot.</p>
            <p>Finally, Lulu said that A-Da wrote the rap lyrics for her opening performance. She said, "I told my husband about it! And the day before, A-Da even came to help me check the full script. He is very good at writing rap. So I asked for his help to make the ceremony more colorful." Lulu also thanked A-Da's girlfriend for letting A-Da help her.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Education Program Encourages AI in Teaching; 1160 Schools Have Joined</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Education held the 2025 Digital Cross-Domain Education Conference in Chiayi. The Ministry continues to encourage elementary and middle schools to use AI (Artificial Intelligence) in their teaching. They do this through a special plan. This plan uses "project-based learning" to help students become better at exploring new things. So far, 1160 schools have joined this program.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced today that their plan, called "PBL-STEM+AICT Cross-Domain Integrated Smart Learning Rooting Project," focuses on information technology. It combines this with subjects like math, physics, chemistry, and science. Through project-based teaching, students learn step-by-step. They start by thinking of ideas, then break down problems, analyze patterns, and use logic. This helps them improve their ability to explore and their interest in learning.</p>
            <p>This plan started in 2019. Since then, 1160 schools have joined as main schools, and 131 small groups have been formed.</p>
            <p>At today's conference, the main topic was how to use AI in classrooms. Teachers were encouraged to use generative AI and machine learning tools. This helps them create new teaching materials and lessons. It also improves their ability to teach different subjects together and use technology in integrated ways.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education hopes that the conference and competitions for teaching materials will help teachers share ideas and work together. They also hope that these meetings will inspire new ways of teaching. The goal is to spread digital skills and the ability to combine different subjects.</p>

            <h1>NTU President Chen Wen-Chang Wants to Stay; Decision Expected on December 13 at University Meeting</h1>
            <p>Today, Chen Wen-Chang, the president of National Taiwan University (NTU), officially told the university meeting that he wants to stay as president. His goal for the future is to make 9 of NTU's subjects among the top 50 in the world. NTU plans to hold a special university meeting on December 13 to vote on whether Chen Wen-Chang can continue as president.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang said at today's university meeting that his first term will end on January 7, 2027. On September 2 this year, the Ministry of Education sent a letter. It asked all university presidents who want to stay in their jobs to send a letter saying so within one month. Because of this, he already told the administrative meeting in September that he wanted to continue. He sent the documents to the Ministry of Education at the end of September. Today, he officially told the university meeting about his wish to continue.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang said he thought about continuing for a while before making his decision. His main thought was whether he could help NTU get even better. He stated that if he can stay as president, he will continue his idea of "building a world-class university and showing its century of glory." He will keep working on improving campus buildings and attracting and keeping talented people.</p>
            <p>For academic research, Chen Wen-Chang hopes that by 2030, NTU will have 9 subjects ranked in the global top 50. Currently, NTU has 7 subjects in the top 50. These include Classical Studies and Ancient History, Social Policy and Administration, Modern Languages, Sociology, Library and Information Management, History, and Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang also promised to keep working hard to raise money. He plans to use strategies like investments and new campus businesses. His goal is for NTU's university fund to reach 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars by 2045.</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-Chang became the president of NTU on January 8, 2023. Before this, he was the dean of the College of Engineering and the director of the Institute of Polymer Science. His special research areas include electronic and optoelectronic polymers, polymer nanomaterials, and precise polymer synthesis.</p>
            <p>According to the "National Taiwan University Organization Rules," the president serves for 4 years. A president who wants to stay must tell the university meeting 14 months before their term ends that they wish to continue. They then ask the Ministry of Education for an evaluation. The evaluation report is expected to be given to NTU by the end of November. After that, the university will follow its internal procedures.</p>
            <p>The president will then present a report on the university's performance to the university meeting. A special university meeting is planned for December 13 this year to discuss the approval of his continuation. Finally, he must get more than half of the representatives' votes to continue as president.</p>
