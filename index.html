In a significant shift, Nvidia, a company known for its advanced computer chips, has become the second most valuable company in the world. It has now surpassed Apple, the well-known iPhone maker. This change highlights the huge demand for Nvidia's chips, which are essential for developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

Nvidia's market value, which is the total worth of all its shares, has grown very quickly this year. This is largely because AI is becoming more important across many industries. Companies around the world are investing heavily in AI, and Nvidia's chips are crucial for the powerful computing needed for these new technologies. This development shows how much the technology industry is changing and how central AI is becoming.

**India's Extreme Heat Damaging Its Economy**

India is currently experiencing severe heatwaves, with temperatures reaching record highs in many areas. This extreme heat is not only dangerous for people's health but is also causing serious problems for the country's economy. The high temperatures make it very difficult for people to work, especially those with outdoor jobs.

Many industries, such as farming and construction, are suffering. Farmers are struggling as crops are damaged, and construction workers cannot work effectively in the intense heat, leading to delays and lower productivity. This situation reduces how much the country can produce and earn. Experts say that these heatwaves are a clear warning. They show how climate change can directly harm a country's financial stability and daily life, not just in India but potentially in other parts of the world as well.

**Popular European Cities Fighting Against Too Many Tourists**

Many famous European cities are becoming too crowded with tourists, a problem often called "overtourism." This situation is making daily life difficult for local residents and sometimes harms historical sites and the environment. In response, several popular destinations are now introducing new rules and measures to manage the large numbers of visitors.

Cities like Amsterdam, Venice, and Barcelona are trying different approaches. These include increasing tourist taxes, limiting the size of tour groups, or even stopping new tourist accommodations from being built. The aim is to create a better balance, making sure that tourism remains good for the local economy but also protecting the quality of life for the people who live there and preserving the cities' unique culture and historical beauty for future generations.`;
