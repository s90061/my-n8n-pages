            <h1>Taishin Life Insurance Made NT$940 Million Profit in First 3 Quarters, But Net Value Ratio Still Below 3%</h1>
            <p>Taishin Life Insurance announced its financial report for the first three quarters of this year today. They made a profit of NT$940 million after tax. The profit per share was NT$0.16. Because the Taiwan stock market grew a lot, Taishin Life sold some investments at a good time. This helped them make more money and reduced the effect of the New Taiwan Dollar getting stronger in the first three quarters.</p>
            <p>At the end of the third quarter, Taishin Life's net worth was NT$40.8 billion. Their net value ratio went up to 2.98%. However, this is still a little less than the 3% required by law.</p>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) checks insurance companies every six months. They require that the company's RBC (Risk-Based Capital) is not lower than 200% and its net value ratio is not below 3% for two periods in a row. These two numbers help the FSC to see if an insurance company can pay its debts.</p>
            <p>At the end of June this year, Taishin Life's RBC was 154.27%, and its net value ratio was 2.31%. So, the net value ratio in the third quarter improved.</p>
            <p>Taishin Life explained that the Taiwan stock market grew strongly. This allowed the company to adjust its investments and make more money from its assets. They also followed the FSC's temporary rules for reserves and put more money into reserves for changes in foreign exchange rates. This helped to reduce the big effect of the New Taiwan Dollar getting much stronger against the US Dollar in the first three quarters.</p>
            <p>Taishin Life also said that in the first three quarters of this year, their new contract premiums (FYP) reached NT$25.93 billion. This is 17% more than the same time last year. Investment-type products made up 86% of the FYP, which shows they continue to drive business growth. For traditional products, Taishin Life also did well with interest-sensitive products. The FYP for these products grew by 93% in the first three quarters compared to last year. They are also developing new health and accident insurance products to get ready for the new IFRS 17 accounting rules.</p>
            <p>Taishin Life pointed out that the global and Taiwan economies have been steadily getting better in recent years. The Taiwan stock market has been boosted by strong growth in the technology and semiconductor industries. Also, major international markets have grown because of new technology and hopes for lower interest rates. Because of this, Taishin Life's investments at home and abroad have made good profits. Their performance in the first three quarters was better than last year. In the future, they will keep trying to make steady profits and find new ways to grow.</p>
            <p>Taishin Life plans to keep changing its investment and risk management plans to make more money. They will also increase their capital by getting more cash and issuing bonds. Additionally, they are actively creating valuable products that will help them meet the IFRS 17 rules and meet what customers need.</p>

            <h1>Yemeni Rebels Say Chief of Staff Killed; Israeli Defense Minister Confirms</h1>
            <p>Today, the Houthi rebels in Yemen announced that their Chief of Staff, Ghamari, was killed while "doing his duty." Ghamari was one of the highest-ranking military officials in the Houthi group, which is supported by Iran.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that even though the Houthi group did not directly say Israel was responsible for killing Ghamari, they stated that the conflict with Israel is "not over." They also warned that Israel would "receive a strong punishment for its crimes."</p>
            <p>In August this year, Israel launched airstrikes on Sana'a, the capital of Yemen. The targets included the Houthi chief of staff, the defense minister, and other important people. Those airstrikes killed the Houthi government's prime minister and several other ministers.</p>
            <p>Israel said at the time that the airstrikes were aimed at Muhammad Abd Al-Karim al-Ghamari, the Houthi government's defense minister, and other high-ranking officials.</p>
            <p>Ghamari was also a member of the "Jihad Office," led by Abdul Malik al-Houthi. This group is in charge of military operations.</p>
            <p>Today, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz confirmed that Israel killed Ghamari. He also said, "We will take the same action against any threat in the future."</p>

            <h1>Quiet Carriages: German High-Speed Trains Have Special Family Sections with Big Tables for Babies to Play and Draw</h1>
            <p>Recently, Taiwan's High-Speed Rail started a rule for "quiet carriages," which has caused a lot of discussion. Different train systems around the world have different ways of doing things. This shows how different cultures think about public order and how people interact.</p>
            <p>In Berlin, Germany, reporter Lin Shang-ying writes that German trains, often criticized for being late, are surprisingly good at making family travel comfortable. If you go into the "baby compartment" on an Intercity Express (ICE) train, you'll see walls with animal drawings and a large table where children can lie down and draw. There's also space for baby strollers, a changing table for diapers, and special electrical sockets that are safe for children. This means parents traveling with babies and young children can have a good time together.</p>
            <p>The "baby compartment" is a small, closed room designed by German Rail specifically for families with babies and young children. It is mainly for children aged 0 to 5 and their parents. Inside, there is a place to park strollers and power outlets with safety covers, which are useful for heating milk bottles or feeding babies.</p>
            <p>In the compartment, besides the seats facing each other, the walls are covered with colorful drawings. In the middle, there is a very large table with cute pictures of train travel. This table is not only for baby toys and things, but German Rail also provides drawing books and crayons for young children to draw and color during their journey.</p>
            <p>Nadja, a parent from Stuttgart, was traveling with her 2-year-old daughter on a long ICE train journey. It was their first time using the baby compartment. Nadja told the Central News Agency, "We have the whole space to ourselves. We can bring the stroller in, and my daughter can play, talk, and eat without bothering other people."</p>
            <p>During the interview, Nadja's husband took their baby for a walk outside the compartment. Baby compartments are usually near the dining car area, where the aisles are wider. The dining area is usually noisier than quiet areas, so baby cries are less likely to disturb others there. This helps parents feel less stressed. Also, unlike regular carriages, the toilet in the same carriage as the baby compartment is much bigger and has a folding changing table, making it even larger than the toilets in first-class carriages.</p>
            <p>Besides the baby compartment, German Rail also has open "family areas." These areas are mainly for families with children who are in kindergarten or school. Regular passengers who don't mind some noise can also choose seats in the family area.</p>
            <p>The baby compartment focuses on care and privacy, while the family area allows older children to move around freely, eat, and talk. Both areas have one thing in common: they help travelers with children not worry about disturbing others. They also give other passengers the chance to choose quieter carriages.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, German Rail also has "quiet zones." A staff member told the Central News Agency that many people who travel on ICE trains are commuters or business travelers. Many of them work or have online meetings on the train. Compared to regular local trains, having quiet zones is "very important" for ICE trains, which travel between cities.</p>
            <p>If passengers need to have meetings or chat on the phone, they can choose seats in the "mobile phone zone." This clear way of dividing areas means that different groups of passengers can all have what they need on the same train.</p>
            <p>Whether it's the "baby compartment" and "family carriage" for families, or the "quiet zone" and "mobile phone zone" for other passengers, you can choose your seat area directly when you book your train tickets on the German Rail website or mobile app.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that if you enter the age of the children traveling with you when booking, the system will automatically show available seats in the family-friendly areas. German Rail advises that if you are traveling with children, you should book the baby or family carriage early. This is because there are not many seats, and during busy times, they are often booked quickly after tickets become available.</p>
            <p>In Taiwan, there has also been a discussion about whether to have quiet zones and family carriages on the High-Speed Rail. The example of ICE trains shows that if train spaces are planned well, even if passengers have different needs, laughter and quiet can exist together.</p>
            <p>Nadja said that even though train delays make German Rail's reputation not so good for some people, for new parents like her, German Rail's child-friendly design is truly excellent. During the interview, Nadja's 2-year-old daughter came back to the baby compartment after a short walk to the dining car. She was drawing on the reporter's business card. This scene, with the green fields outside the window, was the most relaxing and lovely sight the reporter saw during a busy business trip.</p>
