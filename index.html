            <h1>Mountain Areas to Guard Against Heavy Rain on 21st Afternoon, Tropical Depression Expected to Form This Weekend</h1>
            <p>The weather agency says that today, a cold air mass high up caused strong storms in the afternoon. People from New Taipei to Chiayi saw hail. Tomorrow, mountain areas should still be ready for local heavy rain in the afternoon. It is expected that a tropical low pressure system will form around the weekend. It will move across the northern part of Luzon Island. This will bring a little more moisture to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>A forecaster from the Central Weather Agency said that today, because of the cold air mass high up, the storms were stronger. People reported seeing hail in some parts of Xizhi in New Taipei, Taichung, Nantou, and Alishan in Chiayi.</p>
            <p>He said that because of the strong storms in the afternoon, many areas had heavy rain or local very heavy rain. Tomorrow, the cold air mass will leave. Most places will be cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, the western part of Taiwan and the mountain areas in the east will have local short thunderstorms. There is a chance of local heavy rain in all mountain areas, but the rain will be less strong than today.</p>
            <p>He also said that tomorrow, the temperature will usually be between 32 and 35 degrees Celsius. But in Greater Taipei and near the mountains in central and southern Taiwan, some areas might have temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Before it rains, it will feel hot and humid everywhere.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that on August 22nd, there will be even less moisture. This will be the most stable day in the coming week. Most places will be cloudy to sunny. Only the Hengchun Peninsula will have a few short showers. In the afternoon, all mountain areas will have local short thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>He said that starting this weekend, the wind will change to an easterly wind, and there will be a little more moisture. The southeastern part of Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula will have local short showers. In the afternoon, the western part of Taiwan and the mountain areas in the east will have local short thunderstorms. Starting on August 25th, the moisture will increase a little more. The eastern part of Taiwan, and the western part and Yilan area in the afternoon, will likely have thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>He explained that for the next week, Taiwan will mostly be affected by the Pacific high-pressure system. However, right now, from the South China Sea to the east of the Philippines, there is a large area of low pressure. A tropical disturbance is forming there. It is expected that this tropical disturbance east of the Philippines might become a tropical low pressure system this weekend. It will cross the northern part of Luzon Island during the weekend. Next week, it will move into the South China Sea and towards the Indochina Peninsula. It will not directly affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that this large low-pressure area and the possible future tropical low pressure system will bring easterly winds and moisture near Taiwan. Current information shows that the tropical low pressure system is unlikely to become a typhoon before or after it passes Luzon. The weather agency will continue to watch it.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs Sees AI Business Opportunities, Expects 7th Straight Month of Export Order Growth in August Despite Tariffs</h1>
            <p>The business for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing fast. In July, Taiwan's export orders were better than expected. The Ministry of Economic Affairs says that even though the US has set a temporary tariff rate of 20%, and a special investigation (232 investigation) is not finished yet, they are positive about AI business in the second half of the year. Electronic products and information and communication technology products will help keep orders strong. They expect orders in August to keep growing by more than 10%.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs released its export order statistics. In July, export orders were 57.64 billion US dollars. This is the highest ever for July. It is 15.2% more than last year and has grown for six months in a row. From January to July this year, the total amount of orders was 378.21 billion US dollars, which is 16.4% more than the same period last year.</p>
            <p>The head of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' statistics department said that for August, they expect export orders to be between 55.5 billion and 57.5 billion US dollars. This means a growth of 10.5% to 14.5% compared to last year. However, because the US has set a temporary tariff rate of 20% on Taiwan, and the 232 investigation is not yet finished, there are still unknown factors. So, it is hard to predict how well exports will do in the second half of the year.</p>
            <p>He said that orders in July were better than expected mainly because AI led to stronger than expected growth in high-end semiconductors and servers. The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics recently greatly increased its prediction for Taiwan's economic growth rate in 2025 to 4.45%. The AI business will continue to grow steadily in the second half of the year, which will keep supporting export orders.</p>
            <p>Looking at the main types of goods, in July, orders for electronic products were 22.59 billion US dollars. This is the highest ever for July, growing by 24.8% compared to last year. The Ministry explained that this growth is because of strong demand for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing. This led to more orders for IC manufacturing, IC design, memory, printed circuit boards, and chip sales.</p>
            <p>In July, orders for information and communication products were 16.32 billion US dollars. This was also the highest ever for July, growing by 15.5% compared to last year. Strong demand for artificial intelligence and cloud industry uses helped increase orders for servers, network products, and graphics cards.</p>
            <p>For traditional goods, basic metals decreased by 12.6% year-on-year, and plastic and rubber products decreased by 10.3%. These were the only two main product types that showed a decrease. Chemical products increased by 7.8% because customers bought more to refill their stocks, and orders for medicines grew.</p>
            <p>He said that the temporary tariffs from the US on Taiwan mainly affect traditional industries. The Executive Yuan has also launched policies to help these industries. But it is still important to watch how much these tariffs affect traditional industries. For example, for medium to high-end machine tools, competitors are Japan and Germany, and these two countries have lower tariff rates than Taiwan. For low-end machine tools, the competitor is China, and its tariff rate is higher than Taiwan's, so the impact is less.</p>
            <p>Also, the US is encouraging manufacturing to return to the US. This has led to more orders for automated equipment in the machinery industry. In July, orders for machinery were 1.77 billion US dollars, growing by 6.2% compared to last year. He said that because new semiconductor factories are needed, orders for semiconductor equipment and automated equipment will continue to grow in the long term.</p>
            <p>However, he also pointed out that it is important to watch if tariffs cause demand to go down or if companies delay or stop investing. This could affect how many orders the machinery industry gets.</p>
            <p>The second half of the year is when new electronic products are launched. People are watching to see how much is bought. He said that the period when many consumer electronic products are bought might be in August or September. Right now, companies are getting ready by stocking up on parts. Also, with the AI business, the growth in electronic products as a whole is better than expected.</p>
            <p>Regarding the early buying rush caused by the US tariff policy, he said that some companies, including those making basic metals, machinery, and plastic and rubber, have reported that this rush has slowed down. Some industries even saw a decrease in orders compared to the previous month.</p>
