        const text = `**Soldiers' Business Class Upgrade: Unions Agree, But Not if Companies Pay**

President Lai Ching-te suggested that soldiers should get free upgrades to business class if there are empty seats on flights. This idea came up as part of a plan to show respect to the military and improve their benefits.

Aviation unions, like those from China Airlines and EVA Air, said they support helping soldiers. They know soldiers protect Taiwan and help in disasters.

However, the unions also said that upgrading soldiers to business class is a complicated issue. They worry that if airlines have to pay for these upgrades, it could hurt other passengers, company owners, and airline workers. They asked the government to think carefully about how to do this and to help the airlines, instead of just telling them what to do.

**Nanny Sisters Deny Most Charges in New Child Abuse Cases**

Two sisters, who were nannies, are now facing charges for two more child abuse cases. They were already found guilty of causing the death of a 1-year-old boy named "Kai Kai."

In court, one sister, Liu Cai-xuan, said she only tied a child but did not abuse him. The other sister, Liu Ruo-lin, said she did not do anything wrong.

Prosecutors say that Liu Ruo-lin recorded a video where another child hurt a baby and did not stop it. They also claim Liu Cai-xuan tied a baby to a chair. In another case, the sisters allegedly made a child stand in an uncomfortable way and ignored his cries for help. The mother of one child also said her child had bad diaper rash when Liu Cai-xuan was caring for him.

**Chicony's Good Sales in June Despite Trade Challenges**

Chicony, a big company that makes computer keyboards, had very good sales in June. Their sales reached NT$8.346 billion, which is the second-highest for them this year. This happened even though they faced problems like new tariffs (extra taxes on goods) and changes in currency exchange rates.

In the second quarter of the year, their sales grew by 5.2% compared to the first quarter. This shows the company is doing well.

Chicony said that because of the new tariffs from the United States and the strong New Taiwan Dollar, many customers were careful with their orders. However, Chicony's strong sales of keyboards and power supplies helped them do well. Looking ahead, the company plans to make more products in their factory in Thailand to meet customer needs. They also think that the new Windows 11 system and new computer parts from NVIDIA will help them sell more of their products, like special keyboards and camera parts for laptops.
