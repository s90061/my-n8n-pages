Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova will play in the Wimbledon women's singles final. Swiatek won easily against Belinda Bencic, with scores of 6-2, 6-0. This is her first time reaching the Wimbledon final, and she is very excited, saying she never dreamed of it. She usually does well on clay courts, like at the French Open.

In another match, Amanda Anisimova, ranked 13th, surprisingly beat the world number one, Aryna Sabalenka. Anisimova won 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. She said it felt "unreal" and that Sabalenka was a very strong opponent. This is also Anisimova's first time in a Grand Slam final.

Both Swiatek and Anisimova will be trying to win their first Wimbledon title.

**US Judge Stops Trump from Limiting Birthright Citizenship**

A US federal judge in New Hampshire has again stopped former President Donald Trump's policy that aimed to limit birthright citizenship. This happened after the Supreme Court recently made it harder for judges to block such orders for the whole country, unless it's a "class-action" lawsuit (a lawsuit representing a large group of people).

The judge agreed with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) to allow a class-action lawsuit. The ACLU argues that Trump's order could stop children born in the US from automatically becoming citizens. The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution says that all people born in the US are citizens.

Trump's policy wanted to stop babies from getting US citizenship if their mothers entered the US illegally or were short-term visitors, and the fathers were not US citizens or permanent residents. Opponents say this order is against the law. The Supreme Court did not decide if the policy was legal, but sent the case back to lower courts to be reviewed.

**US Says China Ordered Hacking to Steal Vaccine Information**

The US Justice Department announced that two Chinese men are accused of hacking into American computer systems to steal information about COVID-19 vaccines. The US claims that the Chinese government told them to do this. One man has been arrested in Italy and will be sent to the US; the other is still at large.

The two men, Xu Zewei and Zhang Yu, are accused of being involved in computer attacks between February 2020 and June 2021. This includes the "HAFNIUM" attacks, which affected thousands of computers globally. The Justice Department said that officials from China's Ministry of State Security directed Xu Zewei's hacking.

The FBI stated that these hackers, working for China, targeted US universities to steal important COVID-19 research when the pandemic started. Later, they used weaknesses in US systems to steal more research. The FBI said that HAFNIUM attacked over 60,000 US groups to steal sensitive information.

After hacking, the men put special programs on the computers to control them from far away. The Justice Department said this case shows how China uses many private companies to hack and steal information, hiding the government's involvement. The US says it will find and punish those who threaten its cybersecurity.
