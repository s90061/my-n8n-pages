Typhoon Damrey has caused severe damage to Madou pomelo farms in Tainan. It is estimated that more than 80% of the fruit has been lost. The ground in the orchards is covered with fallen fruit. The city government, local offices, farmers' associations, and the army are helping to pick up and move the fruit. However, they need more people, so they are asking for volunteers from all over. Some online influencers have already started gathering people to help.

One influencer, Jeremy, posted on Facebook asking for volunteers to meet at Madou Prince Temple at 8 AM tomorrow. He reminded them that this is hard physical work to help farmers, not a tourist trip. He asked volunteers to be prepared to work for a certain time or finish a certain amount of work, and to do what they can.

The Tainan City Government's Agriculture Bureau said today that after Typhoon Damrey arrived on July 6th, the Madou pomelos were badly hit. By July 7th, the ground was full of fallen fruit. If these fruits are not removed, they will rot and smell bad, and make it difficult to take care of the orchards later. The bureau estimates that 80% to 90% of the Madou pomelos are lost.

**US Child Swallows Chinese-Made Remote Battery, Family Settles for $40 Million**

A news report from Hong Kong stated that a child in the U.S., aged 6, accidentally swallowed a battery from a Chinese-made air conditioner remote control in July 2022. This caused lasting damage to his digestive system. His parents sued the Chinese company and asked for $125.2 million. They settled the case for $40 million (about NT$1.17 billion), which has caused much discussion in China.

Zurich Insurance (China) announced this major payment on July 7th. They said the Chinese company sued by the boy's parents was their client for extra insurance. The announcement did not name the Chinese remote control maker.

According to the report, Zurich Insurance (China) learned in April 2023 that one of their client's air conditioner remote controls, exported to the U.S., caused the accident. The parents believed the remote control was faulty, allowing the boy to swallow the battery. The insurance company talked with the client and their lawyers, and the lawyers suggested a settlement. They agreed on $40 million.

**Taiwan Women's Basketball Team Changes Coach Before Asia Cup, Association Says It Was Necessary**

The Taiwan women's basketball team is about to play in the Asia Cup Division 2 competition. However, they suddenly replaced their foreign coach, Michael Olson, before the games. The Basketball Association's Deputy Secretary-General, Chang Cheng-chung, said today it was a "difficult decision." Chiu Chi-yi will now be the main coach.

Chang Cheng-chung explained that problems with communication between Coach Olson and the team began during the Asia Cup Division 2 East Asia qualifiers and their training in Japan. These issues became very clear during the Jones Cup International Invitational tournament. "This included cultural differences, different ideas about basketball, and even game strategies and player roles," he said.

Because the Asia Cup was starting right after the Jones Cup, and time was short, a special meeting was held on July 7th. They decided to remove Olson from his coaching role. Chiu Chi-yi will now be the executive coach for the Asia Cup Division 2 games. Chang said changing coaches at the last minute is very hard. However, Olson's coaching was affecting the team's ability and spirit. To help the team, they had to make a change quickly.
