<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E4%BB%A5ai%E9%A0%98%E8%88%AA%E5%9C%8B%E9%9A%9B-14%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E4%BC%81%E6%A5%AD%E5%8F%83%E5%B1%95%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9E-%E9%80%BE70%E5%AE%B6%E8%B2%B7%E4%BA%BA%E7%8F%BE%E5%A0%B4%E5%AA%92%E5%90%88-105857909.html">News Link</a>

Igniting the world with smart technology! The Taipei City Department of Industrial Development is leading 14 excellent Taipei-based companies to participate in the "Taiwan Expo 2025 in Malaysia" from today (June 23) until June 26. A "Smart Taipei Pavilion" has been set up, focusing on "AI Leadership, Smart Taipei," to connect with Malaysia's high-value-added industries and showcase Taipei's smart solutions and industrial competitiveness.

Today marked the first day of the exhibition, and the Smart Taipei Pavilion held an opening press conference. Distinguished guests including Mr. Alex Liew, Chairman of the Malaysia Computer & Multimedia Industry Association (PIKOM), and Mr. Ong Kian Yew, CEO, attended. A specialist provided a guided tour, introducing exhibition highlights and Taipei's advantageous business environment.

The Taipei City Department of Industrial Development noted that the Malaysian government has accelerated the promotion of the "New Industrial Master Plan 2030 (NIMP 2030)" and the "National Semiconductor Strategy (NSS)" in recent years, aiming to transform Malaysia into "Southeast Asia's largest data center." Consequently, there's been a significant increase in demand from relevant industries for smart automation upgrades, ESG sustainable development, and AI and big data applications.

According to statistics from Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs International Trade Administration, the total bilateral trade between Taiwan and Malaysia in 2024 reached US$34.557 billion, making Malaysia Taiwan's 7th largest trading partner. Both Taiwan and Malaysia consider integrated circuits as key mutual import and export items, indicating close cooperation opportunities in the electronic and electrical industries. Through the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), over 70 international buyers are scheduled to have one-on-one business matching sessions with Taipei companies. During the exhibition, participating companies will also present their businesses and featured products on stage, fully demonstrating the city's brand and corporate strength.

The Taipei City Department of Industrial Development also stated that the participating companies were jointly selected by experts and scholars. The list includes 14 companies such as Senstec, Zhidian Energy, Yunyu Technology, Huaxin Medical Materials, Free System, Youhua Technology, Heya Smart, Zhanjia Technology, Taiwan Xianmeng, Chengzhi Technology, Feimu Technology, Yinghuan Technology, Ruiyuan Information, and Daduo Technology. Their exhibits cover three major areas: smart healthcare, smart factories, and smart living, comprehensively showcasing Taipei's smart industry capabilities.

**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%A5%A8%E5%83%B9%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train (ÂçÄÈñìËªä) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

TRA fares will be fully adjusted on June 23, with an average increase of 26.8%. This adjustment covers various train ticket prices, lost and found return fees, luggage, and bicycle transportation fees. For example, the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will increase by NT$153. In addition to fare adjustments, TRA will implement a major timetable change on June 26, and revise its refund policy for delays and other promotional measures. Taiwan PASS prices will also be adjusted, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version seeing the highest increase.

This fare adjustment marks the end of a 30-year freeze on TRA prices. Specifically, local train fares from Taipei to Banqiao will increase from NT$15 to NT$22, and the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will increase to NT$975. Luggage and parcel fees will see an average increase of 36%, with items under 70 kg for distances within 300 km increasing from NT$70 to NT$100, a hike of 43%. Transportation scholar Huang Tai-sheng noted that TRA's price increase is significant, roughly one-third.

In addition to fare increases, TRA's discount measures have also been reduced. The free mileage for using EasyCard or iPASS on Tze-Chiang Limited Express trains will be shortened to 50 km. The "Love Child Ticket," which used to cost one-quarter of the full fare for children aged 6 to 12 with disabilities, will also be canceled, though children aged 6 to 12 will still receive a half-fare discount. For residents of Hualien and Taitung, TRA offers point rewards, with 8 times points on weekdays and 5 times on holidays, which can be used to offset ticket purchases.

Regarding train delays, TRA has also set new rules. If a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes due to a malfunction or reasons not attributable to the passenger, or if the departure time is uncertain, passengers can choose not to travel and apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Huang Tai-sheng pointed out that if the High-Speed Rail were to follow suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to manage demand by adjusting prices. He hopes that TRA passengers will not switch to the High-Speed Rail.

It is worth noting that the TPASS commuter monthly pass is not affected by this price increase, but the government's subsidy amount will increase. Transportation scholar Chang Sheng-hsiung believes that while it will not create a financial black hole, it will indeed increase the financial burden. He explained that the increased burden mainly comes from the TRA portion, while the use of MRT, city buses, and national highway buses remains unaffected.

The Taiwan PASS offered by the Tourism Administration will also see price adjustments, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version having the largest increase, from NT$1900 to NT$2500. This comprehensive fare adjustment means that the public will face higher costs for their daily commuting and transportation.

**Taiwan is 'of course' a country, president says in rebuke to China**

<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan is "of course" a country and China lacks both the historical evidence and legal proof to back up its sovereignty claims, President Lai Ching-te said on Sunday in a strong rebuke to Beijing and its stepped up political and military pressure.

China says democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to the country since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a "separatist".

Giving the first of 10 speeches in a series called "uniting the country", Lai drew on Taiwan's history, including the millennia-long connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesians, like native Hawaiians, to show what he said was Taiwan's separate and distinct development from China.

Taiwan's people have a record of opposing invasion, like uprisings against Japan's 1895-1945 colonial rule, and under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for eight years, he added.

"Of course Taiwan is a country," he said at a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, pointing also to its presidential elections. "But China says no, that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan's Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. China says the 1971 United Nations resolution, which took away Taipei's seat in the body and gave it to Beijing, is one of the legal bases of its claims.

Lai, who in March called China a "hostile foreign force", said it was "totally wrong" for Beijing to say that U.N. resolution had anything to do with Taiwan's sovereignty as it was only about which government was represented at the body.

China's threat to Taiwan is real, added Lai, pointing to its daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he said, to a round of applause.

The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.
