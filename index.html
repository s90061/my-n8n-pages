The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently reported that artificial intelligence (AI) will change about 40% of jobs around the world. For some jobs, AI will help people work better, making them more productive. But for other jobs, AI might reduce the need for human workers. The report suggests that countries need to prepare by training people for new skills and creating policies to help workers adapt to these changes. It also said that developed countries might experience more changes from AI because they have more jobs that can be affected by this technology.

**Sustainable Travel Becomes More Popular**

More and more travelers are choosing sustainable options when they plan their trips. This means they look for ways to travel that are good for the environment and local communities. For example, they might choose hotels that save energy, use public transport, or support small local businesses. Travel companies and destinations are noticing this trend and are offering more eco-friendly choices. This helps protect natural places and ensures that tourism benefits the people who live there, rather than harming the environment or local culture.

People can follow instructors on screens, use apps to track their progress, and even join live classes with others. This allows individuals to fit exercise into their busy schedules and work out whenever they want, making a healthy lifestyle more achievable for many.
