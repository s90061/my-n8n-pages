            <h1>New Talks Between USA and China in Madrid: Trade and TikTok are Key</h1>
            <p>A US official said today that America and China will have new talks in Madrid, Spain. These talks will start on September 14th. The US Trade Representative, Jamieson Greer, will meet with Chinese officials. They will talk about trade and money matters. One important topic is that TikTok must sell its US business by September 17th.</p>
            <p>Mr. Greer will go to Spain with the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent. They will meet with China's Vice Premier, He Lifeng, and other important Chinese economic leaders.</p>
            <p>The US Treasury Department said that during the talks, they will discuss many trade and money issues. This includes worries about TikTok's effect on national security. They will also talk about how the US and China can work together to stop money laundering.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce said their focus in Madrid will be on US tariffs, problems with export rules, and TikTok.</p>
            <p>Greer, Bessent, and He Lifeng met before in July in Sweden. China's main trade talker, Li Chenggang, was also there. In that meeting, they agreed to stop adding new tariffs for 90 more days. This meant reducing very high tariffs that both sides had put on each other. It also allowed China to send rare earth minerals to the US again.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump has agreed that the current 55% tax on Chinese goods will continue until November 10th.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Mr. Bessent asked the G7 countries (seven big rich countries) to put "important taxes" on goods from China and India. He wants them to do this to make these two countries stop buying oil from Russia. This plan is to lower Russia's money from oil so that Russia will agree to peace talks with Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Bar Explosion in Madrid Hurts 21 People, Reason Not Clear Yet</h1>
            <p>Today, emergency services in Madrid, Spain, said that a bar explosion happened. 21 people were hurt, and three of them were seriously injured.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that the Madrid emergency center shared information on X. They said the explosion happened in the Vallecas part of Madrid. Pictures show that parts of the bar's roof fell down, and bricks were all over the floor.</p>
            <p>The explosion also broke the bar's door. The street outside was full of broken glass. Rescue teams quickly used stretchers to take the injured people away.</p>
            <p>Emergency services said that medical teams helped 21 injured people. Three people had "serious" injuries, and two others were "possibly very serious."</p>
            <p>Now, rescue workers are using special dogs to smell things and drones (small flying cameras) to help search the area.</p>
            <p>The reason for the explosion is not known yet.</p>

            <h1>About 110,000 People Join Far-Right March in London, Say Police</h1>
            <p>Today, British police said that around 110,000 people went to a march in central London. This march was started by a far-right activist named Tommy Robinson.</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP reported that the Metropolitan Police said, "We think about 110,000 people were at the 'Unite the Kingdom' march and protest."</p>
            <p>The police also said they used security cameras and videos from police helicopters to guess how many people were there.</p>
            <p>Tommy Robinson, who is against immigrants and Muslims, told the crowd, "Most people who usually don't speak up will now speak up... Today is the start of a big change in our culture."</p>
            <p>At the same time, about 5,000 people had another protest nearby. This was organized by a group called "Stand Up to Racism." The police used about 1,000 officers to keep the two groups apart.</p>
