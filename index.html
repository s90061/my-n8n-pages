            <h1>Government May Give Money to People, But Not to the Rich; Officials Say Part of Law May Be Against Constitution</h1>
            <p>The government plans to ask the parliament to approve a special budget to help Taiwan deal with new tariffs from the United States. Media reports say the government will also change a special law. This change will make sure that when the government gives money to people, rich people will not get it. Government officials said today that they will prepare the special budget soon. However, because some parts of the law might not follow the Constitution, the government will ask the court to check if these parts are legal at the right time.</p>
            <p>A special law was passed recently to make Taiwanâ€™s economy and people stronger. It set aside 545 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Out of this money, 235 billion will be used to give money to people. 150 billion will be used for national security. 93 billion will be for economic help because of the new US tariffs. And 67 billion will help society. The original plan to give 100 billion to Taipower company was removed.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, the President's office announced the special law for strengthening Taiwan. The Premier, Cho Jung-tai, also asked all government departments to quickly think of more ways to help. He asked them to prepare the special budget to send to the parliament within one week. Also, after the final tariff information is known, the government will propose changes to the special law based on Taiwan's economy and the needs of its industries.</p>
            <p>Media reports say that the government meeting on August 7th will approve the 545 billion dollar special budget. It will then be sent to the parliament for approval. This budget includes 235 billion for giving money to people. The reports also say that after the final tariff numbers are known, the government will propose a change to the special law to include a "not for the rich" rule for giving money to people.</p>
            <p>Government officials said that the special law has been announced by the President and is now in effect. To quickly help industries and groups affected by the US tariffs, and to make national security stronger, the government will quickly prepare the special budget based on this law. However, because some parts of the law might not follow the Constitution, the government will ask the court to check if these parts are legal at the right time.</p>
            <p>About future changes to the special law, government officials said that they will make clear, real, and effective adjustments. These adjustments will be based on the country's finances, the order of important government tasks, and talks between different political parties. The government will also quickly send the special budget for the "Special Act for Strengthening Taiwan's Economic, Social, and National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations" to the parliament for discussion.</p>

            <h1>Lawmaker Wang Hung-wei Says Government Asked Stock Exchange to Fund Rapper DaZhi; Cultural Association Says Everything Followed Rules</h1>
            <p>Today, Wang Hung-wei, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang party, said that from 2023 to 2025, the Taiwan Stock Exchange gave rapper DaZhi 10 million dollars each year. But she said the messages from these funds did not reach enough people. She claimed that the Stock Exchange gave this money because the General Association of Chinese Culture (GACC), whose head is the President, asked them to. Therefore, she said President Lai Ching-te, as the head of the GACC, should explain this to the public.</p>
            <p>The GACC replied that what the lawmaker said was not true. The GACC is a non-profit group. Its work with the Taiwan Stock Exchange is just like how it usually asks companies to support Taiwanese culture. The money given, how it was used, and how it was checked all followed the rules. There was no special treatment, and there was no "President's order" for DaZhi to receive funds.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei wrote on Facebook today that yesterday she showed that DaZhi's company, which he owns by himself with a capital of 100,000 New Taiwan Dollars, received 10,297,019 dollars from the Ministry of Culture from 2022 to 2025. Also, the Stock Exchange gave 10 million dollars from 2023 to 2025.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei said that the Stock Exchange gave DaZhi 3 million, 3.5 million, and 3.5 million dollars each year from 2023 to 2025. This means an average of over 3 million taxpayer dollars per year. She asked what this money achieved. Some internet users found that DaZhi might have received the money for rap songs about preventing financial fraud ("Zha") released 2 years ago, investing in ETFs ("ETF") released 1 year ago, and trading rules ("Odd-lot Trading and Behind-the-Scenes Interview") released 7 months ago on the Taiwan Stock Exchange's YouTube channel. She said that no matter the artistic quality, these songs did not help spread information widely.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei also said that many people wondered why the Stock Exchange gave money to DaZhi's company. She said the answer is that it was an "order." She claimed the 10 million dollar funding from the Stock Exchange was given because the GACC, led by the President, asked for it. This was listed as a "free donation." In other words, Wang Hung-wei said that former President Tsai Ing-wen and President Lai Ching-te named DaZhi as someone who could get "legal money." She added that it's easy to understand why DaZhi used government money to criticize the Kuomintang party, the band Mayday, and B'in Music.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei believes that when news came out about Mayday donating 9 million dollars to disaster victims in Tainan, they did many other good things that people don't know about. However, she said these "pro-government" singers take taxpayer money every year to create political songs. She suggested that this "free donation" of over 3 million dollars each year, instead of being used to support political allies, would be better if even half of it went to disaster victims or for public good.</p>

            <h1>Jhihben Hot Spring Now Managed by Private Company, Promotes "From Taipingshan to the Pacific Ocean" Travel</h1>
            <p>Starting August 1st, Jhihben Hot Spring, located in Taipingshan National Forest Recreation Area, is now managed by a private company. The company that won the contract will invest over 35.89 million New Taiwan Dollars to repair and improve the area. They also plan to connect Taipingshan with coastal attractions in Yilan, offering a travel idea called "From Taipingshan to the Pacific Ocean." They will add shuttle buses to make this possible.</p>
            <p>The Yilan branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency stated today that the company Lian Da Construction Co., Ltd. was chosen as the best applicant for the Jhihben Hot Spring project (Repair-Operate-Transfer, or ROT). Starting August 1st, Lian Da Jhihben Co., Ltd. will take over the operations and services.</p>
            <p>The Yilan branch explained that this ROT project includes five areas within Jhihben Hot Spring: the main building, the hot spring SPA area, hot spring private rooms, the hot spring public bath area, and the egg boiling area. The company will manage these facilities for 8 years. If their work is good, they can renew the contract for another 7 years. During the 6-month repair period, the egg boiling area and some hot spring facilities will still be open. Other facilities will open to visitors as soon as they are fixed.</p>
            <p>The Yilan branch said that this project especially combines the idea of "From Taipingshan to the Pacific Ocean" for nature tourism. The company will add shuttle buses to connect Taipingshan National Forest Recreation Area with coastal places in Yilan. These places include Guishan Island and Wushi Harbor in Toucheng Township, passing through the Atayal tribe area in Datong Township. This will create a "Lanyang Mountain and Sea Ecological Tour" package that includes nature and culture. In the future, visitors can enjoy both mountains and the ocean in one day, experiencing Yilan's unique natural beauty and local culture.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Yilan branch stated that the company will add a free hot spring foot bath area and charging stations for electric vehicles to make the facilities better for everyone. Residents of Sanxing Township and Datong Township will also get discounts for using the hot springs. The company has also promised to give 1 million dollars each year to the Datong Township Office. This money will help improve local public facilities and benefit the community.</p>
