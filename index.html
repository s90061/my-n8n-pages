            <h1>Delta Electronics' July Sales Exceed NT$45.3 Billion, Stock Price Reaches New High of NT$637</h1>
            <p>Delta Electronics announced its July sales today. Its sales were over 45.397 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is a 21.6% increase compared to last year and a 7.6% increase from June. It is a new record for monthly sales, higher than the previous record of 43.443 billion New Taiwan dollars set in March. This happened because AI is still very strong.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics' stock price also went up today. It closed at 637 New Taiwan dollars, which is 14 New Taiwan dollars higher, or a 2.25% increase. This is a new record high for its stock price. In just the past two months, Delta Electronics' stock price has gone up by 60%, starting from less than 400 New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics said that in July, its power and parts division made up 53% of its total sales. This is more than half. This was because of more shipments of power supplies for AI servers. Also, Delta Electronics shipped more liquid cooling systems for AI data centers. This made its infrastructure division's sales 31% of the total in July. From January to July, Delta Electronics' total sales were 288.352 billion New Taiwan dollars, which is a 24.2% increase compared to last year.</p>
            <p>At a meeting last month, Mr. Cheng Ping, the chairman of Delta Electronics, said that "only AI has been good this year." But because AI is so strong, it helped the company grow in the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, he thinks that big cloud service providers in the US will continue to spend a lot of money. So, Delta Electronics' business growth should be fine.</p>

            <h1>Kao Cheng-Jui Beats Slovenian Star, Enters WTT Yokohama Champions Tournament Top 16</h1>
            <p>In the WTT Yokohama Champions tournament in Japan, Taiwan's table tennis player, Kao Cheng-Jui, also known as "Yuzu Classmate," won his first men's singles match today. He beat Darko Jorgic from Slovenia, who is ranked 8th in the world, by 3 sets to 1. Kao Cheng-Jui has now moved on to the top 16 players.</p>
            <p>Kao Cheng-Jui is only 20 years old and is ranked 27th in the world right now. This week, he went to Japan for the WTT Yokohama Champions tournament. In his first match, he played against Darko Jorgic from Slovenia, who was the 6th seeded player in the tournament. They had played against each other before in April at the Macao Table Tennis World Cup. At that time, Kao Cheng-Jui lost after a tough 4-set match. This time, he hoped to get his "sweet revenge."</p>
            <p>In the first set, Kao Cheng-Jui started behind. But then, he scored 7 points to 1 and quickly took the lead. He had three chances to win the set. Even though his opponent saved two of them, Kao Cheng-Jui served and made Jorgic hit the ball into the net. So, Kao Cheng-Jui won the first set 11 to 9.</p>
            <p>In the second set, Kao Cheng-Jui also started behind. He tried to come back like he did in the first set, but he could not catch up. He lost the set 8 to 11, and the game was tied. However, Kao Cheng-Jui was not affected. In the third set, he played very well again. He changed the speed of his play, which made it hard for his opponent to adjust. Especially at the end of the set, he scored 6 points in a row and won 11 to 7, giving him the lead in the match.</p>
            <p>After a slow start, Kao Cheng-Jui scored many points in the middle of the fourth set. This made his opponent call for a break. But after the break, Kao Cheng-Jui kept his lead. He blocked his opponent's attacks many times with his backhand. In the end, Kao Cheng-Jui made his opponent hit the ball out of bounds. He won the set 11 to 8 and moved on to the men's singles top 16. In the next round, he will play against Kanak Jha from the United States to try to reach the top 8.</p>
            <p>As for Cheng I-Ching, Taiwan's top female player, who is ranked 12th in the world, she played against Honoka Hashimoto from Japan in her first women's singles match today. Honoka Hashimoto is good at chopping the ball. Cheng I-Ching could not stop her opponent effectively, and she was not playing her best. So, she lost the match 2-11, 4-11, and 8-11. She will not go on to the women's singles top 16.</p>
