The technology sector is currently experiencing a strange situation. Many large tech companies have laid off thousands of employees recently, cutting jobs in areas like sales or traditional software development. However, at the same time, these very companies are intensely competing to hire people with strong skills in Artificial Intelligence (AI).

There is a huge demand for AI specialists, such as engineers who can design AI systems, and researchers who develop new AI technologies. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are leading the way in offering high salaries and attractive benefits to attract these top professionals. Even smaller AI startups are finding it hard to compete for this limited pool of talent, as the biggest companies are offering salaries that can be twice as high as typical tech roles.

This strong demand is driven by the rapid growth of AI. Companies are rushing to develop new AI products and services, from advanced chatbots to intelligent automation tools. They need skilled workers to create and improve these complex systems. Experts say that despite wider job reductions in the tech world, the need for AI talent will continue to grow, making it a highly competitive and well-paid field.

**Cities Around the World Adapt to Extreme Heat**

Many cities across the globe are facing a growing challenge: extreme heat. Summers are becoming hotter and lasting longer, which is a major concern for public health and daily life. Cities are often warmer than surrounding rural areas because of all the concrete and buildings, a problem known as the "urban heat island effect." This makes the heat even more dangerous.

In response, city planners and local governments are looking for innovative ways to cool down their urban environments. Some cities are planting more trees and creating new parks. These green spaces provide shade and help lower temperatures naturally. Other places are encouraging "cool roofs," which are painted in light colours or covered with plants to reflect sunlight rather than absorb it.

Additionally, cities are developing warning systems to alert citizens about heatwaves and setting up public cooling centers where people can escape the heat. Some are also using water features like fountains or misting systems to offer relief. The goal is to make cities more livable and safer as global temperatures rise, ensuring residents can cope with the increasingly hot summers.

**European Cities Tackle 'Overtourism' Problem**

Popular tourist destinations across Europe are increasingly struggling with "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors arrive at once, causing problems for the local community, the environment, and even the quality of the visitors' experience. Issues include overcrowded streets, increased noise, damage to historical sites, and rising living costs for residents as housing becomes more expensive due to tourist rentals.

In response, many cities are taking action to manage the flow of tourists and protect their unique character. For example, some places are introducing higher tourist taxes, making visitors pay more to help fund local services and environmental protection. Others are setting limits on the number of people who can enter popular attractions or even entire islands at certain times.

Venice, Italy, has started charging an entry fee for day-trippers to reduce crowds. Amsterdam is actively discouraging certain types of tourism, focusing on cultural visitors rather than party-goers. Barcelona has stopped issuing new licenses for tourist apartments in some areas. These measures aim to find a better balance, allowing cities to welcome visitors while ensuring that local life and the environment can thrive.`;
