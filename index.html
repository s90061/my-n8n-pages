Italy is experiencing a very hot summer with temperatures rising above 40 degrees Celsius. A Taiwanese diplomat who has lived in Rome for nearly 20 years said this summer is the hottest ever, making it difficult to live there. Many tourists try to cool down by spraying water on themselves in the street. However, some visitors from Hualien and Taitung in Taiwan proudly said they are used to the heat and are not afraid of getting darker because they are "already at their limit for tanning."

Weather forecasts said that on July 3rd and 4th, Italy would see temperatures up to 41 degrees in many cities due to hot air from Africa. Cars parked outside felt like "large ovens" when opened, with dashboard temperatures showing over 40 degrees.

Huang Rui-long, Taiwan's deputy representative in Italy, shared that he has lived in Rome for about 20 years over four different postings since 1995. He has truly felt the big changes in the local weather. He noted that summers were not as extreme or hot before. He used to live comfortably without air conditioning in his previous two six-year terms in Rome. Now, even though his current home doesn't get direct sun and has high ceilings, he found last summer difficult and this June is already much hotter than usual. He is now considering installing air conditioning.

According to a survey from an Italian website last year, the number of homes with air conditioning in Italy has increased. However, there are big differences between cities and rural areas. For example, 61% of homes in Mantova, a city in northern Italy, have air conditioning, while only 3% to 4% of homes in cooler mountain towns have it. To cope with the hot summer without air conditioning, Huang Rui-long buys cooling fruits like watermelon and cantaloupe, and makes them into juice. He also avoids going out during the hottest part of the day. If he must go out for work, he always wears a hat and sunglasses for sun protection.

The high temperatures have caused several deaths in Italy in recent days. On July 3rd, two tourists died from heatstroke on a beach in Sardinia, and a truck driver died in a roadside parking area. To protect outdoor workers, most regions in Italy now require a stop to construction work and farm labor between 12:30 PM and 4:00 PM.

The heat also affects tourists, especially this year as it is a special Catholic Jubilee year, bringing many visitors to St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City during the summer holidays. With the heatwave, many tourists hide in the shade under the pillars in St. Peter's Square. Even the hallway in front of the Vatican press office has become a shelter from the sun, with many tourists sitting on the floor, drinking water, and fanning themselves. To find water and cool down, the fountains near the Vatican have become a popular spot with long lines. One person, dripping with sweat, warned others to be careful, calling himself a "sweating monster."

In Rome's tourist areas, people like to eat and drink coffee outside in the summer. To reduce the heat, restaurants have installed large electric fans that blow water mist outdoors. Some street vendors even offer "simple shower for 5 euros" services quietly to visitors.

However, some brave visitors, a group of pilgrims from Hualien and Taitung in Taiwan, told CNA at Rome Airport that even though Rome felt hotter than Taiwan these days, they were still enjoying their trip. Some members said "older Taiwanese people can handle the sun better," and others showed their tanned arms, jokingly saying, "we are already as dark as we can get, so we won't get any darker."
