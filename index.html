**Alcaraz Reaches Wimbledon Final for Third Straight Year, Aims for Third Title**

Carlos Alcaraz is going for his third Wimbledon win in a row. He has reached the final.
Today, Alcaraz won against Taylor Fritz from the US. The score was 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (8:6). This means he will play in the Wimbledon final for the third time.
The match took 2 hours and 49 minutes in very hot weather. Famous people, like Leonardo DiCaprio, watched the exciting game.
The temperature on the court was nearly 32 degrees Celsius. The game had to stop a few times because some fans felt unwell. But Alcaraz stayed calm. He played well against Fritz, who had strong serves. Alcaraz's own serves were also very good.
Alcaraz, who is 22, will play against Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner in the final on July 12th. Djokovic has won Wimbledon seven times, and Sinner is the world's number one player.
After the match, Alcaraz said, "This match was very difficult, just like every time I play against Fritz. The hot weather made it even harder." He also said, "I got over my nerves. Playing in the semi-finals here is not easy. I am proud of how I stayed calm and thought clearly. I am happy with how I played."
Alcaraz, who is ranked second in the world, started the match a bit unsure. But he soon played his best and showed he can win the championship again.
