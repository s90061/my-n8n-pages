            <h1>Putin's Special Envoy: Some Countries Don't Want Russia-Ukraine War to End, Will Try Hard to Harm Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, US President Trump said he would meet with Russian President Putin on the 15th. Today, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy for economic and investment cooperation, said that some countries will try very hard to stop this meeting from happening.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had said Russia and Ukraine were close to a ceasefire agreement. This could end the conflict, which has lasted three and a half years. The details of the agreement are not public yet. But Ukraine might have to give up a lot of land. Many European countries do not like this idea.</p>
            <p>Dmitriev said today that some countries want the war to continue. He wrote on Telegram, a social media platform: "Some countries want the fight to go on. They will definitely try very hard to stop the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump."</p>
            <p>Dmitriev also said that these efforts mean "causing trouble and spreading false information." But he did not say which countries or what kind of trouble they might cause.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin already said that this meeting between Russian and American leaders will happen. Yuri Ushakov, Putin's aide, said the two leaders will "talk about ways to find a lasting peace for the crisis in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said: "This will clearly be a difficult process, but we will work hard and actively."</p>

            <p>Tang Chen-yao is 97 years old now. She was the only person in the 95-99 age group for the 100-meter breaststroke. Even so, she swam hard and finished the race. She was happy to break the record. When the race ended, everyone in the audience cheered for her.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Tang Chen-yao won 5 gold medals in both water and land sports at the Taipei World Masters Games. She will turn 98 in October this year.
