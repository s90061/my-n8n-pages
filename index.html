            <h1>Autumn Typhoon Causes Matsu Ferry Services to Stop for Several Days</h1>
            <p>The Lianjiang County Government announced today that ferry services between Taiwan and Matsu, as well as between the islands, will stop. This is because of Typhoon Fengshen and the effects of an autumn typhoon. The "Mini-Three-Links" between Matsu and mainland China will stop on October 19th. Also, travel to and from Dongyin and Juguang islands might stop for at least three days.</p>
            <p>The Transportation and Tourism Bureau of Lianjiang County said today that the "New Taima" ferry, which travels between Keelung and Matsu, will likely stop services from October 18th to 27th. This is due to Typhoon Fengshen and a cold front from the northeast. The "Taima Star" ferry's night trip from Matsu to Keelung on October 19th is also canceled.</p>
            <p>For travel between the islands, the "North-South Star" ferry between Nangan and Dongyin will stop all day from October 19th to 22nd. The "Taima Star" ferry is expected to stop from October 19th to 27th. The "Donghai Mingzhu" ferry between Nangan and Juguang is stopped for repairs. The "North-South Star" ferry for this route will stop all day from October 19th to 21st. The "Juguang Star" ferry between East and West Juguang will stop all day from October 20th to 21st.</p>
            <p>For the "Mini-Three-Links" between Matsu and mainland China, the local shipping company, North-South Shipping, announced that the "Ji Shun No. 9" ferry from Beigan to Huangqi Port in Fujian, China, will stop on October 19th and 20th. The "Jin An" ferry from Nangan to Langqi Port in Fujian, China, will also stop on October 19th and 20th. Chinese ships, the "An Qi No. 2" for the Huangqi route and the "An Qi No. 6" for the Langqi route, will stop from October 19th to 21st.</p>
            <p>The Lianjiang County Transportation and Tourism Bureau stated that these ferry services are stopping because of the typhoon's outer winds and the northeast monsoon. However, changes to ferry schedules should always be checked with the shipping companies.</p>

            <h1>Lin Chih-kang Takes Two Gloves to Championship Series, Stronger Desire to Play</h1>
            <p>Lin Chih-kang, a versatile player for the CTBC Brothers in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) championship series, is seen as a "special player." Today, he brought two gloves to the game. Last year, he did not get a chance to play. This year, his mindset is different, and he has a much stronger desire to be on the field. He openly said that Yu Te-lung, a versatile player for the Rakuten Monkeys, is his goal and someone he respects.</p>
            <p>The Brothers team is playing in the CPBL championship series (Taiwan Series). Yesterday, they announced their 32-player roster, and Lin Chih-kang was one of the key players. Brothers' head coach Keiichi Hirano said that Lin Chih-kang is very useful because he can play almost every position on the field, even catcher. He is a "special player" for the team.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-kang was also on the Brothers' championship series roster last year, but he did not get to play. This year, he is back on the team for the championship series. Lin Chih-kang told CNA that his feelings are very different this year compared to last year. Last year, he just wanted to do his job well, and he was chosen because he played well. This year, his wish to be on the championship series roster is very strong.</p>
            <p>During practice yesterday, Coach Hirano spent a long time guiding Lin Chih-kang. Lin Chih-kang said he understands what to do at each position. The head coach also gave him advice on how to improve his skills.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-kang, who plays many positions, once brought four gloves to a game. Today, he brought two. He said he hopes he won't need to play catcher. He feels both nervous and excited about the championship series. If he gets a chance to play, he will do his best to help the team.</p>
            <p>The Brothers' opponent in the championship, the Monkeys, also have a versatile player named Yu Te-lung. Lin Chih-kang said that Yu Te-lung is also someone he looks up to and respects. Yu Te-lung plays in different positions depending on the game. To do this, a player needs to be very good at changing their mindset and adapting. By doing what they can control well, they can get more chances to play.</p>

            <h1>National Museum of Taiwan Literature Thanks Donors for 2025; Collection Now Over 130,000 Items</h1>
            <p>Today, the National Museum of Taiwan Literature (NMTL) honored and thanked 29 groups of people who donated literary items in 2025. These items cover a period of 100 years, from the Japanese colonial era to today. With these donations, the museum's collection has grown to more than 130,000 items since it opened 22 years ago.</p>
            <p>The NMTL stated today that in 2025, they received 27 donations of literary items and collected items for two complete works projects. These items include handwritten papers, photos, calligraphy, oil paintings, family letters, letters from literary friends, and literary objects. They show the history of Taiwanese literature and the lives of writers at different times.</p>
            <p>The NMTL explained that donated items must go through a careful review before they can be added to the collection. Once accepted, items are repaired and kept safe using scientific methods and the newest AI technology. The museum is also working hard to make its collection digital. They do this by building databases, publishing books, holding exhibitions, and making digital games. This helps to show the collection in many ways and makes it available for people to use.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the NMTL invites scholars and creators from different fields to visit the museum, read, and study the items through its "Resident Researcher and Creator Program." This program helps create new areas for research and writing.</p>
            <p>The NMTL says that keeping historical items is the main work of a museum. It is also the basis for research, exhibitions, and other uses in the future. The NMTL is now in its 22nd year and has collected over 130,000 items related to Taiwanese literature. The museum hopes that more people will continue to donate items. This will make the national museum's collection available to everyone and become an important basis for studying the history and creation of Taiwanese literature.</p>
