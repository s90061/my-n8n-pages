            <h1>Air Force Commander Asks Soldiers to Keep Fighting Spirit on 88th Anniversary of 814 Victory</h1>
            <p>General Cheng Jung-Feng, the head of the Air Force, led a ceremony today. It was to remember the 88th anniversary of the "814 Air Battle Victory." He told all the soldiers to keep the spirit of fighting strong. He also asked them to improve their skills and make the country's defense better. He said this will help them continue to have the public's support and trust.</p>
            <p>The Military News Agency reported today that the Air Force Command held the "814 Air Battle Victory 88th Anniversary" event. General Cheng congratulated the soldiers who received awards for their good work, their excellent examples, sports wins, and team prizes. He praised their hard work during the year and hoped it would make all soldiers want to do even better.</p>
            <p>During the event, General Cheng talked about the history of the 814 Air Battle victory. He said that in 1937, above Jianqiao Airport in Hangzhou, Colonel Kao Chih-Hang was the first to shoot down an enemy plane. This was the first victory in the war and gave courage to all soldiers and people. It also set up the spirit of "no enemy can beat us, bravely facing danger, winning against many with few, and winning against strong with weak." He said that even though times are hard now, the military must continue the spirit of those who fought before. They must strongly protect the country and its freedom.</p>
            <p>General Cheng gave four hopes to the soldiers. First, he asked them to "get good at their jobs and be well-known." He wants soldiers to not only be good at their main duties but also to learn new things based on their interests. He wants them to use new technology to improve themselves. Second, he said, "Learning foreign languages is useful for life." He told them to use the military's plan to learn two languages and take classes. This will help them talk with people from other countries and do their jobs well.</p>
            <p>Third, he said to "follow rules and orders." General Cheng explained that following safety steps is very important to stay safe and keep the military strong. They must follow all rules for their work to go smoothly. Finally, he asked soldiers to "love their country, love their work, and love their people." He said that by having a good image and good behavior, they can get public support. In times of war, they should protect the country's safety with loyalty and good skills.</p>
            <p>General Cheng ended by telling all soldiers to remember the brave actions of the heroes in the 814 Air Battle. He wants them to continue the spirit of fighting, work safely and professionally, and bring all people together to protect the country. This will help keep the country safe and bring peace to the area.</p>

            <p>The hosts for the 60th Golden Bell Awards red carpet, Huang Deng-Hui, Huang Di-Yang, Hsia Ho-Hsi, and Mu Mu, appeared in public today. Hsia Ho-Hsi wants to be in the best shape for the red carpet. He plans to lose weight from 68 kilograms to 60 kilograms in three months. Huang Di-Yang said he does not read comments to avoid feeling stressed.</p>
            <p>Each host for this year's red carpet has a special role. Hsia Ho-Hsi and Mu Mu (Lin Wei-Ni) will host for the TV programs. Huang Deng-Hui and Huang Di-Yang will host for the TV dramas. Huang Deng-Hui said he is the "good looks" person. Mu Mu (Lin Wei-Ni) is the "energy" person. Huang Di-Yang said he is the "rhythm" person. Hsia Ho-Hsi wants to be the "sexy" person. He also shared that he will lose weight by controlling what he eats and exercising to look his best.</p>
            <p>Huang Di-Yang is very happy to work with Huang Deng-Hui. He said they have known each other for three years and are in the same badminton club. They work so well together that they can catch a ball without even looking at each other. So, hosting together should be easy for them. Huang Deng-Hui joked that his wife gave him special advice: "Don't talk, because you look better in photos without sound."</p>
            <p>Huang Di-Yang hosted the first Taipei Drama Awards and received many good reviews. He said he rarely reads comments because he does not want to feel stressed.
