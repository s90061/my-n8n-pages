Many parents worry about how much time their children spend looking at screens, like phones and tablets. Recent studies are trying to understand if there is a link between this screen time and children's mental health. Some new research suggests that using screens for many hours a day might be connected to problems like anxiety or depression in young people.

However, the studies also show that it's not just about the amount of time. What children do on screens is also very important. For example, using screens for learning or creative activities might be different from just watching videos for hours. Experts say that parents should focus on the quality of screen use and encourage a good balance with other activities, like playing outside, reading, and spending time with family and friends. It's about finding a healthy digital lifestyle for children.

**Work: How AI is Changing Office Jobs**

Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is starting to change how people work in offices around the world. Many companies are using AI tools to help employees with daily tasks. For example, AI can write emails, create reports, and even summarize long documents. This means that some parts of a job that used to take a long time can now be done much faster.

This change is making some workers worried about losing their jobs to machines. However, experts say that AI is more likely to change jobs rather than completely replace them. People will need to learn new skills to work with AI tools. The future of work might involve people and AI working together, with AI handling the routine tasks and humans focusing on more creative and complex problems that need human thought.

**Travel: The Rise of "Slow Travel" and Unique Experiences**

As summer approaches, new travel trends are becoming popular. Instead of rushing to see many famous places, more and more people are choosing "slow travel." This means staying longer in one place, getting to know the local culture, and experiencing life like the people who live there. It's about enjoying the journey, not just the destination.

Travelers are also looking for more unique and personal experiences. This includes staying in unusual places, trying local food, or taking part in special activities like cooking classes or nature tours. People want to feel a deeper connection to the places they visit, rather than just taking photos. This trend also supports smaller, local businesses and helps to make tourism more sustainable for the environment and local communities.
