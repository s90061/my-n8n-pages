Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to change almost 60% of jobs in advanced countries, according to a recent report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This new technology will affect a large part of the global workforce.

The IMF's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, explained that AI could either create new opportunities or increase inequality. She highlighted that about half of the jobs could be affected by AI, with some tasks being replaced and others benefiting from AI tools. Jobs requiring higher skills might see more positive impacts, like increased productivity. However, lower-skilled jobs could face more risks of being replaced.

The report suggests that governments need to prepare for these changes. They should create policies to support workers, such as offering new training programs. This will help people adapt to the changing job market and ensure that the benefits of AI are shared widely, rather than just helping a few. The goal is to manage this shift so that AI helps economic growth without leaving many people behind.

**Spain Grapples with Severe Drought and Water Shortages**

Spain is facing one of its worst droughts in decades, leading to serious water shortages across the country, especially in the northeast region of Catalonia. The lack of rain has caused water levels in reservoirs to drop to critically low points. This situation is significantly affecting daily life, agriculture, and the important tourism industry.

Authorities in affected areas have introduced strict rules to save water. These measures include limiting water use for watering gardens, filling swimming pools, and washing cars. Businesses like hotels and restaurants are also being asked to reduce their water consumption. Farmers, who rely heavily on water for crops, are experiencing significant challenges, with many losing parts of their harvest.

The prolonged dry spell is a clear sign of climate change impacting Europe. Scientists predict that such extreme weather events will become more common in the future. In response, the Spanish government is looking into long-term solutions, such as improving water recycling systems and building more desalination plants to turn seawater into fresh water. Residents are also encouraged to be more careful with water use in their homes to help manage the crisis.

**Sustainable Travel Gains Popularity Among Tourists**

More and more travellers are choosing sustainable tourism options, showing a growing awareness of their environmental and social impact. This trend means people are looking for ways to travel that protect the planet and local communities, rather than harming them. It's about enjoying new places responsibly.

Travellers are becoming more interested in reducing their carbon footprint. This includes choosing to travel by train instead of plane, staying in eco-friendly hotels, and supporting local businesses. They also want to learn about and respect the cultures of the places they visit. This shift is driven by a desire to make travel more meaningful and less damaging to sensitive ecosystems and historic sites.

The travel industry is responding to this demand. Many tour operators and hotel chains are now offering green packages and promoting eco-friendly practices. This business shift is not just about protecting the environment; it also helps local economies by creating jobs and supporting small businesses. As climate concerns grow, sustainable travel is expected to become an even larger part of the global tourism market.`;
