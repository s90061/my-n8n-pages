            <h1>UK Judge Gives 8-Year Sentence to Nursery Worker for Harming 21 Babies and Young Children</h1>
            <p>A judge in the UK today sent a nursery worker to prison for 8 years. The worker was accused of hurting babies and young children many times without any reason. The judge called these actions "abusive."</p>
            <p>News reports say that the person on trial was Roksana Lecka, a 22-year-old woman from London. In one case, she was accused of kicking a small boy's face many times.</p>
            <p>Lecka said she was guilty of 7 crimes of "child abuse against children under 16." She was also found guilty of 14 other crimes after a trial. She said she did these bad things because she used marijuana.</p>
            <p>Judge Sarah Plaschkes said that Lecka did "many acts of violence for no reason" while working at two nurseries in London. The judge said this when she decided on Lecka's punishment for hurting 21 babies and young children.</p>
            <p>Plaschkes said, "You pinched them, hit them, punched them, slapped them, and kicked them. You also pulled their ears, hair, and toes. You threw children headfirst into their beds. You purposely made the children suffer when they were just playing quietly and happily by themselves... What you did was truly abuse."</p>
            <p>Lecka's bad actions were found out in June 2024. At that time, someone saw her pinching several children. The police were called and they looked at video from the nursery. They found many cases of child abuse.</p>
            <p>The parents of the children who were hurt gave statements to Kingston Crown Court in London. They said that the abuse made them feel very sad and guilty.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says More People Will Be Charged After Ex-FBI Chief Comey Is Charged</h1>
            <p>After the US Justice Department charged James Comey, the former head of the FBI, President Trump said more people he sees as his "enemies" will also be charged. Some people say Trump is using the Justice Department to get revenge. But Trump says it is okay because of what happened to him.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 25, the US Justice Department charged James Comey. They said he made false statements and blocked justice. A few days before this, Trump openly asked Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, to act against Comey and other people he saw as his enemies. Comey was accused of making false statements and blocking justice during the investigation into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
            <p>Trump said on the White House lawn, "There will be other people (charged). I mean, those people are very bad. They are bad, very left-wing Democrats." He also said charging Comey was about "showing justice," not revenge.</p>
            <p>Critics say this is a big change for the Justice Department, making it political. This is because it looks like the President is telling them directly who to charge with crimes.</p>
            <p>Trump defended his actions by talking about how the Democratic government charged him many times after he left office the first time. He said, "They did this to me for four years. They went after me for four full years."</p>
            <p>Last weekend, Trump posted on social media, "Truth Social." He told Attorney General Bondi to charge Comey. He also told her to take action against Adam Schiff, a Democratic Senator from California. Schiff led the first attempt to remove Trump from office when he was in the House of Representatives. Trump also named Letitia James, a Democratic Attorney General from New York State. She sued him for fraud last year.</p>
            <p>At that time, Trump wrote, "They tried to remove me from office two times, and they charged me with crimes 5 times! All of it was for no reason. Justice must be done, right now!"</p>
            <p>The Justice Department has started investigations into James and Schiff. They are accused of mortgage fraud. Both of them say they are innocent. They say the investigations are for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Last month, the FBI searched the home and office of John Bolton, who was Trump's National Security Advisor during his first term. They were looking into whether he handled secret documents wrongly. Bolton has strongly criticized Trump since he left his job.</p>
            <p>During his 2024 election campaign, Trump promised to get revenge. But later, he changed his mind and said that winning the election would be his best revenge.</p>

            <h1>Gold Mine Collapse in Nigeria, At Least 100 People May Have Died</h1>
            <p>People living in Nigeria and those who survived said today that a gold mine in Zamfara State has fallen down. They believe at least 100 people may have died.</p>
            <p>People who saw what happened told Reuters that the mine, located in the Maru local government area, collapsed yesterday. Rescue efforts are still happening today.</p>
            <p>Sanusi Auwal, a local resident helping with the rescue, said that at least 13 bodies have been pulled out of the fallen mine. His cousin was one of them.</p>
            <p>He told Reuters by phone, "More than 100 miners were inside the mine when it fell."</p>
            <p>Isa Sani, who was hurt and is now getting medical help, told reporters, "We are lucky to be saved alive. Out of more than 100 people, only 15 were rescued."</p>
            <p>Muhammadu Isa from the Zamfara State Miners Association confirmed the accident. He also said that some rescuers died from not being able to breathe while digging out the victims.</p>
            <p>Illegal mining is very common in Zamfara State, Nigeria. Armed gangs often control the gold mines there. Because of this, violent and deadly accidents happen often.</p>
