            <h1>Trump Government Asks Supreme Court to Keep Freezing Almost $5 Billion in Foreign Aid</h1>
            <p>The government of US President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court today for special permission. They want to continue to stop billions of dollars in foreign aid.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press said the main problem in this legal case is that Trump said last month he would not use almost $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress had approved.</p>
            <p>Last week, Judge Amir Ali from a federal court in Washington decided that Trump's government might have broken the law by holding back this money.</p>
            <p>On August 28, Trump wrote a letter to Mike Johnson, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives. He said he would not use $4.9 billion in foreign aid that Congress approved. This means he was cutting the budget without Congress's agreement.</p>
            <p>Trump used a method called "pocket rescission." This happens when the president asks Congress not to spend approved money near the end of the financial year. If Congress cannot act within 45 days, the money is not used and becomes invalid. The US financial year ends at the end of September.</p>
            <p>Judge Ali said that the law clearly states that the government can only hold back money if Congress agrees to cancel it.</p>
            <p>After a group of federal appeals judges refused to stop Ali's decision, Trump's government asked the Supreme Court for help.</p>
            <p>Lawyers from the US Justice Department told a federal judge last month that another $6.5 billion in aid, which was also frozen, would be used before the financial year ends on September 30.</p>
            <p>This case has been in court for many months. Non-profit groups suing the government say that freezing the aid breaks federal law. They also say it has stopped help for very important life-saving programs overseas.</p>

            <h1>Democratic Lawmakers Show Rude Letter, Say Trump Wrote It, White House Says No</h1>
            <p>Today, Democratic members of the US House of Representatives shared a rude letter. They said President Trump wrote it to wish rich criminal Jeffrey Epstein a happy birthday in 2003. The White House later said this was not true.</p>
            <p>In mid-July, The Wall Street Journal reported that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell collected birthday cards Epstein received for his 50th birthday in 2003. One card had Trump's name on it and some words typed. It also had a drawing of a naked woman's body shape, which looked hand-drawn.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal said: "The person who later became president signed a curvy 'Donald' below her waist, like pubic hair. The letter ended with 'Happy Birthday, may every day be another beautiful secret.'" Trump said this report was false.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is looking into how Epstein's criminal cases were handled. US news channel CNBC said that pictures of the letter that Democratic lawmakers on the committee shared on social media today looked like what The Wall Street Journal reported.</p>
            <p>The White House said today that Trump did not sign or draw the birthday card for Epstein.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, wrote on X (a social media platform): "As I have said many times, this drawing was clearly not drawn by President Trump, and he did not sign it."</p>
            <p>Leavitt also said that reports about this rude letter are "false." She added that Trump's lawyers will continue to take strong legal action against The Wall Street Journal.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Go Up a Little as Market Considers OPEC+ Increasing Production Slowly</h1>
            <p>Today, global oil prices went up a little. This happened as the market thought about two things: OPEC+ decided to slowly produce more oil in October, and Saudi Aramco lowered the price of crude oil for Asian buyers.</p>
            <p>The price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for delivery in October went up by 39 cents. It reached $62.26 per barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
            <p>The price for Brent crude oil from the North Sea for delivery in November went up by 52 cents. It reached $66.02 per barrel in London.</p>
