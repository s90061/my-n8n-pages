            <h1>Market expects Fed to cut interest rates next week; US stock indexes hit new highs</h1>
            <p>The market believes the US central bank will lower interest rates next week, and the three main US stock indexes have reached new high levels.</p>
            <p>Today, in New York, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq stock indexes all closed at new record highs. This happened because new information about inflation and the number of people asking for unemployment benefits made people think the Federal Reserve (Fed) will cut interest rates next week.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 617.08 points, or 1.36%, closing at 46108.00 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up by 55.43 points, or 0.85%, closing at 6587.47 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, went up by 157.01 points, or 0.72%, closing at 22043.07 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also rose by 37.30 points, or 0.63%, to 5995.39 points.</p>

            <h1>Oil prices fall about 2% due to worries about too much supply globally and weaker US demand</h1>
            <p>Oil prices dropped by about 2% today. This happened because people are worried that there is too much oil in the world and that the US will not need as much. These worries were stronger than concerns about oil supply problems caused by conflicts in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures went down by $1.12, or 1.7%, to close at $66.37 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures went down by $1.30, or 2.0%, to close at $62.37.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu promises: There will never be a Palestinian state</h1>
            <p>Today, in Jerusalem, the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, spoke at a ceremony for a settlement plan in the West Bank. He promised that he would not allow a Palestinian state to be created.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said at the event in Maale Adumim, an Israeli settlement: "There will never be a Palestinian state. This land belongs to us."</p>
            <p>He added, "We will protect our history, our land, and our safety... We will make the number of people living in this city twice as big."</p>
            <p>The Prime Minister's office showed this event live.</p>
            <p>Israel has wanted to build on an area called E1, which is about 12 square kilometers. But because other countries did not agree, this plan has been stopped for many years.</p>
            <p>Last month, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister, supported building about 3,400 homes in this very important area.</p>
            <p>This announcement caused many people to speak against it. The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said that it would really divide the West Bank into two parts. He said this would be a "big danger" to having a connected Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>Several Western countries, including the UK and France, have said they plan to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations later this month.</p>
