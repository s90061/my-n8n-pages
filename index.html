            <h1>iPhone Sales Are Strong: Apple Expects Higher Income Than Expected in the Next Quarter</h1>
            <p>Apple Inc. said today that its income for the fourth financial quarter will be much higher than what experts on Wall Street thought. This is because many people bought iPhones earlier to avoid new taxes from US President Trump, which made iPhone sales very good last quarter.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Kevan Parekh, Apple's chief financial officer, said that Apple expects its income to grow by a "middle to high single-digit" percentage in the fourth financial quarter. This is more than the 3.27% growth that analysts from LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group) predicted, which was 98.04 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>LSEG data also shows that Apple's sales in the third financial quarter were better than expected, and this was the highest growth in at least four years.</p>
            <p>However, CEO Tim Cook told analysts during a meeting that the taxes caused Apple to lose 800 million US dollars in the third financial quarter. He added that the company might lose another 1.1 billion US dollars in the fourth quarter because of these taxes.</p>
            <p>Apple announced that its income for the third financial quarter, which ended on June 28, went up by almost 10% to 94.04 billion US dollars. This was more than the 89.54 billion US dollars that LSEG analysts had predicted. The company also earned 1.57 US dollars per share in the third financial quarter, which was more than the expected 1.43 US dollars.</p>
            <p>After Apple announced its good predictions, its stock price went up by 3% in after-hours trading today, showing continued growth.</p>
            <p>Apple, which is based in Cupertino, California, said that sales of its most popular product, the iPhone, went up by 13.5% to 44.58 billion US dollars. This was better than the 40.22 billion US dollars that analysts had predicted.</p>
            <p>It is still not clear what taxes many of Apple's products might face in the future, as many currently do not have these taxes. Sales in Apple's Americas business (which includes the US) went up by 9.3% to 41.2 billion US dollars. This is the region that might be affected by the taxes.</p>
            <p>Even though there have been long delays in getting approval for Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features in Greater China, sales in the third financial quarter were still higher than expected, reaching 15.37 billion US dollars. This was also more than the 15.12 billion US dollars that five analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha research platform had predicted.</p>
            <p>This growth in sales in China during the third quarter is a change from the second financial quarter, when sales there went down compared to the previous year.</p>
            <p>Cook told Reuters that Apple had record numbers of people changing to new iPhones, Macs, and Apple Watches this quarter. He also said that about one percentage point of the 9.6% sales growth in the third financial quarter was because customers bought products earlier to avoid possible taxes.</p>
            <p>Apple stated that its gross profit margin was 46.5% in the third financial quarter, which was better than the 45.9% estimated by LSEG. Apple also expects its gross profit margin for the fourth financial quarter to be between 46% and 47%, which is also better than LSEG's estimate of 45.9%.

            <h1>LPGA British Open First Day: Hsu Wei-ling Finishes with 71 Strokes, Tied for 30th Place</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 1st, Central News Agency reporter Chen Jung-chen) The final major championship of the LPGA season, the British Open, had its first round today. Taiwanese golfer Hsu Wei-ling made 5 birdies, had 2 bogeys, and 1 double bogey. She finished with a score of 71, which is one stroke under par. She is currently tied for 30th place, 4 strokes behind the leader.</p>
            <p>The British Open has a total prize money of 9.5 million US dollars (about 280 million New Taiwan dollars). It is the last of the five major tournaments in the LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association) season. This year, for the first time in the tournament's history, it is being held in Wales. Three Taiwanese female golfers made it into the main event: former world number one Yani Tseng, Hsu Wei-ling, and Chien Pei-yun.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first round, Taiwanese golfer Hsu Wei-ling did not play well at first, getting bogeys one after another. But luckily, she started to play better, getting birdies on holes 9, 10, and 13. Even though she made a mistake on hole 16 and got a double bogey, she quickly recovered. She finished the last two holes with good birdies, making her total score 71, which is one stroke under par.</p>
            <p>After the game, Hsu Wei-ling told reporters that her overall performance today was good. She said there were a few small mistakes in the middle, especially at the start when she and her caddie disagreed a little on which club to use. But she was able to get back on track later. She was especially excited after making a long putt for a birdie on the 17th hole, which made the whole crowd cheer loudly.</p>
            <p>Also, "Smiling Queen" Yani Tseng, who has won the British Open twice before, finished the first round with 2 birdies and 2 bogeys, making her score 72, which is even with par. She is temporarily tied for 51st place. She felt her performance was good and she was not nervous on the course, which allowed her to play freely. She hopes to be more aggressive with her putting in the second round and to deal with the strong wind. (Edited by Wu Su-jou) 2025/08/01</p>

            <h1>Trump's Envoy Meets Israeli Prime Minister, Goes to Gaza to Help with Humanitarian Crisis and Push for Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>(Jerusalem, August 1st, Central News Agency via foreign wires) Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East, met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today. After that, he will go to Gaza to see how aid supplies are being given out. The serious hunger crisis there is making more and more countries ask for a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Witkoff met with Netanyahu soon after arriving in Israel. Witkoff has been part of talks for a ceasefire and a deal to free hostages, but these talks have not moved forward for several months.</p>
            <p>US President Trump also posted on his social media platform "Truth Social" saying: "The fastest way to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is for Hamas to give up and free the hostages!!"</p>
            <p>After this meeting, a high-ranking Israeli official said that Israel and the US are starting to agree that the plan to free some hostages should grow to include freeing all hostages, taking away weapons from the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, and making Gaza a non-military zone.</p>
            <p>The official did not share the details of the plan. But he added that Israel and the US will work to send more humanitarian aid while still fighting in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The White House announced that Witkoff is expected to go to Gaza tomorrow to check on the situation.</p>
            <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Witkoff, who visited Gaza in January, will visit "places where supplies are given out to make sure there is a plan to provide more food. He will also meet with people in Gaza to hear about the difficult situation there directly."</p>
            <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul also met with Netanyahu in Jerusalem and later said: "The humanitarian disaster in Gaza is worse than anyone can imagine."</p>
            <p>He said: "The Israeli government must act quickly, safely, and effectively to provide humanitarian and medical help to stop a big famine from happening. I feel that this point was understood today."</p>
            <p>On the evening of July 30th, the Israeli army fired at a crowd trying to stop aid trucks. At least 58 Palestinians died. Gaza's civil defense agency said this is an example of the deadly problems faced by aid work in the area. (Translated by Chen Yu-ting/Reviewed by Chang Hsiao-wen) 2025/08/01</p>
