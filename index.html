            <h1>Denmark's Prime Minister Apologizes to Greenlandic Women for Forced Birth Control During Colonial Times</h1>
            <p>The Prime Minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, officially said sorry today in Greenland. She apologized to women who were forced to have birth control. This birth control plan caused deep physical and mental pain to Greenlandic people. It also made the relationship between Greenland and Denmark, its former ruler, difficult.</p>
            <p>News reports from AFP and Reuters say that from the late 1960s to 1992, the Danish government put IUDs (a type of birth control) into about 4,500 Greenlandic women without their permission. They did this to control the number of people on the island. This was about half of all women in Greenland who could have children at that time. The youngest girls were only 12 or 13 years old.</p>
            <p>Mette Frederiksen, wearing black, said at the apology ceremony in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, "I believe that if we are not brave enough to talk about the darkest parts of our history, we cannot achieve the fair and proper relationship many people want."</p>
            <p>Frederiksen told the victims, "So, my apology today is not only about the past. It is also about now and the future, and the trust that must be between us."</p>
            <p>Many of the women who were hurt had strong stomach pain. Some even lost the ability to have children and suffered mental and physical harm.</p>
            <p>Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, also wearing black, said, "Receiving an apology does not mean we accept what happened. But what we do next is up to all of us."</p>
            <p>Many victims, also wearing black, listened to Frederiksen's apology and often wiped away tears.</p>
            <p>Kirstine Berthelsen, a 66-year-old retired woman, told reporters that she had two ectopic pregnancies, stayed in the hospital for a long time, had surgery, and had one fallopian tube removed. All these problems were related to the IUDs.</p>
            <p>Berthelsen said that hearing the apology in person was very important to her.</p>
            <p>She said, "This way, I can continue my life and not let hate, anger, and bad feelings take over me inside."</p>

            <h1>Reuters: G7 and EU Think About Setting a Minimum Price for Rare Earths and Taxing Some Chinese Goods</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that four people familiar with the matter said the Group of Seven (G7) countries and the European Union (EU) are thinking about setting a lowest price for rare earths. They are also thinking about adding taxes to some rare earth products that China sends to other countries.</p>
            <p>Rare earths are types of metals that are hard to dig up. They are very important for making things like mobile phones, cars, and advanced weapons. China makes most of the world's rare earths. In April this year, China put limits on how much rare earth metal it would send out of the country. This was a response to taxes that the United States put on Chinese goods.</p>
            <p>Except for Japan, G7 countries depend a lot, or completely, on China for many materials. These include rare earth magnets and metals for batteries. To deal with this problem, G7 leaders started a "Critical Minerals Action Plan" in June. A team of experts had a meeting about this in Chicago earlier this month.</p>
            <p>One person who knows about the meeting said that the main topic was whether to make rules stronger for foreign companies that want to invest in important materials. This would stop companies from going to China. However, they are still not sure if they will take strong actions against China. Australia also joined this meeting.</p>
            <p>This person also said that another idea was to set geographical limits. But the G7 countries did not all agree on this. These limits could include rules to buy locally or to limit buying from certain countries like China when governments buy things for public use.</p>
            <p>Two other people said that the G7 also talked about adding a carbon tax or a regular tax on rare earths and small amounts of other metals from China. The tax amount would depend on how much non-renewable energy was used to make them.</p>
            <p>It is said that officials are considering setting a minimum price with help from government money. The United States recently did this to help its own companies make more products. Australia is also thinking about setting a minimum price to support projects for important minerals like rare earths.</p>
            <p>A fourth person, an unnamed EU official, said that the EU is looking at many ideas. These include a minimum price, buying things together, and special agreements within the G7. But no decisions have been made yet.</p>

            <h1>US Lowers Taxes on Cars from the EU to 15%, Starting from August 1st</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States said it will lower the import tax on cars from the European Union (EU) to 15%. This change started on August 1st, meaning it applies to things that happened in the past. This is to follow the rules of a trade agreement that both sides announced before.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, documents from the US Department of Commerce and the Office of the US Trade Representative show that the tax on cars from the EU will go down from 27.5% to 15%.</p>
            <p>In July this year, US President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a basic agreement. This agreement said that most products sent from the EU to the US would have a 15% tax. The decision to lower taxes on cars and car parts depended on whether the EU made laws to lower its own taxes on US industrial products and some basic farm products.</p>
            <p>The EU already took action in August. This made it possible for the Trump government to change the car taxes for past events. This was done to protect the car industry, which is very important for Europe.</p>
            <p>The documents also say that from September 1st, some industries will not have to pay these taxes. These include airplanes, airplane parts, generic medicines and their ingredients, and some metals and ores.</p>
            <p>The US statement also said that the list of goods might change again.</p>
