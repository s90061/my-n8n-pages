The Ministry of Labor announced today that the Labor Fund lost 92.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars in May. This was because of big changes in exchange rates. By the end of May this year, the fund had lost a total of 291.97 billion New Taiwan Dollars, with a return rate of -4.26%.

The Labor Fund's total size is 6.8949 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, and its return rate is -4.26%. Different parts of the fund have different rules for what they can invest in. The New Labor Pension Fund is 4.5549 trillion New Taiwan Dollars with a -4.32% return. The Old Labor Pension Fund is 1.0282 trillion New Taiwan Dollars with a -4.17% return. The Labor Insurance Fund is 1.0804 trillion New Taiwan Dollars with a -4.66% return.

In May, the Labor Fund lost about 92.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The New Labor Pension Fund alone lost 73.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars that month. The Bureau of Labor Funds said that in May, many important things happened. At the start of May, there were good signs about trade talks between the US and China, which helped improve market feelings. But the talks still need more time. In Taiwan, the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger against the US Dollar in May, which put pressure on companies that export goods and affected market confidence.

The Bureau also said that in May, the stock market went up, but the exchange rates changed a lot. This caused losses in foreign investments. However, exchange rates usually go back to normal over time. The Bureau of Labor Funds has changed its investments based on market changes and is investing carefully.

**Ministry of Education Increases Grants for Students: Up to NT$500,000 for International Competitions**

The Ministry of Education announced today that the Education Property Fund will give more money to students. Students who take part in international competitions can get up to 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars. For competitions across different cities in Taiwan, they can get up to 200,000 New Taiwan Dollars. This is to encourage schools to find and train students with special skills.

The Education Property Fund started more than 300 years ago. People who cared about education gave land to build schools. The Ministry of Education uses the money from renting out this land to help students from low-income families, give money for emergencies, and pay students who work. This shows that the money "comes from education and is used for education." The Ministry of Education said today in a press release that the Education Property Fund has changed two rules. The changes are about "helping students with special skills who need support" and "helping groups that assist students who need care."

To help schools train more talented students, the Ministry of Education has changed the rules to include students from families facing special difficulties, problems, or poverty. They have also greatly increased the amount of money given. For teams going to international competitions, the money increased from 300,000 to 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars. For competitions in Taiwan, it increased from 100,000 to 200,000 New Taiwan Dollars. Individual students can get up to 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars. They also give money for events to show off students' achievements.

Also, students who schools identify as needing help, or young people that organizations say need care, can now get money from the Education Property Fund. This gives more professional help to students who are not doing well in school. They also increased the money for psychological counseling to 1,600 New Taiwan Dollars per session, and up to 24 sessions per person per year. More information can be found on the National Dahu Agricultural and Industrial Vocational High School website, which is in charge of this program for the Ministry of Education.

**9 People in Hong Kong Get Awards for National Security Work, Some Were Sanctioned by US**

Today is the 28th anniversary of Hong Kong returning to China and also the 5th anniversary of the National Security Law in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government announced that 427 people will receive awards and honors. Nine of these people got awards for their "contributions to national security." Some of them were put on a list by the US earlier this year, meaning the US has taken action against them.

To celebrate the 28th anniversary of the handover, the Hong Kong government held a flag-raising ceremony and a party. They also announced the names of people receiving awards. The Chief Executive, John Lee, congratulated everyone who received an award. He especially mentioned that 9 people did great work in protecting national security. John Lee said, "They carried out their duties firmly and bravely, even when outside forces attacked and pressured them. They actively helped to put the 'Hong Kong National Security Law' and the 'Ordinance for Safeguarding National Security' into practice. They made great contributions and should be given awards."

The Hong Kong government released a list of 427 award winners. The 9 people mentioned include Teresa Cheng, the Secretary for Justice; Raymond Siu, the former Commissioner of Police; Lau Chi-hong, the former Deputy Commissioner of Police (National Security); Erick Tsang, the Secretary-General of the Hong Kong National Security Committee; and Oscar Kwok, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (National Security). All of them received the Gold Bauhinia Star.

After Hong Kong put the National Security Law into action in 2020, the US announced sanctions against former Chief Executive Carrie Lam and other high-ranking Hong Kong officials. In March this year, the US State Department announced new sanctions against 6 Hong Kong and Beijing officials. These included Teresa Cheng, Raymond Siu (who was the Commissioner of Police at the time), and Erick Tsang. The Gold Bauhinia Star is the second-highest award, after the Grand Bauhinia Medal. There are also other awards like the Silver Bauhinia Star, the Distinguished Service Medals for disciplined services and the Independent Commission Against Corruption, and the Bronze Bauhinia Star.
