            <h1>Trump: US-Mexico Talks Extended 90 Days, 25% Tariff Remains</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 31st, combined foreign reports) Today, US President Trump said that after talking with Mexican President Sheinbaum, the US and Mexico will have 90 days to discuss. During this time, the current 25% tax on goods will not change.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that his call with Claudia Sheinbaum was "very successful, and we are understanding each other more and more."</p>
            <p>Trump explained that goods from Mexico going into the US will still have a 25% tax. This tax was put on Mexico by Trump, supposedly because of the issue of fentanyl drug dealing.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that cars will have a 25% tax, and copper, aluminum, and steel will have a 50% tax.</p>
            <p>After Trump's announcement, Sheinbaum said today that Mexico will try to reach a long-term agreement with the US to avoid these taxes.</p>
            <p>She stated, "We avoided more taxes... and got 90 days to talk and reach a long-term agreement."</p>

            <h1>Xinzhuang Suitcase Body Case: Police Identify Man as Main Suspect After Weeks</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, New Taipei, July 31st, by Huang Xusheng and Zhao Minya) Regarding the case of a body found in a suitcase in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City, police said late at night that after tirelessly checking surveillance cameras, they finally found footage of the body being left there from 22 days ago. They have identified a man named Chen as a main suspect and have arrested him. They are now trying to understand why he might have done it.</p>
            <p>The Xinzhuang Police Precinct said around 11:30 PM that on July 28th, they received a report about a red suitcase found in a ditch at the end of Lane 381, Xintai Road, Xinzhuang District. Inside was the body of a man who had been dead for many days. After an examination, a forensic doctor believed the man was about 60 years old and had been dead for more than 10 days. There were no clear external injuries on his body.</p>
            <p>The Xinzhuang Precinct stated that they asked the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. A special team was formed. They interviewed nearly a hundred people living nearby. They also sent out their "Hawk-Eye Team" to tirelessly check more surveillance camera footage day and night.</p>
            <p>The special team said that 30 police officers were planned to use the victim's features to search in the criminal system, trying to find out who he was. During this process, it was difficult to identify the victim, and because the body had been in the ditch for a long time, the investigation became stuck for a while.</p>
            <p>Police said that luckily, they narrowed down the search area during their interviews. The Hawk-Eye Team worked all night, checking 22 days of surveillance video, and finally, there was a breakthrough in the case. Police identified a man named Chen as a major suspect. He was seen near the crime scene around July 6th. He is suspected of leaving the body and then running away.</p>
            <p>Police found the suspect overnight and went to a house on Zhongping Road in Xinzhuang District to arrest him. They will now find out his relationship with the dead person, why he did it, and also the identity of the dead person and the cause of death.</p>
