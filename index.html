            <h1>Pacific Islands Forum Does Not Invite US, China, Taiwan; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Asks to Keep Current System</h1>
            <p>The Pacific Islands Forum will be held in September. China put pressure to exclude Taiwan. The Solomon Islands, which is hosting the event, decided to invite only member countries. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that the final plan is still waiting for the host country to announce it. The Ministry also asked to keep the current system, saying that Taiwan's involvement can help bring peace and success to the Pacific region.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) will happen in the Solomon Islands in September. After Beijing asked for Taiwan to be left out, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Jeremiah Manele said on August 6 that representatives from 21 donor countries like the United States and China, and Taiwan, will not be invited.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to a question from CNA this evening. They said that they know the 54th PIF summit, from September 8 to 12, will only have member countries. This is because the Solomon Islands, as the host country, believes that the PIF's system for partners, called "regional organization structure rearrangement," is not yet finished. So, they have decided for now not to invite any PIF "Dialogue Partners" or "Development Partners." The host country will announce the final plan later.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that Taiwan has been involved in all PIF activities as a "Development Partner" since 1993. Taiwan has also attended the "Taiwan/Republic of China- Forum Countries Dialogue," which is set up by the PIF Secretariat during the summit. In these meetings, Taiwan talks with member countries.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks to keep the current system. Taiwan has always followed "The Pacific Way" when dealing with Pacific matters. This means being open and including everyone, just like other PIF member countries. Taiwan believes its involvement can help it work more with PIF, its friends in the Pacific, and other like-minded countries. This can help bring peace, stability, and growth to the Pacific region.</p>

            <h1>Sun Chia-hung is Taiwan's Flag Bearer for World Games, Says It's "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>The opening ceremony for the 2025 Chengdu World Games happened today. Sun Chia-hung became the first Wushu athlete to carry the flag for the Taiwan team. He was very excited and said this moment felt like something from a dream.</p>
            <p>At the last World Games in Birmingham, the Taiwan team won 1 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze medals. For this World Games in Chengdu, Taiwan has sent 120 athletes in 14 different sports. The women's tug-of-war team will try to win their sixth gold medal in the 500 kg category, which would be a new record.</p>
            <p>At today's opening ceremony for the Chengdu World Games, Sun Chia-hung and Huang Mei-chien were the flag bearers for the Taiwan team. They were the 104th team to enter, placed between Syria and the Czech Republic. A total of 64 athletes from Taiwan took part in the ceremony, representing sports such as canoe polo, korfball, orienteering, aquatic sports, roller sports, water skiing, wushu, and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-hung won a gold medal in Tai Chi Quan and a silver medal in Tai Chi Sword at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now he is back in Chengdu and is the first Wushu athlete to be a flag bearer. He told the media he was very emotional, saying this moment felt like a dream he had since childhood. He added, "I think this is a process of building up. Many older athletes before me did very well, and together we have made Taiwan's Wushu known and respected in international competitions."</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-chien, a swimmer who competed in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has recently been focusing more on coaching. However, she still actively competes in fin swimming. In 2024, she even won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fin category at the World Fin Swimming Championships. Huang Mei-chien said that she has been an athlete's oath representative and a torch bearer before, but being a flag bearer is a first for her. "I am very excited and a little nervous," she said, "I hope to do this task well."</p>
