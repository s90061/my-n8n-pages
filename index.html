            <h1>Public Vote and Removals Fail on August 23rd: Scholar Says DPP's 10-Year Advantage Ends</h1>
            <p>The public vote to restart the third nuclear power plant did not pass because it did not get enough votes (less than a quarter of all eligible voters). Also, the efforts to remove 7 KMT lawmakers from office all failed. Shinzo Ogasawara, a Japanese scholar and a professor at Taiwan's Tsing Hua University, said today that these results show the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s strong position over the last 10 years has ended. Now, the ruling party and the opposition parties are equally strong.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara wrote on Facebook that the public vote was about "restarting the third nuclear power plant, which stopped working in May this year." This vote was really about the DPP government's plan to make Taiwan a nuclear-free country. The People's Party, an opposition party, suggested the vote. The KMT supported it, and the DPP was against it. In the end, over 4.34 million people (74.2%) voted yes, and over 1.51 million people (25.8%) voted no. Although more people voted yes, the vote did not pass because it did not reach the legal 25% of all voters. Compared to the public vote in 2021, which had a 41.1% turnout, this vote only had a 29.5% turnout, meaning fewer people participated.</p>
            <p>The votes to remove lawmakers were against the remaining 7 KMT lawmakers, and none of them were removed. Overall, 33.9% of people voted to remove them, and 66.1% voted against it. This difference was even bigger than in July, when the first group of 24 KMT lawmakers faced removal votes. The total turnout in these 7 areas was 49.3%, which is lower than the last time (56.1%). This suggests that fewer DPP supporters went to vote.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara explained that because the results for removing lawmakers were mostly clear by July 24th, this round of removal votes was just "finishing the game." The KMT was confident, while DPP supporters were not very interested. After both rounds, all 31 KMT lawmakers kept their positions. His earlier analysis from July, which said this was "a big blow to the Lai Ching-te government and the DPP," still stands.</p>
            <p>He also said that the public vote showed that most people in Taiwan want the government to change its non-nuclear energy policy. In the 2010s, more people supported a nuclear-free Taiwan. But in recent years, the need for electricity has grown a lot because of semiconductors and AI. Also, renewable energy development is slow, and Taiwan relies more on burning fossil fuels. This has caused problems for the "nuclear-free homeland" policy. People are also worried about solar panels causing environmental problems and corruption.</p>
            <p>He noted that based on these results, it is important to check if the "nuclear-free homeland" idea has become just a slogan and if the arguments for it need to be updated.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara concluded that the "Summer Battle" of 2025 ended with a big loss for the DPP and a big win for the opposition parties. This confirms that the DPP's strong period from 2014 to 2024 has ended, and Taiwan's politics are now in a time where the ruling and opposition parties are equally strong. The DPP needs to rebuild its two main ideas: "resisting China and protecting Taiwan" and "a nuclear-free homeland." The opposition parties, however, cannot just rely on being "anti-DPP." That alone might not be enough to change the ruling party. The party that learns from these lessons will have an advantage in the 2028 election.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Men's Volleyball Loses to South Korea in East Asia Cup, Finishes Second for 4th Time</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's volleyball team lost to South Korea in the final match of the East Asia Volleyball Championship. The scores were 22-25, 22-25, and 16-25. This means Taiwan has finished in second place for the fourth time in a row. Coach Huang Hong-yu said that their original goal was to reach the top four, so they are happy with getting second place.</p>
            <p>The East Asia Men's Volleyball Championship was held in Zhangjiagang, China. The Taiwan team was mostly made up of players who will play in the Rhine-Ruhr World University Games. Although their main star, Chang Yu-sheng, who plays in Japan, was not there, the team still had young talented players like Wen Yi-kai and Chang Yu-chen. Together, they won against the host country, China, in a close 3-2 match in the semi-finals. This win helped Taiwan's men's volleyball team reach the final for the eighth time in a row.</p>
            <p>Today, in the final match, the Taiwan men's team played against strong opponent South Korea again. They wanted to win after losing to them 2-3 in the first round. However, the Taiwan team could not handle the pressure. They made mistakes at important times and lost the first two sets with scores of 22-25 and 22-25.</p>
            <p>With no more chances, the Taiwan men's team still could not stop South Korea's strong attacks in the third set. They also made too many mistakes, and the score difference kept growing. In the end, they lost the third set 16-25. This means they finished second in the East Asia Men's Volleyball Championship for the fourth time in a row. They also missed their chance to win the championship again after their last win in 2013.</p>
            <p>After the game, Coach Huang Hong-yu told the media that their first goal was to reach the top four, so coming in second place was better than expected. He especially liked that other training players had the chance to play in an international competition. This helps the future talent pool for Taiwan men's volleyball. He also said that the team's good mood is their biggest strength. They face wins or losses with a positive attitude, saying, "Even if we make a mistake, we don't blame teammates right away."</p>
            <p>However, Huang Hong-yu pointed out that he hopes the players, after experiencing the high level of volleyball from other countries, will continue to get stronger and improve their serves. Most importantly, they need to make fewer mistakes. He said, "When playing against higher-level teams in the future, being consistent is what shows a high-quality performance and then shows the team's true strength."</p>

            <h1>All 7 KMT Lawmaker Removal Attempts Fail, Foreign Media Says This Might Worsen Political Stalemate</h1>
            <p>Today, all seven attempts to remove KMT lawmakers from office in Taiwan failed. Foreign news agencies said that voters again refused the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) efforts to gain more seats in the Legislative Yuan. This might make the political situation more difficult and complicate Taiwan's plans to greatly increase military spending and deal with growing pressure from Beijing.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the DPP did not win more than half of the seats in last year's national election. This was the ruling party's second try in a month to take back control of the Legislative Yuan. However, the vote counting showed that the DPP faced repeated losses.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that in the first round of removal votes on July 26th, all 24 KMT lawmakers also kept their positions. The ruling DPP faced a big defeat.</p>
            <p>Experts think that these failures happened because President Lai Ching-te focused on the difficult relationship with China instead of everyday issues for people. This made voters tired of voting. Most people expected the results of this second round of removal votes. All major political parties did not try hard to get their supporters to vote this time.</p>
            <p>The failure of the removal attempts might make the political stalemate worse. The opposition parties might continue to challenge President Lai's plans. Key issues include next year's government budget, military spending, and approving new grand justices.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Lai spoke at the Presidential Office tonight about the voting results. He said that Premier Cho Jung-tai had offered to resign many times after the July 26th removal votes. But President Lai wants Cho Jung-tai to stay in his job and continue with his important duties.</p>
            <p>President Lai said that the cabinet will make necessary changes to its staff to make the team more effective and its policies more noticeable to the public.</p>
            <p>Also, the public vote to restart the third nuclear power plant, which happened at the same time today, did not get enough votes to pass.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the DPP is against restarting the third nuclear power plant unless its safety is guaranteed and there is a solution for nuclear waste. The main opposition party, the KMT, supports restarting the third nuclear power plant. They argue that nuclear power is necessary for energy security.</p>
            <p>After the public vote results came out, President Lai said he respects the results. He added, "I also fully understand society's hopes for different energy choices."</p>
            <p>President Lai stated, "For decades, while discussing nuclear power, the biggest agreement in Taiwanese society has been 'safety.'... Nuclear safety is a science problem, a problem that needs testing. It will not be completely solved by one public vote." A survey released earlier this month by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that 66.4% of people agreed that the third nuclear power plant should continue to operate after the relevant authority confirms it is safe.</p>
            <p>However, some people said this public vote was a waste of time because restarting the nuclear plant depends on the "relevant authority" giving approval first.</p>
            <p>Chen Fang-yu, an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science at Soochow University, said, "Whether it passes or not, the decision is in the government's hands, so it won't make any difference at all."</p>
