            <h1>Ministry of National Defense Says Reports on Military Changes Are Not True</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30 (CNA) Media reported that Lieutenant General Lin Wen-hsiang, head of the Armaments Bureau, would become the president of the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST). They also reported that Lieutenant General Li Shih-chiang, the current NCSIST president, would become the Permanent Deputy Minister of National Defense. These were said to be important changes in military positions. The Ministry of National Defense (MND) stated that these reports are not true. They asked the media to check facts carefully to avoid giving wrong information.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening, Mirror Media reported that because of several problems with military equipment purchases, Lin Wen-hsiang would become the president of NCSIST. They also said that Lieutenant General Chao Ya-ping, director of the MND's Procurement Office, would become the head of the Armaments Bureau. In addition, the report said that Lieutenant General Wan Wen-cho, deputy chief of the National Security Council Secretariat, would change positions. So, Lieutenant General Huang You-min, Permanent Deputy Minister of National Defense, would move to be the deputy chief of the National Security Council Secretariat, and Lieutenant General Li Shih-chiang, NCSIST president, would become the Permanent Deputy Minister of National Defense.</p>
            <p>Today, the MND released a press statement about the media's guessed reports on "important military personnel changes." The MND said that all military personnel changes are done according to rules like the "Act for the Appointment of Officers and Non-commissioned Officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force." They consider things like the job type, what the job needs, and the person's past experience. Then, they choose and suggest the best person for the job following a process.</p>

            <h1>Justice Minister Says Prosecutor's Promotion in Ko Case Was Lawful</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30 (CNA) On July 28, the Ministry of Justice announced changes to prosecutor positions. Prosecutor Lin Chun-yen from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office was promoted to Chief Prosecutor. Some people questioned if this was because he handled cases related to former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je. Today, Justice Minister Cheng Ming-chien said in an interview that he made the selection according to the law.</p>
            <p>This morning, Cheng Ming-chien went to the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee of the Legislative Yuan to give a special report and answer questions. He said the above before the meeting.</p>
            <p>On July 28, the Ministry of Justice announced that Prosecutor Lin Chun-yen from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office was promoted to Chief Prosecutor at the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office. The Taiwan People's Party posted on Facebook, saying, "Half of this honor belongs to Ko Wen-je. Without him, there would be no Chief Prosecutor Lin today."</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chien pointed out that to become a Chief Prosecutor, one must be voted for by prosecutors, reviewed and recommended by the Prosecutors' Review Committee. He then makes the selection according to the law.</p>
            <p>Kuomintang Legislator Wu Tsung-hsien said in an interview that not many prosecutors in the country get promoted to chief. He noted that the Taipei District Prosecutors Office alone had 6 promotions. He asked if prosecutors in central and southern Taiwan were not working hard. He wanted to ask the Justice Minister why the number of prosecutors from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office promoted to chief has been increasing each year. He wondered if it was because the Taipei office was "more obedient." (Editor: Li Heng-shan) 1140730</p>

            <h1>UK to Recognize Palestine in September Unless Israel Agrees to Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>London, July 29 (CNA) British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced today that the UK will officially recognize the state of Palestine in September. This will happen unless Israel takes "real steps," which include agreeing to a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), this important move is part of Starmer's plan for "lasting peace." The British leader had an urgent meeting with his cabinet earlier to discuss the worsening situation in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Before the UK, France also recently announced that it would recognize the state of Palestine in September. These two European allies will be the first countries in the Group of Seven (G7) to do so.</p>
            <p>After a cabinet meeting, Starmer spoke on TV from Downing Street. He said that if Israel does not take the actions asked for by the United Nations General Assembly when it meets in September, the UK will recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>He also said that Israel must "end the terrible situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire, promise long-term stable peace, and restart the vision of a two-state solution."</p>
            <p>Starmer stated, "I have always said that when the two-state solution is most at risk, we would recognize the state of Palestine to help a good peace process... Because this solution is in danger, now is the time to act."</p>
            <p>Israel quickly said it "rejects" the UK's move. It called this "a reward for Hamas (the Palestinian armed group) and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza."</p>
            <p>Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize the state of Palestine on September 23, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting.</p>
            <p>More than 140 countries have already recognized the state of Palestine. However, none of these countries are as important as the UK and France. The UK and France are allies of Israel, have nuclear weapons, and are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. (Translators: Hsu Jui-cheng/Reviewer: Lu Ying-tzu) 1140730</p>
