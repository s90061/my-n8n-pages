The Taitung Hot Air Balloon Festival, which just started today, has been affected by Typhoon Danas. The Taitung County Government announced that all activities for this afternoon and tomorrow, July 6th, are cancelled. The light show and music concert planned for July 6th will now take place on August 4th. Also, the famous "Mr. Brown Tree" in Chishang has been tied down to protect it from the typhoon.

The festival began lively this morning, but rain started in the afternoon due to the typhoon's outer winds. The county government said that flying or setting up hot air balloons would be unsafe, so they cancelled activities for this afternoon and all day tomorrow.

The first light show and music concert was supposed to happen tomorrow with singers Accusefive and Claire Kuo, drones, and fireworks. But because Typhoon Danas is coming, it will be moved to August 4th at the same location.

People who booked tickets online for the hot air balloon experience on July 5th and 6th will get a full refund automatically. This will take 10 to 14 working days, and they will receive a text message. If you have any questions, please contact the EzTravel customer service.

Also, the Chishang Township Office in Taitung spent the afternoon preparing the famous "Mr. Brown Tree" for the typhoon. They used ropes and nails to secure the tree trunk and closed both sides to stop visitors from entering.

**Rough Seas Halt Xiaoliuqiu Ferries; Tourist Season Starts Quietly**

Typhoon Danas is getting closer. Ferry services between Pingtung and Xiaoliuqiu were supposed to stop tomorrow, but because the sea conditions got worse quickly, many ferry companies have moved up their last boat times to today. Many tourists have changed their travel plans, so the peak summer season is starting quietly.

As Typhoon Danas comes, the wind and waves are getting stronger. According to the Central Weather Administration, waves near Xiaoliuqiu were 2.5 meters high at 1 PM today. Ferry companies like Taifu Shipping, Blue White Shipping, Dongliu Line Joint Operation Office, and Dafu Shipping, which go between Donggang and Xiaoliuqiu, quickly announced earlier last ferry times today. Liuxing Company had already said yesterday that they would stop all services on July 5th and 6th.

Li Chia-chi, the head of the Xiaoliuqiu Township Tourism Development Association in Pingtung County, told CNA that people on the island can now feel the wind and rain. Most tourists have already gone back early, and those who hadn't arrived yet have cancelled or postponed their bookings. Only a small number of people are still on the island.

"We depend on the weather for our business," said Li Chia-chi. Summer is the busiest time for tourism in Xiaoliuqiu, and it affects the whole year's income a lot. Even though island guesthouse owners are used to the weather affecting their business, they still feel sorry about the lost business this first week because of the typhoon.

This morning, there were few people at Donggang Pier wanting to go to Xiaoliuqiu, but many tourists were returning to the mainland earlier than planned. Some people said that even though going back early was disappointing, it was better than staying on the island and not knowing when they could get a boat back.
