            <h1>US Puts High Taxes on Swiss Goods Again, Swiss Vice President Sees Hope After Talks</h1>
            <p>After US President Donald Trump placed a high tax of 39% on goods from Switzerland, Swiss Vice President Guy Parmelin said today that he had "good talks" with important US officials. He did not share many details.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that after his talks in Washington, Parmelin, who is also the Economy Minister, said he saw "real chances" for both countries in the future.</p>
            <p>On August 1, Trump announced that goods from Switzerland coming to the US would have a very high tax of 39%. This surprised Switzerland. It was one of the highest new taxes Trump put on goods from many countries.</p>
            <p>In early August, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Parmelin quickly went to Washington to talk about making the tax situation better. But their short meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not change things, and Rubio was not in charge of tax policies.</p>
            <p>After his latest trip, Parmelin posted on social media platform X: "I had good talks in Washington with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer."</p>
            <p>He said: "Switzerland sees real chances for both countries in the future and wants to make our economic partnership stronger."</p>
            <p>According to Keystone-ATS, the Economy Ministry did not share details of the talks. This was "for important reasons related to the negotiations."</p>

            <h1>New Ebola Sickness in Congo, 15 People Have Died From 28 Possible Cases</h1>
            <p>The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) has announced a new outbreak of the Ebola virus in its southern Kasai province. At least 15 people have died so far.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that tests done in Kinshasa, DR Congo's capital, at the National Institute for Biomedical Research, showed that this outbreak has the most dangerous type of Ebola virus.</p>
            <p>The DR Congo government is also facing more fighting in the east of the country. On top of that, the US has cut down its help to other countries. This makes DR Congo's health system, which is already weak, even more in danger.</p>
            <p>The country's health ministry said there is a new Ebola outbreak after a 34-year-old pregnant woman in Kasai province became the first person found to have the sickness.</p>
            <p>Last month, this woman was taken to the hospital because she had symptoms of bleeding fever. She died a few hours later because many of her body's organs stopped working.</p>
            <p>The DR Congo Health Ministry stated that this new outbreak has possibly caused 15 deaths out of 28 people who showed symptoms. Among those who died were four health workers.</p>
            <p>This is the 16th time DR Congo has had an Ebola outbreak. Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said that about 53.6% of people who get sick might die. This shows the situation is very serious.</p>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) says that the number of cases will likely go up.</p>

            <h1>Air Attack Destroys Tall Building in Gaza City, Israel Says Hamas Used It to Watch Soldiers</h1>
            <p>Israel destroyed a tall building in Gaza City today with an air attack. This was the second tall building hit in two days. The Israeli army had already told people to move south to a "safe area." This was because they were planning an attack on the center of Gaza City.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that for several weeks, Israel had been saying it would start new attacks on Gaza City, which is the biggest city in the Palestinian area. But they did not say when.</p>
            <p>Israel has increased its air attacks and ground actions around Gaza City. This makes people worried that the already bad situation will become even worse.</p>
            <p>People who saw it and AFP reporters said that Israeli planes dropped thousands of leaflets in many areas west of Gaza City today. These leaflets told people living there to leave.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for Gaza's civil defense, told AFP that 24 Palestinians died today from Israeli attacks. Five of these people died near a place where help was given out, west of Khan Yunis.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said today that they attacked a tall building in Gaza City. They stated that Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, was using the building to "watch" Israeli soldiers. They also added that they took "steps to harm fewer ordinary people."</p>
            <p>People who saw it said the building was called the "Sussi" residential building. They also said the building was destroyed.</p>
            <p>Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, shared a video. It showed the building, which was about 15 floors tall, falling down in smoke and dust.</p>
            <p>Hamas said the attack was wrong. They also said they do not use homes or other civilian buildings for military reasons.</p>
