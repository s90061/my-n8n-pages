            <h1>Ukraine Factory Attacked by Drones; Poland Says Russia Attacked on Purpose</h1>
            <p>Warsaw, July 18 (CNA) â€“ A factory owned by Polish wood flooring company Barlinek Group in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, was attacked by Russian drones on July 15. Six people were hurt, and two of them were seriously injured. This information comes from the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper. Poland strongly said this was a planned attack on places where civilians are. They also said that the event shows the war between Russia and Ukraine is getting closer to Poland's border.</p>
            <p>The attack happened on the evening of July 15, when Russia sent many drones into Ukraine. Polish Foreign Minister RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski wrote on social media that Russian drones attacked the Barlinek Group factory in Vinnytsia. He quoted a factory manager who said, "This was a planned attack from three directions at the same time."</p>
            <p>PaweÅ‚ WroÅ„ski, the spokesperson for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed to Gazeta Wyborcza that five drones attacked the factory from different directions. He stated, "This proves it was not an accident, but a clear attack on a civilian building."</p>
            <p>On July 16, the prosecutor's office in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, announced that they have started an investigation into this Russian action against a civilian industry building as a war crime.</p>
            <p>Barlinek Group is a well-known Polish company that makes wooden floors. Their products are sold in 75 countries around the world. According to Polish Business Insider, about 40% of Barlinek's products are made at the Vinnytsia factory, which opened in 2007. The company also has two other factories in Poland and Romania.</p>
            <p>This is not the first time Russian forces have attacked facilities belonging to Polish companies in Ukraine. In September 2023, a factory of Polish window maker Fakro in Ukraine was hit by Russian rockets. The damage was estimated to be 7 million Euros (about 239 million New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Polish Foreign Minister Sikorski said strongly, "Russian President Vladimir Putin's bad war is getting closer and closer to our borders." (Edited by Chen Chen-kung) 1140719</p>

            <h1>Former US Ambassador: If Taiwan Makes More Drones, Beijing Might Think Twice</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 18 (CNA) â€“ Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador to China, said today that he believes China will hesitate to act. He saw how Ukraine fought against Russia's much bigger army. He also saw that Taiwan is thinking about greatly increasing its drone power and its ability to make drones and attack missiles locally. He thinks this will make China think twice.</p>
            <p>Burns spoke today at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado. He was a speaker in a discussion called "Charting a Course in the Indo-Pacific."</p>
            <p>When asked how the war in Ukraine and other events might affect China's plans to take control of Taiwan, Burns, who is now a co-chairman of the Aspen Strategy Group, said: He saw how Ukraine fought against a much larger army. He also saw that Taiwan is considering greatly increasing its drone capabilities and its ability to make drones and attack missiles locally. He believes this will surely make China hesitate. He added, "This is a good thing."</p>
            <p>Burns, who was the US ambassador to China during President Biden's time, pointed out that former US President Joe Biden successfully convinced Japan to make its own defense stronger. He also saw that "something happening with Taiwan" became a main topic in security talks in Japan and the Philippines. During former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's time, he also warned countries that if Taiwan's sea lanes were blocked, it could badly affect the world's economy.</p>
            <p>"This pressure on China is a good thing," Burns believes. He thinks the Trump government must be careful with this situation.</p>
            <p>Also at the same forum, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said that Taiwan is currently a very important military spot for China's army. He stated, "If Taiwan falls, those military forces and fighting abilities can be used more widely. We must think very carefully about these issues." He believes that "this way of thinking is now being heard strongly among the United States and its allies."</p>
            <p>Recently, China has often put military pressure on Taiwan and held military exercises aimed at Taiwan. The situation in the Taiwan Strait is getting a lot of attention around the world. Foreign news reported that Philippine Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner Jr. said in April that if nearby Taiwan were "invaded," the Philippines would "definitely" be involved in the conflict.</p>
            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also gave a speech in Okinawa earlier this month to support a candidate from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He said that because China's military activities around Taiwan are increasing, it is very important to think about how to deal with it. (Edited by Chen Hui-ping) 1140719</p>

            <h1>Chinese Man Arrested in Guatemala for International Money Laundering, Will Be Sent to US for Trial</h1>
            <p>Guatemala City, July 18 (CNA) â€“ Police and prosecutors in Guatemala recently arrested a Chinese man suspected of money laundering. They are now working to send him to the United States as requested by the US. The US justice department says this man received money from drug sales and moved it around the world to send it back to drug groups in Mexico.</p>
            <p>On July 17, Guatemala's Ministry of Justice announced that, working with the national police, they successfully arrested a Chinese man named Wenshen Xu. They also found that he used other names like Alex, Alex Xiu, Alex Tsui, and Chino.</p>
            <p>Mr. Xu is now held in Guatemala. The United States has officially asked to send him to the US Eastern District Federal Court in Virginia for trial. In the US, Mr. Xu is accused of three crimes: planning money laundering, hiding money from crimes, and helping to hide illegal money flow.</p>
            <p>US investigations show that Mr. Xu was part of a group that laundered money across China, the US, Mexico, and Colombia. This group helped drug cartels "wash" money they made from selling cocaine. His job was to collect cash from drug sales in the US. Then, he used different ways to make the money seem "legal." Finally, he sent the money back to bank accounts controlled by Mexican drug cartels.</p>
            <p>Reports from the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have shown that Mexican drug cartels are now using Chinese underground banking systems, cryptocurrency trading, and fake legal businesses more and more to avoid financial rules in different countries.</p>
            <p>Guatemala's Ministry of Justice strongly stated again its promise to fight crimes that cross borders, especially money laundering and drug dealing. They also said they will keep working with other countries through international legal help to fight crime.</p>
            <p>Right now, Mr. Xu's case for being sent to the US is being looked at by the court. After the court decides, he will be given to the US to be tried there, according to the law. The police and prosecutors in Guatemala have kept the details secret and have not said exactly where he was arrested or where he is being held now.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the United States and countries in Central and South America have been working more closely to fight crimes that cross borders. Since drug smuggling and money laundering often involve many countries' laws, how to improve cooperation across borders and react quickly has become a challenge for police and investigative groups in different countries.</p>
            <p>Guatemalan media said that more details about how Mr. Xu laundered money, using methods like Chinese underground banks, will be found out when the US court hears his case. But whether these international drug money laundering groups are getting bigger and reaching into other Latin American countries is also something that law enforcement in different countries should pay attention to.
