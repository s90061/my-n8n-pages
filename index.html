            <h1>Brazil's Daan Church Celebrates 55 Years, Thanksgiving Service Shows Immigrant Journey</h1>
            <p>The Daan Presbyterian Church in Brazil held a celebration today in the Sao Paulo Cultural Center. It marked the church's 55th anniversary. Through a thanksgiving service, an exhibit of old photos, and a documentary, the event looked back at the faith journey and cultural traditions of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil. It showed how the church has deeply helped the community and cared for the world.</p>
            <p>This year is the 70th anniversary of Taiwanese immigration to Brazil. The Daan Church started in the early 1970s. Pastor Wu Tien-Pao led its creation. It became an important place for faith and community for Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil. Pastor Wu, with strong belief and purpose, helped immigrants with language and cultural problems. He helped them find a spiritual home in a foreign land.</p>
            <p>The Director of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office in Sao Paulo, Chu Yi-Ching, gave a speech. She said that the Daan Church is not just a guide for faith, but also a connection between religion and culture. The Director of the Sao Paulo Cultural Center, You Zheng-Cai, also said that immigrants not only seek a better life but also build warm communities.</p>
            <p>During the event, Chu Yi-Ching gave a gift to the current Pastor Chen Chin-Hung to show thanks and good wishes. Flutist Lin Tzu-Ying specially came from Taiwan to play music. The choir sang many beautiful hymns. The event ended with "Hallelujah" from "Messiah," which touched everyone present.</p>
            <p>Pastor Liu Xiao-Ting said in his sermon: "Faith is not just an idea, but a living example from history." He hopes that this journey of faith in Brazil will continue for many generations, keeping the spirit of Taiwanese immigrants alive.</p>
            <p>At the end of the event, the church honored past pastors with flowers. They also cut a cake with guests to celebrate. Then, a documentary called "Documentary of the 55th Anniversary of the Daan Presbyterian Church in Brazil" was shown. It specially showed Pastor Wu Tien-Pao's work and old videos of early gatherings. It showed how he built a spiritual home for Taiwanese people with faith and love, even in hard times.</p>
            <p>It is important to say that the Daan Church has been involved in international missionary work and helping society for a long time. It actively supports many missionary projects. One of them, the "Ximo Missionary Project," helps poor communities in Mozambique buy land and build schools. This gives local children a chance to get an education. It shows the real actions and deep love of Taiwanese churches in global missionary and humanitarian work.</p>

            <h1>Air Canada Delays Restarting Flights as Flight Attendants Refuse to End Strike</h1>
            <p>Toronto, August 17 (CNA) â€“ Air Canada today put off its plan to start flights again. This happened because the union for 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants said they would not go back to work. This strike has almost stopped the company, changing summer travel plans for Air Canada passengers around the world.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, after the government got involved, the Canada Industrial Relations Board decided that the 10,000 striking flight attendants must return to work by 2 PM local time today. Air Canada then announced it would start flights again tonight.</p>
            <p>Air Canada released a statement. It said that the union representing the striking flight attendants decided to continue the strike, even though the government told them to stop. Because of this, "Air Canada... has stopped its plan to restart a limited number of flights for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge... The airline will start flights again tomorrow night."</p>
            <p>Air Canada pointed out that the Canada Industrial Relations Board had earlier "told Air Canada to restart operations. It also told all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants to continue their duties by 2:00 PM on August 17, 2025."</p>
            <p>The flight attendants began their strike early in the morning on August 16. This was after they said no to a new contract offer from the company.</p>
            <p>Air Canada flies directly to 180 cities around the world. The company estimates that about 130,000 passengers are affected every day.</p>

            <h1>Spain: 20 Large Wildfires Burning, Government Sends 500 More Soldiers to Help</h1>
            <p>Vilar de Santos, Spain, August 17 (CNA) â€“ Today, there are 20 large wildfires burning across Spain. Very hot weather is making it hard to fight the fires. The government has urgently sent 500 more soldiers to help put out the fires.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, in Galicia, which is in the northwest of Spain, several wildfires have combined. They have become bigger and stronger. This has forced roads in the area to close, and train services have stopped.</p>
            <p>Southern Europe is having one of its worst wildfire seasons in 20 years. Spain is one of the countries most affected. In just the last week, three people have died, and over 115,000 hectares of land have burned. Neighboring Portugal is also struggling to fight fires that are spreading.</p>
            <p>Spain's national weather agency, AEMET, said that temperatures in some areas are expected to go up to 45 degrees Celsius today.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez held a press conference in Ourense, an area greatly affected by the fires. He said, "There will be many challenging days ahead, and sadly the weather is not helping us."</p>
            <p>He announced that more soldiers would be sent to help. The total number of soldiers helping with disaster relief across Spain is now 1,900.</p>
