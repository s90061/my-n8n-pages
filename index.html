            <h1>Trump's New Taxes on Goods: 100% on Some Medicines, Up to 50% on Furniture</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that new taxes will be put on many imported goods. This includes a 100% tax on brand-name medicines and a 25% tax on big trucks.</p>
            <p>Trump also said there will be a 50% tax on kitchen cabinets and bathroom sinks, and a 30% tax on soft furniture. All these new taxes will start on October 1. Here is a summary from Reuters about Trump's new taxes.</p>
            <p>Will the new taxes affect countries with trade agreements?</p>
            <p>Trump's government has trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. These agreements set limits on taxes for some products like cars, computer chips, and medicines. So, new taxes for national safety reasons usually won't go over these limits.</p>
            <p>In July, the White House said that the EU agreed to pay a 15% tax on cars, car parts, medicines, and computer chips.</p>
            <p>In early September, the White House said that the trade agreement with Japan means it will get the same tax treatment as EU products.</p>
            <p>What about new taxes on goods from China to the US?</p>
            <p>The US and China agreed in August to stop new taxes for 90 more days. This stopped very high taxes between them.</p>
            <p>Because of this agreement, the US will keep a 30% tax on goods from China, and China will keep a 10% tax on goods from the US. This will last until at least November 10.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear if these new US taxes will be added to the current taxes on Chinese goods, or if they will be separate. The White House has not answered questions about this.</p>
            <p>According to a furniture magazine, the US brought in about $25.5 billion worth of furniture from other countries in 2024. About 60% of this furniture came from Vietnam and China.</p>
            <p>Will a decision from the Supreme Court change these new taxes?</p>
            <p>The US Supreme Court is now looking at if Trump's big global taxes are legal. So, Trump's government is using new tax rules that have a stronger legal reason. This is to reduce problems.</p>
            <p>On September 9, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case about Trump's global taxes. This will be a big test for Trump's power in economic and trade matters.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court will have a hearing about it on November 5.</p>

            <h1>Free Flu and COVID-19 Shots for Hualien Guangfu People and Rescue Workers</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Vagasa caused a lot of damage in Guangfu Township, Hualien County. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said today that people living in Guangfu Township and rescue workers can now get free flu and COVID-19 vaccines. These shots will start in October.</p>
            <p>About 12,000 people will get these vaccines. The central government will send the vaccines quickly to help.</p>
            <p>The flu season has started. The CDC, which is part of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, announced in a news release that more people can get the free flu and COVID-19 shots starting on October 1. This includes everyone in Guangfu Township, health center workers, and rescue workers. This will help protect health in the damaged area and keep healthcare working.</p>
            <p>A CDC spokesperson, Tseng Shu-hui, told reporters that more people are getting the flu recently. Guangfu Township has problems with transport and getting medical help because of the typhoon. If many people get sick there, it could make it hard for local hospitals and rescue teams to do their job.</p>
            <p>About when the vaccines will be given, Tseng Shu-hui said that people in shelters will get their shots first, before October 1. Other people in Guangfu Township and rescue workers will start on October 1, just like everyone else in Taiwan. The CDC started sending vaccines yesterday. By next Tuesday (September 30), enough free vaccines will be sent. The Hualien County Health Bureau will use lists from the Social Affairs Department, the Township Office, and the Health Center to plan the vaccinations.</p>
            <p>Tseng Shu-hui said that the central government is sending these vaccines quickly. The flu vaccines are part of a plan to get 200,000 doses. This year, about 3 million COVID-19 vaccines were bought, and 2.5 million have already been given. So, there are still enough vaccines.</p>
            <p>The CDC said it is important to protect health and keep medical services running in the affected areas. They ask everyone who can get the vaccine to do so soon. Also, if someone feels sick with flu-like symptoms, a doctor can give them free flu medicine. This will help lower the chance of serious flu illness and other problems, keeping everyone safe.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Shinkong Mitsukoshi Can Open Again, Starts Business on September 27</h1>
            <p>The Shinkong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung closed on February 13 after a gas explosion. The Taichung City Government announced today that the store's request to open again has been approved. The much-awaited Shinkong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung will open its doors again tomorrow, September 27.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government said in a news release that the Shinkong Mitsukoshi Chunggang store finished making its inside new, changing its use, and fixing things. Experts checked all these changes. A separate company also approved them. Another special group hired by the Urban Development Bureau checked each floor.</p>
            <p>The store gave its application to open again to the Urban Development Bureau on September 18. It had all the papers needed.</p>
            <p>Different city government groups, like the Urban Development Bureau, Fire Department, and Economic Development Bureau, looked at the application. They made sure it followed all the rules and steps. Today, they said the store can open again.</p>
            <p>Li Zheng-wei, the head of the Urban Development Bureau, said that the process to let the store open again followed building laws and specific city rules. But they also had 6 even stricter rules. For example, they asked the store to fix the whole building, not just the broken parts. They also checked all floors for safety and made sure everything was fixed well.</p>
            <p>The city government said that all its departments put "public safety first, with expert checks" as the most important rule. They made the company follow its repair plan strictly to stop similar accidents from happening again. They also told all owners, users, and managers of department stores in Taichung to keep their buildings safe and use them correctly.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Shinkong Mitsukoshi worked for more than half a year. Today, the city government approved its request to open again. The store finished putting goods back on its floors yesterday. The whole store is now ready to open again tomorrow.</p>
