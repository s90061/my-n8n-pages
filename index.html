**U.S. House of Representatives Unanimously Passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act", Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives on June 23 orally and unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act." This act tells the U.S. to use its influence and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's involvement in the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This includes participating in economic oversight, getting technical help, and allowing Taiwanese people to work in the IMF. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) today (June 24) said that this bill is good for supporting Taiwan's broader international participation and for pushing back against China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will watch how this bill develops closely.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which asks the U.S. government to help Taiwan join the IMF, was proposed and passed by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in March this year. Then, on June 23, the full House passed it orally without any objections. The bill was put forward jointly by Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Representative Al Green.

Representative Kim stated that China continues to block Taiwan's participation in international groups like the IMF because it knows that financial security is as important as military security. China could potentially harm Taiwan's financial system by raising tariffs, selling off stocks, or stopping bank transfers. Joining the IMF would give Taiwan resources to strengthen its financial resilience and resist China's economic pressure.

In response, MOFA Spokesperson Joanne Ou said at a regular press conference this morning that this bill is very important for helping Taiwan expand its international participation and for pushing back against China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for passing this bill without objection. She said it clearly shows the strong support of U.S. congressional members from both parties for Taiwan's involvement in international organizations and its expansion in the international arena. It also further highlights how important it is to make Taiwan's economy stronger and to build global partnerships.

MOFA stated that it will closely monitor the future progress of this bill. It will also maintain close coordination and communication with its friends in the U.S. Congress and the executive branch to keep building positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," after it passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, an identical version must pass in the U.S. Senate and then be signed by the President to become official law. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already passed a similar bill in early June, and it is now waiting for a full Senate vote.

**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility and provocation, after a speech in which he said the island is "of course" a country and there is historical evidence and legal proof to back this up.

Beijing says democratically governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had intentionally distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions," it said in a statement.

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

Responding, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Lai was simply stating historical facts and Beijing's belief the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that, as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Taiwan has over the past five years faced stepped-up military and political pressure from China, including war games.
