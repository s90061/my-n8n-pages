            <h1>China and Russia want to challenge the US through the SCO summit, but the real impact is still unclear</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and leaders from 8 other Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) member countries met in Tianjin, China. They were there for the latest summit of the organization. This meeting might challenge the United States, but it's not clear what the real effect will be.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the SCO, which has 10 member countries, will meet for two days in Tianjin. The organization is 24 years old and has grown in size and power. However, its goals and plans are still not very clear.</p>
            <p>The official members of the SCO are Russia, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.</p>
            <p>The SCO was first seen as a way to balance the US's power in Central Asia. It started with 6 members. Later, 4 new countries joined: India and Pakistan in 2017, and Iran and Belarus in 2023 and 2024.</p>
            <p>Some SCO members, especially Iran and Belarus, are clearly against Western countries. Other members like India, China, and Russia have more complicated relationships with the West. This is partly because the US has changed its mind about Russia's war in Ukraine, or because of problems caused by US tariffs (taxes on imports).</p>
            <p>Since it started in 2001, China, a strong economy in the region, has led the SCO. Russia has tried to use the organization to keep its influence over former Soviet countries in Central Asia, such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
            <p>Russia's economic power has become much smaller, especially because Western countries have put many strict rules on it. But Russia and China still see the SCO as a way for countries in the region to work together on military matters, even if it's only for joint training exercises right now.</p>
            <p>After the war in Ukraine started, India became a main buyer of Russian oil. This made things more difficult with the US. After meeting with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August, Modi said that India and China were making "steady progress" in making their relationship better.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press said that India joining the SCO might make it harder for Russia and China to control the organization. Even though these countries trade with each other, India is not likely to strongly support Russia's war in Ukraine or China's claims over Taiwan and the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>June Teufel Dreyer, a China expert from the University of Miami, said that the SCO seems to want to change from a place for talks to a "real system for practical cooperation that brings good results for the people in member countries." But she added that questions remain: "What are its goals? And how will it achieve them?"</p>

            <h1>Indonesian parliament members get rich themselves, causing riots; public anger spreads to finance minister's home, which is robbed</h1>
            <p>Recently, people in Indonesia have been angry because of the country's economic situation and the large salaries of parliament members. This has caused anti-government protests. The public's anger has continued to grow, and the home of Indonesia's finance minister was robbed last night. Indonesia's defense minister said today that strong actions will be taken against those who caused the violence and robbed homes.</p>
            <p>On August 25, protests started in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia. Protesters said that parliament members received too much money for salaries and housing. On August 28, the protests became violent after a police armored car hit and killed a motorcycle taxi driver. Some politicians' homes and government buildings were robbed or set on fire.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that a neighbor said Indonesia's Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, had her home robbed early this morning. Her home is in South Tangerang, a city near Jakarta. Two groups of people robbed it.</p>
            <p>The neighbor said: "The first group of robbers rode tens of motorcycles. Each motorcycle carried 2 to 3 people. The second group had about 150 people. They took televisions, sound systems, living room decorations, clothes, and dishes."</p>
            <p>Indonesia's Defense Minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, warned in a press conference today: "Law enforcement officers will take strong actions against those who enter private homes or government buildings illegally, without hesitation."</p>
            <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto held a press conference today with leaders from different political parties. He said he has told the army and police to take strict action against those who caused violence and robbed homes. He also warned that some actions during the recent protests across the country are "treason" and "terrorism."</p>
            <p>Prabowo also said: "Parliament leaders have promised to change some internal rules of the parliament. These changes include adjusting how much money members receive and stopping trips abroad."</p>
            <p>The protests in Indonesia have lasted for several days and have spread outside Jakarta. Some local parliament buildings were even set on fire. Because of this, Prabowo canceled his planned trip to China.</p>
            <p>Prabowo became president in October last year. For almost a year, his government faced almost no political problems. These protests are the biggest challenge he has faced so far.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese women's volleyball team wins second place at East Asian Cup; head coach Deng Yen-min moved by players' growth</h1>
            <p>In the East Asian Women's Volleyball Championship held in Hong Kong, the Taiwan team lost to China today in the final game. The scores were 26-24, 24-26, 22-25, 19-25. Taiwan won second place. The head coach, Deng Yen-min, said she was very touched to see how much the players had improved.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Taiwanese women's volleyball team had won the East Asian Volleyball Championship three times. However, for 9 years, they had not been able to reach the top 4 teams. This time, setter Liao Yi-jen, also known as "volleyball sweetheart," led the team. Other players included Hung Chia-yao, Hsu Heng-yun, Weng Tzu-yun, Chien Yi-wen, and Chiu Shih-ching. The head coach, Deng Yen-min, also called "Xiao Niu," said their goal was to reach the final game. They wanted to end their last international match of the year on a good note.</p>
            <p>In the group stage, the Taiwan women's team beat Mongolia and then Hong Kong, the host country. They finished first in their group and returned to the semi-finals. They also beat South Korea 3-0 yesterday, so they reached their goal of getting into the final. But today, they played against the strong Chinese team. The Taiwan team won the first set, but then China won the next three sets 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. So, Taiwan missed out on the championship trophy.</p>
            <p>After the game, head coach Deng Yen-min talked to the media. She said that she used to play for the national team herself, so she knows that players feel pressure. They want to play well for Taiwan. So, she told everyone to focus only on the game and not to think about anything else. She hoped to create a "happy volleyball" feeling, so players would naturally train hard and play with all their effort.</p>
            <p>Deng Yen-min thinks that after playing in the Asian Cup, the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade, and now the East Asian Volleyball Championship, these players are no longer afraid of tall opponents. Their blocking, defense, and attacking positions are also getting much smoother. This made her feel very touched. She also thanked the players for trusting the team quickly and working together to achieve great results.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team will start the second part of their training for the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games on September 8. Deng Yen-min said that more experienced older players will join the team then, along with new players who have a lot of potential. Especially next year, there will be important competitions like the Asian Cup, the East Asian Volleyball Championship, the Asian Championship, and the Asian Games. She said, "Next year will be a very exciting year, and I hope we can train well during this time."</p>
