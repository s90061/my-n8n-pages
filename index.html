Typhoon Danas caused great damage in southern Taiwan. To help with the recovery, the Ministry of Interior plans to send at least 1,000 substitute servicemen to Tainan, Chiayi, and Yunlin from July 14 to 17. These servicemen have recently finished training and have certifications in first aid and disaster preparedness.

President Lai Ching-te visited the affected areas on July 11. He explained that the army's main job is to protect the country, and while helping in disasters is part of their duties, they cannot enter private homes to help with cleanup. The substitute servicemen will help vulnerable people and elderly residents clean up after the typhoon.

**Typhoon Danas Impacts Vulnerable Groups in Chiayi County; Material Bank Provides Emergency Support and Calls for Donations**

Typhoon Danas has affected many vulnerable people and elderly living alone in Chiayi County, leading to worries about food shortages. The Chiayi County Social Affairs Bureau has started emergency operations. Social workers and local government staff are checking on families and giving them help through the "Chiayi County Material Bank."

The Material Bank has already prepared "immediate supply boxes" with food like instant noodles, canned goods, and long-life milk. They have also arranged for baby and adult diapers. So far, 120 boxes of supplies have been given out to help affected families. The head of the Material Bank said that their supplies are low because of rising prices and fewer donations. They are asking the public for more help, especially for items like noodles, canned food, nutritional products, and baby diapers.

**Peru's Caral Civilization Fortress Penico Opens its Doors to Tourists**

The ancient Penico fortress, part of Peru's 3,800-year-old Caral civilization, has opened to visitors after eight years of study and repair. This important archaeological site was a major trading center for early human groups living along the Pacific coast, as well as for people from the Andes and Amazon regions.

Penico is located in the Supe Valley, about 180 kilometers north of Lima, Peru's capital. Before archaeological work began in 2017, the site was just hills. Experts believe Penico is key to understanding why the Caral civilization, which existed from 3000 BCE to 1800 BCE, became weaker and disappeared.

The lead archaeologist, Ruth Shady, stated that Penico was a well-organized city center where farming and trade between coastal, mountain, and forest areas were common. She also mentioned that the site itself dates back to between 1800 BCE and 1500 BCE. Researchers think Penico was built around the same time as some of the earliest civilizations in the Middle East and Asia. They believe a major drought, linked to climate change, caused the end of the Caral civilization, and Penico is important for understanding this crisis.
