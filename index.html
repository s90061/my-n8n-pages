            <h1>UN: Over 1,000 people killed in Gaza trying to get aid since late May</h1>
            <p>The United Nations (UN) said today that more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food in the Gaza Strip have been killed by Israeli soldiers. This has happened since the "Gaza Humanitarian Fund" (GHF), supported by the US and Israel, started working at the end of May.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the UN Human Rights Office, Thameen Al-Kheetan, told Agence France-Presse (AFP): "By July 21, we have recorded a total of 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food."</p>
            <p>Al-Kheetan said: "Out of these, 766 people were killed near the Gaza Humanitarian Fund sites, and 288 people died near aid convoys from the UN and other humanitarian groups." He also clearly stated that the victims were "killed by the Israeli army."</p>
            <p>Mohammad Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, which is the biggest hospital in Gaza, told reporters today that 21 children have died from a lack of food and hunger in different parts of Gaza in the last three days.</p>

            <h1>US leaves UNESCO again; Secretary-General expresses deep regret</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States announced that it has left UNESCO, which is the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The US said that being part of UNESCO anymore is not good for America's national interests. Audrey Azoulay, the head of UNESCO, said she was very sad about this.</p>
            <p>Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, said that the United States has left UNESCO. She explained that UNESCO shows unfairness towards Israel and promotes "social and cultural issues that cause division." Because of this, staying in UNESCO is not good for America's national interests.</p>
            <p>Audrey Azoulay, the head of UNESCO, felt very sad about this. She said, "I am deeply sad that President Donald Trump has decided again to make the United States leave UNESCO." But she also said that she was not surprised.</p>
            <p>The US leaving is a bad thing for UNESCO. UNESCO was created after World War II to help countries work together in education, science, and culture to make peace. Its main office is in Paris.</p>
            <p>During his first time as president, Trump also did similar things. He left the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.N. Human Rights Council, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal.</p>
            <p>When Joe Biden became president in 2021, he changed these decisions. He made the US join UNESCO, WHO, and the Paris Agreement again.</p>
            <p>Now that Trump is back in the White House, the US has left these international organizations again. He has decided for the US to leave WHO. He has also stopped giving money to UNRWA, which is a UN agency that helps Palestinian refugees. This is part of a review of how the US is involved in UN groups, which should finish in August.</p>
            <p>UNESCO is most known for naming World Heritage Sites. These include the Grand Canyon in the US and the ancient city of Palmyra in Syria.</p>
