            <h1>More Same-Sex Couples in Taiwan File Taxes: A 1.5 Times Increase in Three Years, High Numbers in Hualien and Taitung</h1>
            <p>Taiwan became the first country in Asia to allow same-sex marriage in May 2019. The Ministry of Finance reports that in 2023, 6,637 same-sex couples filed income tax. This number is 1.5 times higher than in 2020. In 2023, Hualien had the highest percentage of same-sex couples filing tax with 0.41%, followed by Taitung with 0.35%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance also said that the number of married couples filing income tax grew from 2014 to 2019. However, in 2020 and 2021, fewer married couples filed tax. This might be because fewer people got married during the COVID-19 pandemic, or some families earned less money and did not need to pay tax.</p>
            <p>The number of married couples filing tax went back up to about 2.98 million in 2023. But the percentage of all tax filers who were married went down. In 2023, it was 43.3%, which is 4.4% less than in 2014 (47.7%). This shows that more people are getting married later or choosing to stay single.</p>
            <p>If a married person lives apart from their spouse, they can state "separated" when they file their taxes. The Ministry of Finance said that for the past 10 years, about 0.25% of married tax filers were separated from 2015 to 2022. In 2023, this number went up to 0.36%. This means about 4 out of every 1,000 married tax filers were separated. Keelung (0.53%), Taipei (0.50%), and New Taipei (0.47%) had higher rates among cities and counties, not counting islands.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance also said that same-sex marriage officially started in Taiwan on May 24, 2019. This made Taiwan the first country in Asia to allow it. In early 2023, Taiwan also made it easier for people to marry foreign same-sex partners in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>After same-sex marriage became legal, 2,625 same-sex couples filed taxes in 2020, which was the first year. By 2023, this number reached 6,637. This is an increase of 4,012 cases in three years, or 1.5 times more. The number is growing every year. Because of this, the percentage of same-sex couples among all married tax filers also grew from 0.09% to 0.22%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance looked at the percentage of same-sex couples filing taxes in different cities and counties in 2023. Hualien had the highest at 0.41%, and Taitung was second at 0.35%. Changhua County and Yunlin County had the lowest at 0.09%. The six major cities in Taiwan had rates between 0.2% and 0.26%.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Women's Volleyball Team Loses to Italy at Universiade, Still Has a Chance to Move Forward</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan women's volleyball team played against a strong team from Italy in a Universiade group match in Germany. After a tough game, Taiwan lost with scores of 15-25, 19-25, and 15-25. The team now has one win and one loss. They still have a chance to play against the U.S. team to try and move on to the next round.</p>
            <p>In the Universiade, the Taiwan women's volleyball team is in a group with Australia, Italy, and the U.S. In their first game, Taiwan easily beat Australia 3-0. But today, they had a very hard time against the tall Italian team.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first set, Taiwan's team quickly lost three points and fell behind. They tried hard to catch up, but Italy slowly made their lead bigger. Italy then scored five points to Taiwan's one, ending the first set with a score of 20-14.</p>
            <p>In the second and third sets, Taiwan could play well against Italy at the beginning. But as Italy kept attacking strongly, the score difference grew bigger. In the end, Taiwan's women's volleyball team lost the game 0-3.</p>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's team struggled to attack against the taller Italian players. Italy scored 14 points by blocking shots, while Taiwan only scored 1 point from blocks. The best player for Taiwan was Cai You-Chun, who scored 9 points. This was the highest score for her team.</p>
            <p>Looking at their strength, Italy is the strongest team in the group. They should easily beat Australia in their last game and move on as the first-place team with all wins. Taiwan and the U.S. team both have one win and one loss in the group games. They will play against each other tonight at 11 PM to decide which team will move on to the top 8 as the second-place team from the group.</p>
            <p>In past Universiade games, the Taiwan women's volleyball team won a silver medal in 2003 in Daegu, South Korea. They won a gold medal in 2005 in Izmir, Turkey. But after that, they have not won any more medals. Their best result since then was fourth place at the Taipei Universiade in 2017.</p>

            <h1>UK Accidentally Leaks Personal Information of Afghans, Also Affects Hundreds of British People, Including Special Forces</h1>
            <p>London, July 17 (CNA) The UK has had one of its worst personal data leaks ever. This leak caused thousands of Afghans to be moved to the UK. Today, British news reported that details about hundreds of British people were also leaked. This includes secret agents and members of special military groups.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the UK Ministry of Defence caused this data leak in early 2022. The leaked information appeared on Facebook the next year. Because of worries that the Taliban might hurt these Afghans whose information was leaked, the UK has moved over 16,000 Afghans by May this year.</p>
            <p>British news organizations like BBC News and The Guardian reported that this data leak also shared the personal information of hundreds of British officials. These include agents from MI6 (a secret intelligence service) and members of special forces like the SAS (Special Air Service).</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence said that it is their long-standing rule not to talk about things related to special forces.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "We care very much about the safety of our people, especially those in important jobs. We always take the right steps to keep them safe."</p>
            <p>John Healey, the Defence Minister, apologized for this on July 15. He said that the leak also included personal information of members of parliament and high-ranking military officers. These people helped Afghan allies find safety in the UK.</p>
            <p>Because of this leak, the previous Conservative Party government started a secret plan to move people. This plan is expected to cost about 2 billion British pounds (around 80.5 billion New Taiwan dollars) to protect the affected Afghans and others.</p>
            <p>A special court order, called a "super-injunction," protected this secret relocation plan. This order stopped the media from reporting on it. The court lifted this order only on July 15 this month.</p>
