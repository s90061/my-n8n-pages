Original News URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65775440

Many people are still worried about the high cost of food when they go shopping. Even though inflation, which is how fast prices are going up, has slowed down, food prices are not falling quickly. Experts say that the prices of food items like bread, milk, and vegetables are still much higher than they were a few years ago. This means families have less money for other things after buying groceries. Supermarkets are trying to offer deals and cheaper options, but the cost of growing and moving food is still high for businesses. This makes it hard for prices to go down quickly for shoppers. It seems that food will continue to be expensive for some time.

**How AI Might Change Office Jobs**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to change many jobs, especially those done in offices or that involve thinking and planning. Unlike factory jobs, where robots can replace human workers, AI in office settings might not replace people completely. Instead, it could change how people do their tasks. AI tools might help with writing emails, doing research, or creating presentations faster. This means that people in these jobs will need to learn how to work *with* AI, using it as a helpful tool rather than being replaced by it. Companies will likely look for employees who can use AI to improve their work, making jobs more about managing and using technology.

Traveling in ways that are good for the environment and local communities is becoming very popular. This idea, called "sustainable tourism," means choosing hotels, tours, and activities that do not harm nature and help the people who live in the travel destination. More and more travelers want to reduce their impact on the planet. They are looking for ways to travel that are responsible, like choosing eco-friendly resorts, using public transport, or supporting local businesses. Travel companies are noticing this change and are starting to offer more green options. This trend shows that people want their holidays to be fun but also to help protect the places they visit for the future.`;
