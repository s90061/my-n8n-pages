        const text = `**New AI Models Could Change Half of Global Jobs, Report Says**

A new report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) suggests that advanced artificial intelligence (AI) could affect 50% of jobs worldwide. This includes powerful AI tools like ChatGPT. The report explains that while some jobs might disappear as AI takes over certain tasks, many new jobs will also be created. More often, existing jobs will change, requiring people to learn new skills.

The WEF stresses the urgent need for governments and businesses to invest in education and training programs. These programs are essential to prepare the workforce for the upcoming changes. It is important for workers to develop new abilities to stay relevant in the evolving job market. This proactive approach will help ensure that people can adapt and thrive in a world increasingly shaped by AI technology.

**European Summer Travel Expected to Be Busy, But Costs Are Rising**

Summer travel to Europe is expected to be very popular this year, with many people planning holidays. Southern European countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece are particularly favored by tourists. However, travelers should be aware that prices for flights and accommodation are increasing. There are also growing concerns about "overtourism" in some popular destinations, where too many visitors can create problems for local communities and the environment.

Despite the challenges, tourists are showing a greater interest in cultural experiences and exploring places that are less known. This trend suggests a desire to find unique trips beyond the most crowded spots. City breaks also remain a popular choice. Many travelers are trying to find a balance between visiting famous landmarks and discovering quieter, more authentic locations to enjoy their holidays.

**Global Ocean Temperatures Reach Record Highs, Raising Concerns**

Global ocean temperatures reached new record highs in May 2024, continuing a worrying trend observed over the past year. Scientists are very concerned about this development. They explain that two main factors are contributing to the increased heat. One is climate change, caused by a rise in greenhouse gases from human activities, which trap heat in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere. The other is a natural weather pattern called El NiÃ±o, which typically warms parts of the Pacific Ocean and has a global impact.

These unusually high ocean temperatures have serious consequences for marine life and ecosystems. They can harm fish populations and damage coral reefs, leading to widespread coral bleaching. Warmer oceans also contribute to more extreme weather events around the world, such as stronger storms, heavier rainfall in some regions, and longer periods of drought in others. Experts emphasize the urgent need to address climate change to protect our oceans and the planet.`;
