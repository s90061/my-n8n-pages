            <h1>China Remembers War, Says Official: This Lessens Taiwan's True Government and Changes Taiwan's History</h1>
            <p>This year marks 80 years since World War II ended. An official from the government said today that if we value peace, we must not ignore attacks on other countries. This is the real meaning of remembering the 80th anniversary of the war's end. China is making a big show of remembering what it calls the 80th anniversary of its victory against Japan. Their goal is to make their "One China Principle" stronger and to wrongly connect it to UN Resolution 2758. This makes Taiwan's true government seem less important and creates a false story about Taiwan belonging to China.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te wrote on Facebook yesterday that World War II was a terrible disaster. A few rulers wanted too much power. Also, people thought that if they gave in, there would be peace, but this just helped those who wanted to attack. This led to many countries being pulled into a cruel war. So, when strong, controlling governments start to grow again, everyone must work together to stop them from succeeding.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Eric Chu, the leader of the Kuomintang party, said that President Lai talks a lot about democracy and peace, but he did not mention the history of Taiwan's true government fighting in the war, nor the sacrifice of 3.2 million soldiers. Former President Ma Ying-jeou also said that all Chinese people must never forget this part of history. He criticized President Lai for only talking about the end of the war, not the fighting itself.</p>
            <p>The official pointed out today that 80 years have passed since the end of World War II. It has also been 80 years since Taiwan's true government led all its soldiers and people to fight together. They defeated Japan's desire for power, which was one of the Axis powers at that time. This led to the final victory against this attack.</p>
            <p>The official explained that if we look at the last 80 years, we can learn something important. The victory in World War II happened because people around the world united. They fought against attacks, protected their homes, and wanted true peace. The countries that were once part of the Axis powers are now fully democratic. They have real peace and wealth. They are respected by the world again. This shows that only freedom and democracy can truly help a country grow.</p>
            <p>The official stressed that a country can only be respected if it respects human dignity. Strong, controlling power and attacks only bring death, sadness, and more unfairness. If we care about peace, we must not ignore attacks on others. This is the true meaning of remembering the 80th anniversary of the war's victory.</p>
            <p>The official said that this year, China is making a big display to remember what it calls the 80th anniversary of the victory against Japan. They are changing history, falsely saying that the Communist Party led the war against Japan. They are also holding events like "September 3rd" and "Taiwan Retrocession Day" as part of their plan to unite with Taiwan. Their goal is to make their "One China Principle" stronger and to wrongly connect it to UN Resolution 2758. They continue to make Taiwan's true government seem less important and create a false story about Taiwan belonging to China. The world and the people of Taiwan will not agree with this.</p>
            <p>The official also said that for more than a hundred years, after China lost a war, Taiwan became a colony for 50 years. After that, there was strong, controlling rule and the longest period of martial law in the world, which seemed to have no end. What right do people from the Kuomintang party have to lecture Taiwanese people?</p>
            <p>Also, Chen Yi-shen, who is the head of the Academia Historica, spoke at an academic meeting called "From the Sino-Japanese War to the End of the War and Takeover." He said that one reason the Japanese army started the war against China was to "fight communism." However, Chiang Kai-shek stopped fighting the communists and worked with them against Japan. This allowed the Communist Party to grow strong during the 8-year war. After the war, the Communist Party won the civil war in China. So, Japan's attack on China led to the creation of "Communist China."</p>

            <h1>Comic Exhibition Brings Osamu Tezuka and Tsai Kun-lin Together; Minister Li Yuan Calls It a Historic Moment</h1>
            <p>Through an exhibition, Osamu Tezuka, a very famous Japanese comic artist, and Tsai Kun-lin, who started "Prince Magazine," have met at the National Comic Museum park. This exhibition was first shown in Kyoto, Japan, and now it is in Taiwan. Minister of Culture Li Yuan said that this exhibition is a historic moment because it happens 80 years after the war ended.</p>
            <p>The exhibition "Taiwanese Boy and Japanese Boy â€“ Taiwan-Japan Comics: A Century of Encounters" finished in June this year at the Kyoto International Manga Museum. Starting today, it is showing at the east side of the National Comic Museum park. When you go into the exhibition area, you can see the desks of Osamu Tezuka and Tsai Kun-lin, set up by the exhibition team. These desks show how these two people helped tell the story of how comic cultures grew in Taiwan and Japan. Original drawings by Osamu Tezuka, like parts of "Phoenix: Greece Chapter" and "Zero Man," are also on display.</p>
            <p>Minister Li Yuan said in his speech that yesterday was the 80th anniversary of the end of the war (when Japan surrendered in World War II). With the exhibition happening now, he thought about the long 80-year story between Taiwan and Japan. For example, 80 years ago, his father came to Taiwan from China and collected many Japanese paintings. Also, he was born in the same year Osamu Tezuka drew "Astro Boy," and like Tezuka, he also liked insects.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan said that Tsai Kun-lin lived through a time called the White Terror. After he was jailed for 10 years because of his studies, he started his own publishing company and created "Prince Magazine." He also brought together his friends from prison to make comics. Today's exhibition is a historic moment. "On the 80th anniversary of the war's end, these two important people from history have finally met." The exhibition also shows more than just their stories; it shows how Taiwanese and Japanese comics met and influenced each other.</p>
            <p>Takayuki Matsutani, the president of Tezuka Productions Co., Ltd., said that Osamu Tezuka often used to say, "Comics and cartoons can go beyond national borders." He strongly believed that wars happen because countries do not talk to each other enough. Even if they do talk, it is often only about money, and they don't understand each other's cultures. But through comics and cartoons, people can understand what others are thinking. This can help reduce the chance of wars happening.</p>
            <p>Matsutani added that Osamu Tezuka lived through World War II. He knew how terrible war was, how important peace was, and how precious life was. Even when many people thought "comics were bad," he kept working hard to create them. He wanted to pass these important ideas to the next generation. He encouraged everyone to learn from Osamu Tezuka: "Don't be afraid of adults. Adults will not be here forever. Find a way to tell children what we want to say."</p>
            <p>The international exchange exhibition "Taiwanese Boy and Japanese Boy â€“ Taiwan-Japan Comics: A Century of Encounters" will be held at the east side of the National Comic Museum park from today until October 12th.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang Wants to Be New Taipei City Mayor; Hou Yu-ih Says: "Talk Less, Do More"</h1>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, the head of the Taiwan People's Party, said he wants to run for mayor of New Taipei City. Today, the current mayor of New Taipei City, Hou Yu-ih, said that New Taipei City is very big, and it's not easy to understand it well. He prefers to "talk less and do more" so that people can feel that real work is being done. He welcomes anyone who truly wants to work hard for New Taipei City.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang recently said he wants to be the mayor of New Taipei City. He hopes that the opposition parties can choose the best person to run together. Today, Mayor Hou Yu-ih went to Fengyuan, Taichung, for an event called "Fengyuan Mountain Area Grand Unity." This event was held by Chiang Chi-chen, the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Yuan, to speak against removing officials from office. Before the event, Hou Yu-ih spoke to reporters and answered questions about the election.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that what people in New Taipei City care about most is who can work hard for the city. New Taipei City is very big, and it's not easy to understand it well. So, it's better to "talk less and do more." People want to be impressed and feel that someone is really doing work. This is what people hope for most.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih repeated many times that he welcomes anyone who is willing to give their effort to New Taipei City, and he will tell them "Good luck."</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if Huang Kuo-chang's action was to help him negotiate better with the Kuomintang party. Mayor Hou Yu-ih replied that New Taipei City has a large population of 4.05 million people, and there are big differences between city and country areas. He strongly welcomes anyone who truly wants to work hard and manage New Taipei City.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang also attended the "Fengyuan Mountain Area Grand Unity" event today. When reporters asked him about Mayor Hou Yu-ih saying that New Taipei City is large and hard to understand, Huang Kuo-chang said he was busy and could not answer questions.</p>
