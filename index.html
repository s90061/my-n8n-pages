            <h1>Eswatini: 10 People Sent Back from the US Have Arrived</h1>
            <p>The government of Eswatini said today that it has received 10 people from other countries. These people were sent back from the United States. In July, Eswatini also received 5 people who were sent back. This is the second time Eswatini has received people sent back by the US.</p>
            <p>The Correctional Services of Eswatini stated that they have taken in these 10 people from other countries, who came from the US.</p>
            <p>The Correctional Services' statement said that these people will stay in special facilities. They will stay there until they can go back to their home countries. The statement also said that they are healthy now and are going through the process of being settled.</p>
            <p>The US government has not made a statement about this yet.</p>
            <p>US President Trump wants to send back millions of immigrants who are living in the country without permission. His government is trying to send some of these immigrants to other countries to make this process stronger.</p>
            <p>According to a statement from Eswatini last night, Eswatini will receive 11 people from the US in October. This is part of an agreement with the US Trump government. However, the statement did not say what countries these people are from.</p>
            <p>Eswatini has not shared the details of the agreement it signed with the Trump government. The Eswatini government is facing legal action from local activists. They say that this agreement is against the law.</p>
            <p>The first group of 5 immigrants sent to Eswatini this year were from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba, and Yemen. One man from Jamaica has already been sent back to Jamaica with the help of the Jamaican government. Two more people are expected to be sent back soon.</p>

            <h1>Koreans Travel Abroad for Mid-Autumn Festival Holiday, Taiwan is Second Most Popular</h1>
            <p>This year, Koreans had a long holiday for the Mid-Autumn Festival, including other public holidays, lasting 7 days. Many people chose to travel to other countries. Travel companies found that Japan was the most popular country for Korean tourists. After Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Indonesia were also popular.</p>
            <p>Korean news sources shared information from Klook, an online travel company. Klook released its report today about travel trends for the 2025 Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. The report showed that fewer people booked trips to Southeast Asia this year, with a 6% drop compared to last year. However, bookings for Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong went up by an average of 21%. In Japan, Fukuoka and Osaka were the most popular cities because they are closer. Tokyo, the capital, was also popular.</p>
            <p>Also, because of the long holiday, more travelers chose to go to places further away. Travel to the Americas went up by 21%, to Europe by 35%, and to the Middle East by 71%. In the Middle East, Turkey saw a big increase of 111%, and the United Arab Emirates went up by 33%. This shows that people are choosing many different places to visit.</p>
            <p>At the same time, more people from other main Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and China visited Korea. When including Korea in the statistics, the top three most popular cities for international tourists were Osaka, Tokyo, and Seoul. Travel companies said that Korean culture (Hallyu), shopping, and delicious food are the main reasons why Seoul is becoming more popular.</p>

            <h1>Asahi Breweries Attacked by Hackers, 6 Factories Now Working Again</h1>
            <p>Asahi, Japan's biggest beer company, was recently attacked by hackers. This caused problems with their computer systems. Because of this, they had trouble sending out products and helping customers. Asahi said today that the computer problems from the attack are still not fixed. But, their 6 beer factories in Japan have started making beer again.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Asahi's computer systems started having problems on September 29. This meant the company could not take orders or send out products. Asahi has 30 factories in Japan, and 6 of them are beer factories. The attack did not directly stop these factories from making things. However, because of problems with the company's overall operations, they had to stop making products for a while.</p>
            <p>People were worried that this hacker attack might cause a shortage of beer in convenience stores, supermarkets, and bars. But until today, there have been no major reports of beer running out.</p>
            <p>A person from Asahi Group Holdings told AFP, "Right now, we are taking orders by phone. Our sales staff are also visiting customers in person to take their orders."</p>
            <p>The person also said, "We are still looking into how big this attack was and how it affected our systems."</p>
