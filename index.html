            <h1>Shin-Shin Bus Company Chairman Apologizes and Resigns After Bus Accident Kills Hospital Doctor</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Yang Shu-min, Taipei, July 20) Yesterday, a bus driver from Shin-Shin Bus Company hit and killed Dr. Chou Chia-cheng in Taipei city. Dr. Chou was a doctor from Taoyuan General Hospital. Today, the chairman of Shin-Shin Bus Company, Fan Ta-wei, held a press conference to say sorry and resign. He thinks the accident happened because the driver did not stop at the corner and check carefully before turning.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chou Chia-cheng, a breast cancer doctor from Taoyuan General Hospital, was hit by a bus and died on the morning of July 19. He was crossing the road in Taipei. Shin-Shin Bus Company, whose bus caused the accident, held a press conference today. Fan Ta-wei said that the company will take full responsibility. He also said sorry to everyone and announced that he is resigning.</p>
            <p>Fan Ta-wei said the driver's name is Li. He is 63 years old and has worked as a driver for almost 20 years. He has never broken any traffic rules. However, he was noted 1 or 2 times for not stopping at bus stops, which was a big problem.</p>
            <p>He said that videos from cameras show the driver was probably not tired. The driver was not going too fast and did not turn wrongly. Fan Ta-wei thinks the biggest mistake was not checking carefully with his finger. Maybe there were no other cars on the road at that time. So, the driver did not stop, check with his finger, and then drive when turning. It seems he took an easy way out.</p>
            <p>He explained that parts of the bus, like the front pillar (A-pillar), can block the driver's view. This creates blind spots. So, drivers must stop at crosswalks and when turning. They need to use their finger to check left and right before moving. This rule has been used for a long time. It is sad that some drivers still do not follow it.</p>
            <p>Shin-Shin Bus Company also said that they have about 485 drivers. Four of them are older than 65 years old, and 49 drivers are between 60 and 65 years old. The driver who caused this accident is 63 years old. He asked for his retirement money in March this year and was hired back to work in May. (Edited by Fang Pei-ching) July 20, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Installs Special Crosswalks and Sound Signals to Help Blind People Cross Roads Safely</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chao Li-yen, Taichung, July 20) The government in Taichung City has made special crosswalks for blind people near Huiming School for the Blind. These crosswalks have three white lines. These lines help blind people use their white canes to walk straight. They also put in special traffic lights that make sounds like crickets, birds, and cuckoos. This helps children who cannot see to walk home safely.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung City Transportation Bureau shared some news. The head of the bureau, Yeh Chao-fu, said that the special crosswalks for blind people, the sound-making traffic lights, and bus stop buttons with raised dots (braille) help blind people move around easily. This also teaches drivers to slow down and let people cross when they see the special lines or hear the sounds. The transportation bureau is making traffic better around schools. They are not just helping Huiming School for the Blind. They are also adding clear signs to slow down cars at crossings, sidewalks marked on the road, and making school routes safer. They want to make sure these transport things are safe for everyone to use.</p>
            <p>Yeh Chao-fu also said that they have finished making traffic safer at 63 places near schools where accidents often happen with people walking. They also improved safety at 140 places near schools. To help blind people use buses easily, there is an app called "Taichung Go - Accessible Version." This app works with the bus stop systems. When a blind person is near a bus stop that has a special light, the app tells them. Then, they can use their phone to turn on the light. This means they do not have to look for a button inside the bus stop.</p>
            <p>Cai Min-ling, the head of Huiming School for the Blind, said that more than 60 students at the school have problems seeing or have many problems, including sight. Also, there are almost 300 people from the children's home and care home. They often help blind students go to shopping centers or parks to learn to be on their own and join in social life. Blind students in wheelchairs need more time to cross the road. So, the Transportation Bureau added red light timers. These timers help them know how much time they have to cross. They also put up school zone signs and lines on the road that tell cars to slow down. They made special crosswalks for blind people and traffic lights that make sounds. This helps blind students know their way better and cross the road more safely.</p>
            <p>Fei Jun-hong, who manages things at Huiming School for the Blind, said that for blind students, their "world" is like a power cut. The special crosswalks and sound-making traffic lights do more than just make the roads better. He said it also shows that people in the city understand and respect those who cannot see well or have disabilities. (Edited by Chen Jen-hua) July 20, 2025.</p>

            <h1>"Push & Pull" Dance Show by Hung Dance Impresses Audiences at Festival OFF Avignon</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Li Ruo-yun, Avignon, July 20) When two people face each other, what do "push" and "pull" movements mean? Do they mean love, dislike, or giving in? Hung Dance, a group that has won many awards for their dances, is now at the Festival OFF Avignon in France for the third time. Their dance for two, called "Push & Pull," makes normal movements look like beautiful poems. After difficulties, it helps to calm the close feelings between people.</p>
            <p>Hung Dance had great success in 2022 with "See You" and in 2023 with "BIRDY" at the Festival OFF Avignon. All 40 shows were full. In 2025, Hung Dance is representing Taiwan at the festival again for the third time. They are performing "Push & Pull," which recently won awards in the Netherlands (RIDCC) and Germany (Hanover Choreography Competition). You can see it from July 5 to 26 at the La Condition des Soies theatre.</p>
            <p>The program for "Push & Pull" has a nice description: "Love does not always bring people closer, and dislike does not always push away." This dance is 45 minutes long and is for two dancers. It changes normal pushing and pulling movements. At different times, these movements mean different things. This makes the two dancers play without one person always being in charge.</p>
            <p>Lai Hung-chung, who leads and creates dances for Hung Dance, spoke to the Central News Agency. He said that dance moves can show small changes. For example, when a dancer pushes hard and fast, it might look like a slap. But if the push lasts longer, it can feel like a comforting hug.</p>
            <p>Lai Hung-chung explained, "When one dancer pushes another dancer down, it does not mean they hate each other. I do not create dances to show clear, real-life meanings. Instead, I try to show things in a way that is not so clear, like a poem. This lets the audience think about what it means for themselves."</p>
            <p>BenoÃ®t, who watched the show, said "Push & Pull" was very beautiful. He said the dance had different levels of energy, sometimes quiet and sometimes strong. He told a reporter from the Central News Agency, "I saw two beings like animals. They were trying to understand and get to know each other."</p>
            <p>Roxane, another person who watched and loves dancing, told the Central News Agency that modern dances often use fewer movements to look simple. But "Push & Pull" is different. She said, "The two dancers use all their skills and try very hard. They make 'pushing' and 'pulling' create a feeling of wanting to be together and wanting to be apart. This feeling lasts the whole dance."</p>
            <p>Martine, who also saw the dance, told the reporter that she was not used to this kind of duet. But she still thought "Push & Pull" was very beautiful and even peaceful. Many of the everyday movements where two people face each other felt very real to her. She also saw moments of giving in and accepting.</p>
            <p>MaÃ¯a, who works at the La Condition des Soies theatre, went to thank the Hung Dance team after the show. MaÃ¯a felt that "Push & Pull" brought comfort and healing.</p>
            <p>Different people saw different things in "Push & Pull." But for Lai Hung-chung, the most important word in his mind was "giving way."</p>
            <p>Lai Hung-chung said, "In this dance, there is a part where the dancers measure distance. The two dancers keep measuring how far they are from each other. They use sounds like heartbeats or rain to feel this. During this part, both dancers need to step back a little. This helps them measure more clearly and see the whole picture."</p>
            <p>Lai Hung-chung said, "I think 'giving way' is the main idea of 'Push & Pull.' This 'giving way' is not really stepping back. Instead, it is the two people always moving between different positions. Maybe this is like the character of people from Taiwan."</p>
            <p>This year, a big show called the "Festival OFF Avignon" in France has 1347 groups from all over the world taking part. Groups from Taiwan are also there, like Hung Dance, Meilan Tiya Dance Troupe, Body Prescription, FOCASA Circus, Pingying Dance Ensemble, and the Drama Department of Li Ming Institute of Technology.
