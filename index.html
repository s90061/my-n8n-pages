Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Wang Yi-chuan and a group calling for recalls began a scooter campaign today in Taoyuan. They aim to make the recall efforts a big success. The Blue political party's lawmakers, however, plan to hold a "unity night" to respond to the political challenges with policy explanations.

Wang Yi-chuan and the recall group started their scooter campaign across Taiwan. They plan to hold events in four cities: Taoyuan today, Taitung tomorrow, Taichung on July 11, and Hsinchu on July 13. They expect at least 200 scooters at each event. Participants will wear helmets with "agree" stickers and "agree to recall" T-shirts.

The scooter campaign started around 4 PM from Sanjong Temple in Pingzhen. Several DPP Taoyuan city council members joined the event. Along the way, supporters waved and cheered for the group.

Wang Yi-chuan told the media that they expected 200 scooters, and more people would join later. He said this campaign would work with the "Protect the Nation Pilgrimage" event started by UMC founder Robert Tsao, with both groups moving from east to west and north to south to ensure the "great recall" is successful.

Legislator Lu Ming-che posted on Facebook that a "Unity Night Against Bad Recalls" will be held on July 11 in Zhongli.å‘‚çŽ‰çŽ² also posted that they would use policy talks to face political problems and use their strength against false accusations, letting everyone know that good lawmakers help policies continue.

**BRICS Summit to Start, Expected to Criticize Trump's Tariffs**

The BRICS summit is scheduled to begin on July 6 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is expected that the summit will criticize US President Donald Trump's strong trade policies. However, it will still be difficult for the countries to agree on issues related to the conflicts in the Middle East.

According to sources close to the summit talks, BRICS countries are expected to agree on a common position regarding what they see as unfair US tariffs. BRICS countries represent about half of the world's population and around 40% of the global economy.

US President Trump stated that he has signed letters to be sent to 12 countries. These letters will explain different tariff rates for products shipped to the US. They are planned to be sent on July 7.

Diplomats from the 11 emerging countries that make up BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are working to write a statement. This statement will criticize the economic problems caused by Trump's tariff war.

The final statement from the summit is not expected to directly name the US or its president. However, its content will clearly be a political attack aimed at Washington.

Marta Fernandez, director of the BRICS Policy Center at the Pontifical Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro, said, "We expect a careful tone at this summit: it will be difficult to directly name the United States in the final statement."

This is especially true for China, as it has just finished talks with the US to lower high tariffs that were imposed in return for other tariffs.

Fernandez added, "Now does not seem like the right time to increase tension between the two main world economies, the US and China."

BRICS was created 20 years ago as a group for fast-growing economies. Now, it is seen as a force led by China that aims to balance the power of Western countries.

However, the political importance of this summit will be less because Chinese President Xi Jinping will not be there. This is the first time he has missed this yearly meeting in his 12 years as president.
