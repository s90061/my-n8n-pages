            <h1>India Restores Tourist Visas for Chinese Citizens as Relations Improve</h1>
            <p>The Indian Embassy in China announced today that it will start giving tourist visas to Chinese citizens again from tomorrow. This is happening as relations between China and India get better. This is the first time in five years that India is giving tourist visas to Chinese people.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the relationship between China and India got worse after a fight happened in 2020. This fight was in a disputed area in the Himalayan mountains. After this, India stopped Chinese companies from investing there. It also banned many popular Chinese apps and reduced the number of passenger flights.</p>
            <p>Around the same time, China stopped giving visas to Indian citizens and other foreign people because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But in 2022, China lifted these rules. It started giving visas again to students and people traveling for business.</p>
            <p>China kept its rule about not giving tourist visas to Indian citizens until March this year. At that time, both countries agreed to start direct flights again.</p>
            <p>As relations between the two countries slowly got better, China and India had several important meetings last year. For example, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met in Russia last October.</p>
            <p>China and India share a long border of 3,800 kilometers. Both countries have had disagreements about this border since the 1950s. In 1962, they had a short but fierce war because of the border problem. They continue to talk to solve their disagreements, but progress has been slow.</p>
            <p>India's Foreign Minister told China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi this month that both countries must solve border problems. They need to remove their soldiers and stop trade rules that limit business. This will help their relationship become normal again.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang Reveals Tender Committee Member Became Independent Director; Ministry of National Defense to Re-do Procurement</h1>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, said that a former official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Hong Song-hui, became an independent director for a company that won a military contract. This official used to be on the committee that chose who would win the contract. Today, the Ministry of National Defense said that when they found out in June, they stopped the contract signing process. They also canceled the first result of who won the bid. Now, they will start the buying process again, following the law.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang wrote on Facebook that "Singtex Industrial Co." was chosen as the best company for the "Military Uniform Supply Station Operation Project." However, after Singtex won the selection, the company changed all its board members. Hong Song-hui, who was a former official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and was on the committee that chose Singtex, then became an independent director for Singtex.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense sent out a press release in the evening. It said that for the Army's tender project, a committee member became an independent director for the company that won. When the Ministry of National Defense learned about this in June, they immediately stopped the process of signing the contract. They also canceled the original selection result. The Ministry of National Defense will now start the buying process again, following the law.</p>

            <h1>Mpox Outbreak in Gambia; Cases Increase in Other West African Countries</h1>
            <p>In Gambia, a country in West Africa, an mpox outbreak started yesterday. One case of mpox was found. Many nearby countries have also reported more and more cases of the infection recently.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that because of more cases in West Africa, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that mpox is still a serious international public health emergency.</p>
            <p>Gambia's Ministry of Health made a statement. They said that they found one case of mpox through their regular health check system. They also added that this case was found on July 18th.</p>
            <p>The statement also said, "When even one case of mpox is found in a country where it was not spreading before, it is called an outbreak. We must take action right away."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health in Gambia said they are actively looking for more cases. They are also tracing people who had contact with the sick person and telling people in the community about the disease. They are doing this to stop the illness from spreading.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health said they are doing genetic sequencing. This will help them find out what type of mpox virus is in Gambia.</p>
            <p>From January to the end of May this year, the nearby country of Sierra Leone reported a total of 3,350 mpox cases. Sixteen people died from the disease there.</p>
            <p>The National Public Health Institute of Liberia said that by early June, their country had about 71 active cases.</p>
            <p>Last week, Guinea reported that the number of mpox cases in their country has gone over 200 since September of last year.</p>
            <p>According to the WHO, thousands of mpox cases have also been reported this year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Burundi.</p>
