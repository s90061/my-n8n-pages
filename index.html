            <h1>Taiwanese Tea Master Wins International Award, Makes Taiwan Proud</h1>
            <p>Miaoli, October 13 (CNA) â€“ A young tea master from Miaoli, Chang Chia-chi, has made his own tea brand famous around the world. He has won the top awards in the three most important tea competitions in the world. This year, TasteAtlas, a global food guide, named his brand one of the top 20 tea brands for 2025. It is the only Taiwanese brand on the list.</p>
            <p>Miaoli County Magistrate Chung Tung-chin met and honored Chang Chia-chi today at the county government office. He praised Chang for his excellent tea-making skills and new ideas, which have helped Taiwanese tea become known around the world again. Chung also tried Chang's new champagne sparkling tea and said it was smooth and had many different tastes. He said, "You know it's a high-quality product as soon as you drink it," and "It's so good you don't want to drink it fast."</p>
            <p>Chang Chia-chi comes from a family that makes tea equipment. He carefully tried different ways to make tea and kept detailed records of the tea leaves and how he controlled the temperature and wetness during the drying process. This helped him create new and exciting tastes for Taiwanese black tea and Oriental Beauty tea.</p>
            <p>Chang, who is 40 years old, has won many international awards with his own brand, FormoCha. So far, he has won the Great Taste Awards' three-star award in the UK, the highest gold award at the World Green Tea Contest in Japan, and the AVPA International Tea Competition in France. He has won all the major tea awards. EVA Air also chose his tea for its business class. This year, TasteAtlas, a global food guide, named his brand one of the top 20 tea brands for 2025. It is the only Taiwanese brand on the list.</p>
            <p>Chang said that TasteAtlas has over one million followers worldwide. The winners are chosen based on how well brands do in international tea competitions, what experts think, and what many customers say. Only two Japanese brands were chosen. When he found out he was chosen, he first thought it was a trick. He said, "I was really surprised and happy."</p>
            <p>About his special champagne tea, Chang explained that it is different from champagne (alcohol) made from fermented fruits like grapes. Although tea leaves are not fermented, he uses many layers of oxidation to create different smells and tastes, and then adds bubbles under pressure. After some time in a pressure tank, it is put into bottles. When it is cold, it tastes as good as champagne. It can also be served with fancy meals but does not have alcohol.</p>
            <p>Magistrate Chung Tung-chin said that the county government helps young farmers try new things. Chang Chia-chi has used new ideas to change traditional tea making. He has shown the world the many sides of Taiwanese tea and made the quality and value of tea much better. He is a pride for Miaoli and for Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Osaka Expo Ends: Japanese Prime Minister Praises Mascot "Myaku-Myaku"</h1>
            <p>Osaka, October 13 (CNA) â€“ The 2025 World Expo in Osaka, which began on April 13, officially ended today after 184 days. The closing ceremony was held in the afternoon. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba gave an award to Myaku-Myaku, the official mascot. The award recognized Myaku-Myaku's help in making the Expo exciting.</p>
            <p>The Osaka Expo closing ceremony took place in the afternoon at the "Shining Hat" venue. Masakazu Tokura, the head of the Japan Association for the 2025 World Exposition, spoke at the event. He said, "So many visitors came to the Expo, making it an Expo for everyone. We, as the hosts, are very happy. We hope that the experiences and good feelings people had at the Expo will continue for many years and help create a 'future society where life shines brightly'."</p>
            <p>Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura thanked people from all over the world and in Japan. He said, "Thank you to our friends from all over the world, and thank you to the people of Japan." He looked back at different events during the Expo, such as "10,000 people singing Beethoven's 'Ode to Joy'," a flying show by the Air Self-Defense Force's "Blue Impulse," and the impressive "Ring Roof." He said "thank you" eight times.</p>
            <p>Prince Fumihito Akishino, the honorary president of the Expo, gave a closing speech. He said, "I want to show deep respect to everyone who worked hard to make the Expo happen. I hope the good experiences from this Expo will be passed down to future generations."</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said, "The Expo, with its theme 'Designing Future Society for Our Lives,' was a great success. More than 25 million people from Japan and around the world visited. Today, we can have this wonderful closing ceremony because of the hard work of many people: over 160 countries and regions, international groups, companies, organizations, citizens, and especially Osaka Prefecture and Osaka City. I want to thank them very much."</p>
            <p>He said, "Before the Expo, some people worried about how ready we were. But all the people who took part and everyone involved worked hard to solve problems one by one. Everyone worked together to create a wonderful Expo that made many people happy. I truly believe that this not only shows the start of a 'new Japan' but also brings an important chance for the future."</p>
            <p>Ishiba then gave a special award to Myaku-Myaku. He said he especially wanted to thank Myaku-Myaku, the mascot, for being cute and unique and helping the Expo be a success. He gave Myaku-Myaku the "Prime Minister's Letter of Appreciation" and said, "Thank you, Myaku-Myaku." Myaku-Myaku became very popular, which was a nice surprise for the Osaka Expo.</p>
            <p>The Nikkei newspaper reported that Myaku-Myaku, who looks a bit strange but charming, became very popular after the Osaka Expo started. A tool called Meltwater was used to look at Japanese posts on social media X for almost six months after the Expo opened. It found that posts about Myaku-Myaku (not including reposts or quotes) were 540,000. This was more than Disney's Mickey Mouse (309,000) and PokÃ©mon's Pikachu (440,000). This shows how much attention and excitement Myaku-Myaku created online.</p>
            <p>The closing ceremony included performances like taiko drums and dancing, and Myaku-Myaku dancing with children. The final part included members of the group "Arashi," Sho Sakurai, students from Wajima High School in Ishikawa Prefecture (which was affected by last year's Noto Peninsula earthquake), film director Naomi Kawase, and news anchor Yumiko Udo. They all spoke about their hopes for peace and the future.</p>
            <p>The news that Sho Sakurai would be at the closing ceremony was not announced before. When he appeared on stage in a suit, people online quickly started talking. Comments included, "Mr. Sho Sakurai suddenly appeared?!" and "I screamed, it was such a surprise," and "Sho Sakurai and Udo on the same stage, it's like watching 'news zero' (a Japanese TV news show)."</p>
            <p>After the closing ceremony, a parade was held at the west entrance of the Expo site. Myaku-Myaku danced with the popular dance group Avantgardey, and the atmosphere was very lively.</p>
