The Ministry of Education officially announced yesterday the amendment to the "Regulations for the Appointment of Part-time, Substitute, and Provisional Teachers in Senior Secondary Schools and Below." This amendment specifies that qualified provisional teachers' work experience can be counted for salary increments, similar to full-time teachers. This move addresses a Constitutional Court ruling from July last year, which deemed the previous regulations regarding the non-counting of prior service years for provisional teachers as unconstitutional.

Previously, provisional teachers' salaries were regulated inconsistently across different counties and cities, with some unable to accumulate seniority. Provisional teacher Zhang Kaixiang filed a constitutional interpretation request after Zhonghe High School did not count his two years of prior teaching experience. The Constitutional Court ruled that while the Teachers' Act was constitutional, the provision disallowing prior service years for provisional teachers was unconstitutional, mandating the Ministry of Education to amend the law within one year to unify regulations nationwide.

The National Union of Provisional and Substitute Teachers announced today that the Ministry of Education officially promulgated the amended provisional teacher appointment regulations yesterday. A new Article 16, Paragraph 3, has been added, stipulating that qualified provisional teachers' work experience, provided a single contract period exceeds three months and accumulates to one year, can be advanced by one salary grade, aligning with full-time teachers.

The union stated that this amendment is the first time provisional teachers have been included in the seniority calculation mechanism of Article 9 of the Teacher Salary Regulations. This ends the long-standing structural unfairness of "no salary adjustment no matter how long one works" and secures belated but crucial dignity and protection for provisional teachers across Taiwan.

The union also highlighted that this reform is the culmination of eight years of effort. Zhang Kaixiang filed an administrative lawsuit in 2017, began appealing in 2017, and formally applied for a constitutional interpretation in 2019. The union was established in 2023, and the Constitutional Court formally accepted the case in January 2023, held oral arguments in March 2024, and declared it unconstitutional in August 2024, with a one-year deadline for legislative amendment. The union emphasized that the arrival of this institutional reform is a response to past injustices and a structural improvement to the future educational labor environment.

The union urged that, given the current challenges of declining birth rates and increased mobility in educational human resources, ensuring fair treatment for provisional teachers is crucial for stabilizing the education sector and retaining excellent educators. The establishment of a seniority increment system helps foster a stable human resource network, preventing systemic discrimination and talent outflow.

**KMT Taichung Party HQ Forged Recall Petitions Against DPP Legislators; Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng Released on NT$1 Million Bail**

The Kuomintang (KMT) Taichung City Party Headquarters, in an effort to counter widespread recall movements, allegedly had its First Group Director, Wu Kang-lung, and Secretary-General, Chen Jian-feng, along with 33 other cadres and party workers, forge 4258 petitions by "copying party member rosters." These petitions were aimed at recalling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislators Tsai Chi-chang and Ho Hsin-chun. Party members were even instructed to alternate between blue and black pens during the copying process. Prosecutors yesterday indicted 34 party members. Wu and Chen, who had been in custody, were transferred to the court and subsequently released on bail early this morning, with NT$800,000 and NT$1,000,000 respectively.

The Taichung District Prosecutors Office yesterday indicted 34 party members, including Wu Kang-lung and Chen Jian-feng, on charges of forgery and violations of the Election and Recall Act. Wu and Chen had been detained since a search in early May. The case was transferred to the Taichung District Court yesterday, which decided late last night to set bail at NT$800,000 and NT$1,000,000 respectively. The two managed to raise the bail money in approximately one hour and were successfully released early this morning.

Prosecutors stated that in mid-to-late January this year, the KMT Taichung City Party Headquarters held a meeting where it was decided to counter the recall efforts against KMT legislators in Taichung and to initiate recall petitions against DPP legislators Tsai Chi-chang (First Electoral District) and Ho Hsin-chun (Seventh Electoral District). Wu Kang-lung, the General Manager of the KMT Taichung City Party Headquarters First Group, was appointed as the overall supervisor for recall affairs, with Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng providing assistance.

According to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, the number of proposal signatories required for recall cases in Taichung City's First and Seventh Electoral Districts is 2235 and 3297, respectively. To quickly meet these thresholds, Wu decided to forge a large number of petitions by copying KMT party member rosters.

Prosecutors discovered that on January 22, Wu Kang-lung sent a message in the party headquarters' LINE group, instructing executive directors and deputy executive directors to attend a "special lecture" at the city party headquarters the following day, bringing one blue and one black pen each, and to download the party member rosters for the First and Seventh Electoral Districts as reference for copying.

Prosecutors reported that on January 23, the day of the "special lecture," Wu Kang-lung, Chen Jian-feng, and 34 others attended. Wu explained to the attendees that the recall targets were Tsai Chi-chang and Ho Hsin-chun and instructed them to extensively copy party member rosters. He also reminded them "not to copy party members over 80 years old, not to write in simplified Chinese characters, to mark copied names in the roster to avoid duplication, and to alternate between black and blue pens."

Statistics show that on that day, the 34 individuals copied and forged 1710 petitions to recall Tsai Chi-chang and 2502 petitions to recall Ho Hsin-chun, totaling 4212 petitions. In late January and early February, Wu and Chen further instructed party members to organize and arrange the petitions. If obvious identical handwriting appeared consecutively, they would shuffle the order to avoid detection. The collected petitions were then submitted to the Central Election Commission, totaling 6350 submissions.

However, after verification and disqualification by the Election Commission, 61 additional petitions for Tsai and 445 for Ho were still needed. Wu and Chen then instructed party members to copy and forge 10 and 36 additional petitions for supplementary submission. Ultimately, the Election Commission verified 2360 valid submissions for Tsai's recall (threshold 2235) and 3513 for Ho's recall (threshold 3297). However, after deducting the forged 1720 and 2538 petitions, both clearly fell short of the required threshold.

Prosecutors stated that Wu Kang-lung and Chen Jian-feng, as high-ranking KMT Taichung City Party Headquarters cadres, later deleted chat records to destroy evidence and initially did not admit guilt, only doing so eventually. The other executive directors and deputy executive directors acted under pressure. The investigation concluded with the indictment of 34 people for violating the Election and Recall Act, forgery, and other offenses.

**China's '22 Measures to Punish Taiwan Independence' Marks One Year; Ministry of State Security Claims Continuous Crackdown on Taiwanese Espionage Cases**

More than a year has passed since China issued the "Opinions on Legally Punishing Stubborn Taiwan Independence Separatists for Crimes of Splitting the Country and Inciting Secession" (the 22 Measures to Punish Taiwan Independence) in June last year. China's Ministry of State Security stated this morning that these "Opinions" fully demonstrate their firm determination and powerful action to safeguard national unity in accordance with the law. They also claimed that Chinese national security agencies have "continuously cracked down on Taiwanese espionage and secrecy cases," dismantling a number of spy intelligence networks.

The article further criticized that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities, driven by their own party's interests, are currently engaging in "green terror" against the people on the island, suppressing dissent by any means necessary, and disregarding the welfare of the populace. It alleged that they fawn over and rely on Western powers, treating national righteousness as worthless, and serving as "pawns" for anti-China forces aiming to contain China. Regarding the mainland, the article stated that the DPP refuses to acknowledge the "1992 Consensus," slanders and distorts "One Country, Two Systems," treats cross-strait peace as a joke, and constantly provokes independence. The article concluded that the DPP's perverse actions and egregious crimes will ultimately turn Taiwan into a "powder keg" and "ammunition depot," plunging the Taiwanese people into a perilous abyss of war. It warned that following the path of Taiwan independence will only lead to becoming a tool for the DPP's private use, cannon fodder for Taiwan independence separatist forces' "armed pursuit of independence," and historical sinners of the Chinese nation.

China's Ministry of State Security stated in an article on the 28th that the "Opinions" provide a strong legal weapon for defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity, sending a clear and severe warning to Taiwan independence separatist forces, and fully demonstrating their firm determination and powerful action to safeguard national unity in accordance with the law.

The article detailed that in the year since the "Opinions" were issued, relevant departments have fully exercised their functions. This includes the Wenzhou Intermediate People's Court in Zhejiang Province sentencing Yang Zhiyuan to nine years in prison and three years of deprivation of political rights for "splitting the country" in August 2024. In February this year, the Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate People's Court sentenced Li Yanhe, editor-in-chief of Taiwan's Bachi Culture, to three years in prison, one year of deprivation of political rights, and a confiscation of personal property of RMB 50,000 for "inciting secession."

Furthermore, China's Ministry of State Security and other departments named and released identity information of several personnel from Taiwan's Cyber Warfare Force who participated in planning, commanding, and implementing cyberattacks, espionage, and infiltration against mainland China. This action, it stated, resolutely thwarts "internet-based independence" activities and creates a strong deterrent effect.

The article also mentioned that Chinese national security agencies have continued to strike hard, continuously cracking down on Taiwanese espionage and secrecy cases, dismantling a large number of spy intelligence networks established in mainland China, and severely punishing intelligence infiltration and separatist activities in accordance with the law, thereby effectively safeguarding national security.

China's Ministry of State Security stated that following the "2018 - Thunder" and "Thunder - 2020" special operations, national security agencies will continue to firmly implement the requirements of the "Opinions," fully perform their duties, and severely crack down on illegal and criminal acts by stubborn Taiwan independence separatists in accordance with the law, dealing a direct blow to the arrogance of Taiwan independence separatist forces and external interference forces.

Last August, China's Ministry of State Security also published an article claiming to have "continuously cracked down on over a thousand Taiwanese espionage and secrecy cases, dismantling a large number of spy intelligence networks established in mainland China." Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded at the time that the so-called "over a thousand Taiwanese espionage and secrecy cases," if not exaggerated for performance or boasting, then it is another public declaration that Chinese national security agencies are abusing their power and arbitrarily detaining Taiwanese people who do not conform to Beijing's political ideology and advocate for democracy and freedom, treating them as Taiwan independence separatists or spies by using vague and unclear laws.
