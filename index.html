***PuHong Launches New Taiwan-Made Financial Device to Replace Imports and Grow Sales***

(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 15) Lin Qun-guo, the chairman of PuHong Information, a company that provides financial payment services, said today that they have launched a new financial device for banks. This new device is made in Taiwan. It helps with information security because of the current global political, economic, and cyber security situations. PuHong hopes this device will replace similar products from other countries and become their next important product, helping PuHong's sales grow this year.

PuHong Information is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year. They held a meeting with the media today. Lin Qun-guo said that since PuHong started, it has worked with banks in Taiwan. Their five main product areas include payment systems, financial applications, information security, data protection, and outsourced IT services.

Lin Qun-guo also mentioned that in recent years, banks have told them about growing problems in their work. These problems come from two main areas. First, rules for cyber security are becoming stricter. It is hard for banks to follow these rules and keep their operations safe because there are not enough skilled people in financial IT.

Lin Qun-guo pointed out that the prices of software and hardware from large international companies have gone up quickly in recent years. Also, their rules for using products are becoming more complicated, and products are supported for shorter times. This makes it hard for banks to manage their IT budgets and still meet their profit goals.

He said that because of the current global political, economic, and cyber security situations, making their own information security products and building strong financial systems are important for the financial industry.

He said that PuHong's "financial device" helps banks with their main problems. It focuses on making cyber security products in Taiwan and replacing imported ones. It also meets banks' needs, such as quickly restoring services, preventing big accidents, setting up financial cyber security, and fully taking responsibility for following rules.

He added that the new "financial device" is made to follow financial rules even before it leaves the factory. He believes this new product will help the company earn more money this year.

***Foreign Investment in Taiwan Grew by 126% in First Half of Year, Helped by Large Offshore Wind Farm Projects***

(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 15) The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced today its statistics on foreign and overseas Chinese investment in Taiwan. In the first six months of this year, 1016 investment cases were approved. Although this is a small decrease of about 4% in the number of cases, the total investment amount reached 7.36 billion US dollars. This is a big increase of 126.46%. This growth happened mainly because large projects were approved, such as Orsted Energy's new investments and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) adding more money to their offshore wind farms.

Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Investment Commission announced statistics for foreign and overseas Chinese investment in Taiwan, Chinese investment in Taiwan, Taiwan's investment abroad, and Taiwan's investment in mainland China. In the first six months of this year, a total of 1027 investment cases in Taiwan were approved (this includes foreign and overseas Chinese investment, and Chinese investment). The total investment amount was 7,466,615,000 US dollars.

Regarding foreign and overseas Chinese investment in Taiwan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that from January to June this year, 1016 cases of foreign and overseas Chinese investment were approved. This is a 4.15% decrease compared to the same period last year. However, the investment amount was 7,365,871,000 US dollars, which is a 126.46% increase.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that the main reason for this increase was the approval of several large investment projects. These include: Denmark's ORSTED WIND POWER TW HOLDING A/S (Orsted Energy) investing about 2.02 billion US dollars to set up Dazhanghua Southwest Holdings Co., Ltd.; Luxembourg's CI FENGMIAO SCSP investing about 671.51 million US dollars to add more capital to Copenhagen Infrastructure Fengmiao Co., Ltd.; and British Cayman Islands company STONEPEAK OCEANVIEW (CAYMAN) HOLDINGS COMPANY investing about 268.07 million US dollars to add more capital to Peak Seaview Investment Co., Ltd.

Also, from January to June this year, 11 cases of Chinese investment in Taiwan were approved. The investment amount was 100,744,000 US dollars. The increase in this amount was mainly because in January, Hong Kong-based Peng Ding International Co., Ltd., which has a Taiwanese business background, was approved to invest 3 billion New Taiwan Dollars to add more capital to Peng Ding Technology Co., Ltd.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that even though Hong Kong-based Peng Ding Company is fully owned by Zhen Ding-KY Company, which is listed in Taiwan, and its main shareholder is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn), the investment pathway involved Peng Ding's subsidiary in Shenzhen investing in Taiwan. Therefore, it still needed approval under the rules for Chinese investment.

Regarding Taiwan's investment abroad, from January to June this year, 414 cases of overseas investment were approved. This is a 20.35% increase compared to the same period last year. The investment amount was 18,311,147,000 US dollars, which is a 24.29% decrease.

According to the statistics, for investment in mainland China, from January to June this year, 101 cases of investment in mainland China were approved. The number of cases decreased by 42.61% compared to the same period last year. The approved investment amount was 574,447,000 US dollars, which is a 62.86% decrease compared to the same period last year.
