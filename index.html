A key concern for traders is the potential for direct US military involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, which has been ongoing for two weeks. Other factors influencing the market include expectations around Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and ongoing tensions regarding chip technology between the US and China.

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., is proposing a major collaboration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to establish a massive industrial center for artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. This ambitious project, potentially worth a trillion dollars, represents Son's largest investment idea to date. SoftBank officials are eager for TSMC, a leading manufacturer of advanced AI chips, to play a significant role. This comes as TSMC already has plans to invest $165 billion in the US and has begun mass production at its first factory in Arizona. Son has also prepared a list of SoftBank Vision Fund companies that could participate in this Arizona manufacturing hub.
