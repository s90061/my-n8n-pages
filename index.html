            <h1>US Trade Deficit Smaller in June, Importers Working to Handle Tariffs</h1>
            <p>The US trade deficit got smaller in June. This means the country bought less from other countries than it sold. Imports went down more than exports. This shows that businesses that buy goods from other countries are trying to deal with the extra taxes, called tariffs, that President Trump put on products from other nations.</p>
            <p>The US Commerce Department said today that the total trade deficit in June was 60.2 billion US dollars. This is 16% less than the 71.7 billion US dollars deficit in May.</p>
            <p>This decrease was more than experts expected. It happened mainly because fewer goods for people to buy, like consumer products, were imported. This is because President Trump's taxes made it more expensive for US companies to buy foreign goods.</p>
            <p>On July 31st, President Trump made a final decision on his equal tariffs policy. He wants to make trade fair for the US. The new taxes on goods from almost 70 countries are now between 10% and 41%. This is a bit less than when they were first announced in early April this year.</p>
            <p>Oren Klachkin, an economist, said that people are now less unsure about the policy. This is because the plan for higher tariffs is now public.</p>
            <p>He also said that companies that hoped the tariffs were just a warning now have to accept that the tariffs will stay. He thinks that the bad effects of these high tariffs will be bigger than the good effects of less policy uncertainty.</p>
            <p>The US trade deficit became smaller in June because imports dropped by a lot (3.7%, to 337.5 billion US dollars). Exports also dropped a little (0.5%, to 277.3 billion US dollars).</p>
            <p>Looking at imports, consumer goods went down by 8.4 billion US dollars. Industrial goods and raw materials went down by 2.7 billion US dollars. Also, imports of cars and car parts dropped by 1.3 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Exports also decreased in June. This was because exports of goods went down by 1.3 billion US dollars, and industrial goods exports also became lower.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the US trade deficit with China in June got much smaller. It went down by 4.6 billion US dollars, reaching 9.4 billion US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Former Romanian President Iliescu Dies at 95</h1>
            <p>Authorities in Romania have announced that their former President, Ion Iliescu, passed away today. He was 95 years old.</p>
            <p>The Romanian government shared a sad message online. It said, "We are sad to announce that Mr. Ion Iliescu, who used to be the President of Romania, has died."</p>
            <p>The Romanian government sent its condolences, which means they shared their sadness, with Mr. Iliescu's family and friends.</p>
            <p>The message also said that more information about his state funeral, a special funeral held by the country, will be given in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Mr. Iliescu was in the hospital in early June this year because of lung cancer. The hospital in Bucharest where he was treated said last week that he was in a "critical" condition, meaning he was very ill.</p>
            <p>He was a very important person in politics. He helped lead Romania, a country in Eastern Europe, through a hard time. During this time, the country changed from being communist to being democratic. Mr. Iliescu was last seen in public in the year 2017.</p>

            <h1>European Stocks Mixed as US Interest Rate Cut Future Unclear</h1>
            <p>New information shows that prices in the United States are going up faster, which is called inflation. This makes it less clear if the US will lower its interest rates soon. Because of this, the stock markets in Europe had mixed results today. Some went up, and some went down. The market's strong comeback became weaker.</p>
            <p>In London, the FTSE 100 stock index went up a little. It increased by 14.43 points, which is 0.16%, and ended the day at 9142.73 points.</p>
            <p>In Frankfurt, Germany, the DAX index went up by 88.38 points, or 0.37%. It closed at 23846.07 points.</p>
            <p>However, in Paris, France, the CAC 40 index went down. It fell by 10.97 points, which is 0.14%, and finished at 7621.04 points.</p>
