            <h1>US Stocks Reach New Highs, Not Affected by Bad Job Numbers</h1>
            <p>New York (CNA) â€“ The four main US stock indexes reached new high closing prices today. This happened even though the job data was disappointing. The US government thinks that the number of new jobs created in the last year, until March, might be 911,000 less than first thought. This information could make the Federal Reserve (Fed) decide to lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 196.39 points, or 0.43%, closing at 45711.34 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up a little, by 17.46 points, or 0.27%, closing at 6512.61 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index went up by 80.79 points, or 0.37%, closing at 21879.49 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up slightly, by 10.21 points, or 0.18%, closing at 5819.82 points.</p>

            <h1>"Greek Freak" Helps Greece Beat Lithuania, Enters EuroBasket Semifinals After 16 Years</h1>
            <p>Riga, Latvia (CNA) â€“ Greece has made it to the EuroBasket semifinals again, after 2009. They beat Lithuania 87-76 thanks to Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as the "Greek Freak," an NBA star from the Milwaukee Bucks, who played very well.</p>
            <p>The official EuroBasket website reported that Giannis Antetokounmpo scored a huge 29 points. In the last five EuroBasket tournaments, Greece stopped at the quarterfinals four times. But this time, they finally moved past that stage. They will now play against Turkey to try and reach the championship game.</p>
            <p>Greece started the second quarter playing very well, making three 3-point shots. They went on an 11-2 run, making the score 35-24. However, Lithuania quickly responded with an 11-2 run of their own, bringing the score to 38-39. By the end of the first half, Lithuania was behind 38-44.</p>
            <p>Lithuania managed to get closer, making the score 41-44. But then Greece increased their lead to 51-41. In the middle of the third quarter, they stretched their lead even more to 58-43. Lithuania briefly reduced the gap to 9 points, but Greece again made their lead bigger, to 16 points, at the start of the fourth quarter, making the game's outcome clear.</p>
            <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was very important for Greece and played strongly against Lithuania. The NBA superstar scored 29 points in total. He made 9 out of 15 shots and 11 out of 16 free throws. He also got 6 rebounds, 2 assists, 4 steals, and 1 block.</p>
            <p>Vasileios Toliopoulos made three 3-point shots and scored 17 points. Kostas Sloukas had 11 points and 4 assists. Kostas Antetokounmpo also played well, with 4 points and 4 blocks.</p>
            <p>Even though Jonas Valanciunas played very well with 24 points and 15 rebounds, and Arnas Velickas got 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 7 assists, Lithuania could not win the game.</p>
            <p>Greece won the EuroBasket championship in 1987 and 2005. Now, they only need two more wins to get their third trophy in the team's history.</p>

            <h1>Apple's iPhone 17 Series Focuses on Camera Upgrades, New Thin 'Air' Model Introduced</h1>
            <p>San Francisco (CNA) â€“ Apple held its autumn event today and showed its new iPhone 17 series. They also introduced a new member to the family, the iPhone Air, which is the thinnest iPhone ever. All models in the series will start with 256GB of storage. The iPhone 17 will cost from NT$29,900, and the iPhone Air will cost from NT$36,900. You can pre-order them on September 12, and they will be officially available on September 19.</p>
            <p>Apple's autumn event was streamed online. CEO Tim Cook appeared at Apple's headquarters in California. He first showed the new AirPods Pro 3 wireless earphones, then the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3, and Apple Watch Ultra 3 smartwatches. Finally, the much-anticipated iPhone 17 series phones were revealed.</p>
            <p>The regular iPhone 17 has a bigger 6.3-inch screen and thinner edges. It comes in five colors: lavender purple, sage green, mist blue, white, and black. The screen's material technology is better, making it three times more resistant to scratches.</p>
            <p>The new iPhone 17 uses the A19 chip, made with TSMC's 3-nanometer technology. It has a 6-core CPU and a 5-core GPU, which makes it 20% faster than the previous model. It also supports Apple Intelligence, Apple's personal smart system, which has a real-time translation feature.</p>
            <p>This year, improving the camera is a big new feature. The back camera is now 48 megapixels. The front camera is also a main focus, with improved quality of 16 megapixels. It also has a "Center Stage" feature, which keeps you in the middle of the picture whether you hold the phone horizontally or vertically for selfies. The camera can stay very steady, even if you are running while taking a selfie.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max come in silver, cosmic orange, and deep blue. They have the newest A19 Pro chip and a bigger battery. For materials, the new Pro models use an aluminum body made in one piece, instead of the titanium metal used before. They also have a VC vapor chamber design for the first time, which helps them cool down better.</p>
            <p>For the camera, all three back cameras on the Pro models are now 48 megapixels. They support up to 8x optical zoom and 40x digital zoom. Apple's new camera system uses a camera module that extends sideways, which Apple calls Plateau.</p>
            <p>The iPhone Air, a new member of the Apple family, was shown today. It will take the place of the current Plus models. The iPhone Air is the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever. It was inspired by Apple's thin laptops, the MacBook Air. This brings the "Air" idea to the iPhone, making "thin and light" a main selling point. A video at the online event showed it as thinner than a finger. It comes in four colors: sky blue, light gold, cloud white, and space black.</p>
            <p>This new phone weighs about 145 grams and has a titanium frame. It is a little more than 5.5 millimeters thick, which is about 2 millimeters thinner than current iPhones. It has a large 6.6-inch screen and supports the same 120 Hz ProMotion display technology as the Pro models. It also has the same A19 Pro chip as the new Pro and Pro Max models, which means it works better than the standard iPhone 17.</p>
            <p>All new Apple phones will start with 256GB of storage. The iPhone 17 starts at $799 (NT$29,900), the iPhone 17 Pro starts at $1099 (NT$39,900), and the iPhone Air, which is new, starts at $999 (NT$36,900).</p>
            <p>Pre-orders for all new models will open on September 12 (8 PM Taiwan time), and they will be available in stores on September 19.</p>
