            <h1>Green Party Says Mayor Lu Left the Biggest Pile of Trash in Taiwan; Taichung City Says Landfill is Not Full</h1>
            <p>News reports recently said that the Dali landfill is full and causing problems for citizens. Today, Mr. Cho Kuan-ting, a spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen has been missing and has left the biggest pile of trash in Taiwan during her 8 years in office. The Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau (EPB) replied that the landfill follows environmental rules and is not full. They also said that after the waste incinerator is repaired, the trash can be moved back to be burned.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Tseng and Mr. Cho Kuan-ting, spokespersons for the DPP, held a press conference this morning. Mr. Cho Kuan-ting said that the media showed on September 1st that the Dali landfill was full. After that, the DPP group in the Taichung City Council held more press conferences. But Mayor Lu has been quiet for 7 days and has not responded.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cho Kuan-ting explained that before the previous Taichung Mayor Lin Chia-lung left office, the Dali landfill had only 7,000 tons of trash. In 2019, when Mayor Lu started her first year, it reached 37,000 tons. Now, it has grown to 340,000 tons, which is 40% of all the open-air trash piles in Taiwan's 22 cities and counties.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cho Kuan-ting pointed out that as early as 2018, when Mr. Lin Chia-lung was mayor, the city had already set aside a budget of 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars to improve the Wenshan Incinerator. At that time, it was expected to be finished by 2021. If Mayor Lu had continued this plan when she started, the trash problem could have been solved easily. But sadly, after Mayor Lu took office, she changed the previous plan. She said it would be changed to a BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) project. The cost for the project grew a lot, to 8.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars. So, during her 8 years in office, she left the biggest pile of trash in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Tseng said that audit reports had warned every year that Taichung City's incinerators could not handle enough trash, and the landfill was also running out of space. Taichung's three incinerators are all old and need to be updated. But because Mayor Lu kept changing her mind between ROT (Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer) and BOT plans, the Wenshan Incinerator project only started looking for companies this year. It is expected to be finished in 2032.</p>
            <p>In response, the Taichung Environmental Protection Bureau said that the Dali landfill follows strict environmental rules and is not full. They also use it as a place to temporarily store trash when the incinerators are closed for yearly repairs. When the incinerator repairs are done, the trash from the landfill can be moved back to be burned. They call this "in and out."</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau stated that they started moving trash from the Dali landfill back to the incinerator storage in 2023. The Minister of Environment, Mr. Peng Chi-ming, even visited and said that the handling was good. It was not listed in the national meeting about uncovered trash.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said that to get rid of household trash faster, they are improving the incinerators to handle more trash. They also temporarily move trash to the landfill. While doing this, they follow strict environmental rules. They cover the trash with special recycled ash from burning or use nets to stop it from spreading. This makes sure that the environment around is kept clean.</p>
