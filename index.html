            <h1>KuoPro Financial Plans to Increase Capital for Rakuten Bank; FSC Respects Company Decisions</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 24, CNA reporter Su Ssu-yun) Rakuten Bank, an online-only bank, is still losing money. KuoPro Financial Holding plans to increase its capital by asking for cash from investors. However, some shareholders are worried that their ownership share will become smaller. They have different ideas about when and how to increase the capital. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that it respects the company's decisions on how it is managed. According to the Banking Act, if a bank loses more than one-third of its capital, the authorities will set a time limit for it to add enough capital.</p>
            <p>The media asked about the FSC's view on this. They noted that KuoPro Financial plans to increase capital for Rakuten Bank, but internal shareholders have different opinions about if and when it is needed.</p>
            <p>Hou Liyang, who is a deputy director at the FSC's Banking Bureau, said in a regular press conference that financial companies increasing their capital is a matter of how the company is run. The FSC respects these management decisions.</p>
            <p>He explained that under the Banking Act, if a bank loses more than one-third of its capital, the FSC will give the company a deadline to add more capital. The exact deadline depends on each situation. If a company has not yet reached the one-third limit, it can decide to increase capital on its own based on its financial situation. "Doing it on your own is different from being forced to," he said.</p>
            <p>Hou Liyang also said that if financial companies make their capital stronger earlier, the FSC is happy to see it. However, whether a company increases capital and by how much is up to the company. For a company to increase capital, it must follow certain steps. This includes getting approval from the board of directors, and sometimes from shareholders. They also need to apply to the FSC for approval. The FSC will check these applications according to the rules.</p>
            <p>People also asked if there are other ways to add capital besides asking for cash. Hou Liyang said it depends on whether these ways follow the Banking Act. For example, if a company gets money by selling bonds, this money cannot be counted as capital. (Editor: Pan Yi-ching) 1140724</p>

            <h1>Former Canadian Defense Minister, Who Showed Taiwan Flag in a Tweet, Will Visit Taiwan for Security Forum</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 24, CNA reporter Yang Yao-ju) The "Ketagalan Forum: 2025 Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue" will happen on August 5. Many experts and politicians from Europe, America, and Asia will attend. Among them, Jason Kenney, who used to be Canada's Minister of Defense, will talk about the new security situation in the Indo-Pacific region. He will speak with Tomohiko Taniguchi, who was a foreign policy advisor to Japan's former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</p>
            <p>The Prospect Foundation is holding the "Ketagalan Forum: 2025 Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue" on August 5. According to the agenda, which we know exclusively, former Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney will take part in the first session. This session is called "New Geopolitical Security Situation in the Indo-Pacific." He will talk with scholars from research groups in the Philippines and India, and with Tomohiko Taniguchi, who is now a special professor at the University of Tsukuba in Japan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kenney has strong views on national security. In 2015, when he was Defense Minister, he announced that Canadian soldiers would go to Ukraine to train their military. He also sent troops to the international security and peacekeeping center of the Ukrainian army.</p>
            <p>Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Taiwan gave 25,000 face masks to Alberta, a province in Canada. At that time, Jason Kenney was the Premier of Alberta. He wrote a message on Twitter to thank Taiwan for giving masks to Alberta to help fight the virus. He also put the flag of the Republic of China (Taiwan) next to the Canadian flag in his message.</p>
            <p>This year, experts and politicians from Europe, America, and Asia will come to Taiwan for talks. The second session will be "Responding to 'Hybrid Warfare' and Making Whole-Society Defense Stronger." Scholars from organizations like the American Enterprise Institute, the Atlantic Council, the University of Copenhagen (Denmark), and the Global Risk Mitigation Foundation (Hawaii, USA) will talk. Also, a French politician who supports Taiwan will give a special speech.</p>
            <p>The third session, "How Economy, Technology, and Industrial Diplomacy Affect International Politics," will include talks by scholars from places like Sciences Po Lyon (France), the Main School of Fire Service in Poland, and the Central European Institute of Asian Studies in Slovakia.
