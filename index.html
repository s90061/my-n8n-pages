            <h1>Joshua Young, a former aide to Randall Schriver, becomes Deputy Assistant Secretary for Taiwan and China Affairs at the State Department</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Zhong You-zhen, Washington, July 30) The U.S. State Department confirmed today that diplomat Joshua Young will serve as the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Taiwan Coordination Office. It is understood that Young is a "hawk" when it comes to China. He used to be the executive director of the "Project 2049 Institute," a research group. When Randall Schriver, a former official who supports Taiwan, was Assistant Secretary of Defense during Trump's first term, Young worked for him.</p>
            <p>"Nikkei Asia" first reported this new appointment. The U.S. State Department confirmed to the Central News Agency this morning that Joshua Young has officially become the Deputy Assistant Secretary for the China Coordination Office (also known as China House) and the Taiwan Coordination Office, both part of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs (EAP).</p>
            <p>"Nikkei Asia" reported earlier that the "China House" will become more important. It will work faster to carry out Trump's orders and work closely under Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio. It will play a key role in getting ready for Trump's visit to China.</p>
            <p>The "China House" is still part of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. However, an official from the State Department told "Nikkei Asia" that "it is clear the State Department is trying to give more importance to China issues." "Young will be in charge of organizing China policy across the entire State Department."</p>
            <p>Young is the fourth coordinator since the "China House" was started in 2022. He also holds the position of Deputy Assistant Secretary for China and Taiwan affairs. Before him, Rick Waters, Mark Lambert, and Kevin Kim held these roles.</p>
            <p>State Department officials said that Young has strong support from the leadership on the 7th floor, where Rubio's and Allison Hooker's (Under Secretary for Political Affairs) offices are located. Young will work closely with Hooker.</p>
            <p>Young's appointment is expected to make Kevin Kim's job easier. Kevin Kim is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Taiwan affairs, and his responsibilities are very large.</p>
            <p>A State Department official who knows Kevin Kim's schedule said that Kevin Kim has so much to do that he has meetings every 15 minutes, from early morning until late at night.</p>
            <p>Because Michael George DeSombre's appointment as the new Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs still needs approval from the Senate, the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs has been led by senior diplomat Sean O'Neill.</p>
            <p>After O'Neill was nominated to be the ambassador to Thailand, Kevin Kim was promoted. He also became responsible for Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Pacific Island affairs, which made his workload even heavier.</p>
            <p>Before Young took over the "China House" earlier this month, he was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Security Policy. In that role, he oversaw efforts to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
            <p>He also served as the executive director of the "Project 2049 Institute," a think tank in Washington D.C. The "Project 2049 Institute" recently changed its name to the Indo-Pacific Security Institute (IIPS), and its chairman is Randall Schriver.</p>
            <p>When Young worked for Schriver at the Department of Defense, he was responsible for China and for strategies with U.S. allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
            <p>Schriver told "Nikkei Asia" that Young is good at working with different departments. When he worked at the "Project 2049 Institute," he "looked at the competition between the U.S. and China from an economic and trade point of view. He thought about how to use more tools and how to make trade policies with China better to improve competition."</p>
            <p>One of the most important jobs for the "China House" this year will be preparing for Trump's trip to China. Bonnie Glaser, who directs the Indo-Pacific Program at The German Marshall Fund, a think tank in Washington, said that National Security Advisor Marco Rubio will lead the preparations for this visit.</p>
            <p>"But I also expect people like Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary) to play an important role, because he continues to lead trade talks. Trump's main goals, including this summit (between the U.S. and China), are about trade."</p>
            <p>Glaser pointed out that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will also be important in the preparations. He has already been talking to big company CEOs to see if they are interested in going with Trump to China.</p>
            <p>She said that Trump makes the final decisions on many issues. "He is a manager who likes to be involved in everything. When he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he will definitely not just follow a script." (Editor: Zhang Zhixuan) 1140731</p>

            <h1>Intel Cancels Chip Factory Investment in Poland, Adds it to Main Project in Magdeburg, Germany</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Peng Wei-yu, Warsaw, July 30) American chip company Intel has announced that it will not build the new chip packaging and testing factory it planned for Lower Silesia in Poland. Instead, the company confirmed it will now focus its main efforts on its big factory in Magdeburg, Germany.</p>
            <p>According to the Polish News Agency (PAP), Intel first announced the plan in 2023. It was going to invest 4.5 billion US dollars (about 146.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars) and build the factory near Wroclaw in the MiÄ™kinia area of Lower Silesia. This would have created about 2,000 jobs.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Intel said that they will now put their money and effort into building the main chip-making factory in Magdeburg. This place is seen as very important for Europe's plan to make its own chips. After getting money from the German government and help from the EU Chips Act, Intel decided to invest more there. Some of the work that was planned for Poland will now be done in Germany.</p>
            <p>The Intel spokesperson emphasized: "Our main goal right now is to make sure the big factory in Magdeburg is successful. We will continue to make our chip production and packaging stronger in Germany and Ireland. We will also support our other locations in Israel, Malaysia, and the United States."</p>
            <p>Intel also thanked the Polish government and local groups for working with them. The company said in a statement: "Even though we decided not to invest in Poland, we are very thankful for the support and help from the Polish government and local leaders for this project." For now, there are no plans for other investments in Poland.</p>
            <p>The original plan for Poland was part of the European Union's effort to make its own chips and have a safer supply chain. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and the government of Lower Silesia had high hopes for this investment. They had already bought the land and done some early preparations in the area.

            <h1>Trump Signs Order to Put a 50% Tax on Goods from Brazil</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Tang Yaling, Sao Paulo, July 30) U.S. President Donald Trump today signed an official order. It says that the U.S. will now put a 50% tax on products coming from Brazil. However, some products like oil, orange juice, and airplanes are on a special list and will not have this extra tax.</p>
            <p>On April 2, Trump had already announced a 10% tax on Brazilian products. Earlier today, Trump signed another order to add an extra 40% tax on Brazilian imported goods, on top of the first 10%. This makes the total tax 50%.</p>
            <p>The new order also says that about 700 types of products will not be affected by the extra 40% tax. These include orange juice, airplanes, iron ore, fuel products, and fertilizers.</p>
            <p>Meat, fruits, and coffee are not on the special list of products that don't get taxed. But on July 29, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that Trump's government is thinking about having no tax at all on foods that the U.S. does not produce, such as coffee, mangoes, pineapples, and cocoa.</p>
            <p>The new taxes will start on August 6. Before this, it was thought that the new taxes would begin on August 1.</p>
            <p>The White House said in an official statement that the new taxes are meant to "deal with the Brazilian government's recent rules, actions, and behaviors. These things are a special danger to the security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States."</p>
            <p>The White House statement also said, "The Brazilian government has been politically unfair to former President Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters. They have been persecuting, scaring, bothering, censoring, and bringing charges against them. This is a serious violation of human rights and hurts the rule of law in Brazil."</p>
            <p>Brazil's former President Bolsonaro is accused of planning a coup after he lost the 2022 election to the current president, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro says these accusations are not true. (Editor: Chen Hui-ping) 1140731</p>
