Japan's transport office has announced new rules for carrying power banks on planes. Starting July 8th, if you fly with Japanese airlines such as ANA or JAL, you must keep your power bank with you. You cannot put it in the overhead storage bin.

This rule change is to make flying safer. There have been cases where power banks started to smoke or catch fire on planes. Passengers must also check their power bank if they charge devices during the flight.

Rules already say you cannot put power banks in checked luggage. There are also limits on how many power banks you can carry and their size. For example, you can carry a maximum of two power banks if they are between 100Wh and 160Wh.

**OpenAI Not Using Google's AI Chips Yet**

OpenAI, the company that made the chatbot ChatGPT, has said they are not planning to use Google's special AI chips called TPUs. This is against some news reports that said they would.

OpenAI currently uses chips from other companies like Nvidia and AMD to power its products. A spokesperson for OpenAI stated that they are doing some early tests with Google's chips, but they don't plan to use them widely.

Making big changes to hardware takes a lot of time and new systems. OpenAI is also making its own chips and expects them to be ready this year.
