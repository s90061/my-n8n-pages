            <h1>From Airline Worker to Cultural Bridge Builder: He Bing-hsiu Spreads the Joy of Music</h1>
            <p>A good piece of work needs everyone to work together. Besides the performers in the spotlight, the hard work of people behind the scenes is also very important and should be recognized. The Central News Agency presents a special column called "Behind-the-Scenes Heroes," featuring stories of these heroes every Wednesday.</p>
            <p>From working in aviation to building cultural connections, He Bing-hsiu, the general manager of EVA Air's Austrian branch, has spent six years helping the Vienna Boys' Choir and Taiwan connect deeply. He Bing-hsiu said that "the beauty of music itself" drives everything he does.</p>
            <p>The Vienna Boys' Choir, which is over 500 years old, had its first member from Taiwan in 2009. That member was He Guan-wei, He Bing-hsiu's son, who was 10 years old at the time. When He Guan-wei was six, he passed an interview and started studying at the elementary school section of the Vienna Boys' Choir's own school. After four years of music training, he went on to the middle school section of the same school. He was then chosen for the choir and officially became a member of the Schubert Choir.</p>
            <p>He Bing-hsiu told the Central News Agency that this was a "tough time for a parent." He felt proud at the time and also thought his son could become more independent by living at a boarding school and touring the world. He Bing-hsiu remembered that his son's first stop was Mexico, far away on the other side of the world. He had to face a month-long trip alone to an unfamiliar place. "He didn't adjust well and even made up a story to his teacher, saying his grandmother was seriously ill and he needed to go back to Vienna to see her one last time."</p>
            <p>At that time, He Bing-hsiu took time off work and rushed to Mexico to check on the situation. "The choir has strict rules. I could only stay at the same hotel as them at each stop and appear like a member of the audience at their performance venues." During that time, He Bing-hsiu became an "invisible volunteer." He helped film parts of the tour and made them into DVDs for other parents who could not join. This created a valuable record of his son's growth and slowly built trust between him and the Vienna Boys' Choir.</p>
            <p>He Bing-hsiu recalled, "When I sat in the audience and listened to my son perform with the choir, sometimes in a church, sometimes at a music festival, hearing them sing masses and folk songs from different countries, showing what they learned about various languages and cultures, I smiled from inside. I felt less tired and the music brought me joy."</p>
            <p>He Guan-wei is now grown up and works in data analysis research, but he still loves music. As a father, He Bing-hsiu believes that children learn about the world and understand the beauty of different languages and cultures through singing. "This is not for competitions or performances, but to plant a seed of music and art." Starting in 2019, He Bing-hsiu began helping various choirs in Taiwan to go to Vienna and attend a one-week intensive workshop with the Vienna Boys' Choir.</p>
            <p>He Bing-hsiu said he hopes that Taiwanese children will have the chance to learn with a world-class youth music group and experience real Austrian choir training and stage performances. He wants Taiwanese children to see a different world. "Actually, there were many difficulties during this process. Taiwanese parents found it hard to let their children go so far away. But I think it's okay. The children who came will remember it for a lifetime."</p>
            <p>As he gets closer to retirement, He Bing-hsiu said that his sense of achievement as an airline worker comes from building bridges to the world. "I really hope that all these exchanges are full of the joy of music. I am also happy to keep sharing my experience of working deeply in Vienna."</p>
            <p>He Bing-hsiu said with deep feeling: "Letting children see a bigger world when they are young will help them return to Taiwanese society with different confidence and a wider perspective in the future."</p>

            <h1>France Plans to Recognize Palestine; Netanyahu Accuses Macron of Making Anti-Jewish Feelings Worse</h1>
            <p>Paris, August 19 (Central News Agency) â€“ France plans to recognize the state of Palestine in September. This has caused a disagreement with Israel. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused French President Emmanuel Macron of making "anti-Jewish feelings" worse. This has made the disagreement between the two countries a serious problem.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the French President's office, the Elysee Palace, said Netanyahu's accusations were "bad" and "not true." They added, "What is needed now is a serious and responsible attitude, not confusion and changing facts."</p>
            <p>Netanyahu made these accusations in a letter to Macron. AFP saw the letter, in which Netanyahu said that since Macron announced in July that France would recognize the state of Palestine in September, anti-Jewish feelings in France have "increased greatly."</p>
            <p>In the letter, Netanyahu told Macron, "Your call to recognize the state of Palestine is like adding fuel to the fire of anti-Jewish feelings. This is not diplomacy; it is trying to please. It rewards the terrorist actions of Hamas (a Palestinian armed group), makes Hamas more unwilling to release hostages, makes those who threaten French Jews bolder, and increases anti-Jewish hatred in your country's streets."</p>
            <p>More and more countries have recognized the state of Palestine since the war between Israel and Hamas started in the Gaza Strip almost two years ago. France will soon be one of them.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, at least 145 of the 193 member countries of the United Nations, including France, recognize or plan to recognize the state of Palestine.</p>
            <p>In response to Netanyahu's accusations about anti-Jewish feelings, the Elysee Palace said that France "has always and will always protect its Jewish citizens." The President's office also said it would "never ignore" the accusations in Netanyahu's letter.</p>
            <p>France has the largest Jewish community in Europe. According to the French Ministry of Interior, the number of reported anti-Jewish incidents in France greatly increased from 436 in 2022 to 1676 in 2023, but it went down to 1570 in 2024.</p>

            <h1>TSMC's ADR Drops 3.61%; Experts See Short-Term Ups and Downs in Taiwan Stock Market</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 20 (Central News Agency) â€“ The US Nasdaq and Philadelphia Semiconductor indexes went down. Nvidia's stock fell by 3.5%, and TSMC's American Depository Receipts (ADR) dropped by 3.61%. Yesterday, the Taiwan stock market reached a new high during the day but closed lower. Experts believe that the Taiwan stock market's technical signs show it is correcting after rising too much, but the overall upward trend is not broken. They expect the market to move up and down in the short term.</p>
            <p>After Nvidia and AMD agreed to give 15% of their profits from selling chips to China to the government, US Commerce Secretary Lutnick confirmed today that the US is talking with Intel about buying 10% of its shares. He also repeated his strong belief, which he often said before joining the government, that the US needs to make its own chips and "cannot rely on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Nvidia and other popular stocks that have benefited from the current strong interest in artificial intelligence (AI) took a short break from their increases. Today, most of the four main Wall Street stock indexes closed lower, with the Nasdaq dropping more than 300 points.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose slightly by 10.45 points or 0.02%, closing at 44922.27 points. The S&P 500 index fell by 37.78 points or 0.59%, closing at 6411.37 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped sharply by 314.82 points or 1.46%, closing at 21314.95 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell by 104.81 points or 1.81%, closing at 5671.51 points.</p>
            <p>On August 19, the Taiwan stock market reached a new record high of 24551.42 points during the trading day. As printed circuit board (PCB) stocks, which had been very strong recently, went down, the index changed from positive to negative. It ended the day down by 129.02 points, closing at 24353.5 points, which is below the 5-day moving average of 24355 points.</p>
            <p>On August 19, the three major institutional investors sold 18.617 billion New Taiwan dollars worth of Taiwan stocks. Among them, proprietary traders sold 6.079 billion New Taiwan dollars, investment trusts sold 1.53 billion New Taiwan dollars, and foreign and mainland Chinese investors sold 11.008 billion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Mu Hsien-chueh, a spokesperson for Kinsus, a major IC substrate company, said at a PCB industry performance conference on August 19 that their sales will grow quarter by quarter in the second half of the year. He expects overall sales in 2026 to be better than this year, but he also said they need to watch exchange rate changes. He predicts that the ABF substrate market will grow in the next three years, mainly because of high-end servers and artificial intelligence (AI) chips. He expects that by 2026, there will be a good balance between the supply and demand of high-layer ABF substrates.</p>
            <p>Getac Holdings, a company that makes strong industrial computers, held a meeting with investors on August 19. Chairman Hwang Ming-han said that their component products are doing better than expected. They have increased their prediction for the growth of component sales for the full year 2025 from 8% to 12% to 12% to 20%.</p>
            <p>Lingtong, a micro-controller (MCU) company under the Sunplus Group, said at an investor meeting that its business in the second quarter was not as good as expected for a busy season. The company's outlook for the second half of the year remains careful. Sunplus Innovation, a company that makes image signal processing chips, said that most of their customer orders are urgent ones. They expect sales in the second half of the year to be similar to the same period last year.</p>
