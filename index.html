            <h1>PGA St. Jude Championship: Yu Chun-an Tied for 30th, Still Fighting to Continue</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's only player, Yu Chun-an, played in the third round of the PGA FedExCup Playoffs St. Jude Championship today. He got a score of 69, with three birdies and two bogeys. His total score after three days is 207, which is three strokes under the expected score. He is currently tied for 30th place. He still has a chance to qualify for the next part of the tournament.</p>
            <p>The official PGA website says that after three rounds, Yu Chun-an is expected to be 62nd in the FedExCup points. This is still some distance from being able to play in the second playoff event.</p>
            <p>The rules for the FedExCup Playoffs say that only the top 70 players in FedExCup points can play in the first event, the St. Jude Championship. For the second event, the BMW Championship, only the top 50 players can play.</p>
            <p>Yu Chun-an started from the first hole today. On the second hole, his second shot went into the sand trap next to the green, and he got a bogey. Luckily, on the third hole, he hit an accurate shot and made a birdie from less than three feet, which helped him get back on track.</p>
            <p>But on the fourth hole, which is a par-3 hole, Yu Chun-an hit the ball too far. He had to chip the ball back from next to the green. He then missed a three-foot putt to make par and got another bogey.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Yu Chun-an played a little better after the turn. He got birdies on the 11th and 12th holes. After that, he finished all the holes at the expected score.</p>
            <p>Today, Yu Chun-an's first shot landed on the fairway 78.5% of the time. This was the third best among all players. His average first shot distance was 307 yards. He also reached the green in the expected number of shots 66.67% of the time, which was the seventh best.</p>
            <p>The only problem was his putting. In the third round, he took an average of 1.83 putts on the green. This put him at 59th among all 69 players.</p>
            <p>Yu Chun-an has one more day to play. To get into the second FedExCup playoff event, he needs to finish at least in the top 15, based on the points calculation.</p>

            <h1>Greek Prime Minister: Humanitarian Aid Dropped by Air to Gaza</h1>
            <p>Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that Greece and countries from the European Union dropped food aid by air into the Gaza area today.</p>
            <p>Mitsotakis wrote on Facebook: "This morning, two planes from the Greek Air Force dropped 8.5 tons of basic food into the Gaza area."</p>
            <p>"This action was planned together with countries from the European Union and the Middle East. Its goal is to help meet the basic needs of the people in the area that has been affected."</p>
            <p>Philippe Lazzarini, who is in charge of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), warned that dropping aid by air alone cannot stop the increasing hunger.</p>
            <p>The United Nations believes that Gaza needs at least 600 trucks of aid every day to meet the basic needs of its people.</p>
