A new study shows that families in the UK are spending less money on things they don't really need. This is because of rising costs, which are making daily life more expensive. Many households are finding it harder to manage their money.

The research found that people are cutting back on luxury items like alcohol and new clothes. Instead, they are focusing their spending on essential items, such as food and energy bills. This means less money is available for treats or entertainment.

Supermarkets have noticed that shoppers are choosing cheaper brands more often. Some people are also buying fewer items overall. Experts say that even though the rate at which prices are increasing has slowed down a bit, many families are still struggling to afford everything they need. Businesses are also seeing the effect of people having less money to spend.

**Google Asks Some Staff to Share Desks**

Google has told some of its employees they will need to share desks when they come to the office. This is part of new changes to how the company uses its office space. It mainly affects employees who work in a "hybrid" way, meaning they spend some days at home and some in the office.

The company explains that the aim is to use office space more effectively. Employees will use a booking system to reserve a desk for the days they are in. This new system has already started in some Google offices, including those in California, New York, and Dublin.

Google began asking employees to come into the office at least three days a week in 2023. This rule was put in place to help teams work better together and improve how much work they get done. The new desk-sharing plan is another step in how Google is changing its approach to office work.

**Popular European City Facing Tourist Crowds**

A very popular city in Europe, Dubrovnik in Croatia, is facing problems because too many tourists are visiting. This historic city, famous for its beautiful old town and walls, is finding it hard to manage the large number of visitors, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic ended.

Many local people feel that the huge crowds are making their daily lives difficult and changing the city's special atmosphere. They worry that the city's unique charm is becoming less special because of the constant flow of visitors.

To deal with this, the city has started some plans. They are trying to limit the number of cruise ship passengers who arrive each day. They are also working to encourage tourists to visit other, less crowded parts of the region instead of just the main attractions. The aim is to find a balance where tourism benefits the city without destroying its unique character or making life impossible for its residents. Many other popular European cities are also looking for similar solutions to handle growing numbers of visitors.
