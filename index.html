Chuang Ching-cheng, who was the CEO of the Executive Yuan's Central Taiwan Joint Services Center, announced today that he will resign. He made this decision because the budget for his office was greatly cut by opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan. He will now work as a volunteer to support efforts to remove certain officials from their positions. The Executive Yuan said that Premier Cho Jung-tai thanked Mr. Chuang for his work and accepted his resignation, respecting his personal career choices.

Mr. Chuang explained that his office's budget, which was about NT$7 million, was reduced to only about NT$70,000 for operations. This cut made it impossible to pay for basic things like electricity, water, fuel, office supplies, cleaning, and staff salaries. Because of this, he decided to resign and join the public on the streets to support the recall campaigns.

The Executive Yuan's spokesperson, Li Hui-chih, stated that Mr. Chuang submitted his resignation to Premier Cho Jung-tai on July 5th. Premier Cho thanked him for his efforts over the past year to combine government resources and help develop different areas. However, to respect Mr. Chuang's plans for his future career, his resignation has been accepted.

**Dalai Lama Celebrates 90th Birthday, Wears "Team Taiwan" Hat, Watches SanÂ§™Â≠ê Performance**

The Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet, celebrated his 90th birthday on July 6th in Dharamsala, a mountain town in northern India. Taiwanese people who came to wish him a happy birthday gave him a hat and clothes that said "Team Taiwan." The Dalai Lama was happy and immediately put on the hat. He also watched a performance by the SanÂ§™Â≠ê (Third Prince), who carried the national flag of Taiwan. The Dalai Lama smiled and waved to them.

A video shared on the Dalai Lama's social media showed members of a Taiwanese religious group singing for him at his birthday event. One person gave him the "Team Taiwan" baseball cap and jersey. The Dalai Lama accepted them, put on the hat, and gently touched the giver's face to give a blessing.

The Dalai Lama also stopped for a moment to watch the electric SanÂ§™Â≠ê perform. The SanÂ§™Â≠ê carried the Taiwanese flag and special peach-shaped lanterns. He waved to them as they performed.

The Dalai Lama's birthday was on July 6th. High-ranking Tibetan religious leaders met in Dharamsala on July 2nd. The Dalai Lama spoke to them via video, saying that the system of reincarnation will continue. He clearly stated that the Gaden Phodrang Foundation will be the only group allowed to find the next reincarnation. This news made many Tibetans very happy, but it made the Chinese government, who wants to control this process, quite unhappy.

**Hsu Han-chen, Preserver of Traditional Timber Construction, Passes Away; Ministry of Culture Will Request Commendation**

Hsu Han-chen, who was recognized for preserving the important cultural skill of "Damuzao" (traditional timber construction), passed away on July 5th at the age of 96. The Ministry of Culture will ask the President to officially praise his contributions.

The Ministry of Culture released a statement today. Minister of Culture Lee Yuan said that Mr. Hsu spent a long time working on and passing on traditional timber construction skills, especially for temple wooden structures. He was a very skilled craftsman and a leading master of timber construction in his time. The Ministry of Culture will fully help his family with the funeral arrangements.

Mr. Hsu Han-chen was born in 1929 and was known as "Han-chen Si" in the field. He learned his skills from his father, Hsu Tung-lu, and started working at 17. He was the only one in his family who learned all the necessary skills for a master craftsman in traditional Han-style timber construction. These skills included designing, drawing, planning, marking, and managing construction sites. He was one of the few master craftsmen in Taiwan who specialized in Han-style temple buildings.

Starting in 1950, Mr. Hsu worked on building temples. He helped build or fix about 70 temples. He was very good at combining modern reinforced concrete building methods with traditional timber construction techniques.

From 2011, Mr. Hsu worked hard to teach and promote traditional timber construction skills. He held many training courses with the help of the Ministry of Culture's Bureau of Cultural Heritage and National Cheng Kung University's Architecture Department. These courses taught different techniques for timber frames. In 2014, the Ministry of Culture recognized Mr. Hsu Han-chen as an important preserver of "Damuzao" techniques. He also received the Tainan City Government Outstanding Citizen Award in 2015 and the 5th National Cultural Heritage Preservation Award in 2020.
