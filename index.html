            <h1>Training to Prevent Misconduct in Special Education: Emphasizing 24-Hour Reporting and Privacy</h1>
            <p>Recently, issues of bad behavior and bullying have gained public attention. The Ministry of Education held a training session for new administrators at special education schools. They repeated that if they know about such events, they must report them to the school safety system within 24 hours. They also need to take steps to protect the people involved and keep their information private.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education released a statement today. They held a training on August 20 called "Reporting Procedures for Misconduct Cases and Campus Gender Safety Incidents." New principals, student support directors, team leaders, and human resources directors from special education schools attended. Experts shared their experiences to help the staff understand the rules and how to handle these situations.</p>
            <p>Liu Hsiu-feng, an advisor to the National and Pre-school Education Administration's Campus Gender Incident Prevention Center, spoke at the event. She stressed that for cases of sexual assault, harassment, or bullying, schools must report them to the "Campus Safety Reporting System" within 24 hours of finding out. They also need to immediately protect the people involved, keep their information private, and start an investigation and provide help.</p>
            <p>Recently, bad behavior and gender-related incidents on school campuses have gotten a lot of public attention. The Ministry of Education repeated that schools must follow the rules in the "Basic Education Act," "Student Counseling Act," and "Gender Equality Education Act." This is to keep students healthy in mind and body and to protect their self-respect.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that when handling school incidents, the main ideas are "quick response, protecting the people involved, keeping everything secret, and following up later." They will continue to offer special training to help school teams understand the reporting process exactly.</p>

            <h1>Plan to Extend Vehicle Tax Cut Until 2030: Up to NT$100,000 Off for Replacing Old Cars</h1>
            <p>Today, the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan discussed a plan to change Article 12-5 of the Commodity Tax Act. This change is about reducing the commodity tax for replacing old cars and motorcycles with new ones. Lawmakers from different political parties agreed to extend the tax reduction until the end of December 2030. Also, new cars and motorcycles bought for the first time will also get a tax cut. If you replace an old car with a new one, you could save up to NT$100,000. This new rule is expected to become law next week.</p>
            <p>Right now, there's a special offer to reduce commodity tax when you replace an old car or motorcycle with a new one. This offer will end on January 7 next year, and people want to know if it will continue. Car companies in Taiwan recently asked to extend the NT$50,000 commodity tax discount for replacing old cars. They also asked for the discount to apply to people buying a new car for the first time.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee held talks about changing Article 12-5 of the Commodity Tax Act, which is about reducing commodity tax for replacing old cars and motorcycles. The Minister of Finance, Chuang Tsui-yun, and the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, Ho Chin-tsang, were there.</p>
            <p>To keep encouraging people to get rid of old cars or export used ones and buy new ones, which helps industries and reduces carbon, lawmakers from all parties agreed to extend the tax discount. The new end date will be December 31, 2030.</p>
            <p>This law change also includes ideas from the industry. It means you can get a tax cut even if you buy a new car without replacing an old one. To help with the country's goal of saving energy and reducing carbon, lawmakers agreed that if you buy a new small car (under 2000cc) and register it before the end of 2030, you will get a NT$50,000 tax cut.</p>
            <p>This means if you replace an old car and buy a new car under 2000cc, you can get a total tax cut of NT$100,000 (NT$50,000 for replacing and NT$50,000 for the new car).</p>
            <p>Also, if you buy a new motorcycle (under 150cc) and register it before the end of 2030, you will get a NT$2,000 tax cut. If you replace an old motorcycle and buy a new one under 150cc, you can get a total tax cut of NT$6,000 (NT$4,000 for replacing and NT$2,000 for the new motorcycle).</p>
            <p>Minister Chuang Tsui-yun said that extending the tax reduction and offering some tax cuts for new cars and motorcycles helps meet public demand. It also encourages people to buy new cars that use less energy. She respects the Legislative Yuan's decision.</p>
            <p>Deputy Minister Ho Chin-tsang pointed out that including new cars and motorcycles in the tax reduction will help people who are buying a car for the first time. Many car companies also want the law to be changed and passed quickly.</p>
            <p>Lai Shih-pao, the head of the meeting and a KMT convener, said that after today's talks between the parties, the bill can go directly to the Legislative Yuan for its second and third readings. It is expected to pass next week and become law after the president announces it.</p>

            <h1>New York Times: Xi Jinping's Purge Continues Stalin and Mao's Tradition</h1>
            <p>Beijing, August 21 (CNA) China's leader, Xi Jinping, is still removing people from power within the Communist Party. The New York Times reported that Xi Jinping's actions are like those of Stalin and Mao Zedong. He uses these purges to control important people and make his own power stronger.</p>
            <p>A New York Times Chinese website report on August 21 titled "Why Did Xi Jinping Start a Big Purge? Mao Zedong and Stalin Might Provide Answers" says that Chinese politics is still unclear and secretive. Today, people still don't know why former President Hu Jintao was led away from the Communist Party's 20th Congress in 2022. They also don't know what happened when former Premier Li Keqiang died in 2023. In 1971, Lin Biao, who Mao Zedong chose to take over, died in a plane crash while trying to leave China, and people still don't know the full truth.</p>
            <p>The report mentions that this situation has led to a small group of online commentators called "Zhongnanhai Bed Listeners." These Chinese internet users try to guess China's political direction from rumors and small clues. Recently, these "Zhongnanhai Bed Listeners" have been very busy because Xi Jinping has removed many military and government officials he had promoted himself this year.</p>
            <p>The "Bed Listeners" have made up stories online about when Xi Jinping would leave power and about intense meetings between Xi Jinping's group and older party members. However, even former U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Flynn said on the X platform, "Clearly, there is a transfer of power happening in China. Those who follow China need to pay close attention to key members of the Chinese Communist Party, especially the loss of confidence among public and national security officials. Changes in China's leadership have huge effects." Some people in the U.S. believe that Xi Jinping's power structure is breaking.</p>
            <p>The report says that trusted observers don't want to seem like they believe rumors, but asking "questions" is fair and has happened before in history.</p>
            <p>The report believes that Xi Jinping's purges continue the traditions of Stalin and Mao Zedong. They are used to control important people and make his own power stronger.</p>
            <p>Stalin's big purges in the 1930s physically removed 70% of the Soviet Communist Party's Central Committee members. More than half of the 1,966 delegates from the 1934 Soviet Communist Party Congress were also killed, along with many military leaders.</p>
            <p>Stephen Kotkin, a senior researcher at the Hoover Institution, said, "This is one of the most surprising things about communism: it will kill its own loyal followers." He added, "Those who are always loyal can still be targets because of the government's paranoia and sudden strong beliefs."</p>
            <p>Wu Guoguang, a senior researcher at Stanford University's Center for Chinese Economy and Institutions, sees a repeated pattern in Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>This repeated pattern is "failed governance and more power becoming centralized, followed by purges."</p>
            <p>Stalin's big purges happened after a terrible famine, which his own policies caused. Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution happened after a big famine in China, which was also a result of Mao Zedong's terrible decisions. Xi Jinping's current actions are happening after the failed "zero-COVID" policy, bad economic choices, and difficult foreign policies.</p>
            <p>Wu Guoguang explained that there is a spiraling and strengthening relationship between highly centralized power and bad governance. The key link between failed governance and a dictator getting more power is "purges." In other words, the worse the governance, the harsher the purges; the harsher the purges, the tighter the control. Wu Guoguang calls this cycle "Stalin's logic."</p>
            <p>The report says that no one expects Xi Jinping's rule to end now. But guesses about his control of power might show that there is growing tension between him and the party's important members.</p>
            <p>Cai Xia, a retired professor from the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, said that important members of the CCP let Xi Jinping gain power through fighting corruption, changing the constitution to remove term limits, and hurting private businesses. She said they stayed quiet because Xi Jinping did not take away their special rights.</p>
            <p>But Xi Jinping's current purges, along with China's economic problems, are now affecting them more directly. Cai Xia said, "If this continues, important party members might start to think that not only Xi Jinping will fall, but the CCP itself will."</p>
            <p>Kotkin pointed out, "One of the biggest weaknesses of this government is when its important members start to have doubts." If his health allows, Xi Jinping might rule for another 10 or 20 years, but only if he can keep the loyalty of the CCP leadership.</p>
            <p>The report says it is still not clear how effective Xi Jinping's purges are, and the end of this campaign is not yet in sight.</p>
