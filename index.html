            <h1>Young people addicted to social media, Korea bans mobile phones for all students in class</h1>
            <p>South Korea's parliament passed a new law today. This law stops all students in the country from using mobile phones or other digital devices during school hours. This shows that more and more people are worried about how much young people use social media.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters and BBC reports, both sides of the Korean government worked together to create this law. They want to control smartphone addiction. Many studies now show that using phones too much can be harmful. The new law will start next year in March, when the new school year begins.</p>
            <p>Members of parliament, parents, and teachers in South Korea say that students using phones too much affects their schoolwork. The time they should spend learning is taken up by their phones.</p>
            <p>A survey by the Korean Ministry of Education last year found that about 37% of middle and high school students said social media affected their daily lives. Also, 22% of these students felt worried when they could not access their social media accounts.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-hoon, a member of the opposition People Power Party and one of the people who suggested the law, said in parliament: "Our young people are now very addicted to social media. Our children's eyes are red every morning because they are scrolling on Instagram until 2 or 3 AM."</p>
            <p>South Korea is now one of the newest countries to limit how young people use phones and social media. Some countries, like Finland and France, have similar bans, but only for younger students. Other countries, like Italy, the Netherlands, and China, have bans for all school levels.</p>
            <p>Australia was one of the first countries to ban social media for teenagers, and they recently made their ban bigger. A study from the Netherlands in July showed that after schools there banned phones, students could focus better.</p>

            <h1>Trump calls for prosecution of financial tycoon Soros, claims he orchestrated violent protests across US</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump said today that rich businessman George Soros and his son should go to court. Trump said Soros's family was behind "violent protests" all over the US. The Soros family is often a target for right-wing groups. Trump did not give any facts to support his claims.</p>
            <p>News agency AFP reported that Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social": "Soros and his very left-wing son should be charged under the RICO law for helping violent protests and other bad things." RICO stands for the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>
            <p>In June, protests happened in Los Angeles, California, because more immigrants were being caught. During this time, old conspiracy theories about the Soros family became popular again.</p>
            <p>George Soros, who is 95 years old and from Hungary, has long given money to support liberal ideas and the Democratic Party in the US. Because of this, many extreme right-wing people in Europe and the US see him as a bad person. Soros is Jewish, and many attacks against him over the years have been called anti-Semitic (against Jewish people).</p>
            <p>Soros has also been wrongly accused of causing more immigration problems in Europe and at the US southern border. He has also been blamed for starting large protests. This includes the anti-police protests in the US in 2020, after a Black man named George Floyd died because a police officer knelt on his neck.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote in his post: "Soros and his crazy friends have done a lot of harm to our country! This also includes his wild friends on the West Coast of America."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "We will not let these crazy people keep tearing America apart. Be careful, we are watching you!"</p>
            <p>The "Open Society Foundations," a charity started by Soros, strongly disagreed with what Trump said. In a statement to AFP, they wrote: "The Open Society Foundations does not support or give money to violent protests." In 2023, Soros announced that his son, Alexander Soros, would take control of the organization.</p>
