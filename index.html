            <h1>Washington Post: Iran Keeps Building Secret Underground Nuclear Site After US-Israel Bombing</h1>
            <p>The Washington Post checked satellite photos and expert reports. It seems that Iran has been building an underground base faster in the past few months. This happened after the United States and Israel damaged Iran's main nuclear site in June this year. This shows that Iran might still be working on its nuclear weapons plans.</p>
            <p>Satellite pictures show that Iran is still building a deeper military base. It is at a place called "Pickaxe Mountain." This place is south of the Natanz nuclear site, which the US and Israel bombed on June 22.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post said that since 2020, Iran has been digging tunnels. These tunnels are under the Zagros mountains. This is about 1.6 kilometers south of the Natanz nuclear site.</p>
            <p>We do not know the real reason for the Pickaxe Mountain site. No international inspectors have ever visited it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who is the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that Iran's government did not answer his questions about the site earlier this year.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that the rooms under Pickaxe Mountain might be very deep, about 79 to 100 meters. This is deeper than the Fordow nuclear site. The US military bombed Fordow with special bombs in June. In 2020, Iran said it would build a factory at Pickaxe Mountain to make centrifuges. This factory would replace one that was destroyed earlier that year. Centrifuges are fast-spinning machines used to make uranium stronger.</p>
            <p>An expert from Maxar Technologies said that the tunnels at Pickaxe Mountain started in December of the same year. The size and depth of the site made experts wonder if it has another use. It could be a new secret place to make uranium stronger, or a safe place for Iran to keep uranium that can be used for weapons.</p>
            <p>But experts also said that building work, both inside and outside the mountain, does not mean Iran is quickly restarting its nuclear weapons program and making bombs faster.</p>
            <p>Before the attacks in June, Iran had about 900 pounds of uranium that was 60% pure. This is close to the 90% purity needed for weapons. After the attacks, no one knew where Iran's stored uranium was. This made people worried that Iran might secretly collect the important materials for nuclear weapons over time.</p>
            <p>The new building work at Pickaxe Mountain seems to be partly to make the site stronger against future attacks. The Pickaxe Mountain place was not hit when the US and Israel attacked Iran's nuclear sites in June.</p>
            <p>Jeffrey Lewis, an expert, said: "After being attacked, Iran might decide to make this place bigger. They might move more activities underground."</p>
            <p>Experts who checked the satellite pictures for The Washington Post found three main changes at Pickaxe Mountain since the US bombing on June 22. These changes show that work is continuing: first, better protection around the outside; second, making one tunnel entrance stronger; and third, more dirt dug out, which shows that underground work is still happening.</p>
            <p>Sarah Burkhard, an expert, said that making the tunnel entrance stronger and covering it helps to make it harder to destroy by bombs.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Gaza Agreement Is Near, Could End Almost Two-Year War</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump said he believes an agreement to stop the war in the Gaza Strip will happen soon. He said this after he recently spoke with Israel and Arab countries.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Trump told news reporters at the White House, "I think we have an agreement."</p>
            <p>He also added, "It looks like we have an agreement for Gaza. I think this agreement will let the hostages go free. It will also make the war end."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump did not share more information.</p>
            <p>This week, leaders from many countries gathered at the United Nations building in New York. At this meeting, the United States shared a peace plan for the Middle East with 21 points. The plan's goal is to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, in the Gaza Strip. This war has been happening for almost two years.</p>
            <p>Steve Witkoff, who is a special representative from the US, said that this peace plan was given to leaders from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan on September 23.</p>
