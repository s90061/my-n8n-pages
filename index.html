            <h1>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Position Is Weak; Justice Minister Is the First Cabinet Member to Ask Him to Step Down</h1>
            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who also leads the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is facing pressure to leave his position. Aso Taro, a top advisor in the LDP, and now Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki, have both said they want a new party leader. Suzuki is the first minister in Ishiba's cabinet to openly ask for this.</p>
            <p>Usually, the LDP leader is chosen every three years and can serve up to three terms. If there is an early election for the party leader, it means people are trying to force the current leader to step down.</p>
            <p>Since Ishiba became Prime Minister last autumn, the LDP has lost in the general election last year, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election in June this year, and the House of Councillors election in July. The party does not have a majority in both houses of parliament, which is a first in its 70-year history. Because of this, some party members are asking Ishiba to resign.</p>
            <p>The LDP will decide on September 8 whether to hold an early election for the party leader. Members of parliament will give their opinions. To have an early election, more than half of the 295 members of parliament (not including the Speakers) and 47 representatives from local party offices (one for each prefecture) must agree. This means 172 people must agree. On September 8, people must register their names and personally hand in their request at the LDP headquarters.</p>
            <p>Today, Keisuke Suzuki wrote on his blog, "The ruling party lost badly in elections, and we don't have a majority in either house of parliament. Many problems are waiting, and politics cannot stop. To make people trust the LDP again, the party must work together and start fresh."</p>
            <p>Suzuki added, "In this situation, an early election for the party leader, where many party members can vote, is the best choice." He said he would sign the request for an early party leader election and submit it.</p>
            <p>Suzuki is the first cabinet member in Ishiba's government to ask for an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>Taro Aso, a top advisor for the LDP and a former Prime Minister, who also leads the Aso faction (the only group in the LDP now), had already said on September 3 that he wanted an early election for the party leader during a training session for his faction.</p>
            <p>Aso had dinner tonight with Motegi Toshimitsu, a former Secretary-General of the LDP, at a Japanese restaurant in Tokyo. People think they talked about the growing calls to remove Ishiba and who might become the next leader.</p>
            <p>In the LDP, the former Motegi faction, which includes about a dozen experienced members of parliament (elected about 5 times) and younger members, also wants an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>Japan's Mainichi Shimbun newspaper reported that the LDP's Tokyo branch met today at the party's main office. About 150 people were there, including Shinji Inoue, a member of parliament and head of the Tokyo branch, along with members of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly and local assembly members. They all agreed to ask for an early election for the party leader.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Inoue told reporters, "Many people at the meeting pointed out that the results of the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election and the House of Councillors election were very bad, and the leader is responsible. Our Tokyo branch's election results were very bad, unlike other local LDP branches."</p>
            <p>In June this year, the LDP won 21 seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election, including those added later. In the House of Councillors election in July, for the Tokyo area (6 seats to be re-elected and 1 by-election), they only won 1 seat.</p>
            <p>Regarding who is responsible for the bad results in the House of Councillors election, Ishiba apologized at a recent meeting of LDP members from both houses of parliament, but he said he would continue to serve.</p>
            <p>Professor Satoshi Fujii from Kyoto University's graduate school strongly criticized this on a Kansai TV show, saying, "If Ishiba continues as leader, Japan will be ruined."</p>
            <p>Fujii said, "Ishiba wants to continue and improve Japan's economy by dealing with rising prices. But Ishiba has been in power for one year, and the economy has not improved at all. We cannot expect it to get better in the future."</p>
            <p>Fujii also criticized, "Ishiba thinks he has done well in foreign affairs, but US President Donald Trump's order today says that Japan must invest 80 trillion Japanese yen (550 billion US dollars) in the US, and the US will decide the details. This means Japan is at a very high risk of losing a lot of its national interest."</p>
            <p>Fujii further pointed out, "After the elections for both houses of parliament, the LDP became a minority government (without a majority). If the party leader doesn't take responsibility for such a terrible loss, then the idea of responsibility will disappear in Japan, and it will be hard to keep order."</p>

            <h1>Broadcom Gets a Big Order for AI Chips Worth 300 Billion NT Dollars from a New Client; Stock Price Rises 15% at Opening</h1>
            <p>New York (CNA) â€“ The American chip company Broadcom announced that it has signed a 10 billion US dollar (about 300 billion New Taiwan dollars) order for artificial intelligence (AI) chips with a new customer. People guess this customer is OpenAI, the company that made ChatGPT. Broadcom's stock price went up by 15% when the market opened today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Broadcom's new order makes people think the company will do well in the race to develop generative AI. It also strengthens Broadcom's leading position in the market for special chips. This is especially important as big tech companies are looking for different suppliers so they don't have to rely only on Nvidia's expensive and limited AI processors.</p>
            <p>Analysts from well-known Wall Street firms like J.P. Morgan, Bernstein, and Morgan Stanley all said that based on when the contract was made and its size, the new customer placing the order with Broadcom is very likely OpenAI.</p>
            <p>Reuters had already reported last year that OpenAI was working with Broadcom to create its first custom-made chip.</p>
            <p>Broadcom now expects its AI revenue to "significantly improve" in the 2026 financial year.</p>

            <h1>Jam Hsiao's Song Brings Back Memories; Lin Chih-Sheng Cries: "Your Cheers Created Me"</h1>
            <p>Taipei (CNA) â€“ The Wei Chuan Dragons baseball team held a series of games to celebrate Lin Chih-Sheng's retirement. After today's game, singer Jam Hsiao performed, singing "A Dream," a song Lin Chih-Sheng had asked for. Lin Chih-Sheng sang "A-Fei's Little Butterfly" with Hsiao and cried, telling fans, "Your cheers are why Lin Chih-Sheng exists."</p>
            <p>The Dragons started "31CONIC Chih-Sheng's Strike," a series of events for Lin Chih-Sheng, today at the Taipei Dome. After today's game, singer Jam Hsiao performed. Before singing "A Dream," Hsiao specially mentioned that it was a song Lin Chih-Sheng asked for. Lin Chih-Sheng shared that "after working very hard for a while, but not getting any recognition," he cried while listening to this song in his car. He felt that time "was like a dream."</p>
            <p>After Hsiao sang the first eight songs, Lin Chih-Sheng's familiar cheering song started. Lin Chih-Sheng slowly walked onto the field in a white suit. First, he did his famous "Sorry Sorry" dance again. Then, he sang "A-Fei's Little Butterfly" with Jam Hsiao. While a video showed highlights of his career, including his time in the Chinese Professional Baseball League and with the national team, Lin Chih-Sheng became emotional and cried.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng received applause and cheers from 26,316 people in the audience. He kept wiping away tears and took a long time to calm down. His family, including his son and daughter, were also on the field to share this moment.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng gave a speech, thanking all the fans who came. He said, "I don't know why I deserve to be standing here. It's because of your cheers that Lin Chih-Sheng was created." He also thanked Jam Hsiao, saying that Hsiao sang songs he often listened to, and he started crying as soon as he heard them from off the field. He thanked Hsiao's team for giving him such a wonderful night.</p>
