A law against stalking in Taiwan has helped many people. However, some cases have still led to harm or even death. Women's groups recently said that the law has problems. For example, it's hard to decide if a case is related to "sex or gender," and getting a protection order takes too long. They want the law to be changed to fix these issues.

The stalking law started on June 1, 2022. The government says that over 70% of victims have been able to stop the stalking. Groups like the Modern Women's Foundation and Taiwan Violence Prevention Alliance agree the law has helped. But they also see parts that need improvement.

They said that judges sometimes say a case is not related to "sex or gender," and then the stalker is found not guilty. One example was a man who touched a woman's scooter seat. A higher court said this was related to her "sex or gender" because her body would touch the seat. In another case, a reporter followed a famous person, but the police said it was not related to "sex or gender." This shows that the "sex or gender" rule makes the law hard to use.

Women's groups want to remove the "sex or gender" rule from the law. They also say that getting a protection order takes too long, about 35 days on average. This means victims are not protected fast enough. They also want to make sure victims' personal information is kept safe. The groups have suggested new ideas for the law, and they hope the government will work with them to make these changes soon.

**Thai Acting Prime Minister Suriya Has Chinese Roots, Visited Ancestral Home**

According to reports from Hong Kong, Thailand's acting Prime Minister, Suriya Jungrungrungkit, has Chinese family origins. His family comes from Puning City in Guangdong province, China. His Chinese name is "Zhuang Junqi." He has visited his family's village, Guolong, in Puning many times to honor his ancestors.

Suriya has been a minister in the Thai government many times. He is the brother of Zhuang Hanchong, who is a famous Chinese-Thai leader and head of the San Yu Group, known as the "Car King."

Suriya is also the uncle of Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, who was the leader of the now-closed "Future Forward Party" in Thailand. Suriya has visited Guolong village to pay respects to his ancestors more than once. For example, in October 2024, he went there with his brother and about 20 family members. They also visited the old house where his parents lived over 80 years ago. He also gave money to help people in need there. This caused a lot of excitement in the local area.

**Two Men Sentenced for Running Marijuana Farm in Hsinchu County**

Two men, Mr. Lin and Mr. Hsieh, have been sentenced to prison for growing a large number of marijuana plants. They rented a house in a quiet area of Hsinchu County and grew 260 marijuana plants there. A court in Hsinchu found them guilty of breaking drug laws. Mr. Hsieh was sentenced to 7 years in prison, and Mr. Lin was sentenced to 6 years. The court also took away all their growing equipment and the marijuana plants.

Court documents show that Mr. Lin, who is 35 years old, bought hundreds of marijuana seeds in 2023. He also learned how to grow marijuana from someone known as "Brother Ji." After that, he rented a house in Hsinchu County to use as a marijuana farm.

The house had special equipment like ventilation fans, lights, and power cords for growing the plants. There were a total of 260 marijuana plants found there.

Mr. Lin admitted that he grew the marijuana to sell it and make money. However, Mr. Hsieh said he was not guilty. He claimed he only went to the house with Mr. Lin once and did not know that marijuana was being grown inside.

The judge said that both men had been in trouble for drug offenses before and should have learned their lesson. But they did not respect the country's strict laws against drugs. Mr. Lin committed this crime soon after being released from prison. Mr. Hsieh even turned off and reset his phone to avoid being caught, showing no regret. The case can still be appealed.
