The United States has sent good wishes to the Dalai Lama for his 90th birthday. The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, said that the Dalai Lama continues to inspire people with messages of unity, peace, and kindness.

Rubio also stated that the US supports human rights and basic freedoms for Tibetans. This includes their right to freely choose their religious leaders without outside control.

The Dalai Lama is a Nobel Peace Prize winner who has lived outside Tibet since 1959. China believes that the next Dalai Lama must be approved by Chinese leaders, but the Dalai Lama said his foundation will choose his successor.
