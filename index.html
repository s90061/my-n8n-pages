            <h1>Russia-Ukraine-US Meeting Uncertain; Putin Says Conditions for Meeting Zelenskyy Not Ready</h1>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine seems to be getting a little calmer. The US and Russia recently hinted that they might be willing to talk. Reports say that US President Trump plans to hold a meeting with three leaders, including Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, after he meets with Russian President Putin. However, Russia and the US still have different ideas about this, so it is not clear if the three-way meeting will happen.</p>
            <p>This evening, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Ukraine has the right to be part of any agreement that concerns it. He stressed that to find a fair solution, a meeting with the three leaders must happen. He also said he was thankful for Trump's wish to find peace, but he added that "every step must be carefully planned."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy stated that Russia's war against Ukraine is a threat to freedom across all of Europe. Therefore, Europe should have a place at any talks. He noted that Ukraine is working to make sure a meeting happens to protect European interests.</p>
            <p>"The war by Russia is against Ukraine, and it is a challenge to our freedom. It is also an attack on freedom for all of Europe," Zelenskyy said clearly.</p>
            <p>According to Russia's TASS news agency, Vladimir Putin said he is not against meeting Zelenskyy, but it must happen under the right conditions. "I say again that I am not against the whole (meeting), it is possible," Putin told reporters. "But the right conditions must be there, and sadly, it will take a long time to create those conditions."</p>
            <p>Regarding a two-sided meeting with Donald Trump, Putin said he suggested the meeting take place in the United Arab Emirates. He also said that Russia and the US have wanted to have this meeting for some time.</p>
            <p>Yury Ushakov, a foreign policy advisor at the Kremlin, said that Russia and the US have agreed on a place for talks next week. They are now working on the final details and expect to announce them soon.</p>
            <p>The New York Post reported that officials from the White House said that Trump's plan for a US-Russia meeting depends on Putin meeting Zelenskyy first. However, Putin has often refused to meet Zelenskyy face-to-face, which makes the US-Russia meeting uncertain.</p>
            <p>When Ushakov was interviewed in Moscow, he said that Russia's main focus now is getting ready for the two-sided meeting with Trump. About the idea of a three-way meeting, he said it was only a suggestion from the US when they visited Russia, and Russia has not given a clear answer yet.</p>
            <p>Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's former culture minister who led the Russian team, had already said during the third round of Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul that both sides had clear disagreements on how to stop fighting. There was no readiness for a meeting between the leaders. He gave the example of the meeting between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek during the Chinese civil war to show that a meeting of leaders will not be useful if there is no agreement first.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported yesterday that Trump told European leaders that he would meet Putin next week. After that, he planned to invite Zelenskyy to join a three-way meeting. But Trump made it clear that only he and the leaders of Russia and Ukraine would be part of the talks, and no other European countries would be included.</p>

            <h1>Brazil and India Leaders Promise to Defend Working Together After Trump Adds 50% Tariffs</h1>
            <p>After US President Trump put high tariffs on goods coming from Brazil and India, Brazilian President Lula and Indian Prime Minister Modi spoke on the phone today. Both leaders promised to "defend working together with many countries."</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Brazilian President's office said both leaders said it was important to "defend working together with many countries and deal with the money problems (from Trump's tariff war)."</p>
            <p>Modi wrote on X (a social media site) that he wants to make the relationship with Brazil, which is part of the BRICS group of countries, stronger. He also added that "a strong partnership between countries in the Global South that focuses on people's needs is good for everyone."</p>
            <p>Trump announced yesterday that he would double the tariffs on goods from India coming into the US to 50%. This is because India buys oil from Russia. Oil is a main way Russia gets money during its war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The first 25% tariff on Indian goods began today. The extra 25% tariff will start in three weeks.</p>
            <p>Trump also placed a special punishment on Brazil. This is because Lula's government put Trump's friend, the former far-right president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, on trial for planning a coup.</p>
            <p>Many Brazilian goods sent to the US, including coffee, started to have a 50% tariff yesterday.</p>
