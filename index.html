            <h1>Wife and Children Study Abroad, Nie Yun Lives Alone in Taiwan with a Turtle</h1>
            <p>Artist Nie Yun attended a press conference today about health. He said that his family has problems with high blood pressure and blood sugar, so he checks his own blood pressure regularly. He also shared that his wife and children have moved abroad to study, and now he lives alone in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>To help people understand how to manage blood pressure, the National Health Agency and the Taiwan Society of Hypertension ask people over 18 years old to check their blood pressure at home once a year. The National Health Agency also helps companies and communities set up places to check blood pressure. This makes it easy for people to check their blood pressure correctly and know their numbers.</p>
            <p>Nie Yun was at the press conference today to tell people to check their blood pressure regularly. His family has high blood pressure and blood sugar problems, so he pays special attention to this. Luckily, his blood pressure is stable now.</p>
            <p>Nie Yun shared that he has been living alone for the past few years, and only a turtle keeps him company. He said, "My wife and three children have all gone to study abroad. First, my oldest child went to university, then my second child went. After that, my wife said she wanted to get her master's degree, so she went. Then, my youngest daughter wanted to follow. It took about three years for them to leave one by one, even our dog went."</p>
            <p>Nie Yun laughed and said he is good at living alone. He exercises and eats regularly. But he is busy with the musicals "3 Idiots" and "The Wedding Banquet," which makes him feel stressed. He said, "Performing a show takes about three hours. This makes me keep my body in good condition because I have to sing, dance, and remember the lines. I need to be clear-headed."</p>
            <p>It is summer break now, so Nie Yun's wife and children have returned to Taiwan. His two sons are working summer jobs, and his daughter is still in school. He said, "She is on the badminton team at her school abroad. So, when she came back to Taiwan, her main goal was to train with different coaches."</p>

            <h1>Fantastic Four Creates Retro-Futuristic Feel, Avatar 3 Trailer First Appears on Big Screen</h1>
            <p>The movie "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" will be released in Taiwan tomorrow, before the US. The movie has a retro-futuristic style. The team remade Times Square in New York and filmed in Spain for this movie. Also, the trailer for "Avatar: Fire and Ash" will be shown for the first time before the movie.</p>
            <p>In "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," the four main actors are like a close family. The actors said they also have a strong bond outside of the movie.</p>
            <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays "Mister Fantastic," said, "This family is full of care and love, and we did it easily." Vanessa Kirby, who plays "Invisible Woman," said, "We are very lucky to get along so well." Joseph Quinn, who plays "Human Torch," said that the good connection between the four actors cannot be forced. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays "The Thing," concluded: "The four of us worked hard to make this family feel more human."</p>
            <p>Matt Shakman, the director of "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," said in a behind-the-scenes video that the original comic books were from the 1960s. That time was full of hope and dreams about going into space. So, the movie's style is retro-futuristic. To show the movie's special feeling, Pedro Pascal also shared, "We carefully built outdoor places like Times Square and indoor scenes. We even went to Spain to film."</p>

            <h1>Shohei Ohtani Pitches 3 Innings, Gives Up 1 Run, and Hits a Home Run; Dodgers End 6-Game Home Losing Streak</h1>
            <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, who plays two positions, started the game today. He pitched for 3 innings and gave up 1 run. The other team hit a home run right away. But in the first inning, Ohtani hit a 2-run home run himself. The Dodgers won the game 5 to 2 against the Minnesota Twins. This ended their 6-game losing streak at home.</p>
            <p>In this game, Shohei Ohtani started for the Dodgers. The Twins, who batted first, hit a home run in the 1st inning with their star center fielder Byron Buxton. This made the score 1 to 0.</p>
            <p>But in the bottom of the first inning, the Dodgers' second batter, Shohei Ohtani, hit a 441-foot home run after Mookie Betts walked. This gave the Dodgers a 2 to 1 lead. Ohtani has hit a home run in his last 3 games.</p>
            <p>Today, Ohtani gave up a home run in the first inning but hit one back in the same inning. This makes him the first pitcher since Randy Lerch of the Philadelphia Phillies on May 17, 1979, to give up a home run and hit a home run in the same game's first inning. That game was a crazy hitting game where the Phillies won 23 to 22 against the Chicago Cubs.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers, who are first in the National League West, lost all 3 games to the Milwaukee Brewers last weekend. They have now lost 6 home games in a row. This is their longest losing streak at Dodger Stadium since September 2017.</p>
            <p>Shohei Ohtani has hit home runs in 3 games in a row. He now has 35 home runs in total, which is second in the National League.</p>
            <p>Will Smith of the Dodgers hit two solo home runs today against Twins pitcher David Festa. He hit them in the 4th and 6th innings, making the score 4 to 1.</p>
            <p>Today, Shohei Ohtani pitched for 3 innings, giving up 4 hits and 1 run. He also struck out 3 batters. Dustin May took over from him and pitched 4.2 innings, giving up 5 hits and no runs. He struck out 4 batters and got the win.</p>
