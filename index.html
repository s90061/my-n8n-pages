            <h1>Three Korean Influencers Enjoy Taichung's Charm; Tour Buses Offer Foreign Language Services</h1>
            <p>The Taichung Tourism Bureau recently went to Korea to promote Taichung's special charm. They worked with Tigerair Taiwan to invite three Korean internet famous people (influencers) to truly experience Taichung. These influencers visited popular places and ate local food. The bureau also helped bus companies train their drivers and customer service staff to speak foreign languages for visitors.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Tourism Bureau announced today that there are 16 flights every week between Taichung and Korea. Korean Air and T'way Air have 14 flights each week between Taichung and Incheon. Tigerair Taiwan has 2 flights each week between Taichung and Jeju. Korea is a very important country for Taichung to get international tourists. Jin Air will also start 14 new flights each week between Taichung and Incheon in the winter season this year.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Bureau recently promoted Taichung's charm in Korea. They worked with Tigerair Taiwan to invite three Korean influencers to deeply experience Taichung. They visited Fengjia Night Market, Dakeng Trails, Audit Village, Sun Cake Museum, and hot spring resorts in Huilai Guguan. They also tried delicious local food in Taichung.</p>
            <p>Chen Mei-hsiu, the Director of the Tourism Bureau, said that on July 31st this year, they launched the 555 bus route. This route makes it easy for travelers to go between the airport and the city center quickly. It connects "Taichung International Airport â€“ MRT Wenhua Senior High School Station â€“ City Hall Station â€“ Shin Kong / Far Eastern Department Stores â€“ Liming Zhongke Road Intersection â€“ Taichung International Airport." This creates a fast and easy way to get to and from the airport. The buses also have space for luggage, and tourists like this service.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Bureau helped bus companies improve the foreign language skills of their drivers and customer service staff for the Taiwan Tourist Shuttle buses. They offered English classes and gave drivers and staff small pocket phrasebooks. They also showed them easy-to-use translation apps for their phones. This helps the staff on the front lines to communicate in English, Korean, and other foreign languages, offering friendly service to international visitors.</p>

            <h1>All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant Battle in Southern Taiwan; Han-Lai's "Island Language" Kaohsiung Store Sold Out in Seconds</h1>
            <p>People really love "all-you-can-eat" restaurants, and this has made businesses compete for customers. Han-Lai Foods' all-you-can-eat restaurant "Island Language" opened its second store in Kaohsiung. It is very popular. Reservations until the end of October were fully booked in minutes. Han-Lai expects that when they open reservations for November in September, they will also be gone very quickly.</p>
            <p>Han-Lai Foods said today that about 10,000 seats for "Island Language" were available online until the end of September, and they were all booked in 5 minutes. Reservations for October were also gone in 2 minutes. Next, they will open reservations for November on September 1st.</p>
            <p>Han-Lai Foods said that the "Island Language" Kaohsiung store is expected to make 500 million New Taiwan Dollars in sales for the whole year. Lin Shu-ting, the chairperson of Han-Lai Foods, said they will open more stores faster this year and next year. In December, they plan to change the Taoyuan TaiMall Hi-Lai Harbor buffet restaurant into the third "Island Language" store. After that, they will open one store each in Taichung Hanshin Intercontinental Shopping Center and Taipei Dome.</p>
            <p>The "Island Language" Kaohsiung store is on the 8th floor of Hanshin Department Store in Kaohsiung. It has 660 ping of space and 350 seats. It directly competes with the "Hi-Lai Harbor" all-you-can-eat restaurant from the same company. It also competes with other all-you-can-eat restaurants like Shin Yeh's "A-Ji" and "Paradise Buffet" from the Shin Yeh Group, trying to get more customers in the all-you-can-eat market.</p>
            <p>Han-Lai Foods spent nearly 200 million New Taiwan Dollars to build the "Island Language" Kaohsiung store. It officially opened recently. Besides offering drinks that go well with the food, each themed food station has special dishes that would be served in a separate restaurant. They also use more ingredients from contract farmers, organic foods, and foods with known origins.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kaohsiung store works with many famous brands and stores. These include baking expert Wang Peng-chieh, Yifong Winter Melon Tea, Yuanlin's century-old grass jelly, and special drinks from A-Xiang, the owner of TCRC, one of Asia's top 50 best bars. On holiday evenings, each person also gets half a lobster. The prices range from 1490 to 2090 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Liu Tzu-ming, the general manager of Han-Lai Foods' Western cuisine brands, said that the sales from buffet restaurants alone make up almost 40% of the group's yearly income. As times change, customers who go to all-you-can-eat restaurants care more about the quality of every detail, from ingredients, dishes, and environment to service.</p>
            <p>In addition, the "A-Ji" store in E-DA World is on the 7th floor of E-DA Fashion Square A Building. Since it opened in 2021, it has also been hard to get a seat. It mainly offers Japanese food, with 9 main areas including "Sheng Sheng (sashimi and seafood)," "Qiao Shou (made-to-order sushi)," "Zhi Shao (teppanyaki)," and more. Prices range from 1390 to 1990 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>

            <h1>Lee Jae-myung Visits USA, Sends Group to China at Same Time; Shows Practical Diplomacy to Keep Balance</h1>
            <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is visiting the United States and will meet with US President Trump. But at the same time, he has also sent a special group to visit China. This is seen as a way to balance South Korea's relationship between the US and China. It shows the "practical diplomacy" that Lee Jae-myung's government talks about.</p>
            <p>On August 24th, former South Korean National Assembly Speaker Park Byeong-seok led the President's special group in Beijing. They met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. They also gave Wang Yi a personal letter from Lee Jae-myung. The letter said that South Korea's new government cares a lot about its relationship with China and hopes to make the two countries' relationship grow better.</p>
            <p>Korean media reports say that sending this special group was a way to tell China that South Korea "will not ignore its relationship with China." This happened while South Korea's foreign policy is based on its alliance with the United States.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency quoted Choi Jin-baek, a research professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy. He said that the South Korean government sending a special group to China while Lee Jae-myung visits the US seems like an example of practical diplomacy.</p>
            <p>China welcomed this visit. But China also said things that seemed to challenge the US, such as saying it wants to protect the international free trade system and stop protectionism. It also talked about improving communication in groups like the United Nations. These comments are thought to be aimed at President Trump's past actions on tariffs (taxes on imported goods).</p>
            <p>Also, the news releases from the South Korean and Chinese foreign ministries about this special group's visit showed some differences in their positions. The Chinese Foreign Ministry's news release mentioned that the special group said they respect the "One China" principle. However, it did not mention South Korea's point about the Provisional Measures Zone (PMZ) between the two countries.</p>
