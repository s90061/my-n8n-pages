            <h1>Trump's tariffs and uncertainty make investors worried, European stocks close lower</h1>
            <p>London, September 2 (CNA) - Today, the main stock markets in Europe closed lower. This happened because investors were worried about a few things. These included disagreements between US President Trump and the Federal Reserve, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs, and money problems in European governments. Because of these worries, investors quickly looked for safer places to put their money.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went down by 79.65 points, which is 0.87%. It closed at 9116.69 points.</p>

            <h1>US removes special permission for TSMC's Nanjing factory; Ministry of Economic Affairs says it won't hurt Taiwan's industry</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 2 (CNA) - The US government will take away a special permission from TSMC's factory in Nanjing, China. On the evening of September 2, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) also took away similar permissions from two Korean companies last week. This means the US action is likely not just aimed at TSMC. The Ministry also said that the Nanjing factory makes only about 3% of all TSMC products. It makes even less of all semiconductor products in Taiwan. So, this change should not hurt Taiwan's ability to compete in the industry.</p>
            <p>A recent US government document said that the US will remove special permissions for American company Intel and Korean companies Samsung and SK Hynix. These permissions allowed them to get US equipment for making semiconductors in China. TSMC said today that the US government told them that their special permission for TSMC (Nanjing) will end on December 31, 2025. TSMC is now checking the situation and plans to take proper steps to make sure its Nanjing factory can continue to work without problems.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 2, the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that by taking away TSMC Nanjing factory's special permission, the factory will need to ask for permission for each piece of US equipment it wants to import in the future.</p>
            <p>The Ministry explained that this change means the Nanjing factory will no longer have a "green channel" permit from the US Bureau of Industry and Security. This "green channel" allowed them to get controlled goods from the US without asking for permission for each batch. Now, they will need to ask for permission "case by case." This change will make it harder to predict how the factory will operate in the future.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that TSMC has already announced that it received the notice from the US. The US government will cancel TSMC Nanjing factory's special permission from December 31, 2025. TSMC also said that it will try to make sure its Nanjing factory continues to operate without stopping while talking with the US government.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that the BIS also canceled special permissions for two Korean companies, Samsung and Hynix, last week. This suggests the action is not only against TSMC or a specific company. Taiwan and the US have a very close relationship in the semiconductor supply chain. Also, the US continues to make rules stronger for semiconductors. Therefore, companies in Taiwan should keep improving how they follow export control laws to protect their rights.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also said that about 20% of Samsung's DRAM products are made in China, and about 40% of Hynix's are. For TSMC, only its Nanjing factory in China uses US-controlled items (16-nanometer). This factory makes only about 3% of TSMC's total products and this might become even less in the future. It makes even less of Taiwan's total semiconductor production. So, the Ministry thinks this will not hurt Taiwan's overall ability to compete in the industry.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs stressed that it will continue to talk closely with the US and companies. It will keep informed about the situation and offer help.</p>
