            <h1>Loan Interest Subsidies to Boost Spending; China's Ministry of Finance: Will Extend Policy as Needed</h1>
            <p>China's economy is not strong inside the country. So, the government has started new plans. These plans offer help with interest on loans for people who buy things and for businesses in the service industry.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Finance said that this is the first time the central government has given interest help for loans. The goal is to make people spend more money. They will decide later if they need to continue this help for a longer time.</p>
            <p>The State Council Information Office held a meeting this morning, August 13. They talked about the plans for helping with personal consumer loans and service industry business loans.</p>
            <p>Liao Min, a vice minister from the Ministry of Finance, said that giving interest help for personal consumer loans and service industry loans is new for the central government. He called it another "national payment" in the area of consumer loans. This plan aims to make people want to buy more and make the market more active. This shows that the government thinks it is very important to make people spend more.</p>
            <p>Mr. Liao also said that these two plans for interest help want to move more money towards spending. This will help to make people buy more and make the economy flow better. After these plans end, the government will check how well they worked. Then, they will decide if they should continue the plans, help more types of businesses, or change which banks can offer these loans.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and the National Financial Regulatory Administration shared a plan. It is called the "Plan for Giving Government Interest Help for Personal Consumer Loans."</p>
            <p>This plan says that from September 1 of this year until August 31, 2026, people can get help with interest if they use loans from certain banks for normal buying and if they meet other rules.</p>
            <p>The amount of interest help will be 1% of the loan interest each year. The central government will pay 90% of this help, and the local governments will pay 10%.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Finance gave an example: Someone uses a loan of 200,000 Chinese Yuan (about 834,000 New Taiwan Dollars) to fix up their home or buy furniture. If the loan interest rate is 3% each year, they would normally pay 6,000 Yuan in interest. With the 1% interest help, they will pay 2,000 Yuan less in interest.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and seven other government groups shared another plan. It is called the "Plan for Giving Loan Interest Help to Service Industry Businesses."</p>
            <p>Eight types of service businesses can get this help. These are food and lodging, health, elderly care, childcare, home services, culture and fun, travel, and sports. They can get help if they took loans between March 16 of this year and December 31 of this year. The loans must be used to make their services better or to improve places where people spend money.</p>
            <p>The help for interest will be for no more than one year, at a rate of 1% each year. The central government will pay 90% of this help, and the local governments will pay 10%. One business can get help for a loan up to 1 million Chinese Yuan. For example, if a restaurant gets a 900,000 Yuan loan for one year on October 1 to buy new tools or make their place bigger, they can get 9,000 Yuan in interest help.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rains in Kyushu: 3 Dead, Over 700 Buildings Flooded; Recovery Faces Extreme Heat</h1>
            <p>Earlier this month, many parts of Japan's Kyushu area had very heavy rains, more than ever before. Three people have died, some are still missing, and 732 buildings are flooded. People in the affected areas are trying to fix their homes, but today they will face very hot weather, over 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Japan's NHK news reported today that areas in Kyushu, like Kagoshima and Kumamoto, have had "linear rainbands" since August 8. These are long lines of rain clouds that bring a lot of rain. This has caused record amounts of rain in many places.</p>
            <p>The heavy rains have also caused problems in many areas. In Kamou-cho, Aira City, Kagoshima, a house was completely destroyed by a landslide. A woman living in that house was found dead on August 11.</p>
            <p>Also, on August 12, a man in Kumamoto's Kosa-cho died in a mudslide while trying to get to a safe place. In Yatsushiro City, a 70-year-old woman died when her car went into an industrial water channel.</p>
            <p>In Fukutsu City, Fukuoka, a man and a woman in their sixties might have been carried away by a river. We do not know where they are now.</p>
            <p>The Kumamoto local government first said three people were missing. But they could not confirm that one person was swept away by the river. So, last night, they changed the number of missing people to two.</p>
            <p>Regarding the damage, three buildings were completely destroyed, three buildings were partly damaged, and 732 buildings were flooded. This happened in three areas: Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka.</p>
            <p>The Japanese police and local governments are still gathering information about the damage from this heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Japan's Fuji News Network (FNN) reported that two people are missing in Fukuoka and Kumamoto.</p>
            <p>A social welfare center in Tamana City, Kumamoto, was also damaged by the heavy rain. Workers are cleaning furniture with water to fix the place. But some people said, "Some air conditioners do not work, and the air conditioner repair companies seem very busy right now. We are not sure what to do."</p>
            <p>Japan is now under a high-pressure system. This means that a large area, including Kyushu, will have very hot weather today. The highest temperatures expected in different places are: Hita City, Oita, 37 degrees Celsius; Kumamoto City, 36 degrees; and Fukuoka City, 35 degrees.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Willow Approaching: Yunlin Vegetable Farmers Rush to Harvest, Pomelo Farmers Protect Trees</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow is coming closer to Taiwan. This morning, vegetable farmers in Yunlin quickly harvested their vegetables because the wind and rain were not strong yet. Also, Douliu pomelos will be ready to pick in about one week. Pomelo farmers are checking the water systems in their farms. They are worried that strong winds might make the fruit fall, or if too much water stays on the farm, it could harm the trees. If this happens, they will lose a lot of money.</p>
            <p>The Erhlun Township Farmers' Association usually sends about 60 tons of vegetables every day. But since Typhoon Danas, it has rained for many days in Yunlin. The vegetables in the fields have rotted. Now, only about 20 tons of vegetables are being sent. Last week, the weather in Yunlin was sunny, so farmers quickly planted new vegetables. But now, with Typhoon Willow coming, farmers are quickly harvesting the vegetables they have in their fields.</p>
            <p>Farmers said that before July, they often lost money on quick-growing leafy vegetables. Because of typhoons and strong winds from the southwest, many vegetables were damaged. This means there are fewer vegetables to sell, and their prices are going up. For example, some farmers planned to pick rapeseeds tomorrow from a small piece of land. But sellers asked them to pick them this morning because there was no wind or rain, as they were worried about more damage after the typhoon.</p>
            <p>Douliu pomelos will start to be picked next week. Yunlin County Leader Chang Li-shan visited the Douliu pomelo growing area today. She was with the head of the Agriculture Department, Wei Sheng-te, and the general manager of the Douliu City Farmers' Association, Chang Chiao-fu. They went to see how farmers are getting ready for the typhoon.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chang said that because of the typhoon, Yunlin will have winds of strength 6 to 7 on average from this afternoon. The wind gusts could be as strong as strength 9 to 10. Douliu fruit farmers prepared early. For example, the water drainage systems in their farms are very good. This will stop water from staying too long and hurting the roots of the trees.</p>
            <p>A pomelo farmer, Cheng Yen-fu, said that pomelos do not like to be in too much water. If the roots close to the surface die from too much water, the tree will also die. So, it is very important to have a good water drainage system on the farm. He also said that Douliu pomelos are very heavy now, and they will be picked in about one week. If the wind is too strong, the fruit might fall, or their skin might get damaged. He just hopes that the weather will be kind, with less wind and rain.</p>
