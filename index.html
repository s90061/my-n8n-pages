            <h1>EU Foreign Minister: Any Agreement Between US and Russia Must Include Ukraine and EU</h1>
            <p>The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said today that any agreement between Washington and Moscow to end the war in Ukraine must include Ukraine and the European Union. She will call a meeting of EU foreign ministers tomorrow to talk about the next steps.</p>
            <p>Kallas sent an email saying, "The United States can make Russia negotiate seriously. Any agreement between the United States and Russia must include Ukraine and the EU. This is because it is important for the safety of Ukraine and all of Europe."</p>
            <p>US President Trump plans to meet Russian President Putin in Alaska on August 15.</p>
            <p>Kallas said, "While we work for lasting and fair peace, international law is clear: all temporarily occupied lands belong to Ukraine."</p>
            <p>She stressed, "The agreement must not become a reason for Russia to attack Ukraine, the transatlantic alliance, and Europe again."</p>
            <p>Kallas also mentioned that EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation in the Gaza Strip.</p>

            <h1>Israel Plans to Control Gaza City, Netanyahu Explains 5 Rules for Ending the War</h1>
            <p>Israel's security group recently decided to fully control Gaza City. This decision made many people angry. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a press conference. He said that the Gaza Strip will not have military forces anymore. He also explained Israel's five main rules for ending the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>BBC reported that Netanyahu said at the press conference that Israel has five main rules to end the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>These rules include: the Palestinian group Hamas must give up its weapons, all Israeli hostages must be freed, the Gaza Strip must not have military forces, Israel must have "full control over security" in the Gaza Strip, and a new "civilian government" must be made that is not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said that the Israeli government plans to completely take control of Gaza City. He called this the "best way" to end the war and defeat Hamas. He also stated that Israel will let regular people go to safe areas. In these areas, they will get "enough" food, safety, and medical help.</p>
            <p>He also blamed Hamas again for the problem with aid in Gaza. He accused Hamas of stealing aid that was meant for ordinary people.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu showed a picture. He said the picture showed many aid supplies that Israel allowed into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. These supplies had not been picked up yet.</p>
            <p>He also talked about a three-step plan to fix this problem. This plan includes making safe paths for giving out aid, adding more safe places where the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation" can manage giving out aid, and having the Israeli army and others do more aid drops from the air.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Warship Entered Chinese Waters by Mistake Last Year, Was Warned by Chinese Army Fire</h1>
            <p>Today, Japanese media reported that in July last year, a Japanese warship called "Suzutsuki" from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force entered China's waters by mistake. This happened off the coast of Zhejiang Province in China. The Chinese military warned the ship by firing at least two cannon shells. It is very unusual for China to fire warning shots at another country's ship. This shows that the situation was very dangerous and could have gotten worse quickly.</p>
            <p>Japan's Kyodo News reported details from people who know about Japan-China relations. They said that on the morning of July 4 last year, the Japanese warship Suzutsuki was sailing off the coast of Zhejiang Province in China. It was watching Chinese military training from international waters. The Chinese military saw the Suzutsuki moving towards China's waters. They told the Suzutsuki many times to change its course. Just before the Suzutsuki entered China's waters, the Chinese military fired one cannon shell as a warning.</p>
            <p>After the Suzutsuki entered China's waters, the Chinese military fired another cannon shell. They told the Suzutsuki to leave. The Suzutsuki was not hit by the shells and was not damaged.</p>
            <p>The report said that the Suzutsuki's electronic sea map had a switch error. It was not set to show the borders between international waters and other countries' waters. This mistake meant the ship did not notice it had entered Chinese waters. Because of this, the Chinese military fired warning shots. The Suzutsuki was in China's waters for about 20 minutes.</p>
