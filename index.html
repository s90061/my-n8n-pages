        const text = `**Putin and Trump Talk About Ukraine War**

Today, US President Trump spoke with Russian President Putin on the phone. Trump asked to stop the war in Ukraine quickly. An official from the Kremlin said that during the call, Putin repeated Russia's idea to solve the "main reasons" for the war.

Reuters reported that the call lasted almost an hour. Putin's helper, Yuri Ushakov, shared what was discussed. They did not talk about the US stopping some weapons for Kyiv recently.

At the same time, Ukraine's President Zelensky told reporters in Denmark that he hopes to talk to Trump as soon as tomorrow. He wants to discuss why the US stopped sending weapons. "Main reasons" is a short way for Russia to talk about two big issues: NATO getting bigger and Western countries helping Ukraine. This includes not letting Ukraine join NATO. NATO leaders say Russia also wants to control the decisions of Kyiv and other countries in Eastern Europe.

**US House Passes Big Bill, Sends to Trump Before July 4th**

Today, the US House of Representatives voted for a big bill from the Senate. President Trump wanted this bill to lower taxes and increase spending. The House approved it with 218 votes for and 214 against. Now, the bill will go to Trump to sign into law before July 4th, as he wished.

On July 1st, the US Senate also voted for this bill, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Trump's government supports. The Senate approved it with a close vote of 51 for and 50 against. After that, the bill went to the House for their vote. At one point, some Republican members in the House refused to vote, which made it hard to start the discussion. But early today, the House still voted 219 for and 213 against to start talking about the bill. Later today, they passed the bill.

Trump recently said that this bill will give tax cuts to Americans, make borders safer, and make the army stronger. He believes the US economy will grow very quickly. He also asked for the bill to be signed before July 4th. The Associated Press reported that the Senate's changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will add 3.3 trillion US dollars to the country's debt. It will also greatly reduce health insurance coverage. This is according to the US Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

**Djokovic Wins His 99th Match at Wimbledon, Krejcikova Also Moves On**

The Wimbledon tennis tournament continued today with its second round. Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic easily beat local player Dan Evans and moved to the third round in men's singles. In women's singles, the defending champion Barbora Krejcikova had a tough match against American player Caroline Dolehide and won after three sets.

Many high-ranked players lost early in the first three days of Wimbledon this year. But Djokovic did not become one of them. Today, he won his match in just 1 hour and 47 minutes. He beat Dan Evans, who played with a special invitation, by scores of 6-3, 6-2, 6-0. After the match, Djokovic found out it was his 99th win at Wimbledon. He said, "That means I've been playing for a long time! I still enjoy playing. This court has given me a lot. In my heart, Wimbledon is always special, and making history here is even more special."

Djokovic, who is 38 years old, won the US Open in 2023. This gave him 24 Grand Slam singles titles, tying him with Australian tennis legend Margaret Court. Even though he lost in the finals of Wimbledon for the past two years to Carlos Alcaraz from Spain, Djokovic still believes Wimbledon is his best chance to win his 25th Grand Slam title. In women's singles, Barbora Krejcikova from the Czech Republic, last year's champion, played a difficult match for 1 hour and 51 minutes. She finally beat Caroline Dolehide with scores of 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.
