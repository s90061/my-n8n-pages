**Fair Trade Commission Approves Deal; Taiwan Smart Electricity to Increase Capital with 14 Companies**

Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission approved a plan for Taiwan Smart Electricity (TSE) to combine with other companies. Six companies, including China Steel and Chunghwa Telecom, will work together to buy and sell electricity. TSE announced today that it will raise more money, increasing its capital to about NT$1.5 billion to NT$2 billion. The number of shareholders will also grow to 14.

Currently, TSE has three shareholders. After the capital increase, the 14 shareholders will include major companies like Taiwan CPC, Chunghwa Telecom, and TSMC. Government-related companies will own more than half of the shares. TSE said that after the approval, they will raise more money and work more closely with offshore wind farms that will connect to the power grid by 2030. They have already talked to some wind farm projects. Once a new board is set up, they will decide on purchases.

TSE will have 7 board members, with one from each of the main companies. The head of the Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection will also be a director and the chairperson. TSE noted that Taiwanese companies need green energy because of pressure to reduce carbon and to meet their promises for RE100, SBTi, or ESG goals. For companies that are not big enough to sign contracts directly with wind farms, TSE will help them get green energy by buying it in large amounts and selling it to many different companies. This will help businesses become more eco-friendly. TSE also said that besides buying and selling green energy, they will help companies manage extra power and meet their power supply needs. This will lower the cost of buying electricity and help more green energy be used. TSE believes its creation will not harm the current green energy market. Instead, it will help businesses buy green energy, make the green energy market work better, and benefit companies, wind farms, and electricity sellers.

**Dozens More Killed in Israeli Air Strikes in Gaza; Hamas Seeks Ceasefire Guarantee**

A person close to Hamas said today that Hamas wants to make sure a new US-backed plan for a ceasefire in Gaza will end the war. Doctors say Israeli air attacks in Gaza have killed dozens more people. Reuters reported that Israeli officials believe it is very likely that a ceasefire and hostage deal will be reached after almost 21 months of war.

After the US helped stop fighting between Israel and Iran for 12 days, efforts to stop the war in Gaza have sped up. However, Gaza's health department said that strong Israeli air attacks continued, killing at least 59 people on July 3. US President Trump said on July 1 that Israel has agreed to conditions for a 60-day ceasefire with Hamas. Both sides will try to end the war during this time.

A source near Hamas said Hamas wants clear promises that the ceasefire will lead to the war's end. Two Israeli officials said the details are still being discussed. Hamas stated this morning that they are talking with other Palestinian groups about the ceasefire plan. After these talks, they will give an official answer to the mediators. An Egyptian national security source said that Egyptian and Qatari mediators are trying to get promises from the US and other countries to ensure talks about ending the war will continue. This is to convince Hamas to accept the two-month ceasefire plan. A high-ranking Israeli official close to Prime Minister Netanyahu said the government is ready to approve the ceasefire deal. Another source said Israel expects Hamas to respond by July 4. If the answer is positive, an Israeli team will join indirect talks to finalize the agreement. An official familiar with the talks said today that the plan involves releasing 10 living Israeli hostages and returning the bodies of 18 others in stages. In return, Israel would release Palestinian prisoners. It is believed that about 20 of the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza are still alive.
