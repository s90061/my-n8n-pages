            <h1>Over 2,000 Millimeters of Rain in Pingtung Mountains in 7 Days; 831 People Moved to Safety</h1>
            <p>Due to a southwest air current, the Pingtung mountain area has received more than 2,000 millimeters of rain in seven days. This caused roads to flood and rocks to fall. The county government moved 831 people to safety as a precaution. Also, yesterday, dirt and rocks blocked pipes in Koushe Village, Sanhemen Township. Today, the water is flowing freely again.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration issued warnings for heavy and extremely heavy rain in Pingtung. Data shows that from July 28 until noon today, the rain measuring stations in Shenshan, Wutai Township, and Shangdewen, Sanhemen Township, both recorded over 2,000 millimeters of rain. This amount is almost the same as Taiwan's average yearly rainfall.</p>
            <p>Pingtung continued to have heavy rain today because of the southwest air current. Yesterday, in Koushe Village, Sanhemen Township, two water pipes in the village were blocked by a lot of dirt and rocks because of the heavy rain. This stopped the water from draining well, causing dirt and mud to flow onto the roads. The village chief of Koushe, Song Zaofu, told CNA today that heavy machinery was used yesterday to clear the dirt. Today, the water is flowing smoothly again. But because the heavy rain keeps falling, it is still hard to feel safe.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Government reported that by noon today, a total of 831 people from mountain areas like Wutai, Sanhemen, Majia, and Mudan townships were moved to safety. Among them, 576 people went to stay with relatives, and 255 people were placed in shelters.</p>
            <p>Today, nine townships in Pingtung, including Wutai and Gaoshu, closed schools and offices due to the heavy rain. The old Sanhemen Bridge in Sanhemen Township was closed at 12 PM today as a safety measure because the water level was too high. Jianyuan Road in Gaoshu Township was flooded with 30 centimeters of water and is now temporarily closed. In Shizi Township, on the Shouka section, trees and dirt fell onto the road from the side of the hill, making it difficult to pass. This has now been cleared. There are also potholes on the Chaozhou section of Zhutian Township.</p>

            <h1>Tiles Falling from Building Wall in Xinyi District, Taipei City Building Management Office Fines NT$60,000</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Building Management Office said today that tiles recently fell from the outer wall of a 40-year-old building on Fude Street in Xinyi District. After checking, they found the tiles fell from the air conditioner opening on the 5th floor. Residents have been told to fix it quickly. The office will also fine the owner NT$60,000 according to the Building Act.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, someone posted pictures and text on the Facebook group "Xinyi District Small Talk." They said that bricks and tiles were falling from the outer wall of a building on Fude Street in Xinyi District. The person had seen this happen twice in one week. They also warned people walking on nearby roads and sidewalks to be careful.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Building Management Office announced today through a press release that tiles fell from the outer wall of a building on Fude Street in Xinyi District. They found that this old building received its occupancy permit in 1985. They have asked a professional architect from the Architects Association to go to the site to check the building's safety.</p>
            <p>The Building Management Office said that the first check showed the tiles fell from the air conditioner opening on the 5th floor of the building. They have told the residents involved to fix it quickly to keep the public safe.</p>
            <p>Also, according to Article 77 of the Building Act, the building owner must keep the building safe.</p>
            <p>The Building Management Office said that in this case, the owner did not manage and maintain the building well. This caused the outer wall tiles to fall off and put public safety at risk. They will fine the owner NT$60,000 according to Article 91 of the Building Act. If anyone's life or property is harmed, the building owner will also be responsible under civil and criminal law, in addition to being fined according to the Building Act.</p>
            <p>To encourage people to check and fix the outer walls of old buildings, Yu Ji-xue, the head of the Building Management Office, said that people can apply for money to help fix outer walls. This is under the "Taipei City Building Outer Wall Decoration Peeling Application for Repair and Subsidy Guidelines." Buildings must be 10 years old or more to get this help. The money is given per building, up to NT$200,000, based on the actual cost.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Taipei City Urban Regeneration Office also offers subsidies for renovating old houses. For each case, the approved subsidy amount cannot be more than 50% of the total cost of the approved renovation items, and it cannot be more than NT$12 million.</p>
            <p>The Building Management Office asks all owners to check their outer walls regularly and fix them early. Keeping outer walls safe is important for people's lives and property, and it helps prevent sad accidents.</p>
