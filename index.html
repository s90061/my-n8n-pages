            <h1>Washington Mayor Says No Longer Cooperating with ICE; Trump Threatens Emergency State in Capital</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said that the capital's police will no longer work with the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency. After this, U.S. President Trump today said he might declare a national emergency in Washington D.C. and make it a federal area.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the main issue is whether D.C. police should give information about people who are living in the country illegally to federal agencies. Trump's actions made some civil rights groups and local officials worried. They said this might give the federal government too much power. It is known that over 2,000 troops are currently patrolling Washington.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, thousands of people protested in Washington streets. They were against Trump's order in August to send in the National Guard. At that time, officials said this was to "bring back law and order and public safety." They said the capital had serious crime problems.</p>
            <p>Trump earlier said on his social media platform, Truth Social, that safety in the capital has much improved. He said that "crime has almost disappeared" in a few weeks, which is the first time in decades.</p>
            <p>Mayor Bowser's office did not respond to Trump's statements by the time this news was written.</p>
            <p>Trump had already put the capital's Metropolitan Police Department under federal control. He also sent federal law enforcement officers, including ICE, to help with law enforcement on Washington streets. However, it is not clear yet when these groups will stop their work.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that "radical left Democrats" pressured Bowser to stop working with ICE. He stressed that if the police stop working together, crime might go up again.</p>
            <p>Trump said that if safety in Washington D.C. gets worse, or if needed, he would consider declaring a national emergency in the capital and making it federal. This would protect the safety of local residents and businesses.</p>
            <p>Mayor Bowser had previously signed an order to make D.C. work with federal law enforcement agencies. She had also publicly said that the federal deployment helped improve local safety.</p>
            <p>The U.S. National Guard usually works under the governor of each state. Only the Washington D.C. National Guard is directly controlled by the President.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Stock Market Stops 5-Day High; Investment Firm Hopes for Slow Fed Rate Cut</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 15 (CNA) The Taiwan stock market today stopped its 5-day streak of reaching new highs. It closed down by 117.48 points. Important stocks, PCB companies, and military-related stocks went down. An investment advisory firm said that the market's positive trend has not reversed. It is holding steady above the 5-day moving average, showing a strong period of adjustment. The market is closely watching the U.S. Federal Reserve's (Fed) FOMC meeting on September 17 for news about interest rate cuts. A slow reduction in rates that continues into next year would be helpful.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market today ended its 5-day run of new highs. It fell by 117.48 points, closing at 25357.16 points. Major stocks like TSMC and Hon Hai went down. The PCB industry's gains faded, and military drone-related stocks pulled back.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-wei, Vice President of Mega International Investment Services, told CNA that the Taiwan stock market is continuing its adjustment after rising a lot since last Thursday. However, the positive market feeling has not changed, and it is holding above the 5-day moving average, showing a strong adjustment phase.</p>
            <p>He said that the market is carefully watching the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting on the 17th for news on interest rate cuts. They are also paying attention to what the Federal Reserve says about the job market and the future economy. Investors already expect a rate cut, and about 80-90% of the good news has already affected the market. But, because people are very hopeful, there is still a good chance that the market could reach new highs before the results are announced.</p>
            <p>He added that the market is wondering if the rate cut will be 0.25% or 0.50%. However, if the rate is cut by 0.50% all at once, people might worry that the economy is actually doing very badly. Therefore, a slow rate cut, such as 0.50% by the end of the year and another 0.50% next year, might be what the market hopes for most.</p>

            <h1>Fraud Suspect Who Hit 4 Police Officers and Citizens While Being Arrested Is Charged with Attempted Murder</h1>
            <p>New Taipei, September 15 (CNA) In August, a man named Ko, a member of a fraud group, and his partner Wu were being arrested by police in Sanchong, New Taipei. Ko drove his car into police officers, hurting three officers and one citizen. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office has charged both men with attempted aggravated fraud. Additionally, Ko has been charged with attempted murder.</p>
            <p>According to the indictment from the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office, the fraud group falsely claimed on Facebook that people could make money by investing in virtual currency. From July 2025, they tricked a woman named Lin into sending them money many times. After Ms. Lin realized something was wrong, she reported it to the police and worked with them. She arranged to meet the fraud group on August 8 in Dazhi Street, Sanchong District, New Taipei City, to hand over NT$2 million.</p>
            <p>On that day, the fraud group sent a man named Wu to pick up the money. They also told a man named Ko to watch nearby. When Ms. Lin gave them the fake money she had prepared, the police immediately moved in to arrest Wu. When Ko saw Wu being arrested, he quickly drove his car forward and hit two police officers. When he saw that the police had blocked his way, he still tried to get away. He then backed up and hit one more police officer and Ms. Lin. This hurt three police officers and Ms. Lin. The police quickly surrounded and stopped Ko, and both men were taken into custody.</p>
            <p>Later, Wu admitted that the fraud group told him to pick up money and do money laundering. Ko, however, denied what he did. He said he "didn't know it was a fraud, and didn't know the people he hit were police."</p>
            <p>The prosecutor said that both men are involved in the crime of attempted aggravated fraud according to the Criminal Code. The investigation has recently finished, and they have been charged. Also, because Ko drove his car at high speed into police officers and Ms. Lin, he is charged with attempted murder. This will be punished separately from the attempted aggravated fraud charge.</p>
