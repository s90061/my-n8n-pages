            <h1>Three Korean Influencers Explore Taichung's Charm; Tourist Buses Offer Foreign Language Services</h1>
            <p>Three well-known Korean internet personalities recently visited Taichung. They explored famous places and tried local foods. This was part of a plan by Taichung's tourism office to promote the city's unique charm in Korea. The city also worked with a bus company to help drivers and customer service staff speak better foreign languages for tourists.</p>
            <p>Taichung's tourism office said today that there are 16 flights every week between Taichung and Korea. There are 14 flights from Taichung to Incheon with Korean Air and T'way Air, and 2 flights from Taichung to Jeju with Tigerair Taiwan. Korea is a very important country for international visitors coming to Taichung. Jin Air will also start 14 new flights per week between Taichung and Incheon in the winter season this year.</p>
            <p>The tourism office recently went to Korea to share Taichung's special appeal. They worked with Tigerair Taiwan to invite three Korean internet influencers to deeply experience Taichung. They visited Fengjia Night Market, Dakeng Trails, Shen Ji New Village, the Sun Cake Museum, and hot spring resorts in Huilai Guguan. They also tasted delicious local food in Taichung.</p>
            <p>Chen Mei-hsiu, the head of the tourism office, said that on July 31st, bus route 555 started. This route makes it easy for travelers to go between the airport and the city. It connects "Taichung International Airport â€“ Wen-Hua Senior High School MRT Station â€“ City Hall Station â€“ Shin Kong Mitsukoshi/Far Eastern Department Store â€“ Liming Zhongke Road Intersection â€“ Taichung International Airport." This creates a fast and easy way to get to and from the airport. The buses have space for luggage, and visitors have given good feedback.</p>
            <p>The tourism office is helping bus companies improve the foreign language skills of their Taiwan Tourist Shuttle drivers and customer service staff. They are not only holding English classes and giving drivers and staff small phrasebooks, but also showing them simple and useful translation apps for their phones. This helps first-line service staff speak English, Korean, and other languages, offering good service to international visitors.</p>

            <h1>All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant War in Southern Taiwan: Hanshin's "Island" Kaohsiung Branch Books Out in Seconds</h1>
            <p>People love "all-you-can-eat" restaurants, and businesses are fighting to get customers. Hanshin Food & Beverage's all-you-can-eat restaurant "Island" opened its second branch in Kaohsiung. It is very popular; all tables for October were booked in minutes. Hanshin expects that bookings for November, which open in September, will also be taken very quickly.</p>
            <p>Hanshin Food & Beverage announced today that about 10,000 seats for "Island" until the end of September were booked online in 5 minutes. Bookings for October were taken in 2 minutes. The company will open bookings for November on September 1st.</p>
            <p>Hanshin Food & Beverage said that the "Island" Kaohsiung branch is expected to make 500 million New Taiwan dollars in sales this year. Lin Shu-ting, the chairman of Hanshin Food & Beverage, stated that the company will open more stores faster this year and next year. In December, they plan to change the Taoyuan TaiMall Harbor Buffet restaurant into the third "Island" branch. After that, they will open one more branch at Hanshin Zone Shopping Center in Taichung and another at Taipei Dome.</p>
            <p>The "Island" Kaohsiung branch is on the 8th floor of Hanshin Department Store. It has 350 seats in a 660-ping space. It competes directly with "Hanshin Harbor" all-you-can-eat restaurant, which is part of the same company. It also competes with other all-you-can-eat restaurants like "Xu Ji" at E-DA Outlet Mall and "Xiang Shi Tian Tang" from the Xiangbin Group.</p>
            <p>Hanshin Food & Beverage spent nearly 200 million New Taiwan dollars to build the "Island" Kaohsiung branch, which recently opened. Besides having drinks that go well with the food, each themed food station offers special dishes like a unique restaurant. They also use more ingredients from special farms, organic ingredients, and ingredients with tracking information.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kaohsiung branch works with many famous brands and stores. These include baking expert Wang Peng-chieh, Yifong Winter Melon Tea, Yuanlin's century-old grass jelly store, and special drinks from A-xiang, the owner of TCRC, one of Asia's top 50 bars. On weekend evenings, each person also gets half a lobster. Prices range from 1490 to 2090 New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Liu Zi-ming, the general manager of Hanshin Food & Beverage's Western dining brands, said that sales from their buffet brands alone make up nearly 40% of the group's total yearly sales. As time goes on, customers who visit all-you-can-eat restaurants care more about the quality of every small detail, from the ingredients and food to the environment and service.</p>
            <p>Also, "Xu Ji" at E-DA Outlet Mall, located on the 7th floor of E-DA Fashion Square A Building, has been very popular since it opened in 2021. It focuses on Japanese food, with 9 main sections including "Sheng Sheng (sashimi and seafood)," "Qiao Shou (made-to-order sushi)," and "Zhi Shao (teppanyaki)." Prices range from 1390 to 1990 New Taiwan dollars.</p>

            <h1>Lee Jae-myung Visits the US While Sending a Delegation to China, Showing Practical Diplomacy for Balance</h1>
            <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is visiting the United States and will meet with US President Donald Trump. At the same time, he has sent a special group to visit China. This is seen as a way to keep a good relationship between the US and China. It shows President Lee Jae-myung's government's idea of "practical diplomacy."</p>
            <p>On August 24th, Park Byeong-seok, a former speaker of South Korea's National Assembly, led a special group to Beijing. They met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Park Byeong-seok gave Wang Yi a letter from President Lee Jae-myung. The letter said that South Korea's new government cares a lot about its relationship with China and wants to make it better.</p>
            <p>Korean news has said that sending this special group means that while the alliance with the US is the main part of Korea's foreign policy, Korea also wants to tell China that it "will not ignore its relationship with China."</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported what Choi Jin-baek, a professor at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy, said. He noted that the South Korean government sending a special group to China at the same time President Lee Jae-myung visited the US seems to be a practical diplomatic move.</p>
            <p>China welcomed this and also sent a message to the US. For example, China talked about protecting the international free trade system and being against protectionism. They also stressed working together more within organizations like the United Nations. This was seen as a response to President Trump's tariffs (taxes on imported goods).</p>
            <p>However, the press releases from the Korean and Chinese foreign ministries about the special group's visit still show some differences in their views. China's foreign ministry press release mentioned that the special group said they respect the "one-China" policy. But it did not mention that Korea talked about the Provisional Measures Zone (PMZ) between the two countries.</p>
