US President Trump announced that if Russia does not agree to a ceasefire within 50 days, the US will put in place secondary tariffs. Trump has used "secondary tariffs" to mean "secondary sanctions." These sanctions would target countries that buy Russian energy. If this happens, China and India, the two biggest buyers, will be the most affected.

Trump said he was disappointed with Russian President Putin because he thought a ceasefire agreement would have been reached two months ago. He stated that if there is no agreement in 50 days, there will be 100% secondary tariffs. News reports clarify that Trump is likely referring to "secondary sanctions," which punish other countries for trading with a sanctioned country.

Because of worries about US secondary sanctions, most banks and financial groups worldwide now avoid trading with Russia or Iran. This is because they do not want to risk losing access to the US market. India and China are the top two buyers of cheap Russian oil. If Trump puts secondary sanctions on Russian oil, these two countries could be hit hardest.

**Taichung Fengyuan 5-Person Death Case: Gold Group Buying Leader Detained**

The Taichung District Prosecutors Office is investigating the death of a family of five in Fengyuan. Ms. Li, who led a gold group buying scheme, was previously released on NT$150,000 bail. Prosecutors arrested Ms. Li again based on new evidence. After questioning, the court decided early this morning to detain her and prevent her from seeing visitors, due to charges of fraud.

The Taichung District Court held a detention hearing last night. After reviewing the case, the court decided that there was enough reason to detain Ms. Li.

On July 2, a family of five was found dead in their home in Fengyuan. Police found no signs of murder. The investigation then shifted to fraud. The family had joined a gold group buying chat started by Ms. Li, who was introduced by their eldest daughter's classmate. The scheme promised commissions for buying gold with credit cards.

After a year, the family's debt was more than their commissions. In one deal, Ms. Li said the family had broken an agreement and demanded NT$5 million in compensation. She then took the family to a moneylender in Changhua, where they borrowed NT$2 million by mortgaging their house. The family later pawned their cars and motorcycles.
