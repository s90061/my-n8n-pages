            <h1>Australian Man Drinks on MRT, Man Advises Him, Both Get into Trouble</h1>
            <p>On September 17, an Australian man was drinking a beverage on the Taipei MRT. Another man, Mr. Ke, saw this and told him to stop. However, the Australian man showed Mr. Ke a rude hand gesture.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ke felt angry because of the rude gesture. He then took out a utility knife. Other passengers saw this and told the MRT staff. When the train stopped at Sanhe Junior High School Station, MRT security guards asked both men to get off the train. The police then took over.</p>
            <p>The police said that after asking them questions, the Australian man received a fine of NT$1,500 from the Taipei City Government. This was for breaking the "Mass Rapid Transit Act." Mr. Ke also received a fine of NT$10,000 for breaking the same law. In addition, because Mr. Ke showed a knife, the police sent his case to the prosecutor. He is accused of threatening someone, which is a crime.</p>

            <h1>French Prime Minister Seeks Agreement on Budget, Unions Call for "Black Thursday" Strike</h1>
            <p>Protests continue in France. Last week, people protested against the government. Now, major unions are calling for a strike tomorrow to protest the government's budget plan. They expect the strike to be bigger and cause more problems. At the same time, Prime Minister Lecornu is talking with main opposition parties. He is trying to find a common agreement for the budget plan.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Lecornu started his job last week and immediately showed he wanted to work with others. He announced that the government would not cancel two national holidays. He also said that former prime ministers and ministers would no longer get special lifelong benefits starting next year. He has also met with leaders from major unions to hear their ideas.</p>
            <p>However, eight large unions, including the CFDT, CGT, and FO, were not convinced. They are still calling for a big strike on September 18. They are protesting against the government's "harsh" budget plans. They also want fairer taxes and to stop the plan to change the retirement age to 64.</p>
            <p>Workers are unhappy with the budget plan proposed by the former Prime Minister, Francois Bayrou. This plan aimed to save 44 billion euros to reduce debt and also wanted to cancel two national holidays. Under pressure, Bayrou called for a vote of confidence in Parliament, but he lost. He then resigned as Prime Minister to President Emmanuel Macron. Macron then chose Lecornu to be the new Prime Minister. Lecornu's main job is to get the 2026 budget plan approved.</p>
            <p>Even though Bayrou has left his position, the changes in government have not stopped public anger. On September 10, people started a protest movement called "Bloquons Tout" (Block Everything) on social media. The Ministry of Interior estimated that almost 200,000 people took part across the country, and 473 people were arrested.</p>
            <p>Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau believes that tomorrow's strike will be bigger and more intense than last week's. He thinks thousands of people might use the chance to cause trouble and show hatred towards the police. He said on BFMTV that "early in the morning, some people might block things, cause damage, and there are also small groups of very violent far-left people who want to cause trouble."</p>
            <p>This strike will include more industries than last week. It is expected that up to 800,000 people might protest across the country. The government is getting more than 80,000 police and military personnel ready to keep things safe. They will also use drones, armored vehicles, and water cannons.</p>
            <p>In the greater Paris area, metro services are expected to be greatly affected. Trains will only run during busy times. The main unions of the French National Railway Company (SNCF) have also asked their members to strike and join the protests. This means train travel will likely be difficult.</p>
            <p>For air travel, air traffic controllers' unions have also called for a strike. They want their salaries to increase with inflation and better management in their industry.</p>
            <p>Pharmacists' unions are against the previous government's saving plan. One part of this plan would reduce the money they get from selling generic medicines. Because of this, they are calling for pharmacies to close tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Also, the French electricity company (EDF) has received a strike notice from unions. The strike will be from 9 PM tonight until 9 PM tomorrow. This means electricity supply might also be affected. The unions want higher salaries and lower energy taxes.</p>
            <p>Before this large social movement, Prime Minister Lecornu is meeting with important opposition parties. These include the left-wing Socialist Party (PS) and the far-right National Rally (RN). All leaders of the left-wing parties will talk with Lecornu, but the far-left "France Unbowed" (LFI) has refused his invitation.</p>
            <p>To get the budget plan approved, the support of the Socialist Party is very important. However, one of the conditions from the Socialist Party is to create a "Zucman tax." This tax would make very rich people, who have more than 100 million euros, pay at least 2% in tax. But the government does not support this idea, saying it relates to tax fairness issues.</p>

            <h1>Government to Approve Extension of Electric Vehicle Tax Exemptions Until End of 2030</h1>
            <p>The Executive Yuan will likely approve new rules for the "Commodity Tax Act" and "Vehicle License Tax Act" tomorrow. These new rules will extend the tax exemption for electric vehicles for another five years, until December 31, 2030. This change is expected to save people and businesses about NT$9.6 billion in taxes each year.</p>
            <p>Usually, these tax exemptions are extended for four years. But this time, the Ministry of Finance plans to extend them for five years, until the end of 2030. This is to help reach the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, making sure all policies work together.</p>
            <p>The main part of the new "Commodity Tax Act" rules (Article 12-3) is that the tax exemption for buying electric vehicles will be extended for five years, until December 31, 2030. Also, the rule that allowed the Executive Yuan to decide whether to extend the tax break will be removed.</p>
            <p>This means that if you buy an electric vehicle that runs only on electricity and register it, you will not have to pay commodity tax. However, for electric cars, the tax exemption is only for the first NT$1.4 million of the car's price after tax. If the car costs more than that, you will have to pay tax on the extra amount.</p>
            <p>For the "Vehicle License Tax Act" (Article 5), the new rules say that city and county governments can extend the exemption for electric vehicles for five years, until December 31, 2030.</p>
