            <h1>French Company's Chikungunya Vaccine Stopped by US Due to Bad Side Effects</h1>
            <p>A French medicine company named Valneva said today that the US FDA has stopped the approval for their Chikungunya vaccine, called Ixchiq. This happened because some people reported "serious bad events" after taking the vaccine.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Ixchiq is one of only two Chikungunya vaccines that the US FDA has allowed. Chikungunya is a disease that mosquitoes spread. It is usually found in warm, tropical places, but recently, it has been seen in many countries around the world.</p>
            <p>The US approved Ixchiq in 2023. But people reported side effects, which made officials look into it more, especially for older people using the vaccine. The European Medicines Agency also acted on this earlier this year.</p>
            <p>Valneva explained that on August 22nd, the US FDA stopped Ixchiq right away. They mentioned four new serious side effect cases. Three of these cases were in patients who were between 70 and 82 years old.</p>
            <p>Thomas Lingelbach, who is the CEO of Valneva, said in a statement: "The danger of Chikungunya is growing all over the world. Before we decide what to do next, Valneva will keep working hard to make sure our vaccine can be used to help global health."</p>
            <p>Experts in public health say that because of climate change, mosquitoes that carry Chikungunya are moving to new places. This means the disease could cause a big outbreak in the future. Chikungunya does not often kill people, but the risk of dying is higher for babies and older people.</p>
            <p>In July, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Chikungunya could have many cases. They asked for quick action to deal with it.</p>

            <h1>South Korea Helps US Ship Building with Its Strong Skills, Good for Talks with Washington</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, August 25) Today, the President of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, will meet with US President Trump for the first time. South Korea will use its excellent ability to build ships as a way to talk with the US government. This help will make the US shipbuilding industry strong again.</p>
            <p>The Korea Herald newspaper said that South Korea's ship-building industry is a special thing Seoul can use in talks about taxes with Washington. South Korea's great skill in building ships will help President Trump's plan to make the US shipbuilding industry great again.</p>
            <p>The newspaper reported that many people, who did not want to be named, said that South Korea's Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, Kim Jung-kwan, met with US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, in New York on July 25th. In that meeting, Mr. Kim suggested a plan called "Make American Shipbuilding Great Again (MASGA)." He also talked about a future where South Korea and the US work together on shipbuilding.</p>
            <p>Two large South Korean companies that build ships, HD Hyundai and Hanwha Group, are putting more money into the US. They are also working more closely with US companies that build ships.</p>
            <p>HD Hyundai is working with an American shipyard called Edison Chouest Offshore. They plan to build mid-sized cargo ships at this US shipyard by the year 2028.</p>
            <p>Last year, Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Group bought a shipyard in Philadelphia from Hanwha for 100 million US dollars (about 3 billion New Taiwan Dollars). This shipyard also got a deal to build the first LNG (liquid natural gas) transport ship in nearly 50 years that was ordered by the US and can be sold to other countries.</p>
            <p>A report from the think tank "Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)" in Washington in June of this year said that in 2024, South Korea was second in the world for new ship orders. They had 17% of the market. China was first with 71%.</p>
            <p>South Korea has big shipyards that can build more than 220 ships every year. They have been very good at building both ships for everyday business and ships for special purposes.</p>
            <p>One of the largest South Korean shipbuilding companies, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, can build 50 ships each year. It has already given more than 80 military ships, like destroyers and frigates, to the South Korean Navy. It also provides support ships to countries like the Philippines and New Zealand.</p>
            <p>Another big shipbuilding company, Hanwha Ocean, also gives military ships like destroyers, frigates, and smaller frigates to the South Korean Navy. Out of 24 military ships bought by the South Korean Navy, 17 were from Hanwha Ocean. Recently, Hanwha Ocean also made a deal with the US Seventh Fleet to fix support ships and ships that carry fuel.</p>
            <p>Also, South Korea keeps using new and smart technology. This includes making it simpler to share technology with the US. For example, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries is working with an American technology company called Palantir Technologies to make smart shipyards.</p>
            <p>This new plan uses a technology called "Digital Twins" in every part of building a ship, from drawing the first plans to making the final product. People think this will help the US shipbuilding industry become strong again.</p>
            <p>To explain, Digital Twins technology makes a virtual copy of a real product. It uses specific data from the shipyard to make ship designs and tests better. This happens from making computer models to trying out new designs.</p>
            <p>For making the ships, Digital Twin shipyards help workers do more by using materials better and making the building process easier. This can even help shipyards control their machines and work more exactly.</p>
            <p>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has signed an agreement with Huntington Ingalls Industries, which is the largest military shipyard in the US. They will work together to use automated systems, robots, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. This will help digital shipyards and make their use of advanced technology better.</p>
