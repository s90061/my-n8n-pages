Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 specialized colleges.
Earlier this year, Minister of Education Cheng Ying-yao stated at a meeting of university presidents that schools managed by China's United Front Work Department have specific goals and are not purely academic. He said it is necessary to stop working with them, and the Ministry of Education will no longer recognize degrees from these schools in the future.
The Ministry of Education officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University from the list. The Ministry explained that since 2019, Jinan University in mainland China has been managed by the United Front Work Department. To ensure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment and avoid specific political goals in their study places, Guangzhou Jinan University was taken off the approved list.
The Ministry of Education also said again that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, fair, and based on mutual benefit. Schools arranging student exchange trips to China should follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of activities, organizers, trip plans, and materials. Activities should not have political goals or content. Schools should also avoid accepting one-sided hospitality from China or helping with China's policies and political propaganda.
The Ministry also added that if schools are unsure about organizers or trip plans, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. The Ministry still hopes to help young students from both sides learn together and understand each other better. However, during exchanges, students should be aware of risks and pay attention to the background of organizers and if there are specific political goals.
