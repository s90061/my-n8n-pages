            <h1>Trump and Putin to Discuss Ukraine War; German Leader Expects Zelenskyy to Attend</h1>
            <p>US President Trump will meet with Russian President Putin on August 15 to talk about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. Germany's Chancellor Merz said today that Germany believes Ukrainian President Zelenskyy will be at this meeting.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Putin and Trump will meet in Alaska, USA. They will try to solve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has lasted over three years. Ukraine and Europe say that Kyiv must be part of the talks.</p>
            <p>Merz said in an interview with German TV channel ARD, "We hope and expect that the Ukrainian government, President Zelenskyy, will be part of this meeting."</p>
            <p>Merz told ARD that Berlin is working closely with Washington to make sure Zelenskyy attends the talks.</p>
            <p>He said, "We cannot accept that Russia and the United States talk about or even decide on land issues without including Europeans and Ukrainians. I believe the US government has the same opinion as us."</p>
            <p>Merz said he hopes these talks will lead to important progress towards a peaceful solution, or even a "breakthrough."</p>
            <p>He said, "We hope for a breakthrough on August 15. Most importantly, we hope for a ceasefire and peace talks in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine have had three rounds of talks this year, but they have not reached a ceasefire.</p>
