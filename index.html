Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing how people work and the skills needed for jobs. Companies are starting to use AI tools more often, which is affecting various industries. This shift means that employees need to learn new abilities to work alongside AI technologies. Businesses are investing in training programs to help their staff adapt, focusing on skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and understanding how to use AI programs effectively. While some worry about AI replacing jobs, experts believe that AI will mostly change existing roles, making them more efficient and creating new kinds of work. The future workplace will likely involve humans and AI working together, requiring continuous learning from the workforce.

**Popular Destinations Tackle Overtourism with New Rules**

Many of the world's most beautiful and famous travel destinations are facing a big problem: too many tourists. This issue, known as "overtourism," can damage local environments, strain resources, and make daily life difficult for residents. To protect their heritage and ensure a better experience for both visitors and locals, some places are introducing new rules. For example, Venice, Italy, a city famous for its canals, recently started charging a fee for day-trippers entering the historic center during peak times. This move aims to manage the number of visitors and encourage more respectful tourism. Other destinations are exploring similar ideas, like limiting tourist numbers, promoting off-season travel, or encouraging visitors to explore less-known areas. These efforts reflect a growing global trend towards more sustainable and responsible travel practices.

**Global Heatwaves Bring Daily Life Challenges and Spark Innovation**

Many regions around the world are currently experiencing extreme heatwaves, with temperatures reaching record highs. These intense periods of heat are becoming more frequent and severe, and scientists link them to climate change. The soaring temperatures have a significant impact on daily life, affecting people's health, agricultural productivity, and even city infrastructure. Hospitals report an increase in heat-related illnesses, and outdoor work becomes dangerous. In response, cities and communities are looking for innovative solutions to help residents cope. This includes setting up public cooling centers, advising people to stay indoors during the hottest hours, and implementing "green" infrastructure projects like planting more trees to provide shade and reduce urban heat. These challenges highlight the urgent need for both adaptation strategies and global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.`;
