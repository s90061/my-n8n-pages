            <h1>Death Row Inmate Hsiao Jen-chun Claims He Can Be Rehabilitated, Seeks Retrial; Supreme Court Rejects Appeal, Decision Final</h1>
            <p>The Constitutional Court said that the death penalty is allowed under certain conditions. Hsiao Jen-chun, who was sentenced to death for killing lawyer Chou Te-sheng, asked for a new trial. He said he could change and become a better person, so his punishment should be less. The High Court said no. Hsiao Jen-chun did not agree and asked a higher court to review it. The Supreme Court also said no, and the decision is final.</p>
            <p>There are now 36 people waiting for the death penalty, including Hsiao Jen-chun, who was sentenced in 2010. Last year, the Constitutional Court made a decision, number 113 Constitutional Judgment No. 8, saying the death penalty is okay if certain rules are followed. Hsiao Jen-chun used this decision as new evidence. In July this year, he asked the Taiwan High Court for a new trial and to stop his punishment.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Jen-chun said that because of the Constitutional Court's decision, his first sentence did not explain why he could not change. This is why he got the death penalty. He also said that he wrote letters to the victim's family during his trial. A pastor also said that Hsiao Jen-chun felt sorry for what he did. This shows he can change.</p>
            <p>The High Court looked at his request. They said Hsiao Jen-chun was only arguing about how severe his punishment was. He did not have enough new facts or evidence to prove that he could change and that his previous sentence was wrong. So, they said no to his request for a new trial.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Jen-chun did not agree with this decision and asked the Supreme Court to review it. The Supreme Court thought the High Court's decision was correct. They rejected his appeal, and the decision is now final.</p>

            <h1>To Prevent Too Many Lawsuits in Schools, Principals' Association: Can Look at Japan's School Lawyer Plan</h1>
            <p>Teacher's Day is coming soon. Recently, groups of teachers have spoken out. They want the government to deal with too many complaints and lawsuits in schools. The Principals' Association today released a statement. They suggest changing the law so that people who complain must give their names. They also suggest looking at Japan's idea of having "school lawyers," which means special trained people would handle investigations.</p>
            <p>Teacher groups think that all complaints from students and parents, big or small, are sent to school meetings for investigation. This makes teachers very tired and uses up a lot of school resources. Yesterday, the Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said in a press release that they will change how things are done. They want to meet the needs of schools and help teachers grow in their jobs.</p>
            <p>Many teacher groups said that some principals might use these school meeting rules to get rid of people they don't like. Today, the Taiwan Association of Junior and Senior High School Principals released a press statement. They repeated that school meetings are made up of parents, school staff, teacher representatives, and experts. So, a principal cannot control everything alone.</p>
            <p>However, the Principals' Association also agreed that the school meeting system has indeed given school staff much more work and stress. They suggest changing the law. This would allow schools to do a quick check after receiving a complaint. Then, they can decide if they should deal with it or try to solve it by talking to parents and teachers.</p>
            <p>The Principals' Association also suggests that if a complaint does not have clear facts, or if the person making the complaint cannot be found, the school should not deal with it. This way, people who complain would always need to give their names.</p>
            <p>Also, the Principals' Association suggests looking at Japan's school lawyer plan. This would mean that the people in school meetings are from professional groups. After these professional groups investigate and review cases, they would send them back to the teacher evaluation committee. This committee would then decide if a teacher should be stopped from teaching, fired, or not hired again.</p>
            <p>The National Education Action Alliance also released a press statement. They suggested three ways to reduce administrative work. For the problem of too many lawsuits in schools, the alliance suggests creating different levels for complaints and setting rules for when to accept them. First, they can use talks and discussions. They can also use a standard list of evidence and ways to reply.</p>
            <p>The alliance also suggests paying homeroom teachers more and increasing extra pay for guidance roles. This is because teachers now have more work in managing classes, talking with parents, and helping students with their studies. This would give teachers more emotional support and help them work better with parents.</p>
            <p>Regarding the issue of "too many lawsuits in schools," Cheng Ying-yao said publicly before that they are planning to limit anonymous complaints. He also promised to add more professional staff each year so that teachers can focus on teaching.</p>
