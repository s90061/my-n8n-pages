            <h1>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy Wants High-Level Talks on Security Guarantees Next Week</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy asked other countries today to quickly start high-level talks about security for Ukraine. At the same time, defense ministers from EU countries promised to train Ukrainian soldiers in Ukraine if there is a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>Kyiv is working on diplomatic plans to end the war with Russia, which is now in its fourth year. Ukraine also wants partner countries to promise to protect it from any future attacks.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said he expects to meet with European leaders next week. He wants them to promise to protect Ukraine, similar to how NATO protects its members. He also said that US President Donald Trump should be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>He said, "We need to make this plan clear to everyone," and that he wants to tell Trump "our ideas."</p>
            <p>Even though Trump met with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders separately this month, diplomatic efforts to stop Russia's full invasion have not been very successful yet.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also mentioned a deadline set by Trump. Trump recently said he would decide on new actions against Russia if Russian President Vladimir Putin did not agree to a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Kaja Kallas, a top EU official for foreign affairs and security, said that EU defense ministers met in Copenhagen today. They generally agreed to train Ukrainian soldiers inside Ukraine as part of the EU's military training plan.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Trump seemed more willing to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. He said that Europe must do more to help keep Ukraine safe.</p>
            <p>Kallas wrote on X (a social media platform): "The EU has already trained more than 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers. We must be ready to do even more."</p>
            <p>Russia has always been against any NATO soldiers being in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said he hopes that parliaments in allied countries will approve security guarantees. He talked about an agreement from 1994 where Kyiv gave up its nuclear weapons for security guarantees. He said this was not enough to stop Russia. He stated, "We want security guarantees that are legally binding. We do not want another Budapest Memorandum."</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien Chen Loses to Danish Star Antonsen, Misses Badminton World Championships Semi-finals</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's top badminton player, Chou Tien Chen, played against Danish star Anders Antonsen in the men's singles quarter-finals at the BWF World Badminton Championships in France today. Chou unfortunately lost with scores of 17-21, 21-23, missing his chance to reach the semi-finals.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien Chen won a bronze medal at the World Championships in 2022. Even at 35 years old, he is still a strong player in world badminton, ranking 6th globally. He was Taiwan's last hope in singles at these championships. Today, in the men's singles quarter-finals, he challenged Anders Antonsen, who is ranked 2nd in the world. They are familiar opponents; Chou had won 8 out of their 13 previous matches, but he has lost more often in their recent games.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first game, both players used careful strategies. Many points required long rallies, which tested their physical fitness. Chou showed his excellent defense and had a 2-point lead at the mid-game break. However, in the second half of the game, he couldn't stop Antonsen's strong attacks. Chou also made a serving mistake at an important moment, which led to him losing the game 17-21.</p>
            <p>Facing a critical situation, Chou Tien Chen kept fighting hard against Antonsen at the beginning of the second game. But after the mid-game break, Chou suddenly scored 5 points in a row, giving him a 6-point lead. Yet, he then lost several points in a row and almost lost his lead. Luckily, he still managed to get three game points. However, Antonsen saved all of them. In the end, Chou hit the shuttlecock into the net, losing the game closely with a score of 21-23. He was unable to reach the men's singles semi-finals.</p>
