**Chinese Tugboat Enters Taiwanese Waters Unchallenged**

A large Chinese tugboat named "Lianhe Haigong 5001" has entered Taiwan's territorial waters. According to reports, no authorities tried to stop the vessel. An organization called Taiwan ADIZ, which monitors the area, issued a warning about the boat's presence. The reason for the tugboat's entry is not clear, which has caused concern. There is a worry that it might be involved in "gray zone" activities, such as damaging underwater communication cables or carrying military equipment. The organization is urging for the boat to be closely watched and intercepted to determine its purpose.
