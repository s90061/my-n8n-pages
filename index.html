            <h1>AI Future Looks Good, Antitrust Case Won; Alphabet Now Worth 3 Trillion US Dollars</h1>
            <p>On September 15, Google's parent company, Alphabet, reached a market value of 3 trillion US dollars for the first time. This happened because people are positive about artificial intelligence (AI) again, and a judge made a decision that was good for the company in an antitrust case.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Alphabet's A shares went up by 3.6% to 249.1 US dollars. Its C shares also went up by 3.4% to 249.5 US dollars. Both of these prices are new high points for the company.</p>
            <p>With today's increase, Alphabet's stock price has gone up by more than 32% this year. This makes it the best-performing stock among the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies in the US. Its growth is much higher than the S&P 500 index, which has grown by 12.5%.</p>
            <p>Alphabet has joined big technology companies like Apple and Microsoft that are worth 3 trillion US dollars. Nvidia, the world's most valuable company for AI chips, is worth 4.25 trillion US dollars.</p>
            <p>The newest good news for Alphabet came from a US court decision. This decision allows Alphabet to continue controlling its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system. This was a very important moment for Alphabet because its strong position in search and mobile systems has been watched closely for a long time.</p>
            <p>The court said that even though sharing data would help Google's advertising rivals, Google does not need to separate Chrome or Android. This removes a big worry for investors, who believed these two businesses were key parts of Google's entire operation.</p>
            <p>Alphabet's cloud computing business had a good second quarter, with sales growing by almost 32%. This was more than what experts expected. This happened because the company's investments in its own chips and the Gemini AI model started to work well. This also made investors more confident.</p>

            <h1>Swedish Pole Vault Star Duplantis Wins Gold at World Championships, Sets New World Record</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, September 15 â€“ The World Athletics Championships continued today in Tokyo, Japan. Armand Duplantis, the famous Swedish pole vaulter, won a gold medal in the men's pole vault final. He jumped 6.30 meters, setting a new world record.</p>
            <p>News agencies like Reuters reported that Duplantis had already won the gold medal after successfully jumping 6.15 meters. However, he then asked for the bar to be moved up by 15 centimeters. On his third try, he jumped over 6.30 meters. This broke his own world record of 6.29 meters, which he set last month in Budapest.</p>
            <p>Duplantis not only won the men's pole vault gold medal at the World Athletics Championships again, making it his third win in a row, but he also broke the world record for the 14th time in his career. He had also won gold medals in pole vault at the Olympic Games in Paris and Tokyo.</p>
            <p>Emmanouil Karalis from Greece won the silver medal with a jump of 6 meters. Kurtis Marschall from Australia won the bronze medal with a jump of 5.95 meters.</p>
