            <h1>Train Station Employee Collapses and Dies During Work, TRA Helps Family</h1>
            <p>A worker at the Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) Jioucyutang Power Substation suddenly collapsed and died yesterday while checking train tracks. TRA announced today that General Manager Feng Hui-sheng has asked the head of the Electrical Department, Cheng Kuo-hsi, to visit the family. The Tainan Power Section has also started a special team to help the family with everything they need.</p>
            <p>TRA explained in a message that yesterday afternoon, around 1 PM, the Jioucyutang Power Substation received a report from Xishi Station. The report said a balloon was stuck on a part of the electric lines at the 30K+100 mark on the Pingtung Line. A team of three workers from the substation drove to the tracks near Linluo Station at about 2:15 PM and then walked along the tracks to check them.</p>
            <p>TRA said that around 2:30 PM yesterday, about 300 meters south of Linluo Station, a worker named Chen suddenly fainted. It was not because of electric shock. The other workers with him immediately called 119 (emergency services) and started giving him CPR. The 119 team arrived and took him to the hospital, but he did not survive.</p>
            <p>TRA stated that General Manager Feng Hui-sheng has asked Cheng Kuo-hsi, the head of the Electrical Department, to go and comfort the family. He also asked the Tainan Power Section to quickly form a care team. This team will continue to comfort the family and help them with anything they need.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Man Holds Temple Employee Hostage with Knife, Police Rescue Her</h1>
            <p>A 40-year-old man named Wu recently used a knife to enter Baoyun Temple in Taichung. He took a female employee hostage. He was reportedly upset about a past disagreement. He demanded that legal officials come to the scene. The police arrived after being called. During the incident, detective team leader Tu Chih-hung quickly took the knife from Wu. Police then moved in to stop him and sent him to the police station. After questioning, the prosecutor asked to keep him in custody, and this request was approved.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department said today that they received a call around 7 PM on July 31. The call was about a man with a knife entering the Fagu Mountain Baoyun Temple on Shizheng Road in Xitun District and holding an employee. Many police officers were immediately sent to the location.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they found that the 40-year-old Mr. Wu had entered the temple office. He was very emotional and was holding a female employee hostage with a fruit knife. He was also waving the knife as if to attack. The police quickly blocked all entrances and exits and told people to leave the area. They used police guns, batons, and pepper spray to surround Mr. Wu.</p>
            <p>Police investigations found that Mr. Wu was likely angry for a long time because of an unresolved problem he had with the temple before. Thatâ€™s why he took this chance to attack. He demanded that "legal officials come here so I can explain clearly." As the police tried to talk to him, he became more agitated and held the knife tightly. The person he was holding was very scared and did not move at all.</p>
            <p>Officers saw that the situation was not changing. They pretended to agree with Mr. Wu's demands. Tu Chih-hung helped connect Wu with the Taichung District Prosecutors Office. He asked a prosecutor to talk to Mr. Wu on a video call. During the conversation, Tu Chih-hung tried to calm Mr. Wu while slowly moving closer. Then, he quickly moved forward to take the knife. He grabbed and held Mr. Wu. Other police officers then came to help stop Mr. Wu and rescue the hostage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu was taken back to the police station for investigation. After being questioned by the police, he was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office. He was charged with crimes like interfering with freedom and making threats. After more questioning, the prosecutor asked for him to be kept in custody, and this was approved.</p>
