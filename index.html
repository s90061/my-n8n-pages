            <h1>Suspect in Conservative Influencer Kirk's Killing Arrested, Will Be Charged Next Week</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old man named Tyler Robinson has been arrested. He is expected to be officially charged next week with serious crimes, including murder. This comes after Charlie Kirk, an American conservative internet celebrity, was shot and killed at an event in Utah.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Kirk was shot by a sniper on September 10 while he was giving a speech at Utah Valley University. After the shooting, local and federal police worked hard to find the suspect.</p>
            <p>Kirk was an important friend of former U.S. President Donald Trump. He was also a famous internet personality and a leader in the movement for young conservatives. He had millions of followers on social media. People liked him because his videos were smart and well-edited. He was also good at answering people who argued with him or had different political ideas.</p>
            <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced the arrest at a press conference today, saying, "We caught him."</p>
            <p>Kash Patel, the Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), told reporters that the suspect is Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old man from Utah. He was caught last night, about 33 hours after the shooting. By this morning, the FBI had received more than 11,000 tips. This is the most tips they have received since the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.</p>
            <p>Governor Cox said that a relative and a family friend of Robinson told the local police that he had told them, or "hinted," that he committed the crime. This information helped the police arrest Robinson.</p>
            <p>Governor Cox did not want to talk about why Robinson might have killed Kirk. However, he mentioned that investigators found a bullet casing at the scene with "Hey, Fascist! Take this!" written on it.</p>
            <p>According to court papers for the arrest warrant, the bullet that killed Kirk had an internet joke, called a "meme," about online role-playing games.</p>
            <p>More details about Robinson's life started to appear today. Governor Cox said that Robinson had lived with his family for many years in Washington County, which is in the southwest part of Utah, near the borders of Arizona and Nevada.</p>
            <p>NBC News searched state and federal records using Robinson's name and birth date. They did not find any criminal record for him. He is a registered voter, but he does not belong to any political party.</p>
            <p>At the time of the shooting, he was a third-year student in an electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, which is part of Utah's public university system. Before this, he received a four-year scholarship to Utah State University, but he only studied there for one semester.</p>
            <p>A neighbor named Steven Green said he knew Robinson's family because they went to the same Mormon church.</p>
            <p>Governor Cox said that a family member interviewed by investigators stated that Robinson had become more interested in politics in recent years. This family member also said Robinson told another relative that he did not like Kirk or his ideas.</p>
            <p>Based on the papers submitted by investigators, Robinson was arrested for aggravated murder, using a firearm to cause serious injury, and stopping justice. Governor Cox said he is currently in the Utah County Jail and will be officially charged early next week.</p>

            <h1>Minister of Culture Li Yuan Returns as a Writer in Czech Republic</h1>
            <p>Li Yuan, who has been Taiwan's Minister of Culture for 480 days, spoke as a writer for the first time in the Czech Republic. When asked how he would introduce Taiwan if he were the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Li Yuan said that Taiwan and the Czech Republic both experienced times of dictatorship and suppression of language. He hoped this shared history would create a feeling of sympathy from the Czech people.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 12, Li Yuan took part in a literary discussion called "Scenery in Words: Where Taiwanese Stories Flow." Other participants were writer Chen Sihong, who lives in Germany, Dr. Táňa Dluhošová, the head of the Institute of Asian and African Studies at the Czech Academy of Sciences, and Czech writer Kateřina Tučková. The event was held at the Havel Library. They had to add more chairs, and the audience grew from 40 to over 100 people. Less than 20% of the audience were readers from Taiwan. This showed that the Czech literary world is very curious about and interested in Taiwanese literature.</p>
            <p>Petr Vizina, a well-known cultural figure from the Czech Republic, was the host. When he introduced Li Yuan, the Taiwanese people in the audience cheered loudly. Vizina was surprised, saying that in the Czech Republic, people would never react so warmly to a politician because "no one likes politicians." Li Yuan joked that during his time as a minister, he learned "not to tell the truth" and "to speak without saying anything." This made the audience laugh.</p>
            <p>During the discussion, Vizina asked Li Yuan how he would introduce Taiwan if he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Li Yuan jokingly replied that he would first mention that Taiwan and the Czech Republic both went through dictatorship and had their languages suppressed. He said their history and destiny are similar to the Czech Republic's and that he would "hope to gain the Czech Republic's sympathy."</p>
            <p>Li Yuan stated he would help the Czech Republic understand Taiwan through movies, literature, and art. He said Taiwan has been affected by major cultures from the West, Japan, and China, which has made it what it is today. He believes Taiwan is already very different from China. He added, "From a cultural point of view, China is actually a part of Taiwan. Taiwan and China have never been together since the Ice Age. The above is what a Minister of Foreign Affairs would say." This showed his humorous side.</p>
            <p>Some readers in the audience also asked a question about the artifacts in the National Palace Museum. Some people say these items do not belong to Taiwan. Li Yuan answered that culture is not something that stays the same forever. He explained that over 50 or 100 years, one side (China) still follows the old ideas of kings and authoritarian rule in Chinese culture. But on a democratic and free island (Taiwan), people look at these artifacts with their own special understanding. He said, "These two cultures are now completely different."</p>
            <p>Li Yuan said that China uses Chinese culture as a tool. In the past, they changed traditional Chinese characters to simpler ones and destroyed old buildings, damaging Chinese culture. He added, "Now they suddenly say that Chinese culture belongs to them. I have never understood this."</p>
            <p>Today, Li Yuan will go to the Moravian Library in Brno to sign an agreement to work together. He will also visit historical underground water storage buildings in the Czech Republic. This is the last stop on his trip to Europe.</p>

            <h1>New Reforestation Plan: 6 Years, NT$200,000 for First Year</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency has changed its rules for giving money to encourage tree planting. The old rule was to give money for 20 years. Now, this period has been shortened to 6 years. For every hectare of land planted with trees, people will get NT$200,000 in the first year. After that, they will get NT$60,000 each year for the next five years. Over 6 years, the most money someone can receive is NT$600,000 per hectare.</p>
            <p>The Taitung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency has been holding many meetings with forest farmers. They are sharing information about the new forest policies and rules. On September 11 and 12, they held meetings to explain the new "Reforestation Incentive 2.0" plan, which got a lot of attention from the public.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taitung Branch announced the main points of the newly updated "Regulations for Encouraging and Guiding Reforestation." These points include: a shorter time period, more money for incentives, more choices, and more flexible ways to manage the land.</p>
            <p>The Taitung Branch explained that the old program gave money for 20 years. The new program shortens this to 6 years. For each hectare, the incentive is NT$200,000 in the first year. For years 2 to 6, it is NT$60,000 each year. In the 6th year, there is also an extra NT$50,000 for forests that have grown well, and another NT$50,000 for wood that can be used for building. This means that over 6 years, a person can receive up to NT$600,000.</p>
            <p>The deadline to apply for 2025 is December 31. For 2026 and later years, applications can be submitted from January 1 to April 30 each year. The smallest area of land you can apply for is 0.1 hectare for land on a slope and 0.3 hectare for flat land. The land must be one complete area and not spread out in different places.</p>
