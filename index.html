            <h1>Parliament Checks Child Care Law: All Parties Support Government's "Monitoring Cloud" System</h1>
            <p>The Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee of the Legislative Yuan looked at a draft law called the "Child Care Services Act" today. Both ruling and opposition lawmakers agree with the government's idea for the "Monitoring Cloud" system. This system would require child care centers to install cameras and send the video recordings to a central system. However, they still need to agree on how many days the data should be kept and if the central government should help local governments pay for the system. They will discuss these points later.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee continued to review the draft Child Care Services Act article by article today. Lu Chien-te, the Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, and Chou Dao-chun, the acting director of the Social and Family Affairs Administration, were present.</p>
            <p>The New Power Party, Taiwan Statebuilding Party, Taiwan Green Party, and Obasan Alliance for Minor Parties and Human Rights held a press conference this morning. They said that the most important change needed is the "Monitoring Cloud." All child care centers must have cameras. This is not for watching them all the time, but to keep evidence safe. They asked lawmakers from all parties to support this change in the law so that facts can be saved.</p>
            <p>Article 30 of the government's draft Child Care Services Act says that to keep children safe and to save evidence, child care centers must install video recording equipment. The video and audio data must be kept for at least 30 days. This data should also be sent to an online system set up by the local government. The central government should help local governments pay for setting up this online system.</p>
            <p>During the review of each article, Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Wang Yu-min said this is a very important part of the law. She noted that many child care centers do not like it. Child care centers feel that they are seen as people who will always make mistakes, so they need strict rules. They also worry that they might not have enough time to get the cameras ready. They are also concerned about whether the government will offer help.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min said that because the rights of young children are involved, child care centers, the central government, and local governments all have responsibilities. She supports the government's draft law because it is balanced and includes ideas from all sides. She also said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare should talk to the child care providers so they understand that the policy is meant to be helpful.</p>
            <p>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Chang Ya-lin said that if something happens, evidence can show what happened. Schools and parents can get the evidence. If there is bad treatment, it can help make clear what happened. She supports the government's version of the article. DPP lawmaker Wang Cheng-hsu said he also tends to support the government's version. However, he suggested that videos should be kept for at least 3 months, as "30 days is indeed a bit short."</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Lin Shu-fen said that after the law about how money is shared between the central and local governments changes, the central government will give over NT$370 billion to local governments. She questioned if there would be enough money if the central government "must" help local governments build the system. Taiwan People's Party (TPP) lawmaker Chen Chao-tzu was concerned about the security standards for the videos and how to stop them from being leaked or used wrongly. She said, "Basically, the government's direction is correct."</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te said that everyone in society cares a lot about the "Monitoring Cloud." He said the Ministry of Health and Welfare will follow the principle of the "best interests of the child" from the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). They will try to find the best solution for children, parents, and child care centers. He asked everyone to relax, explaining that this system is for keeping evidence safe and also for protecting child care workers from being wrongly accused. He added that the central government has limited money and asked if "should" help local governments build the system could be changed to "can" help.</p>
            <p>Chou Dao-chun said that when child care centers upload videos to the system, it is like backing them up to the cloud. He said, "We are not doing online monitoring or using technology to enforce laws." The videos will only be used to understand what happened if there is a big problem and evidence needs to be saved. Also, getting access to the videos needs permission. It's not like anyone can watch them anytime without a reason or limits. He noted that child care workers are worried about their privacy, and more communication will happen after the law is passed.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min said that the government's first draft was the best version. She added that local governments are supposed to do the work, so "one side pays, and one side works, which is very fair." Lu Chien-te said that after the law about sharing money is changed, the central government will have big money problems. He said setting up the system would cost about NT$200 million. The central government has its own difficulties, but it will respect the Legislative Yuan's decision.</p>
            <p>In the end, because there was no agreement, Wang Cheng-hsu, who was leading the meeting, said that all the proposals and related decisions would be saved for later discussion.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Hong En Hospital's Longan Branch Incident: Control Yuan Asks 3 Agencies to Review</h1>
            <p>The Control Yuan said today that at Taichung Hong En Hospital's Longan Branch, a patient may have been sexually assaulted. The hospital did not report it right away as the law says. Also, a nursing assistant named Lin hurt a person who was under guardianship. Because of these events, the Control Yuan has asked the Taichung City Government, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of Justice to review and make improvements. They also asked the Executive Yuan to work harder on guardianship measures that offer different types of care and on systems to prevent cruel treatment.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan said in a press release that Control Yuan members Wang You-ling and Chi Hui-jung pointed out that in June 2022, the Longan Branch knew that a female patient (Patient A) might have been sexually assaulted by a male patient at the same hospital. However, the hospital did not save evidence immediately or report it. They only separated the people involved and talked to the family. They thought it was consensual because the female patient's physical condition seemed better. Later, Patient A reported it herself to the 113 protection hotline. But because almost half a year had passed, there was not enough evidence, so the prosecutor decided not to charge anyone.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan members said that after Patient A reported it, the Taichung City Government sent people to investigate and reported the case to the police. However, the city government did not check if the Longan Branch had failed its duty to report. Also, from 2022 to 2024, the hospital still received good ratings in its mental health care reviews. This shows that the city government did not properly supervise the hospital.</p>
            <p>About the nursing assistant named Lin who hurt a man named Yang who was under guardianship: The Control Yuan's investigation showed that Mr. Yang was sent to the Longan Branch by the Changhua District Prosecutors Office for guardianship. The assistant, Lin, was hired by the Longan Branch to help in the wards. However, Lin did not get proper training or a check for security management. Lin also had a history of hurting people and an angry personality. When working, Lin would threaten, punch, and kick Mr. Yang. Even though the Changhua District Prosecutors Office visited monthly and had a way to talk with the Longan Branch, they could not stop or quickly deal with the violence.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan members said that the Law on the Enforcement of Security Measures clearly states that there should be suitable places for different types of guardianship cases. These places should follow rules like "different levels and paths," "different kinds of treatment," "moving between places," "regular checks," and "ways to transfer care." This means that people under guardianship should get different help depending on their situation. However, even though the law was changed more than four years ago, only some special psychiatric wards in courts have started. Other special psychiatric hospitals, mental recovery centers, mental health nursing homes, and places for people with disabilities are still being planned. This means that local prosecutor's offices still have trouble finding places for people under guardianship.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan members asked the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to look at how things are working now. They should consider including mental health hospitals and places where security measures are carried out in a "system to prevent cruel treatment." This would involve regular, irregular, and systematic visits to check all rules and create ways to prevent patients and people under guardianship from suffering bad treatment. Also, the "Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment" has not yet become part of Taiwan's laws. The Control Yuan said the Executive Yuan should work faster to make this law.</p>

            <h1>Illegal Hotels Face Fines Up to NT$2 Million; Travelers Should Check Legality Before Staying</h1>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said today that illegal hotels can be fined up to NT$2 million (about US$62,000) by law. They ask people to use the Taiwan Travel Accommodation website to check if a hotel is legal when booking rooms by phone or through online travel agencies (OTAs).</p>
            <p>In August this year, an event happened in Jiufen, Ruifang District, New Taipei City. People complained that their bookings for guesthouses were suddenly canceled, and prices were raised. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration said in a press release today that if a hotel or guesthouse is found to be operating illegally, it will be fined up to NT$2 million according to the Tourism Development Act and forced to close down.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that to protect legal businesses and stop illegal ones, they created the "Taiwan Travel Accommodation" website in 2020. This platform is managed by the government and lists all legal hotels and guesthouses in Taiwan. This helps travelers choose safely and avoid problems.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that for the Jiufen incident in New Taipei, they have asked the local government to inspect and fine those breaking the rules. This is to show how important it is for hotels and guesthouses to be legal.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that since they started the "Hao Ke B&B" (Friendly B&B) brand in 2011, almost 1,900 high-quality "Hao Ke B&Bs" have been chosen across Taiwan. All selected B&Bs meet the 6 main ideas of the brand: "friendly, kind, clean, hygienic, safe, and cultured." These B&Bs are excellent examples for places to stay when traveling in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that to fight against illegal hotels and guesthouses and prevent bad experiences for travelers, the Tourism Development Act was changed and started in April this year. The law now has stronger penalties for illegal hotels, with a maximum fine of NT$2 million. Also, for those who illegally operate and advertise their services, the fine has also been increased to NT$1.5 million.</p>
