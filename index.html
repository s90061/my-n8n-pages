            <h1>China Controls Rare Earth Exports; EU and G7 Work Together on a Solution</h1>
            <p>(Brussels, October 14, Central News Agency) Maros Sefcovic, the EU Commissioner for Trade, said today that the European Union (EU) is working with the Group of Seven (G7) countries. They are planning how to deal with China's "unfair" rules on rare earth exports.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, China announced new rules last week for exporting rare earth technology. China makes most of the world's rare earths. These are important minerals used to make special magnets for cars, electronics, and defense.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sefcovic said, "These rules have made some EU companies stop making products. This causes real economic problems. This is not about safety or stopping the spread of weapons. It is directly about normal industries."</p>
            <p>After meeting with EU ministers in Denmark, Mr. Sefcovic told the media, "So, we cannot just do nothing. We must act together."</p>
            <p>He also said, "I am talking closely with G7 countries. I am also talking with China to find a solution." He added that he plans to speak with high-level Chinese officials next week.</p>
            <p>After China put these rare earth rules in place, US President Donald Trump said on October 10 that he would add an extra 100% tax on Chinese goods.</p>
            <p>Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the Foreign Minister of Denmark, warned at a press conference with Mr. Sefcovic, "More trade problems between the US and China are bad news. This will make global trade weaker again, and Europe will also be affected."</p>

            <h1>IMF Report: Taiwan's Economy Expected to Grow 3.7% in 2025</h1>
            <p>(Washington, October 14, Central News Agency) The International Monetary Fund (IMF) today raised its prediction for Taiwan's economic growth in 2025 to 3.7%. Also, the IMF raised its prediction for global economic growth this year. This is because taxes did not hurt as much as expected, and money situations were not as bad as first thought.</p>
            <p>In its newest "World Economic Outlook" report, the IMF thinks Taiwan's economy, measured by real GDP, will grow by 3.7% this year. This is higher than the 2.9% it predicted in April. For 2026, the IMF lowered its prediction from 2.5% in April to 2.1%.</p>
            <p>The report also predicts that prices for consumers in Taiwan will go up by 1.7% this year. This is a bit lower than the 1.8% predicted in the April report. For next year, consumer prices are expected to go up by 1.6%, which is the same as the April report.</p>
            <p>For unemployment, the IMF expects Taiwan's unemployment rate to stay at 3.4% for both this year and next year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the IMF also said in its new report that the US recently made trade deals with some big economies. This stopped President Donald Trump's original threats of large taxes from happening. Also, other countries did not fight back much. Because of this, the IMF has raised its global growth prediction for the second time since April.</p>
            <p>The IMF now predicts that the world's real GDP will grow by 3.2% in 2025. This is higher than the 3.0% predicted in July and better than the 2.8% predicted in April. The IMF still expects global economic growth to be 3.1% in 2026, which is the same as its July prediction.</p>
            <p>However, the IMF also warned that if Trump starts a trade war with China again, it could slow down the world's economy a lot.</p>
            <p>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist for the IMF, said that taxes were lower than expected. Also, the world economy benefited from companies being smart and changing their plans. They bought things earlier and quickly changed their supply chains. Financial support from Europe and China, a weaker US dollar, and a lot of investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) also helped.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gourinchas said, "Overall, the situation is not as bad as we feared. But it is worse than we thought a year ago, and not as good as we need."</p>
            <p>Based on the IMF's main prediction, the US economy is still strong. Its growth rate for 2025 is expected to be 2.0%. This is a little higher than the 1.9% predicted in July. For 2026, US GDP growth is expected to be 2.1%. This is also a bit higher than in July, but still lower than the 2.8% in 2024.</p>
            <p>The prediction for the Euro area's growth also went up a little, from 1.0% in July to 1.2%. This is mainly because Germany is increasing its spending, and Spain continues to show strong activity.</p>
            <p>Japan's predicted growth rate for 2025 greatly increased to 1.1%, which is higher than the 0.7% predicted in July. Its growth rate for 2026 is expected to go down to 0.6%, but this is still 0.1% higher than the July prediction.</p>
            <p>The IMF's prediction for China's growth stayed the same. It expects 4.8% growth in 2025 due to more exports, but it said this might not last. For 2026, the expected growth rate is 4.2%.</p>
