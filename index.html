            <h1>Fortune's Global 100 Business People: Jensen Huang Replaces Elon Musk as #1</h1>
            <p>The American "Fortune magazine" recently shared its list of the world's 100 most powerful business people. Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, moved past Elon Musk, who was number one last year, to take the top spot. Lisa Su, the CEO of AMD, and C.C. Wei, the chairman of TSMC, are also on the list.</p>
            <p>This is the second time "Fortune magazine" has published its list of the 100 most influential business people. The list includes 28 industries worldwide, such as finance, technology, retail, and cars. Nineteen women are on the list. These include Julie Sweet (11th place), the CEO of Accenture; Jane Fraser (12th place), the CEO of Citigroup; Lisa Su (14th place), the Chairwoman and CEO of AMD; and Ana Patricia Botin (20th place), the President of Banco Santander.</p>
            <p>This year, the top ten most influential business people on Fortune's list are, in order: Jensen Huang, Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft), Mark Zuckerberg (CEO of tech giant Meta), Elon Musk (CEO of electric car company Tesla), Wang Chuanfu (President of BYD), Sundar Pichai (CEO of Alphabet), Ren Zhengfei (founder of Huawei), Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI, which made ChatGPT), Jamie Dimon (CEO of JPMorgan Chase), and Mary Barra (CEO of General Motors).</p>
            <p>Under Jensen Huang's leadership, Nvidia has greatly benefited from the high demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) chips. It became the first company to be worth over 4 trillion US dollars. This important event shows how vital Nvidia is in the fast growth of generative AI.</p>
            <p>Nvidia does have other companies trying to compete with it. But, as "Fortune" said, "Right now, no company can truly threaten Nvidia's leading position."</p>
            <p>C.C. Wei, the chairman and president of TSMC, is ranked 40th.</p>

            <h1>Trump Signs Executive Order to Add 25% Tariffs on India, Effective from the 27th</h1>
            <p>US President Trump signed an executive order today. It states that because India buys Russian oil directly or indirectly, the US will add another 25% tariff on Indian goods. With the earlier 25% tariff, goods from India entering the US will face a total tariff of up to 50%. The new tariffs will start on August 27th.</p>
            <p>Trump said yesterday, "We put a 25% tariff on India, but I think I will greatly increase it in the next 24 hours because they are buying Russian oil."</p>
            <p>Trump then signed an executive order today. It says that because India buys Russian oil directly or indirectly, the US will add a 25% tariff on goods imported from India. This is in addition to the 25% tariff announced earlier, which was expected to start on August 7th. So, goods from India going to the US will now face tariffs as high as 50%.</p>
            <p>The White House released a fact sheet saying that the extra 25% tariff on India will begin on August 27th.</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that on August 4th, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that the US and the European Union were "targeting" India because it buys Russian oil. But India said these actions were "unreasonable" and that India would protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>India buys a lot of oil from Russia. This oil is a main source of money for Moscow's military actions in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for over three years, and there is no sign of it ending soon. Trump had previously said he would put "secondary tariffs" on countries that continue to trade with Russia, like China and India.</p>
