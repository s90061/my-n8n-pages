            <h1>White House: Trump's Son-in-Law and Envoy Go to Egypt to Finish Hostage Release Details</h1>
            <p>After the Palestinian Islamic group Hamas gave a good answer to a peace plan to end the war in Gaza, White House officials said that President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will go to Egypt today. They will work out the final details for releasing hostages.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, a White House official confirmed that Kushner and Witkoff will travel to the Middle East. Their goal is to finish the details for releasing hostages and to talk about the agreement Trump is pushing for, which aims to end the conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>
            <p>After Hamas said they were ready to release all hostages and discuss the peace plan in detail, Trump asked for an immediate stop to the fighting in Gaza.</p>

            <h1>Bad Pork Intestines, Almost 4,000 Kilograms, Found in 4 Counties; FDA Takes 5 Steps to Stop Them</h1>
            <p>Almost 4,000 kilograms of bad pork intestines from Baiwei Company in Pingtung have been found in 4 counties across Taiwan. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced tonight that Taoyuan had the most, with 2,159 kilograms. Other areas include Taipei with 1,330 kilograms, Pingtung County with 180 kilograms, and Kaohsiung with 126 kilograms. The FDA has put in place five main steps to stop the spread, including checking where the products came from and where they went.</p>
            <p>The Mid-Autumn Festival was not safe for food this year. The Pingtung Prosecutor's Office said in a press release that a boss and workers from a company in Pingtung used industrial hydrogen peroxide to bleach some diseased pig large intestines. Then, they sold them to other companies who did not know they were bad, earning illegal money.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sent out two press releases tonight. They explained the case of "Baiwei Food Co., Ltd." possibly using industrial hydrogen peroxide to process pork intestines. Investigators have taken hydrogen peroxide from the site and are still looking into the case. Health authorities have sealed 11,664 kilograms of pork intestines at the processing site and another 940 kilograms in storage.</p>
            <p>"The animal organs from the slaughterhouse were not from sick pigs; they were safe to eat," said Wei Ren-ting, head of the FDA's Southern Regional Management Center. He added that people from the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine said that veterinarians check pig organs during slaughter. If organs are not good for people to eat, blue coloring is put on them, and they are sent to be processed so they do not enter the food chain.</p>
            <p>People were worried about where the bad pork intestines went, fearing they might eat them at barbecues. Wei Ren-ting told the Central News Agency that Baiwei Company's records for pork intestines only had names or short names, and contact information for receiving goods.</p>
            <p>However, looking at the sales records, Wei Ren-ting said that a total of 3,795 kilograms went to 4 counties. Mr. Chen from Ningxia Market in Taipei bought 1,330 kilograms, which is still being checked. Mr. Qiu from Pingtung County bought 180 kilograms and sold it to individuals, with no stock left. Mr. Wu from Kaohsiung City bought 126 kilograms, and there is no stock left.</p>
            <p>The company that bought the most was Dachangshun Food Co., Ltd. in Taoyuan City, which bought 2,159 kilograms. Wei Ren-ting said that the products taken off the market today were mostly from this batch in Taoyuan. By 9 PM tonight, all of them had been removed, and other actions are ongoing.</p>
            <p>Wei Ren-ting pointed out that the FDA is also taking five big steps: complete tracing, immediate removal and sealing, sampling and testing, strict punishment for illegal businesses, and more public information and education. They are asking businesses to provide records of what they bought and sold, and checking where the products came from. All products involved will be immediately removed from sale, and existing stock will be sealed to make sure they do not reach customers.</p>
            <p>In addition, Wei Ren-ting stressed that health authorities have been asked to do more checks in markets, restaurants, and shops. They need to see if there is any industrial hydrogen peroxide left. The results will be announced quickly. Businesses involved will be sent to court under the "Food Safety and Health Management Act." They could face up to 7 years in prison and a fine of up to NT$80 million. They will also be put on a food safety blacklist and stopped from doing business. The FDA will keep checking food sources and remind customers to buy food from legal places.</p>
            <p>The FDA asks people to call the 1919 food safety hotline or tell their local health department if they have concerns or find problematic products.</p>

            <h1>BBC World Service Looks for More Money, Tries to Use Part of Defense Budget</h1>
            <p>The BBC World Service is finding it hard to get enough money. This is because the government has cut the budget for helping other countries and other reasons. Now, news says that leaders at the BBC are asking the government to use some of the defense budget for the World Service's work.</p>
            <p>The British newspaper "The Guardian" reported that BBC World Service leaders say some of their work is very important for "national security." For example, they watch media, especially media from countries like Russia and China. They also work against false information or foreign attempts to control information.</p>
            <p>Information from the UK Ministry of Defense shows that the government plans to increase its defense spending to 2.6% of the country's total economic output (GDP) by April 2027, when the new financial year starts. Currently, Britain spends about 2.3% of its GDP on defense.</p>
            <p>Also, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed at a meeting in The Hague in June this year that member countries should aim to spend 5% of their GDP on security and defense. Of this, 3.5% should be for main defense costs, and 1.5% for things like basic services, helping society be strong, and other security matters. The British government has said it plans to reach this goal by 2035.</p>
            <p>The 1.5% of GDP goal for NATO's security and defense spending can be understood in different ways. BBC World Service leaders say their work is part of national security.</p>
            <p>The government is trying to "waste less" and "make systems work better." As part of this, even though the BBC World Service got a small increase in money from the government for the 2025 to 2026 financial year, they were still asked to "cut costs" in the first half of this year. They had to create a budget plan to save 70 million British pounds (about NT$2.87 billion).</p>
            <p>About one-third of the BBC World Service's budget comes from the UK Foreign Office. Most of the other two-thirds comes from "license fees" that British people pay every month to watch TV. About 80% of the money from the Foreign Office comes from the government's Official Development Assistance (ODA), which is money given to help other countries.</p>
            <p>However, this spring, the British government said it would cut ODA spending. This spending will go down from 0.5% to 0.3% of the country's total national income (GNI). One reason for this cut is to put more money into defense.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported in January that the World Service might need to cut 130 jobs because they needed to save money. The report also said that the TV license fee was "frozen" for two years, and the increase in the fee was not enough to keep up with the rising cost of making TV shows. This was one reason why the BBC had a financial gap of 492 million British pounds in the 2024 to 2025 financial year.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Munro, the head of BBC World Service, recently spoke at an event during the ruling Labour Party's yearly meeting. He said he is trying to get different government departments in the UK to help pay for the BBC World Service. This would spread out the financial pressure.</p>
            <p>A BBC spokesperson said that the BBC World Service shares Britain's great culture around the world. It also helps the British economy and plays an important part in keeping countries safe and stable globally. The BBC is asking the Foreign Office for money and will keep talking with the government about the long-term plans for the BBC World Service.</p>
