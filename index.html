            <h1>US to Charge 15% Tax on Most EU Goods; Car Taxes Lower, Wine Not Excluded</h1>
            <p>The United States and the European Union shared details of their new trade agreement today. They expect that taxes on cars sent to the US will go down. However, the 15% tax on wine will stay, which Europe hoped would be removed. The EU says it will try to get the US to make more changes.</p>
            <p>News reports say that US President Trump and EU leader Ursula von der Leyen agreed to a basic plan in July. Most goods from the EU will have a 15% tax when they enter the US.</p>
            <p>But the EU tried to get some industries to be free from this tax. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to raise taxes on other industries. So, many parts of the agreement were still unclear.</p>
            <p>Today, a joint statement from both sides made the agreement clearer. But talks are not finished, and some things are still uncertain.</p>
            <p>The EU said that the highest, "all-inclusive" 15% tax will apply to most European goods. This includes cars, medicines, computer chips, and wood.</p>
            <p>Maros Sefcovic, an EU official for trade, told reporters in Brussels, "This is the best trade agreement the US has made with any partner." This tax will not be added to any existing taxes.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic also said he is sure that the tax on cars will be lower than the current 27.5%. He added that it will start from August 1st, as the US side has promised this.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, wine and spirits will still have the 15% tax when sent to the US. This is despite France, Italy, and other countries trying to get rid of the tax for these products.</p>
            <p>The French Association of Wine and Spirit Exporters (FEVS) said they were "very disappointed." Gabriel Picard from the association said, "We are sure this will cause big problems for the wine and spirit business."</p>
            <p>Christophe Chateau, a spokesperson for the Bordeaux Wine Council, called it "bad news." But he said it was better than the worst possible situation, because Trump had once threatened a tax as high as 200%.</p>
            <p>Chateau said, "This makes it even harder to trade and send Bordeaux wine to the US." The US is currently the biggest market for Bordeaux wine.</p>
            <p>The office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the agreement is "not yet perfect or final." But it has stopped a "trade war."</p>
            <p>As part of the agreement, the EU has promised to greatly reduce limits on seafood and farm products from the US. These include nuts, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, pork, and bison meat.</p>

            <h1>Details of US-EU Trade Deal Come Out, European Stocks Mostly Up</h1>
            <p>The United States and the European Union announced the details of their trade agreement today. Most goods exported from the EU to the US will face a 15% tax. The uncertainty about how much the US would tax these goods is now over. Because of this, most major European stock markets closed higher today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 21.06 points, or 0.23%, closing at 9309.20 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up slightly by 16.37 points, or 0.07%, closing at 24293.34 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 34.74 points, or 0.44%, closing at 7938.29 points.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine's Safety Plans: Reuters Says Options Include European Troops Led by US</h1>
            <p>The US military said today that military leaders from the US and some European countries have finished looking at military choices for Ukraine. They will send these choices to their national security advisors to review. Sources said that one option is to send European troops to Ukraine, with the US in charge of leading and controlling them.</p>
            <p>US President Trump has promised to help protect Ukraine as part of any deal to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Reuters had previously reported that military planners from the US and Europe had started looking into ways to ensure Ukraine's safety after the conflict.</p>
            <p>The US military stated, "These options will be given to the national security advisors of each country. They will consider them carefully as part of the ongoing diplomatic work."</p>
            <p>Defense leaders from the US, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the UK, and Ukraine met in Washington D.C. from August 19th to 21st.</p>
            <p>Reuters was the first to report that the plan to be given to the national security advisors of each country has been completed.</p>
            <p>Trump promised to help Kyiv with its safety at a meeting on August 18th. Ukraine and its European friends were happy, but many questions are still unanswered.</p>
            <p>Officials had said that US and European planners needed time to figure out military plans that would work and that Russia would agree to.</p>
            <p>Sources told Reuters that one idea is to send European troops to Ukraine, but the US would be in charge of commanding and controlling them.</p>
            <p>To help reach a peace agreement, Western countries have asked that NATO countries be able to send troops. However, Russia's foreign ministry has said no to this idea.</p>
            <p>Trump had publicly said he would not send US troops to Ukraine. But on August 19th, he seemed to open the door for the US to be involved militarily in other ways.</p>
            <p>The US might provide air support in different ways. This includes giving Ukraine more air defense systems and creating a no-fly zone controlled by US fighter jets.</p>
