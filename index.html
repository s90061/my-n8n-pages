            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Gets Stronger; Hualien and Taitung Have Over 200 mm of Rain</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration (CWA) announced that Typhoon Wipha was closest to Taiwan today. In the last three hours, the typhoon became a bit stronger, and its size grew. Because of the outer parts of the typhoon, Hualien and Taitung counties have received more than 200 millimeters of rain from midnight until 8 AM today.</p>
            <p>The CWA is still warning about the typhoon at sea. At 8 AM today, the center of Typhoon Wipha was about 240 kilometers southwest of Eluanbi. Its central pressure was 980 hectopascals. The fastest wind near the center was 28 meters per second, which is like a level 10 wind. The strongest gust of wind was 35 meters per second, like a level 12 wind. The area with winds of level 7 or higher was 150 kilometers wide. The typhoon is moving northwest, then west, at a speed of 24 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xie Peiyun, a weather expert from the CWA, said that the typhoon is expected to get stronger and bigger. She also said it will slowly move away from Taiwan's coast later today. Because of the typhoon's outer bands, there will be a lot of rain. Besides Hualien and Taitung, other areas will also have short rain showers.</p>
            <p>For the next 24 hours, Ms. Xie Peiyun said that the rain will still be very heavy today. People in eastern Taiwan must be very careful. Mountain areas in Hualien and Taitung might get extremely heavy rain. Flat areas in Hualien and Taitung, mountain areas in Yilan, Nantou, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will also get heavy rain. New Taipei City, Taipei City, Yilan County, the Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas, Taoyuan City, and mountain areas in Taichung will have heavy rain in some places.</p>
            <p>Because the typhoon's outer parts are causing warm air to sink, the CWA also issued a warning for high temperatures. Today, Miaoli County has an "orange" warning, meaning there is a high chance of temperatures staying above 36 degrees Celsius. Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Changhua County, and Kinmen County have a "yellow" warning, meaning people should watch out for temperatures above 36 degrees.</p>
            <p>The CWA is still warning about strong winds on land. From today until tomorrow, some parts of Keelung City, New Taipei City, Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County and City, Miaoli, Taichung, Nantou County, Tainan City, Pingtung County, Yilan County, Hualien and Taitung (including Orchid Island and Green Island), Penghu County, Kinmen, and Lienchiang County might have average winds stronger than level 6 or gusts stronger than level 8. Today, the greater Taipei area should be careful of stronger gusts.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that today, there will likely be long waves along the north coast of Keelung, the eastern coast of Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), the southern coast, the Hengchun Peninsula, and Penghu. In the Bashi Channel, the waters southeast of Taiwan, and the southern Taiwan Strait, waves will become larger than 5 meters. Waves in the waters north and northeast of Taiwan, and the northern Taiwan Strait, will also slowly get bigger, from 3 to 4 meters. People are advised not to go to the beach.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese-American Swimmer Han An-chi Breaks National Record Again in 100m Freestyle But Does Not Reach Final</h1>
            <p>In Germany, at the Rhein-Ruhr Universiade event, Taiwanese-American swimmer Han An-chi competed in the women's 100-meter freestyle race today. She finished in 55.26 seconds, which means she broke her own national record again. However, she was sad because she did not make it to the final race.</p>
            <p>Han An-chi is an athlete who will go to the Paris Olympics. This time, she swam for Taiwan again at the Rhein-Ruhr Universiade. On the first day, she set a new national record in the women's 200-meter backstroke with a time of 2 minutes and 11.96 seconds. She also swam with her teammates Liao Yu-fei, Chiu Yi-chen, and Liu Pei-yin in the women's 4x100-meter freestyle relay final. They set a new national record of 3 minutes and 46.77 seconds.</p>
            <p>Han An-chi already held the national records for the women's 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter butterfly races. Yesterday, in the first round of the women's 100-meter freestyle race, she swam in 55.34 seconds. This made her old national record no longer valid. Then, early this morning, in the semi-final race for the women's 100-meter freestyle, she swam even faster. She finished in 55.26 seconds, breaking the national record again. But, Han An-chi was only the 10th fastest swimmer overall, so she could not go to the final.</p>
            <p>Also, another Taiwanese swimmer, Fu Kun-ming, swam the men's 200-meter individual medley race in 2 minutes and 02.25 seconds. He got into the semi-final and also met the necessary time for the Nagoya Asian Games. But in the semi-final, he could not swim faster, so he did not reach the final race. Another swimmer, Chou Ching-lei, who is also Taiwanese-American, met the Nagoya Asian Games standard in the women's 400-meter individual medley with a time of 4 minutes and 49.12 seconds. But she also did not make it to the final.</p>
