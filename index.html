            <h1>Brazil Protests US Tariffs at WTO, Without Naming Trump</h1>
            <p>The government of Brazil is upset with new tariffs from the United States. The US said it will put a 50% tax on products from Brazil starting August 1. Brazil has strongly complained about these taxes at the World Trade Organization (WTO). They said these actions are "random and messy." But they did not directly mention US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>A Brazilian official, Philip Gough, spoke at the WTO today. He works for Brazil's foreign ministry. He said Brazil is "very worried" about countries using trade rules to get involved in other countries' issues. Forty countries, including 27 from the European Union, agreed with him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gough said these tariffs are "breaking global supply chains." He warned that they could make the world economy face high prices and slow growth. He also said that these one-sided actions "clearly go against the basic rules of the WTO," which are very important for international trade.</p>
            <p>News reports say Brazil's government is thinking about making a formal complaint to the WTO. However, people who work in diplomacy believe the WTO cannot solve problems well right now. Even if the WTO makes a decision, it might not be able to make countries follow it. So, a formal complaint from Brazil might just be a political act, not something that will fix the problem.</p>
            <p>Because of this, Brazil might join with other countries that are also affected by these taxes to make a combined complaint.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gough said Brazil always believes in working together through world trade systems. But if talks do not work, Brazil's President Lula is thinking about using an "economic fairness law." This law would allow Brazil to put similar taxes on products from the US. The Brazilian government believes Trump's actions are trying to interfere with Brazil's independence. This "economic fairness law" would allow Brazil to take action against countries or groups that create trade, legal, or political problems for Brazil.</p>
            <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is currently on trial because he is accused of trying to overthrow the government. The US President Trump said he would put a 50% tariff on Brazil because Brazil is "hunting down" his friend Bolsonaro.</p>

            <h1>Fan Yun Tells US Congress: Hsiao Bi-khim Being Followed Is an Example of China's Pressure</h1>
            <p>Today, a hearing was held in the US Congress about China's political actions. Taiwanese lawmaker Fan Yun spoke at the meeting through a video call. She started by talking about baseball, something Americans understand well. She used it to show how Taiwan is often silenced. She also said that Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim was followed by Chinese people when she visited Czech Republic before she became Vice President. Fan Yun said this is a clear example of China trying to control Taiwanese officials in other countries.</p>
            <p>The meeting was organized by the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC). Its goal was to talk about how to stop China's political attacks and its efforts to control people in other countries. Lawmaker Fan Yun, from Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party, joined the meeting by video.</p>
            <p>In her speech, she gave an example of Taiwan winning the 2024 World Baseball Premier12. She explained that the players were not allowed to wear jerseys with Taiwan's name on them. Even after a big hit that scored three runs, they could not openly shout their country's name. The team captain even pointed to the empty space on his jersey where "Taiwan" should have been.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun said, "This is what our life is like. China is always trying to make us silent."</p>
            <p>She also said that China is trying harder to influence and spy on Taiwan. According to Taiwan's National Security Bureau, the number of spy cases that went to court in 2024 was four times higher than in 2021. These spies targeted the military, the parliament, political parties, and groups of citizens. China has even hired gangs to set up armed networks across Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun also spoke about the situation in Taiwan's parliament. She said that after the election last year, the two main opposition parties gained more seats. The leader of the biggest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), went to China with 17 other lawmakers. After meeting with Chinese officials, they started to propose laws that go against Taiwan's constitution. They also stopped or reduced the defense budget without good reasons.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun added, "China also pays Taiwanese internet celebrities to create videos that support China's ideas." She said that China's political goal is twofold: first, to make people think that the disagreement between Taiwan and China is only an internal Chinese matter, to make Taiwan alone. Second, to make Taiwanese people trust the United States less. A recent survey showed that people in Taiwan who use TikTok are more likely to like China. They are also more likely to believe that a pro-American government will cause a war.</p>
            <p>Regarding China's pressure on Taiwanese people in other countries, Fan Yun said that China is harassing military and government officials who are abroad. For example, what happened to the Vice President-elect in Czech Republic. The purpose of these actions is to scare Taiwanese people and show them that there is a cost if they dare to stand up to China.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun talked about the many ways the Taiwanese government is dealing with these issues. She also mentioned that Taiwan has a strong civil society, which means that ordinary citizens are very active in society. This was made stronger by past student movements like the Wild Lily and Sunflower movements. Taiwanese people strongly want to protect their democracy.</p>
            <p>She also noted, "Even as I am speaking, Taiwan is having a very big movement to remove some lawmakers from office. This movement was started by citizen groups. The voting will happen this Saturday."</p>
            <p>Fan Yun said that as Taiwanese people, "we know that freedom does not come easily." Generations of Taiwanese have fought and even died for democracy. They are now working hard to stop a war from happening.</p>
            <p>She strongly said that Taiwan alone is not strong enough to stop China's aggression. She also said that Taiwan's safety is important not just for the region but for the whole world economy. She hopes that the US will stand with Taiwan and protect the same values.</p>

            <h1>Switzerland's Low Birth Rate Causes Worker Shortage; Central Bank Warns of Slower Economy</h1>
            <p>Switzerland has a low birth rate, which means not many babies are being born. This is causing a shortage of workers. The Swiss central bank has warned that this will slow down the country's economic growth.</p>
            <p>In June, the Swiss Federal Statistical Office shared new numbers about the population. In 2024, the average family in Switzerland had 1.3 children. This shows that the birth rate keeps getting lower. The Swiss central bank released a new report this week. It says that many older people, who were born during the "baby boom" after World War II, are now retiring. Because of this, Switzerland might need up to 400,000 more workers in the next ten years. In the long run, this will slow down how much the country's economy can grow.</p>
            <p>The statistics show that families with four people are the most common, making up about 42% of all families. But families with only one child are becoming more common each year. The Swiss central bank says that as the population gets older and fewer babies are born, it will be harder to find enough workers. The report expects that if things continue this way, the number of new jobs each year might only be half of what it used to be. This means the country's potential to create more goods and services (GDP) will also grow slower.</p>
            <p>Michael Siegenthaler, a researcher who studies the job market at ETH Zurich, spoke to a Swiss TV station. He said that in the past, Switzerland's economy grew a lot because it had many young people joining the workforce. But now, the baby boomer generation is about to retire completely, so it is expected that the economy will grow slower. He explained that Swiss companies have already been hiring many talented people from other countries to fill job openings. They will likely continue to do this by offering good salaries to foreign experts.</p>
            <p>Katja Rost, a professor of sociology at the University of Zurich, also spoke on the Swiss TV report. She explained that the main reason for fewer births is that women want to have fewer children. Many women now want to achieve their personal goals first. Also, raising children in Switzerland is very expensive, which makes it harder for families to have more children.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that even countries in Northern Europe, which have good social benefits for families, are seeing fewer births. So, even if Switzerland quickly makes its family policies better, it will not greatly increase the birth rate in the short term.</p>
            <p>Some people think that new artificial intelligence (AI) technology can do some of the work that people do, which could help with the worker shortage. But the Swiss central bank's report clearly stated that an aging population is a big problem for how the country manages its money. Since 2010, more older people have retired than young people have started working. The government and businesses need to be careful and smart in how they deal with this. This will help make sure the job market stays strong and the economy can grow well for a long time.</p>
