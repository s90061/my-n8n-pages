The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently shared a new report about how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will change the world of work. The report suggests that about 60% of jobs in richer countries could be affected by AI. In less developed countries, this number might be lower, around 40%.

AI could affect jobs in two main ways. For some jobs, AI might help workers do their tasks better, making them more productive. This could lead to higher pay. However, for other jobs, AI could take over tasks completely, possibly leading to job losses or a decrease in demand for certain skills.

The IMF believes that governments and companies need to prepare for these changes. This means offering training programs to help people learn new skills that are in demand. It also means creating social support systems for those who might lose their jobs. The goal is to make sure that AI benefits everyone and doesn't create bigger gaps between people.

**Venice Introduces Entry Fee for Day Visitors**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started a new system to manage its large number of tourists. From April 25th, visitors who come to Venice for just one day on certain busy dates will have to pay an entry fee of â‚¬5. This trial program aims to reduce the problem of "overtourism," where too many visitors make life difficult for local residents and put a strain on the city's unique environment.

The fee will be charged on 29 specific peak days between April and mid-July. The city hopes this small charge will encourage some day-trippers to visit during less busy times or to stay overnight, which is a key goal. People who stay in hotels overnight, residents, and children under 14 are exempt from paying the fee.

City officials say this move is important for protecting Venice's delicate structure and improving the quality of life for those who live there. They want to find a better balance between tourism and the needs of the city and its people. This trial period will help them decide if the fee should become a permanent part of Venice's tourism strategy.

**Earth Experiences Ten Months of Record Heat**

Scientists have announced that March 2024 was the tenth month in a row to be the warmest ever recorded globally for that time of year. This continuous rise in temperatures, measured by climate monitoring services like Copernicus, is a clear sign of ongoing climate change and its increasing speed.

These higher global temperatures are causing more frequent and intense extreme weather events around the world. We are seeing more severe heatwaves, longer droughts, and heavier rainfall that leads to flooding. These changes affect daily life, farming, and the natural environment, putting pressure on communities and ecosystems.

Experts are urging countries and individuals to take stronger actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of global warming. They emphasize the need to switch to cleaner energy sources and protect natural areas. Limiting the temperature increase is crucial to prevent even more serious consequences for our planet and future generations.`;
