            <h1>Meta's Co-branded AI Glasses Sell 3 Times More, Boosting EssilorLuxottica's Profit</h1>
            <p>EssilorLuxottica, the world's biggest glasses maker, said today that sales of its "Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" went up three times in the first half of 2025. This product is a collaboration with the tech company Meta. These higher sales helped the company earn more money.</p>
            <p>EssilorLuxottica's total sales in the first half of the year grew by 5.5%, reaching 14 billion Euros. Their net profit, which is the money left after all costs, increased slightly by 1.6%, reaching 1.4 billion Euros.</p>
            <p>Francesco Milleri, the CEO of EssilorLuxottica, stated that the company's performance shows they are "moving forward with their growth goals," even though the global situation is not stable.</p>
            <p>EssilorLuxottica also said that AI glasses became much more popular in the first half of this year. Sales of the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses increased by more than three times compared to last year. The company also launched new Oakley glasses with AI support in June.</p>
            <p>These Ray-Ban Meta co-branded glasses have a camera, headphones, and a microphone. Users do not need to take out their phone; they just need to say "Hey, Meta" to start Meta's artificial intelligence.</p>

            <h1>BBU Concept Stocks Will Release Financial Reports Soon, Stock Prices Rise First</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Zeng Renkai, Taipei, July 29) Leading companies in BBU (Battery Backup Unit) technology, Lite-On and Delta Electronics, will hold meetings with investors on July 30th and 31st. Also, AES-KY, a company that makes battery modules, plans to share its financial report for the second quarter on Thursday. Because of this, the stock prices of companies related to BBU have started to go up.</p>
            <p>Even though the Taiwan stock market went down by 211.46 points today, AES-KY's stock price went up to its daily limit of NT$1200, staying strong in the "Thousand Dollar Club" (meaning its stock price is over NT$1000). Gaintech also saw its stock price rise by NT$1.7, or 4.97%, ending the day at NT$35.9.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics, a big company in the stock market, saw its stock price go up by NT$3, closing at NT$525. Lite-On's stock price stayed the same at NT$124.5, showing it was strong against the market decline.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA will release its new GB300 AI servers later this year. BBU is now a standard part of these servers, and more and more people are using it. Lite-On, a major company that makes power supplies and BBU modules, said before that there is not enough BBU to meet what customers need. So, at the beginning of the year, they started to make more at their factories in Kaohsiung, North America, and other places. They expect to finish making more products by the third quarter. This will likely cause the demand for battery modules, which are used to make BBUs, to also go up.</p>
            <p>Lite-On will hold its investor meeting tomorrow. They are expected to give more details about the BBU market situation.</p>
            <p>Experts say that BBU works like this: if the main power suddenly stops, the system quickly switches to the BBU for power. This helps to quickly save important information from the computer's memory (DRAM) to a backup storage (SSD). This stops data from being lost if the power goes out. As many AI data centers are being built, BBU is slowly becoming a standard and necessary part. Experts believe that the demand for BBU will grow a lot.</p>
