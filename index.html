            <h1>Documentary about a Snake Protecting Its Eggs Wins Award</h1>
            <p>The Taichung branch of the Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency announced today that its film, "Guardian: Documenting a Hundred-Pace Snake Protecting Its Eggs in the Wild," won the "Science Exploration Award" at the 3rd Taiwan Eco-Environment Film Festival.</p>
            <p>The Taichung branch said the film shows the first-ever complete record of a hundred-pace snake protecting its eggs, hatching, and caring for its young in the wild. This is very important for ecology. The video also became very popular online, with over 420,000 views, showing how much it helps people learn about snake protection.</p>
            <p>Director Yan Wen-ru, in her speech, thanked the Taichung branch for always supporting ecological science research and caring about local conservation. She also thanked the Wild Sound Environmental Ecology team for using special equipment and people to watch and record in the wild for a long time, which made the film possible.</p>
            <p>The Taichung branch explained that the film took two months to make. They used special cameras like infrared automatic cameras, time-lapse cameras, night vision cameras, and hidden cameras. They watched and recorded 24 hours a day, without stopping. This way, they got the world's first complete video of a female hundred-pace snake protecting its 20 eggs, from hatching to caring for the babies.</p>
            <p>The Taichung branch said that for the first time, the film used harmonic reflectors to successfully track the young snakes after they left their nest. This information was then compared with records of hundred-pace snake breeding when Lin Hwa-ching, the director of the Forest and Nature Conservation Agency, worked at the Taipei Zoo. This made it possible to show this important information to the public.</p>
            <p>The Taichung branch said that snakes are a vital part of the forest ecosystem and are needed to keep nature balanced. But for a long time, people have misunderstood snakes because of how they look or what people believe. The agency hopes that this special video will share scientific knowledge and spread the message. They want people to see that snakes also have warm behaviors, like protecting their young. This can change what people usually think about snakes and help them understand how valuable snakes are in the ecosystem.</p>

            <h1>China Warns Citizens About Safety in the Philippines, Philippines Says Many Crimes Against Chinese are by Chinese People</h1>
            <p>There is new disagreement between the Philippines and China. After China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told its citizens to be careful in the Philippines, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs said that Beijing was "wrongly describing" the safety situation in the Philippines. It also said that many crimes against Chinese citizens are done by "Chinese people harming their own people."</p>
            <p>On August 30, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent out a safety warning on its consular service website. It said that public safety in the Philippines has been bad recently, and there are many crimes against Chinese citizens. Chinese citizens in the Philippines should protect themselves more and avoid dangerous areas. If they plan to visit the Philippines, they should check the safety risks and plan their trip carefully.</p>
            <p>Angelica Escalona, the spokesperson for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, said today that Philippine police have been "strongly fighting" reported crimes. These include many cases where "Chinese people harmed their own people."</p>
            <p>In mid-July, the Philippine police's anti-kidnapping group arrested 12 kidnapping suspects. Six of them were Chinese, and they were involved in kidnapping one Chinese person. In early August, the same police group arrested four more Chinese people. They were accused of kidnapping two Chinese people.</p>
            <p>Most of the criminals tricked their victims into meeting them by pretending to exchange foreign money or sell cars. Then, they kidnapped the victims.</p>
            <p>Escalona said that China's safety warning "wrongly described" the safety situation in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>She mentioned the 9th Joint Consular Meeting between the Philippines and China in Beijing in July this year. She said that both sides talked about working together to enforce laws then. The Philippines is ready to solve China's worries through talking.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued this safety warning after Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung visited the Philippines with a business and trade group.</p>
            <p>On August 30, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Lin Chia-lung helped a Taiwanese business and trade group visit the Philippines from August 25 to 30. The Filinvest Innovation Park in the Philippines had posted a photo of Lin Chia-lung speaking at an event on Facebook and called him the leader of the visiting group.</p>
            <p>Since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office, the relationship between the Philippines and Taiwan has become closer. In April, the Philippine President's office released a memo that made it easier for government officials from the Philippines and Taiwan to meet. It allows Philippine officials to welcome business and investment groups from Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>New Session of Legislature Begins, President Lai Will Invite Party Members from Different Groups to Dinner</h1>
            <p>The 4th session of the 11th Legislature started today. Members of different groups within the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have been getting calls from President Lai Ching-te, who is also the head of the DPP, inviting them to dinner. It is understood that before the new session officially begins, President Lai will invite members from various groups to his home in four separate groups. This is to understand the situation in the Legislature and to know what the party members think. The main goal is to make sure the general budget passes easily.</p>
            <p>People within the party said that President Lai's dinner invitations are mainly to help everyone agree on things. The most important task for the new session of the Legislature is to deal with the general budget. Whether the budget passes or not directly affects how the government works. The President is concerned about how the party group will handle this in the future and wants to talk with everyone.</p>
            <p>Regarding the debate about whether to change the party group's chief convener, people in the party said, "Of course, Chief Convener Ker Chien-ming is also on the guest list for the dinners." President Lai respects the party group's independence and will not interfere with how the group works.</p>
            <p>People in the party said that it is good for President Lai and members from different groups to talk and share ideas in the new session. This will help the President understand the situation in the Legislature and also know what the party members think. The main goal is to make sure the general budget passes easily.</p>
