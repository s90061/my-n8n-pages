            <h1>Erya Publishing: 50 Years of Supporting Literature. Yin Di: I Worry Good Books Will Be Forgotten</h1>
            <p>Erya Publishing has been a literary helper for 50 years. It has also comforted many readers. The founder, writer Yin Di, said today that for 50 years, he has been very careful about the books he publishes. He is only afraid that good books will be forgotten and that no one will see them.</p>
            <p>Yin Di, who is almost 90 years old, attended an event today called "Not Nostalgic, Classics Still Young: Erya Fifty, Classics Fifty." At the event, Wang Dewei, Xiang Yang, Bai Xianyong, Chen Fangming, Wang Rongwen, and Ye Burong gave awards to writers whose books were chosen for the "Classic Fifty" list. Many writers, both old and young, were there, and the atmosphere was warm and moving.</p>
            <p>Yin Di spoke and said that he has had eye problems lately. He has lost the joy of writing and reading, but his passion for literature will never change.</p>
            <p>Yin Di said he still clearly remembers how words first taught him and moved him. He also became a writer himself. He always hoped that good writing could be seen by more people. He shared how he is a very strict editor. He gives authors three chances when reading their work. If he reads a good article, he will "stand straight" to read it carefully. If he reads an article three times and still thinks it is not good, he puts it in a "rest area" and reads it again later.</p>
            <p>Feng Deping, the head of "Wenhsun Magazine," spoke and said that she believes many people have been asked to write by Yin Di. They were moved by Yin Di's spirit. She was very happy to plan this event for "Erya" and choose 50 classic books. She also thanked the more than one hundred cultural figures who helped make this very important event happen. She said, "People who write are always young."</p>
            <p>Writer Bai Xianyong spoke and said that "Erya" has three main qualities. First, it has a literary spirit. Second, it publishes the most poetry books, which is very important for spreading modern Taiwanese poetry. He also praised Yin Di's poems because they are "easy to understand." Third, "Erya" also publishes many yearly collections, which keep a very good record of the literary world.</p>
            <p>The critic Wang Dewei said that in October 1997, Yin Di sent him a big box of books and asked him to edit them. This group of books became "The Creation of the Canon: 30 Years of Selected Novels." This work gave him a chance to understand how important Taiwanese literature is in the Chinese-speaking world. He wants to show his respect to Yin Di.</p>
            <p>For this event, one hundred cultural figures chose 50 books from 908 books published by Erya. Books like Bai Xianyong's "Taipei People," Lin Haiyin's "My Old Home," and Yu Qiuyu's "Cultural Journey" were chosen. Also, Wang Dingjun alone had 4 of his books on the list: "Four Parts of a Memoir," "Left Atrial Vortex," "Broken Glaze," and "River Melody."</p>
            <p>You can find the full list of the 50 books on the "Wenhsun" magazine Facebook page. (Edited by Hsieh Ya-chu) July 19, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Actor Shih Ming-Shuai Remembers Low Pay for Student Plays, Jokes "A Lunchbox Was Enough"</h1>
            <p>Actor Shih Ming-Shuai attended a press conference today for the 20th anniversary of the Public Television Service (PTS) Student Drama Exhibition. He remembered that in the past, the budget was only 1.5 million New Taiwan Dollars, so actors were paid very little. He joked, "A lunchbox was enough." But he said these experiences were good for him. He saw them as "a chance to practice after training at Shaolin Temple."</p>
            <p>PTS held the "PTS Student Drama Exhibition 20th Anniversary Film Festival" press conference today. Director Lin Chun-Yang and actors Shih Ming-Shuai, Fu Meng-Po, and others were invited. They shared their experiences from working in film and TV over the years.</p>
            <p>Shih Ming-Shuai, who studied drama in college, said he saw the student drama exhibition as a chance to "train at Shaolin Temple and then go out to practice." He also thought it was a great way to connect studying in school with working in the real world.</p>
            <p>Shih Ming-Shuai also talked about how hard it was to make student dramas. They wanted to make good films even with limited money. He said that at that time, there were no rules about how many hours they worked, and they often worked without pay. He said, "A lunchbox was enough." He also said, "It was really very hard! I once worked for 32 hours without stopping." He would even fall asleep as soon as he closed his eyes. He admitted that working at a convenience store paid more money.</p>
            <p>Director Lin Chun-Yang also said that when they were filming, people in the same industry helped each other. He once worked as a cameraman for another film team. He said, "If they gave me a little money, it was wonderful." He was even surprised if a film team had lunchboxes, saying, "They actually have food!"</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiu-Hua, the General Manager of PTS, said that the student drama works have become famous around the world. The ideas from students are new and different, and they have successfully entered the international market. She said, "Many international or big companies are asking PTS if there are any new student drama projects." They hope to find ideas that can be made into TV series or movies.

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: We Respect the Cabinet's Choice for Representatives Against Nuclear Power Plant Restart Referendum</h1>
            <p>The public vote (referendum) to restart the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, also known as Nuclear No. 3, will take place on August 23. The Central Election Commission (CEC) will hold 5 public talks or debates. Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said it has no special opinion on who will speak against the referendum. They respect the Cabinet and public groups' decision to choose Lin Tzu-lun, who is a deputy director at the Cabinet's office for energy and carbon reduction, and Tseng Wen-sheng, who is the chairman of Taiwan Power Company, to be the representatives against the restart.</p>
            <p>The CEC said earlier that they want both sides of the Nuclear No. 3 restart referendum to share their views completely. So, they decided to hold 5 talks or debates on August 7, August 9, August 11, August 13, and August 15. These will be shown on national TV channels. The Legislative Yuan will speak for the "for" side. The Cabinet or groups that have permission to set up offices under Article 20 of the Referendum Act will speak for the "against" side. Usually, these are talks, not debates, unless both sides agree to have a debate.</p>
            <p>Last night, the Cabinet said that after considering the views of experts from schools and from practical work, Lin Tzu-lun, the Deputy Executive Director of the Cabinet's Office of Energy and Carbon Reduction, and Tseng Wen-sheng, the Chairman of Taiwan Power Company, will be the representatives against the referendum.</p>
            <p>However, news reports said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs did not want to send representatives to speak against the Nuclear No. 3 restart referendum talks. They also asked the Cabinet not to suggest anyone to speak against it. After the MOEA stated its position, the Cabinet quickly chose Tseng Wen-sheng as one of the representatives against the referendum. This seemed to be against what the MOEA wanted.</p>
            <p>Today, the MOEA said that the government team has the same opinion about nuclear power. They have said many times that they are open to using nuclear power. But it can only happen if it is completely safe, if there is a way to deal with nuclear waste, and if society agrees on it.</p>
            <p>The MOEA also said that the Nuclear Reactor Facilities Control Act was made public on May 23 this year. According to Article 6, Paragraph 3 of this law, "If a nuclear reactor facility needs to keep working after its license is no longer valid, the company that runs it can ask the main authority. If the main authority says the nuclear reactor facility is safe and approves a new license, then it can keep working."</p>
            <p>The MOEA said that if Nuclear No. 3 is found to be safe by the main authority and is given a new license, then the MOEA, as the government group that puts laws into practice, must follow the rules in the Nuclear Control Act. So, it is not a question of being against or for it.</p>
            <p>Regarding the people chosen for the referendum talks or explanations, the MOEA said they have no specific opinion. They respect the decisions made by the Cabinet and public groups. (Edited by Hsieh Chia-chen) July 19, 2025.</p>
