            <h1>Ye Baodi Hits First Home Run, Hawks Win; Lin Shixiang Gets 30th Save</h1>
            <p>Taichung, October 5th (CNA) â€” The TSG Hawks played their last regular season game against the Wei Chuan Dragons. Ye Baodi hit his first home run in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) during the bottom of the 8th inning. This home run won the game for the Hawks, making the score 4-3. The Dragons have now lost 5 games in a row. Lin Shixiang from the Hawks got his 30th save this season, becoming the 8th player in CPBL history to do so.</p>
            <p>The Hawks played against the Dragons at their home stadium, Chengcing Lake Baseball Field. Neither team scored in the first three innings. In the bottom of the 4th inning, the Hawks scored first with a solo home run by Yan Yu-hsuan.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 6th inning, the Dragons took the lead with a two-run home run by Giljegiljaw Kungkuan. This was his 24th home run of the season. In the top of the 7th inning, the Dragons scored another run because of a hit, a passed ball, and a sacrifice fly by Wang Shun-ho.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 8th inning, the Hawks started to attack again. After two outs, Wang Bo-hsuan and Tseng Yu-ching both walked. Then, Ye Baodi hit a three-run home run, which put the Hawks ahead. This was his first home run in the CPBL, and it was the winning hit. Ye Baodi was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the game.</p>
            <p>The Hawks' starting pitcher, Sakurai Shuto, pitched 6 innings and gave up 2 runs. He pitched well but did not get the win or loss. The win went to relief pitcher Huang Chun. The closing pitcher, Lin Shixiang, pitched 1 inning, struck out 2 batters, and did not give up any runs. This was his 30th save of the season.

            <h1>China Offers Visa-Free Travel to Russia; Russian Travel Bookings to China Increase 3.5 Times in September</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 5th (CNA) â€” On September 2nd, the Chinese government announced that Russian citizens could enter China without a visa for one year, starting from September 15th. According to statistics, travel bookings from Russia to China in September increased by 3.5 times compared to the same period last year. Bookings for Beijing and Shanghai especially grew a lot. A manager at a travel platform said that China is now more popular with Russian tourists than holiday places within Russia itself.</p>
            <p>Earlier, the Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported data from the Russian travel platform Travelata. In September 2024, 98% of Russian travel bookings to China were for Hainan Island, and 2% were for Beijing. This September, the percentage for Hainan Island went down to 88%, but it was still the most popular. Beijing and Shanghai each made up 5% of bookings, and other cities made up 2%.</p>
            <p>Also, in September this year, Russian tourists spent an average of 209,000 rubles (about NT$77,000) per person in Hainan. This is about 11.8% less than the 237,000 rubles spent in the same period last year.</p>
            <p>The data also shows that Russian tourists mainly booked high-end hotels in China. Five-star hotels made up 50% of all bookings, and four-star hotels made up 44%.</p>
            <p>According to the report, Oleg Kozyrev, the Chief Operating Officer of Travelata, said that China's trial visa-free policy for Russians clearly changed what Russian tourists prefer. China is now more popular than holiday places within Russia. (Edited by Chiu Kuo-chiang) 1141005</p>

            <h1>US Defense Strategy Report Coming Out; Whether East Asia Defense Line Includes Taiwan and South Korea Is Watched</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 5th (CNA) â€” Nikkei Asia reported that the Trump administration will soon release a new "National Defense Strategy" report. This report might focus on protecting the United States itself first. People are paying close attention to whether this plan for defense in Asia will include Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia said that the Trump administration's "National Defense Strategy Report" is coming out soon, and US allies are watching closely. This document is a regular review that the US releases every four years. It decides the main plan for defense policies both inside and outside the country. It is expected to be released as early as October, and its direction might change a lot this time.</p>
            <p>The 2018 "National Defense Strategy Report" was released during Trump's first time as president. At that time, it called China and Russia the main challenges to the global order. It also promised that the US would be strong in strategic competition. Now, this way of thinking seems to be changing.</p>
            <p>By the end of August, the US Department of Defense had finished a draft of the new strategy. It is now being shared within the government. The political website Politico reported that this draft focuses on defending the US homeland first. This is a complete change from the 2018 strategy, which focused on fighting against main enemies like China and Russia.</p>
            <p>If this report is true, this change by the Trump administration will have big effects. If the US military focuses more on its own country, its promises to protect allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific will face more pressure.</p>
            <p>In Europe, many people feel sad that US military support might become less. But in Asia, some allies hope that Washington will not only keep its military in the region but also make it stronger because China is becoming more powerful.</p>
            <p>However, this hope might not be realistic. Even if the Trump administration cares about Asia, military help might not drop as much as it might in Europe. But if the White House insists on putting its own country first, Asia will also be affected.</p>
            <p>The current talks within the Trump administration show a worrying fact: officials have not decided where the US military's defense line in Asia should be. This line is the border where the US believes it is worth a big cost to protect its national interests.</p>
            <p>In theory, the US could draw four kinds of defense lines in Asia. The best way for stability in the region is the current one, which includes Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. The US has mostly followed this approach for decades.</p>
            <p>The worst situation would be if the US defense line in Asia only included Japan, leaving out South Korea and Taiwan. This might make North Korea and China bolder, which could greatly increase the risk of conflict.</p>
            <p>In 1950, Dean Acheson, who was the US Secretary of State at the time, suggested drawing a defense line in the Pacific that only included Japan, but not South Korea and Taiwan. This was called the "Acheson Line." Many people have long believed that this made North Korea think the US would not get involved, which led to the Korean War that same year.</p>
            <p>The other two options are to exclude either South Korea or Taiwan. Even if Japan is protected because of US military bases, if either South Korea or Taiwan is left out, it will have a big impact on Japan's strategy.</p>
            <p>Many US security experts say that current US military officers and officials from the Department of Defense and State Department generally support continuing the first option. However, some people in the Trump administration who do not want to interfere, like Vice President JD Vance, still have doubts about how much responsibility the US should take for the defense of South Korea and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>People who know about the internal discussions said that a plan was quietly shared within the Trump administration. It suggested accepting South Korea's nuclear power to stop attacks and reducing direct US responsibility for South Korea's defense. This strong idea was rejected, but it might be suggested again in the future.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan, there are also different ideas in Washington. Hardline people in the military and Congress want to oppose China. They think the US must clearly promise to protect Taiwan's safety. But some high-ranking officials like Vance have a less active view on helping Taiwan defend itself.</p>
            <p>The final decision on where to draw the Asian defense line is still with Trump. Because of what he has said and done in the past, people are still not sure about his judgment. Although Trump has often criticized China on trade issues, he has never been very interested in making the US military more involved in Asia to counter China's growing military power. He does not want to fight China for power and does not see international issues as a geopolitical battle.</p>
            <p>Since August this year, Trump has kept sending strong messages that homeland defense is the most important. In the same month, Trump ordered thousands of US troops to the Caribbean. The official reason was to fight drug smuggling. On September 2nd, the US military attacked a Venezuelan boat suspected of carrying drugs, killing 11 people believed to be drug dealers in international waters.</p>
            <p>In contrast, Trump has seemed unwilling to use the US military to defend allies. He recently told Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, three NATO members next to Russia, that the US would cut money for their military building from the 2026 financial year. This clearly shows his "homeland first" attitude.</p>
            <p>Michael Shoebridge, the director of Strategic Analysis Australia, said: "Since Trump became president, the US has put homeland security first. It has increased border funding and even sent National Guard and Marines to its own country. The new defense strategy is expected to make these actions official."</p>
            <p>Shoebridge pointed out: "US allies must improve their own defense and rely less on US support. Investing more in their own defense industries and working more closely with trusted partners like Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines is now the only way."
