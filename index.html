            <h1>Uncertain US Interest Rate Cut Outlook, Mixed European Stock Market Closures</h1>
            <p>New information shows that prices are going up in the United States. This makes it unclear if interest rates will go down soon. Because of this, the stock market's growth has slowed. Today, the main stock markets in Europe had mixed results, some went up and some went down.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little, by 14.43 points or 0.16%. It closed at 9142.73 points.</p>

            <h1>US and Ukraine Finalize Drone Cooperation Plan; 3 Nordic Countries and Netherlands Provide 500 Million in Military Aid</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that Ukraine has finished a first plan for working with the United States on drones. They will talk more about the details later. Zelenskyy had said before that this project could be worth as much as 10 billion US dollars (about 298.8 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said on social media that he talked to US President Donald Trump. They discussed how Ukraine and the US can work together on defense, including the drone project. He said this could be "one of the most important agreements".</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that during the call, they talked about Russia's recent large air attacks. He noted that Trump understood Russia's attacks on Kyiv well. They also talked about possible ways to punish Russia. Zelenskyy said, "If Russia had not made the war last longer on purpose, the war should have ended months ago."</p>
            <p>Last month, the "New York Post" in the US reported that Zelenskyy said in an interview that Ukraine and the US were talking about working together on drones. Ukraine plans to give its drone technology, which has been tested in real war, to the US. In return, the US would give weapons to Ukraine. Zelenskyy called this a "win-win" partnership at that time.</p>
            <p>Also, after the Netherlands became the first NATO country to say it would buy weapons directly from the US, Zelenskyy said today that Sweden, Norway, and Denmark will also give military help together. This help is worth 500 million Euros (about 17.3 billion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Recently, NATO, Ukraine, and the US have agreed on a new way to work together. This plan is based on the "Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List" (PURL). It helps organize the delivery of US-made weapons that Ukraine needs.</p>
            <p>With this plan, Ukraine lists the weapons it needs most. Each time, about 500 million US dollars in aid will be given. NATO countries, with help from Secretary General Mark Rutte, will decide which country will donate or buy the military equipment Ukraine needs.</p>

            <h1>Trump: No Meeting with Xi Jinping If No Trade Deal Between US and China</h1>
            <p>People are wondering when US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet. Today, Trump said that if the US and China make a trade agreement, he will likely meet with Xi Jinping before the end of the year. But if they don't agree, he will not meet with Xi. Trump also said that both sides are very close to reaching an agreement.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump spoke on the phone to CNBC, a US business news channel, on the show "Squawk Box". When asked about meeting Xi, he said that Xi Jinping asked to meet him. If the US and China make an agreement, he will likely meet Xi Jinping by the end of this year. He said, "If we don't make a deal, there will be no meeting."</p>
            <p>He said, if both sides won't agree, "What's the point of meeting?" But he also stressed that the US and China are now very close to an agreement. He added, "We have a very good relationship with China."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last week, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he believes the US and China are ready to make a deal. Before this, US and Chinese officials had their third round of trade talks in Sweden at the end of July. They were trying to solve their economic problems. Their goal was to make the current agreement on tariffs, reached in mid-May, last longer.</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China met in Geneva and agreed. They decided to greatly lower high taxes on goods for 90 days. This break in the trade conflict will end on August 12th.</p>
            <p>Before this, the US and China had already made basic agreements in May and June. They were trying to stop using taxes to punish each other and to fix problems with China's rare earth mineral exports. Now, as the August 12th deadline is coming, China needs to make a long-term agreement on tariffs with the US.</p>
