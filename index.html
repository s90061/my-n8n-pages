            <h1>Li Yang Becomes First Minister of Sports, Aims to Make Taiwan's Sports Stronger</h1>
            <p>The new Ministry of Sports will start on September 9th. The government announced today that Li Yang, a famous Taiwanese badminton player who won two Olympic gold medals, will be the first Minister of Sports. Li Yang said he will work hard to make Taiwan's sports better.</p>
            <p>The government announced its "AI Action Cabinet 2.0" today. Sixteen government members will change. Li Yang, who won two Olympic gold medals in men's badminton doubles, will be the first minister of the new Ministry of Sports, which opens on September 9th.</p>
            <p>Li Yang is 30 years old. He and his partner Wang Chi-Lin, known as the "Lin-Yang pair," won gold medals in men's badminton doubles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2024 Paris Olympics. This was the first time a team won two gold medals in a row in this event.</p>
            <p>After the 2024 Paris Olympics, Li Yang retired. He started working as an associate professor at National Taiwan Sport University in September last year. He also used his skills to lead the school's badminton team. The team did well in this year's National University Games and national badminton ranking competitions.</p>
            <p>Li Yang's desire to help Taiwanese sports is not new. After the Paris Olympics, he said he wanted to run for president of the Chinese Taipei Badminton Association. He wanted to start by helping in the sport he knows best. Now, he will be the Minister of Sports, which is the highest position for managing sports in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Li Yang told CNA, "Taking this job is very important to me, and the responsibility is even bigger. I will put in 200% effort and energy to do things well. Besides sports policies, as a former athlete, I will especially care about what athletes need."</p>
            <p>Li Yang is a Leo. He has strong ideas and pays close attention to details. He once said that after retiring, he gave more than 30 public speeches. He even paid a professional teacher to help him learn to speak better and more clearly.</p>
            <p>Li Yang's path into politics is similar to his badminton career. When he was in middle school, he was not a good badminton player. Even in high school, he couldn't join the top-level (A-level) players. His father once told him to stop playing badminton and focus on his studies. After high school, he chose to study at National Taipei University of Business, which was not a common choice for badminton players. But he later became a famous Olympic double gold medalist in badminton.</p>
            <p>It was rumored that the new Ministry of Sports asked several athletes to be minister. In the end, Li Yang, who has a good public image, took the job. This was something he had not thought about before this year.</p>
            <p>Li Yang said, "Life is like this; some things lead you in new directions. But I always believed that no matter what my position, my original goal is the same: to make Taiwanese sports better. Now I have this chance to help more people. Maybe this is because people trust me and have hopes for me."</p>
            <p>Li Yang stressed that he is ready in his mind. "Like when I was a player, I always said, 'The shuttlecock doesn't touch the ground, never give up.' Now I will use this spirit to keep fighting in my new role."</p>
            <p>Wang Chi-Lin, his former partner, is competing in the World Badminton Championships in Paris, France. He sent his good wishes to Li Yang, saying, "I hope he can do more for Taiwanese sports in the future."</p>
            <p>Li Yang also wrote on Facebook today, "New journey, original intention unchanged." He presented six main sports policies. He plans to act on everyone's hopes and make Taiwan better through sports.</p>
            <p>Besides Li Yang as Minister of Sports, two deputy ministers will be Zheng Shi-Zhong, the current Director-General of the Sports Administration, and Huang Qi-Huang, the CEO of the Sports Science Center. Hong Zhi-Chang, the current Deputy Director-General of the Sports Administration, will be the permanent secretary.</p>

            <h1>Legislator Unhappy About No Investigation in Ye Bing-cheng Case; Zheng Ying-yao Promises Review</h1>
            <p>Ye Bing-cheng, a former Deputy Minister of Education, was accused of sharing personal details from a gender equality case. Today, Wu Pei-yi, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party, was upset that the Ministry of Education has not started an official investigation into the leak. She told Minister of Education Zheng Ying-yao that he was not doing his job and asked the Ministry to start an investigation quickly. Zheng Ying-yao did not promise to do so. He only said he would think about it carefully and deal with it according to the law.</p>
            <p>Today, the finance, internal affairs, economy, education and culture, transportation, and social welfare and health environment committees of the Legislative Yuan met. They were discussing a special budget for recovery and rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rains on July 28.</p>
            <p>During questioning, Wu Pei-yi said that the gender equality committee gave two suggestions to the Ministry of Education about Ye Bing-cheng's case. First, they asked the Ministry to investigate the part about breaking the Personal Data Protection Act, as this was not something the gender equality committee could investigate. Second, they asked the Ministry to investigate if the political official had broken the Public Service Act, as this was also not the gender equality committee's job.</p>
            <p>Wu Pei-yi asked Zheng Ying-yao, "Does the Ministry of Education not know it can start an investigation?" She asked how long it had been since the case happened and if the gender equality committee still had to tell the Ministry to start an official investigation. Legislators from the Education and Culture Committee of the Legislative Yuan also sent a letter to the Ministry of Education in April. The Ministry could have started an investigation in April. Wu Pei-yi asked, "Did they start one then?"</p>
            <p>Zheng Ying-yao said that the Ministry of Education understood that Ye Bing-cheng shared information online in an improper way. At that time, people said he broke the Gender Equality Act. But looking at all the laws, Ye Bing-cheng was not directly involved in the National Taiwan University's gender equality investigation, nor was he in charge of gender equality matters at the Ministry of Education.</p>
            <p>Zheng Ying-yao's answer made Wu Pei-yi angry. She repeatedly asked, "Did you start an official investigation?" Zheng Ying-yao admitted that the gender equality committee's first decision was no, so an investigation was not started.</p>
            <p>Wu Pei-yi said that this is why people say the Ministry of Education is protecting him. It has been four months, and they have wasted time. She called it embarrassing and a failure to do their job. She asked, "When will the Ministry of Education start an official investigation?" She said that just because someone leaves their job, it does not mean the problem is over. The truth needs to be found. This issue is important because if victims' personal information might be shared, they might be too scared to report problems in the future.</p>
            <p>Because Zheng Ying-yao did not promise to start an official investigation, the meeting's leader, Democratic Progressive Party legislator Lai Hui-yuan, also asked Zheng Ying-yao to make a promise. Zheng Ying-yao only said that the Ministry of Education would deal with it according to the law and carefully review it internally.</p>
            <p>Wu Pei-yi said it has been four months, so they should act quickly and investigate if needed.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hsiao: Insurance is a Backup, Strongest Support in Times of Trouble</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said today that insurance is not always obvious when things are calm. But when bad weather or problems come, it becomes the strongest support. Future challenges for the insurance industry include climate change, changes in population which increase the need for healthcare and long-term care, and digital and AI growth which will change how risks appear. Insurance is a backup; it is more than just a contract. It is the power that helps families when risks happen.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao attended the "11th Taiwan Insurance Excellence Awards Ceremony" today. Many people were there, including Chen Yan-liang, Deputy Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission; Huang Hong-zhi, Chairman of the Taiwan Insurance Institute; Chen Hui-you, Chairman of the Life Insurance Association; Chen Wan-xiang, Chairman of the Non-Life Insurance Association; and many insurance company workers.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said in her speech that insurance is not easily seen when things are calm, but it becomes the strongest support when bad weather comes. Taiwan is in an earthquake area around the Pacific Ocean. Typhoons and heavy rains happen often. Also, the world's economy and politics are not stable. So, managing risks is not only a professional topic but also an important part of national safety and how well society can recover. The insurance industry is the most important part of this safety net.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said that the skill and trust of insurance workers connect every family, business, and society closely. This net helps with unexpected problems and also carries everyone's hopes. For many people, they do not notice insurance every day, but everyone knows that insurance is a backup. Insurance is more than just a contract; it is the strength that supports each family when risks happen.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said that the insurance industry always stays ahead of changes. Future challenges include climate change bringing more extreme weather events. Also, changes in how many people are in different age groups mean that healthcare and long-term care are needed more quickly. The growth of digital technology and AI will also change what kinds of risks there are. This means the insurance industry will need to be more creative and have a stronger sense of purpose in the future. She honored the insurance people there and thanked them for being a strong force for stability in society.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said she believes that giving these awards can encourage more insurance workers to get better at what they do. This will make insurance more than just a policy; it will be a real and dependable promise, and a force that protects Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huang Hong-zhi said that the Taiwan Insurance Excellence Awards started in 2005 and happen every two years. This is the 11th time. He looked back at recent challenges, such as changes in world politics and the effects of extreme weather. These have brought new risks to the insurance industry. The insurance industry has always stayed true to its main goal of protection. It works together to keep the industry stable and provides strong protection. He hopes that insurance companies will gather strength to face future challenges and continue to help stabilize society. He also showed the highest respect from the organizing committee.</p>
            <p>Wu Zhong-shu, the head of the judging committee, said that 40 companies took part this time and submitted 159 cases. Thirty-five experts from universities and the industry judged the awards. After early reviews, main reviews, and final decisions, the winners were chosen. He hopes this process will protect what customers need and also help Taiwan's insurance industry grow steadily.</p>
