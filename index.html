Atlanta police said today, July 14, that BeyoncÃ©'s new music and concert plans were stolen on July 8. A person linked to the crime is still free.

The AFP news agency reported that on July 8, items were taken from a car. BeyoncÃ©'s dance leader and a dancer had rented this car in Atlanta. This happened just two days before her "Cowboy Carter" concert tour was supposed to start in Atlanta.

Christopher Grant, 37, the dance leader, told the police that he came back to his car and saw the back window was broken. His bags were gone. The police report said that the stolen items included many hard drives. These drives had "music with special marks, new music that was not released, videos made for shows, and lists of songs for old and new concerts."

Also stolen were an Apple laptop, headphones, and some expensive clothes. Police used signals from the laptop and headphones to look for them, but the report does not say if any stolen items were found.

A statement from Atlanta police said they have a warrant to arrest one person. This person's name is not known, and they are still free.

BeyoncÃ© started her "Cowboy Carter" tour in April. Before that, she won her first Grammy Award for Album of the Year for the same album.

The tour is almost over. BeyoncÃ©'s four shows in Atlanta ended today. The last two shows will be in Las Vegas in late July.

***Lin Chun-hsien Asks Tainan Officials to Raise NT$6 Million for Typhoon Relief***

Typhoon Doksuri caused a lot of damage in Tainan. Lin Chun-hsien, a legislator from the DPP party, asked other legislators like Kuo Kuo-wen, Lai Hui-yuan, Lin Yi-chin, and many Tainan City Council members to collect 6 million New Taiwan Dollars (NT$) for a special fund for typhoon disasters. He hopes this will make more people donate and help people in the disaster areas get back to their normal lives.

Lin Chun-hsien spoke at a press conference in the Tainan City Council this afternoon. He said the damage was much worse than anyone could imagine. Public officials from his party quickly sent people and supplies to help. Now, as people begin to rebuild, more help from different groups is needed.

He said that this morning he talked to Premier Cho Jung-tai. They might plan to give the most money possible for typhoon relief. But helping people after a disaster needs both government and private help. So, he and three other legislators, along with the DPP group in the Tainan City Council, collected 6 million NT$ for relief. He hopes this will encourage more people to give.

Lin Chun-hsien said that the day after the typhoon, public officials from the DPP started to help. They found food, covers for roofs (tarpaulins), and lights. They also sent people to help put covers on damaged houses. They connected different groups, like the army, new police officers, and people doing alternative service, to help fix the damaged areas.

Lin Chun-hsien said that recently, in Xiliao, Qigu, which was hit hard by the typhoon, he saw someone cooking warm food for the affected people. When he asked, he learned they were from Nanxi, an area that had an earthquake. Because they received help from many people during the earthquake, they chose to come and help in the typhoon disaster area this time.

Kuo Kuo-wen said that he found companies to help, and he also arranged for construction vehicles to help people clean their homes, which worked very well. The rebuilding part will be even harder. He hopes that with the help of public officials, the first 6 million NT$ will help the people affected and make more people want to help too.

Lai Hui-yuan said that her area was one of the worst hit this time. She is very thankful to Lin Chun-hsien for organizing this. She also thanked all the kind people who gave things or went to the disaster areas to help. Local farmer groups and district offices also helped send supplies. More help is still needed, and everyone's ongoing support is important.

***UK Media: Trump Asked Zelensky if Weapons Could Hit Moscow***

According to people who know, former U.S. President Donald Trump privately told Ukraine to attack deeper into Russia. He even asked Ukraine's President Zelensky if Ukrainian forces could hit Moscow, Russia's capital, if the U.S. gave them long-range weapons.

The British newspaper "Financial Times" reported that this conversation happened on July 4. It was during a phone call between the U.S. and Ukrainian leaders. What they talked about goes against what Trump had said before about the war between Russia and Ukraine. It also goes against his promise during his election campaign to stop the U.S. from being involved in wars in other countries.

We still don't know if the U.S. will give these weapons. This talk shows that Trump is more and more unhappy because Russian President Vladimir Putin has said no to Trump's idea of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Trump had promised to end the war in one day.

Trump had talked to Putin on July 3, but he said that call was "bad." This made him call Zelensky the next day.

Two people who know about it said that Trump asked Zelensky if Ukraine could hit military targets far inside Russia if he gave them weapons that could do that.

According to sources, Trump asked on the phone: "Volodymyr (Zelensky's first name), can you hit Moscow? ... Can you also hit St. Petersburg?"

Zelensky reportedly answered: "Of course. If you give us those weapons, we can do it."

According to two sources, Trump supported this idea. He said that the goal of this plan was to "make them (the Russians) feel pain" and force the Russian government (Kremlin) to come and talk about peace.

A Western official who knew about the phone call said that this conversation shows that Ukraine's Western partners increasingly want to give Ukraine long-range weapons that can "take the war to Moscow." U.S. officials have also quietly agreed with this idea in recent weeks.

The White House and the Ukrainian President's Office did not reply when the Financial Times asked for their comments.

Three people who know said that because Trump and Zelensky talked, the U.S. gave Zelensky a list of possible weapons for Ukraine in Rome last week.

Zelensky met with U.S. defense officials and people who help communicate between NATO countries. He got a list of long-range attack systems. These weapons might be given through another country.

Ukraine had asked for Tomahawk missiles. These are very accurate cruise missiles that can fly about 1600 kilometers. However, one source said that, like the previous Biden government, the Trump government is also worried that Ukraine might not control themselves well.

Two sources also said that one of the weapons recently talked about between the U.S. and Ukraine was the "Army Tactical Missile System" (ATACMS).

Ukraine has used ATACMS missiles given by the U.S. to hit targets in parts of Ukraine controlled by Russia. Some of these attacks even went deeper into Russian land. But these missiles can only go 300 kilometers, which is not enough to reach Moscow or St. Petersburg.
