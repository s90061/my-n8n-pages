            <h1>Chiayi Dapu Earthquake Causes Train Delays</h1>
            <p>A 5.1 magnitude earthquake happened in Chiayi Dapu this afternoon. The Taiwan High Speed Rail (HSR) said that some trains will be late. This is because a warning system turned on between Chiayi and Tainan, and one train (number 242) stopped.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration reported that the earthquake happened today at 4:37 PM. It was 10.4 kilometers deep. The center of the earthquake was 36.3 kilometers southeast of the Chiayi County Government. The strongest shaking was level 4 in Chiayi County, Tainan City, and Kaohsiung City.</p>
            <p>The HSR company stated that due to the earthquake in Chiayi, the warning system between Chiayi and Tainan was activated. This caused train number 242 to stop. The HSR followed its normal steps for earthquakes.</p>
            <p>The HSR explained that because the earthquake warning reached level 2 in some areas, trains must slowly speed up in 5 steps to be safe. Trains first move slowly (less than 45 kilometers per hour). Then they slowly go faster: 70 km/h, 120 km/h, 170 km/h, and 230 km/h. Workers are now checking the trains and the tracks. Other workers are riding the trains to inspect them and test how the tracks move.</p>
            <p>The HSR company said that this earthquake will cause some trains to be late. They apologize for any trouble this causes passengers.</p>
            <p>For regular trains, Taiwan Railway (TRA) said that Xinying felt level 4 shaking. Trains between Chiayi and Shanhua will follow level 4 earthquake rules. Chiayi, Shanhua, Tainan, and Gangshan felt level 3 shaking. Trains between Dounan and Chiayi, Shanhua and Kaohsiung, and on the Shalun Line will follow level 3 rules.</p>
            <p>According to TRA rules, if there is a level 4 earthquake, the first train goes at 30 kilometers per hour. From the second train, they go at 60 kilometers per hour until the next station. Track and electricity workers check the lines. If everything is okay, trains go back to normal speed. For a level 3 earthquake, the first train goes at 60 kilometers per hour to the next station and checks the tracks. If there are no problems, from the second train, they go back to normal speed.</p>

            <h1>Minister Talks with Medical Device Companies, Shares 6 Ways to Help Them Grow</h1>
            <p>The Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, recently met with medical device companies. He talked about problems like new taxes from the United States and changes in the New Taiwan Dollar's value. He said the ministry will focus on 6 main areas to help these companies improve and grow. This will also make them more competitive around the world. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has also been meeting with other export industries like textile, metal, semiconductor, car parts, and electronics companies.</p>
            <p>Yesterday afternoon, Minister Kuo Chih-hui led a meeting called "Medical Device Industry Roundtable." He invited 12 small and medium-sized medical device and biotech companies. These companies send products to the US and have won important awards. They discussed US tax rules, currency changes, and how small companies can do business in other countries. They wanted to hear ideas to find good ways to help.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that the medical biotech industry is very important for Taiwan's future. The Ministry of Economic Affairs wants to help companies make valuable and new products. They also want companies to use AI technology to quickly create smart medical devices and new products. This will help them stay ahead and find new markets.</p>
            <p>To deal with US taxes and New Taiwan Dollar changes, Mr. Kuo said the Ministry of Economic Affairs is making stronger plans in 6 main areas. These plans will help the medical device industry improve and become more competitive. First, they will focus on special markets and make products or services that fit specific customer needs. This will help them be different from other companies. Second, they will try to be flexible and fast to improve quickly and create more value. This will help them keep their strong position in the global market. Third, they will help small and medium-sized companies with new ideas by making rules simple and quick. They will also give money to help companies change and grow.</p>
            <p>Fourth, on August 14, the Ministry of Economic Affairs opened a new office in Dallas, USA. It's called the Taiwan Trade and Investment Center. This office will help connect companies' supply chains and sales paths, so they can work together better. Fifth, they plan to build industry areas in the US to help companies set up there. They will also help companies make better products, use digital tools, and work internationally to find new markets and customers. Last, they will work with public and private banks and a special fund for small and medium companies. They will offer easy, cheap, and low-risk ways for these companies to manage currency changes and reduce financial risks.</p>
            <p>Companies at the meeting said that recent changes in the New Taiwan Dollar's value have made it hard to get new orders and caused them to lose money. They hope the government can help keep the currency value stable.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that currency values change based on what people buy and sell in the market. The Ministry of Economic Affairs continues to watch currency changes. They also work with banks to offer different financial support plans. This includes special loans for small businesses. Also, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the special fund for small and medium companies have a new plan to help with currency risks. This plan gives an extra guarantee of NT$60 million to each company and does not charge fees until the end of this year. This will help small and medium companies when currency values change.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that since the US announced higher import taxes in April this year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has met often with export industries like textiles, metals, semiconductors, car parts, and electronics. They will continue to visit companies, listen to what they need, and get ideas. Through good plans and money, they will help Taiwan's medical device industry become stronger. They will also help build a strong global supply chain that lasts a long time, and reduce how much currency changes affect small and medium businesses.</p>

            <h1>Shinkong Synthetic Fibers: Bad Problems Are Gone, Expect Better Second Half of the Year</h1>
            <p>Shinkong Synthetic Fibers held a meeting with investors today. The general manager, Ou Chin-ta, said that the first half of this year was difficult because of many negative things. But now, special taxes are clear, money exchange rates are stable, and shipping costs are lower. The main bad problems are gone. He thinks the second half of the year will be much better.</p>
            <p>In the second quarter, Shinkong lost NT$108 million. Last year, in the same period, they made NT$441 million profit. So, they went from making money to losing money. They lost NT$0.07 for each share. This is the first time they lost money in a quarter since late 2015. For the first half of the year, Shinkong made NT$20.103 billion in sales. This is 10.3% less than last year. Their profit was NT$288 million, which is 63.7% less than last year. They earned NT$0.18 for each share after taxes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ou explained today that Shinkong's business in the first half of the year was not as good as they hoped. This was because of four main bad factors. First, there was very strong competition in China, which caused prices to be too low. Second, the New Taiwan Dollar quickly became stronger in May, which caused big problems with money exchange. Third, in early April, the US announced new taxes, so customers waited and did not buy goods. Fourth, shipping costs became very high because everyone rushed to send goods when taxes were on hold. Mr. Ou said that shipping costs to the US in May were even three times higher than at the end of April.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ou said that besides China's low-price competition, the other bad factors have become less serious or are gone. Special taxes are now set, so customers are ordering normally again. The New Taiwan Dollar's value has recently gone down a bit. Also, sea shipping costs have returned to a normal level. Overall, he believes that "the second half of the year is moving in a good direction."</p>
            <p>To deal with China's low-price competition, Shinkong tries to sell its products in different markets. Two years ago, they built a new factory in Thailand, called Taisin. This factory mainly makes environmentally friendly recycled polyester, called r-PET. Mr. Ou said that this part of their business is not much affected by China's low prices.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ou said that big international drink companies, such as Coca-Cola, NestlÃ©, Japan's Suntory, Kirin, and Asahi, have set goals for how much r-PET they will use by 2025 or 2030. This means that there will be a clear need for this product in the future.</p>
            <p>Shinkong's Taisin factory is currently using about 80% of its machines. It has been approved by the US FDA. They also expect to get approvals for food-grade products from Japan and Thailand in the last three months of the year. This will help them sell more products.</p>
            <p>Also, Shinkong is working on different types of business. In 2022, they won a contract for a project called "You Shih Youth Entrepreneurship Village and Smart Manufacturing Park." They got the right to use the land for 50 years. The park is now being built. They plan to make it the largest center for smart unmanned vehicles in northern Taiwan. It will have areas for making, researching, testing, and getting licenses for these vehicles. This made people think the company's stock would do very well. Today, when asked by investors, Mr. Ou said that Shinkong only provides the space and does not make drones themselves.</p>
            <p>Shinkong's stock price has been strong recently. In less than half a month, it went up from NT$12.55 to NT$19.2 on August 19. This is an increase of more than 50%. After that, it went down from the highest point. Today, it closed a little higher at NT$16.6.</p>
