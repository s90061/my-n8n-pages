            <h1>Schroder Scores 26 Points, Makes 12 Assists; Germany Beats Finland to Reach EuroBasket Final</h1>
            <p>Germany showed its strength and experience today. They won against Finland with a score of 98 to 86. This win means Germany is the first team to reach the EuroBasket championship game.</p>
            <p>This is the first time Germany has reached the EuroBasket final since 2005. They are now hoping to win their second championship cup, after winning one in 1993.</p>
            <p>Dennis Schroder, a point guard for the NBA's Sacramento Kings and a member of the world champion German team, scored 26 points and gave 12 assists. He led his team to stop Finland's surprising dream of winning the title. Schroder made 4 three-point shots and scored on all 10 of his free throws.</p>
            <p>Another NBA star on the German team, Franz Wagner, a forward for the Orlando Magic, scored 22 points. In the second quarter, he made two three-point shots in a row. This helped Germany get ahead by a lot, making the score 49 to 30. This was Germany's biggest lead in the whole game.</p>
            <p>For Finland, Olivier Nkamhoua played the best, scoring 22 points. Lauri Markkanen, a forward for the Utah Jazz, scored 16 points. In the last part of the third quarter, Finland almost caught up, being only 6 points behind. Finland tried hard to come back, but they could not stop Germany from winning.</p>
            <p>Germany will play against Greece or Turkey in the championship game. The game between Greece and Turkey will happen later today.</p>

            <h1>Suspect Arrested in Shooting of U.S. Conservative Influencer Kirk; Bullets Had Anti-Fascist Messages</h1>
            <p>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and supporter of U.S. President Trump, was recently shot and killed at an event in Utah. Today, authorities confirmed that the suspect has been caught. They also revealed that the bullets used had anti-fascist messages carved on them.</p>
            <p>Kirk was 31 years old. He died after being shot in the neck while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Utah. A video from the event shows him speaking to a crowd. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and he fell into his chair. The camera quickly moved away, and the people watching became very scared.</p>
            <p>Kirk was an important supporter of Donald Trump. He was also a well-known internet personality and a leader in the young conservative movement. He had millions of followers on social media. People liked him because he was smart with editing, and he was good at responding to people who tried to cause trouble or disagreed with his ideas.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that U.S. authorities said today that after Kirk was shot, they found two unused bullets. These bullets had anti-fascist messages carved on their shells.</p>
            <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox held a press conference. He said that one bullet shell had "Hey, fascist! Take this!" written on it. The other one had "Bella Ciao" carved on it. This seems to be from an Italian anti-fascist song from World War II called "Bella Ciao."</p>
            <p>Governor Cox also said that the police have caught Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Kirk's shooting. On the evening of September 11, a family member of Robinson contacted a family friend. This friend then told the Washington County Sheriff's Office that Robinson had admitted or suggested he was involved in the crime.</p>
            <p>He also said that Robinson's family told investigators that Robinson had become "more political" in recent years. This family member remembered a dinner party where Robinson mentioned that Kirk was going to Utah Valley University. Robinson also talked about why he did not like Kirk and his ideas.</p>
            <p>It is understood that Robinson told his family he believed "Kirk was full of hate and spread hate."</p>
