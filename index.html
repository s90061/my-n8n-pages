            <h1>Financial Times: Trump Tries to Push EU Limits, Asks for 15% to 20% Minimum Tariffs</h1>
            <p>(Brussels, July 18, Central News Agency) Three people who know about the talks said that US President Trump has asked for more in trade talks with the European Union (EU). He wants any agreement with the EU to have a minimum tax on goods of 15% to 20%.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times reported that after weeks of talks about how to make an agreement, Trump became tougher. This is to see how much the EU can take. The plan was to keep the basic tax on most goods at 10%.</p>
            <p>The people who know said that Trump did not care about the EU's newest idea to lower taxes on cars. He said he was happy to keep the 25% tax on cars as planned.</p>
            <p>A US official told the Financial Times that even if they make a deal, the US government is now thinking about putting a similar tax rate of more than 10% on EU goods.</p>
            <p>This situation puts the EU in a difficult spot. This is because Trump said that if they do not make a deal by August 1, he will put a 30% tax on all goods from the EU.</p>
            <p>The EU has said it will react strongly to the US move. But people inside the EU have different ideas about whether to fight back. Also, the EU might have to accept a basic tax of more than 10% in any agreement.</p>
            <p>EU foreign officials said yesterday that if the EU cannot make a trade deal with the US, the EU leaders will prepare a list of planned limits for US service companies, including big technology companies.</p>

            <h1>Former President Bolsonaro on Trial for Coup Attempt, Brazilian Police Search His Home</h1>
            <p>(BrasÃ­lia, July 18, Central News Agency) After a judge in Brazil limited the freedom of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of trying to start a coup, his son said today that police raided Bolsonaro's home.</p>
            <p>News reports from AFP and Reuters say that Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is a member of parliament, recently went to the US to get support for his father. He wrote on social media platform X that the federal police "raided my father's home this morning."</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro strongly criticized his opponent, high court judge Alexandre de Moraes. Moraes today ordered the former far-right president to wear an electronic ankle tag and not leave his home at night.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro is accused of trying to make the 2022 presidential election win by Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva invalid. Moraes is one of the judges in this case. Moraes said these steps are needed because of Bolsonaro and his son's "unfriendly actions" against Brazil.</p>
            <p>Before this, US President Trump announced a 50% tax rate on Brazil. He said this was because Brazil was doing a "witch hunt" against his friend Bolsonaro.</p>
            <p>After the Brazilian federal police raided Bolsonaro's home and his party's main office, he told Reuters in an interview that if he gets his passport back, he will meet with Trump.</p>
            <p>Judge Moraes ordered Bolsonaro's passport to be taken last year. Because Bolsonaro is suspected of working with Trump to interfere with his trial for the alleged coup, Moraes today increased the searches and limits on Bolsonaro.</p>
            <p>Also, Bolsonaro told Reuters that he wants his son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, who is a member of parliament, to try to become a US citizen and not return from the US.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro said he talks to his son at least every two days. Eduardo Bolsonaro speaks his mind and is a friend of Trump. He is currently in Washington to get support for his father.</p>
