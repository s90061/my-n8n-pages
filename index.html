            <h1>Internet Star Says Famous Restaurant Uses Pre-made Food, China to Introduce National Rules</h1>
            <p>An internet star named Luo Yonghao said that a famous chain restaurant, Xibei, used pre-made food. This means food that is cooked earlier and then heated up to serve. Xibei strongly disagreed, and this fight became a very popular topic in China for many days. News says that China's National Health Commission has checked a new plan for national food safety rules for pre-made food. These rules will say that restaurants must tell customers if they use pre-made food.</p>
            <p>News from Chinese media said that Luo Yonghao wrote on Weibo on September 10th. He said that he ate at Xibei with his friends and found that "almost all the food was pre-made, and it was expensive." He felt it was "very unpleasant." He asked for a law to make restaurants clearly say if they use pre-made food.</p>
            <p>The next day, Jia Guolong, the founder of Xibei, took many reporters to the Xibei restaurant in Beijing where Luo Yonghao ate. Jia Guolong said that Xibei does not use any pre-made food. He also said that all 370-plus Xibei kitchens across China would be open for customers to see. He also let people taste the 13 dishes Luo Yonghao ordered to check them. He also said he would sue Luo Yonghao.</p>
            <p>Luo Yonghao quickly replied, "Okay, let's do it. If it's not pre-made food, then that's amazing. If they can make freshly cooked food taste like it's all reheated, that must be high-tech." He offered a reward of 100,000 Chinese yuan (about 425,000 New Taiwan Dollars) for legal proof that Xibei uses pre-made food.</p>
            <p>Reports say that companies under Xibei have many patents related to pre-made food. Luo Yonghao also showed a report from the People's Daily Online Research Institute from July 2023. This report showed that more than 80% of dishes in chain restaurants like Xibei are pre-made.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Luo Yonghao spoke live online. He said that many pictures shared online show that some food items in Xibei stores, like boneless yellow croaker fillets, beef sauce for kids' meals, chicken, and pork ribs with pickled cabbage, can be kept for 9 months. Lamb ribs can be kept for 24 months. He said the sea bass he ate at Xibei tasted very fishy, like it had been frozen for a long time. But Xibei's public relations team said it was fresh.</p>
            <p>Luo Yonghao gave an example of a sea bass seen in Xibei's kitchen, shown by the media. Its ingredients included several additives like sodium tripolyphosphate and sodium hexametaphosphate. It could be kept for 18 months. He questioned if this was fresh fish or "factory-made preserved food."</p>
            <p>This argument about pre-made food, started by Luo Yonghao, has really hurt Xibei's business. On September 12th, Jia Guolong said that the damage to Xibei was clear. Their income dropped by 2 to 3 million each day. About how he handled it, he said, "It's better not to do business than not to argue when something is wrong."</p>
            <p>Many famous restaurant owners supported Xibei. Yu Donglai, the boss of the famous supermarket Pang Dong Lai, also wrote a post to support Xibei. But he later deleted it, possibly because many people online disagreed.</p>
            <p>Luo Yonghao said that his goal was not to attack Xibei or Mr. Jia. Instead, he wanted to make the pre-made food industry in China more open and ensure customers know what they are eating.</p>
            <p>First Financial News reported today that the plan for China's national food safety rules for pre-made food, led by the National Health Commission, has passed its review. It will soon be open for public comments.</p>
            <p>An expert involved in writing the rules said, "This standard mainly sets the definitions and food safety requirements." The plan gives clear rules for how pre-made food is categorized, what ingredients it uses, how it is processed, how it is stored and transported, and how it is tested. It also says for the first time that "no preservatives" must be added.</p>
            <p>A food expert mentioned in the report said that this event is both bad and good for the pre-made food industry. It will surely make government departments pay attention and help the national food safety standards for pre-made food come out faster.</p>
            <p>He also said that supervision over food businesses needs to be stronger. Restaurants should be encouraged to openly share information about their use of pre-made food. By doing this, the industry can control itself better and create a good dining experience for everyone.</p>
            <p>Chinese industry experts believe that new rules for pre-made food will likely ask for "no preservatives and better cold storage." This could increase costs by 15% to 30%. Smaller factories might not be able to pay for the changes. They could be bought by bigger companies or close within two years after the national standard takes effect. However, big brands might grow even more because of their size.</p>

            <h1>New Money Sharing Law: 9 Cities and Counties in Taiwan Will Get Less Money</h1>
            <p>Besides a mistake in the formula for the new Financial Allocation Act (a law about how money is shared), Hsu Yung-yi, who is in charge of public budgets at the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS), said today that nine cities and counties will receive less money. These places are Tainan City, Changhua County, Chiayi County, Pingtung County, Penghu County, Keelung City, Kinmen County, Lienchiang County, and Chiayi City. They will get less money than before the law was changed.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai invited local leaders to talk about problems with the Financial Allocation Act. These problems include arguments, how power is shared, mistakes in the formula, and the growing difference between cities and rural areas. In the afternoon meeting, many people came, including Mayors Lu Shiow-yen of Taichung, Huang Wei-che of Tainan, Huang Min-hui of Chiayi City, and county heads and other local officials.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, the Executive Yuan held a press conference. Premier Cho Jung-tai, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun, Secretary-General Chang Tun-han, Minister of Finance Chuang Tsui-yun, and DGBAS Director-General Chen Shu-tzu were there for the afternoon press conference.</p>
            <p>At the morning press conference, Chen Shu-tzu reported that in 2026, the central government will give local governments a record high of 1.165 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. However, she noted that nine cities and counties will still receive less money than they did before the law was updated.</p>
            <p>During the afternoon press conference, reporters asked which nine cities and counties would get less money. Hsu Yung-yi said the places that will receive less are Tainan City, Changhua County, Chiayi County, Pingtung County, Penghu County, Keelung City, Kinmen County, Lienchiang County, and Chiayi City.</p>
            <p>The central government gives money to local governments in three main ways: shared tax money, general grants, and project grants. For the shared tax money, the Ministry of Finance recently calculated using the new Financial Allocation Act's formula. It found that next year, the central government will give local governments 884.09 billion New Taiwan Dollars in shared tax money. This is an increase of 416.51 billion New Taiwan Dollars compared to this year.</p>
            <p>Regarding general grants and project grants, Chen Shu-tzu explained that these are ways the central government helps local governments with tasks they should do themselves. The responsibility for these tasks belongs to the local governments. So, these tasks will be handled by the local governments first. For tasks that the central government took over from the provincial government, the money has been given to local governments. But the official responsibility can only be fully moved after future law changes.</p>
            <p>Chen Shu-tzu also mentioned that this is why the central government will change what general grants and project grants cover. However, local governments might find that some general grants are given based on calculations, not on applications. So, the DGBAS will talk with different government departments to make the application process simpler.</p>
            <p>According to DGBAS information, for 2026, local governments will decide how to use the money they receive for certain items. For general grants, this includes money for clearing waterways, building and buying vehicles for police and fire stations, education support like electricity and water for school lunches, money saved from pension reforms, and special retirement help for teachers. Local governments will also pay for their basic income and spending differences. For project grants, local governments will pay for things like improving road quality, strengthening and rebuilding dangerous public buildings, cultural area development plans, and improving funeral facilities.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Army Says 250,000 People Left Gaza City; UN Estimates 1 Million Residents</h1>
            <p>The Israeli army said today that more than 250,000 people have left Gaza City in the past few weeks. They have moved to other parts of the Gaza Strip. This happened while the Israeli army increased its attacks on Gaza City, which is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Avichay Adraee, who speaks for the Israeli army in Arabic, wrote on social media platform X. He said, "The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) estimate that more than 250,000 residents of Gaza City have moved out of the city for their safety."</p>
            <p>However, the United Nations (UN) believes that about 1 million Palestinian people live in Gaza City and the areas around it.</p>
            <p>The UN and other countries have already warned about the Israeli army's attacks on Gaza City. They are worried that this will make the difficult living conditions for people there even worse.</p>
            <p>Many countries are asking Israel to stop fighting. But Israel still says it will attack Gaza City. They see Gaza City as one of the last main places where Hamas is based. Israel wants to destroy this Palestinian group.</p>
            <p>Today, the Israeli army dropped papers from the sky in the western part of Gaza City. These papers told people to leave. They said, "The Israeli army is fighting very strongly in your area... For your safety, please leave now... Go south of Wadi Gaza (Gaza Dry River)."</p>
