            <h1>Fortune Global 500: Six Taiwanese Companies on the List, TSMC Jumps 60 Spots</h1>
            <p>New York, July 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ Fortune magazine recently released its 2025 list of the world's 500 biggest companies. Six Taiwanese companies are on the list. Hon Hai (Foxconn) is ranked 28th, and TSMC is ranked 126th, moving up 60 spots.</p>
            <p>This year, the Fortune Global 500 companies together made 41.7 trillion US dollars in revenue. This is 1.8% more than in 2023. It is also more than one-third of the world's total economic output (GDP). These companies also employ 70.1 million people.</p>
            <p>Walmart, a big retail company from the US, is number one for the 12th year in a row. It has been number one 20 times since 1995.</p>
            <p>The top 10 companies this year are mostly the same as last year. But after the top 10, many technology companies moved up a lot. For example, Meta Platforms, the US social media company that owns Facebook and Instagram, moved up 25 spots to 41st place.</p>
            <p>Nvidia, a big company that makes AI chips, moved up even more, by 156 spots, to 66th place. BYD, a large Chinese electric car company, also moved up 52 spots to 91st place.</p>
            <p>The six Taiwanese companies on the list this year are Hon Hai (28th), TSMC (126th), Quanta (348th), Pegatron (461st), CPC Corporation, Taiwan (494th), and Wistron (496th). Quanta moved up 96 spots from last year. (Translator: Chen Zhengjian/Editor: Zhang Zhengqian) 1140731</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Tesla Buys LFP Batteries from South Korea's LG Energy Solution to Reduce Dependence on China</h1>
            <p>Seoul, July 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ Reuters reports that the American electric car company Tesla is trying to rely less on products imported from China because of tariffs. For this reason, Tesla has signed a contract worth 4.3 billion US dollars (about 128 billion New Taiwan Dollars) with LG Energy Solution from South Korea. This contract is for batteries for energy storage systems.</p>
            <p>One person who knows about the deal also said that LG Energy Solution (LGES) will send the LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries to Tesla from its factory in Michigan, USA.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, LG Energy Solution announced that it had signed a 3-year contract worth 4.3 billion US dollars to supply LFP batteries globally. However, the company did not say who the customer was or if the batteries would be for cars or for energy storage systems.</p>
            <p>Tesla's Chief Financial Officer, Vaibhav Taneja, said in April that US tariffs had a "very big" effect on Tesla's energy business because Tesla buys LFP batteries from China.</p>
            <p>At that time, he also said: "We will also try to get more supplies from other places outside of China, but this will take time." (Translator: Zhang Zhengqian/Editor: Chen Zhengjian) 1140731</p>

            <h1>Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates Unchanged Again, Resisting Pressure from Trump</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ The US Federal Reserve (Fed) decided today in its meeting to keep interest rates the same. This decision was made even though President Trump kept asking them to lower rates.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports that the Fed officials want to wait and see the economic data from this summer. This is because Donald Trump's tariff policies are always changing, and the effect of tariffs on prices appears later. They want to see how prices are affected before deciding.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve met from July 29 to 30. During the meeting, they thought about changing interest rates. They also tried to find a balance between controlling inflation (rising prices) and making sure there is a strong job market.</p>
            <p>But the Fed's way of waiting for data made Trump angry. Trump has often criticized Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for not lowering interest rates further. (Translator: Chen Zhengjian/Editor: Yang Zhaoyan) 1140731</p>
