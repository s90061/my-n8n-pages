            <h1>Mai Meets Harlem Yu Again, Jokes That Her Recording Made Him Have a Stomachache</h1>
            <p>The artist Mai came back to Taiwan to join a TV show hosted by Harlem Yu. When they met again, they felt emotional. Mai saw Harlem Yu and said, "Harlem, you helped us record music back then, and it gave you a stomachache." Harlem Yu joked back, "Not just a stomachache, my head hurt too."</p>
            <p>Mai came to Taiwan to record the show "Ha! The Truth is Revealed," hosted by Harlem Yu. She shared in a press release about starting her career in Taiwan. She remembered meeting Harlem for the first time on the CTS show "Super Sunday" and recording songs. She said, "When I first met Harlem, I couldn't speak Chinese at all." But now, she can understand questions and answer them well. Mai also mentioned that Harlem helped her write songs and record them in the past. She said, "I made your stomach hurt." Harlem replied playfully, "Not just my stomach, my head also hurt, everywhere hurt."</p>
            <p>Harlem also asked Mai about her recent life change, "Are you going to return to performing?" Mai firmly said, "Yes! And I am single now."</p>
            <p>The show asked about rules for foreign workers. Mai, as a foreign worker, said her work permit has detailed information. It says things like "TV shows, news interviews, events." She also explained that she "cannot earn money in other places, like working part-time at a convenience store."</p>
            <p>"Ha! The Truth is Revealed" is a game show that combines checking facts and understanding false information. It helps viewers learn how to spot wrong information while having fun. It airs every Monday to Wednesday at 9 PM on PTS and is also available on PTS+. After airing, episodes are put on YouTube every Thursday to Saturday at 8 PM.</p>

            <h1>Korea's Liberation Day Will Pardon Over 830,000 People, Including Former Leader of Innovation Party Cho Kuk</h1>
            <p>The South Korean government announced today the list of people who will be pardoned on August 15, Liberation Day. The list includes Cho Kuk, the former leader of the Innovation Party, and his wife. It also includes business people like Choi Shin-won, former head of SK Networks, and Choi Jee-sung, former vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported that South Korean President Lee Jae-myung held a meeting today in the afternoon. They approved the pardon list for Liberation Day, which was suggested by the Ministry of Justice's pardon review committee. In total, 836,687 people will receive a special pardon. This includes many people from the ruling party who were investigated and sentenced during the time of former Presidents Moon Jae-in and Yoon Suk-yeol.</p>
            <p>The report suggests that this decision might be to satisfy supporters and to keep the government's plans moving forward. Not only were many ruling party members pardoned, but also Cho Kuk and his wife, who are controversial and recently went to prison. Cho Kuk was sent to prison last December. This was after a court decided he should serve 2 years in jail for cases like cheating related to his children's university admissions. Because of this, he cannot run for president, even though he was seen as a strong candidate for the next election.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuk's wife, Jung Kyung-sim, was also sentenced last December. She received 1 year in prison and 2 years of probation for faking documents related to her son's university entry.</p>
            <p>A survey by the South Korean polling company Realmeter, done between August 4 and 8, asked 2,506 adults. It showed that President Lee Jae-myung's approval rating dropped to 56.5%. This is 6.8 percentage points lower than the week before. Analysis shows that young people still feel it is "unfair" and "double standards" regarding Cho Kuk and his wife's cheating for their children's education. This feeling of unhappiness about the pardon list has affected the President's approval rating.</p>

            <h1>Fierce Competition: ASMPT Closes Shenzhen Advanced Semiconductor Equipment Factory</h1>
            <p>ASMPT, a company based in Singapore that makes semiconductors and electronic parts, announced today that it will close its factory in Shenzhen's Bao'an District. This factory makes advanced semiconductor equipment. The company said this is a plan to make its manufacturing in China better.</p>
            <p>ASMPT sent out a press release today. It said that to improve its manufacturing in China, it has decided to close Advanced Semiconductor Equipment (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd., which is in Shenzhen's Bao'an District. This factory is part of the company's semiconductor solutions division. Closing the factory will affect about 950 workers.</p>
            <p>ASMPT stated that this was a hard decision. However, it is a necessary step to make ASMPT's global supply chain better. This will help the company meet changing market and customer needs. It is expected to make the company's factories around the world more competitive in terms of cost, more flexible, and stronger in their operations.</p>
            <p>ASMPT also said that its operations at other important manufacturing sites worldwide will not be affected. It added that its supply chain is fully organized, so the quality and supply of products and services will not be affected.</p>
            <p>In recent years, many semiconductor companies in China have closed down. This is due to many problems, like a weak economy, less spending by people, and technology limits led by the United States. Hong Kong media reported before that in 2022, 5,746 semiconductor companies in China applied to close. This was a 68% increase from 3,420 companies in 2021.</p>
