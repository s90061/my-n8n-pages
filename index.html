            <h1>Paper Windmill Art Project Goes to Yilan, Old Tree Tells Local Stories</h1>
            <p>The "Paper Windmill 368 Town and City Children's Art Project â€“ Sustainable Journey" continues to travel around Taiwan. Today, it was held at the square in front of Yilan Sports Park. The Paper Windmill's big old tree told local Yilan stories. More than 2,200 parents and children came to watch.</p>
            <p>The Paper Windmill Cultural and Educational Foundation released a press statement today. It said that this performance, called "Taiwan Fantasia," has four different parts. "Don Quixote" encourages children to bravely follow their dreams and face problems. "The Attack of Leftover Food" is a fun and interactive show. It helps children understand why it's important to value food. "The Joy of Celebration" is a magic-like black light show. With lights and colors, it kept the children looking closely.</p>
            <p>This year is special because the Lin Deng Cultural and Educational Foundation, one of the sponsors, is 35 years old. The Paper Windmill Theater also created a special "local story" part for its first show in Yilan. The big old tree told the beautiful legend of General Gui and Princess Kavalana falling in love. They became Guishan Island and Lanyang Plain, watching over each other from far away. The story also included the life of Lin Deng, a person from Yilan. This showed the strong local warmth of Yilan.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian-han, the chairman of Zhongxing Security Cultural and Educational Foundation, gave a speech. He said he was very happy to work with Paper Windmill on the 368 Art Project. They have worked together since 1999. "Today's show has a small part about my grandfather Lin Deng's story. I hope children and adults in Yilan can learn about his spirit of helping Yilan." Finally, a video was shown to thank the late CEO of Zhongxing Security Cultural and Educational Foundation, Zhuang Su-zhu, for her support.</p>
            <p>Lin Mao-sheng, the acting county chief of Yilan County, said that through theater performances, children and adults can enjoy art and also learn a lot. Yilan City Mayor Chen Mei-ling said, "Thank you to the three Zhongxing Security foundations for helping Yilan for a long time. We are very grateful that the first Paper Windmill 368 project in Yilan County is in Yilan City, bringing happiness."</p>
            <p>Ren Jian-cheng, the head of the Paper Windmill Theater, said that every time they come to Yilan, they feel the audience's warm applause and laughter. "This is what keeps us going."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan People's Party Supports Ko Wen-je, 8 Police Officers Injured; Chiang Wan-an Calls to Check</h1>
            <p>Former Taiwan People's Party Chairman Ko Wen-je has been held for almost one year because of a case. Today, Taiwan People's Party Chairman Huang Kuo-chang started a "walking and reading" event. During this event, people pulled and pushed with the police. This caused 8 police officers to get hurt. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he called Police Chief Li Xi-he to ask about the situation.</p>
            <p>The Zhongzheng First Police Precinct of the Taipei City Police Department released a news statement. It said that this morning, Huang Kuo-chang gathered almost a thousand people. They walked towards the President's residence as part of a "walking and reading" activity. During the event, people kept pushing forward, pushing police officers, and moving barriers. They tried to enter a protest-restricted area along the south sidewalk of Aiguo West Road. This led to 8 police officers being injured. This action might break the Assembly and Parade Act. The police will report it to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for investigation.</p>
            <p>Before attending the Taipei International Food Festival today, Chiang Wan-an was stopped by reporters. He said he called Li Xi-he to check on the injured police officers and also on people at the scene who might have heatstroke. He asked people to understand the hard work of police officers and to be careful for their own safety.</p>
