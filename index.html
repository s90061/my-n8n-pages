            <h1>Portugal Considers Recognizing Palestine as a State in September</h1>
            <p>The office of Portugal's Prime Minister, Mr. Luis Montenegro, announced today that the Portuguese government will talk to the president and the parliament. They will discuss recognizing Palestine as a state in September, during the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
            <p>A statement from Mr. Montenegro's office said that Portugal "is thinking about recognizing Palestine as a state." This process might finish in September at the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York.</p>
            <p>Recently, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada also said they plan to recognize Palestine as a state in September at the UN General Assembly. Now, Portugal has said it might do the same.</p>
            <p>Also, today, Germany's Foreign Minister, Mr. Johann Wadephul, spoke about the situation. He said that Israel is becoming more and more alone in diplomacy. This is because of the crisis for people in Gaza and because some countries want to recognize Palestine as a state.</p>
            <p>Before he left to visit Israel, Mr. Wadephul released a statement. He said that the United Nations recently had a meeting to discuss a "two-state solution" for the conflict between Israel and Palestine. He said this shows that "Israel is becoming a smaller group." The United States and Israel both refused to go to this meeting.</p>
            <p>Germany is one of Israel's best friends in diplomacy. But Mr. Wadephul said: "Some people in the Israeli government have openly said they might take over Palestinian land. Because of this, more and more European countries are ready to recognize Palestine as a state without talking to Israel first."</p>
            <p>Last week, more than 70 members of the Israeli parliament voted for a plan. They asked their government to officially take control of the West Bank, which they currently occupy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wadephul also said again that Germany's view is: "Palestine should only be recognized as a state after peace talks have finished." But he also used stronger words. He said, "This process must begin now," and "Germany might also have to react if there are actions taken by only one side."</p>
            <p>In addition, today, the Prime Minister of Sweden, Mr. Ulf Kristersson, asked the European Union (EU) to stop the trade part of its agreement with Israel. He said this is because of what Israel is doing in the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The EU and Israel have an "Association Agreement." This agreement sets the rules for their trade and political relationship. According to information from the EU, the EU is Israel's biggest trading partner. It makes up nearly one-third of all Israel's trade with other countries.</p>

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Hsieh Cheng-chun Plays Well in Pitching and Hitting; Ku Meng-chieh Injured</h1>
            <p>In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Taiwan team's player Hsieh Cheng-chun had a tough game against Japan earlier. But today, in the first game of the Super Round against the Dominican Republic, he played very well. He helped the team win 9 to 4. He came in to pitch when the team was in a difficult situation and did great. He also hit well. Another player, Ku Meng-chieh, left the game because of an injury. He has received basic treatment, and doctors will keep checking on him.</p>
            <p>In the earlier games, Hsieh Cheng-chun started pitching against Japan and lost. He pitched for three innings and gave up four runs. But today, in the Super Round game against the Dominican Republic, he came into the game in the second inning when the other team had players on base. He stopped their attack. He pitched for 1.2 innings, made four batters strike out, and did not let the other team score any runs. He got the win as a pitcher. He also played well when he was hitting, getting two hits and one RBI (run batted in).</p>
            <p>After the game, the head coach of the Taiwan team, Mr. Zhang Zijian, said that Hsieh Cheng-chun's pitching in the last game was actually not bad. He said the Japanese team just hit the ball very well. After that game, the coach told Hsieh Cheng-chun to feel better because he would need to pitch again. The coach said they had to win today's game. When the team was in a difficult situation, the coach decided to let Hsieh Cheng-chun pitch. He showed great control and played very well.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Cheng-chun said he was not nervous when he had to pitch with other players on base. He said he is used to being in difficult situations like that. When he went to pitch, he just wanted to throw good balls for the batters to hit and let his teammates on defense help. He tried his best to do what the coaches asked him to do.</p>
            <p>Ku Meng-chieh, who usually bats fourth for the Taiwan team, was hit on the hand by the ball in his first turn at bat today. He then left the game to rest. Coach Zhang Zijian said that after basic medical care, they will continue to watch him. If the pain gets worse, they will send him to the hospital for more checks. They hope his injury is not serious.</p>

            <h1>World Athletics to Start SRY Gender Testing in September; Only Negative Results Allowed for Women's Events</h1>
            <p>World Athletics has announced that starting this September, all female athletes who compete in top-level events must take a genetic test.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, this test will officially start before the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, which will be from September 13 to 21.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sebastian Coe, the head of World Athletics, said: "Athletics has always tried to get more women to join. It is very important for them to feel that there is no unfair limit based on their bodies in sports."</p>
            <p>"Checking someone's biological sex with a test is a very important step to make sure this happens."</p>
            <p>The test looks for the SRY gene, which is a part of the Y chromosome. This gene helps male features develop. Athletes can choose to take the test by using a cotton swab inside their mouth or by giving a blood sample.</p>
            <p>If an athlete's test result is negative, they will be allowed to compete in women's events that are part of the world rankings.</p>
            <p>If an athlete's test result is positive, they can only join women's events that are not part of the world rankings, or other types of sports categories that are not only for women.</p>
            <p>Each sports association that is a member will be in charge of doing these tests.</p>
            <p>World Athletics said that this test is "very accurate." They also said that there is a "very small chance" of getting a wrong result, either negative or positive.</p>
            <p>The SRY gene test is also the method that World Boxing (WB) is using this year for their required gender tests.</p>
            <p>On July 30, Mr. Coe released a statement. He said: "Now, for top-level sports events, if an athlete wants to play in the women's group, they must be a biological female."</p>
