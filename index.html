            <h1>Fed Rate Cut Almost Certain, New Taiwan Dollar Rises to 30.522</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 8 (CNA) The US job report showed fewer new jobs than expected. This means the US central bank will likely lower interest rates in September. Because of this, the US dollar became weaker, and the Taiwan stock market went up. The New Taiwan Dollar quickly became stronger by 1.61 cents during the day. However, the central bank worked to slow down the strong rise. The New Taiwan Dollar closed at 30.522, which is 9.3 cents stronger. This is its highest value in almost half a month. The total amount of money exchanged in Taipei and Yuan Tai foreign exchange markets was 1.8675 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>The latest US job numbers were much lower than people thought. This shows that the job market is cooling down very quickly. It is almost certain that the US central bank will cut interest rates in September. This caused the US dollar to fall, and other currencies became stronger.</p>
            <p>Even though the job numbers made people worry a little about the US economy, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which is closely linked to Taiwan's stock market, went up. Also, the Taipei International Semiconductor Exhibition is coming soon, making semiconductor-related stocks popular and helping the Taiwan stock market rise.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan stock market started high in the morning and reached 24729.96 points, which is a new high during trading hours. By the end of the day, the increase was smaller, but it still closed at 24547.38 points, up by 52.8 points. This is a new record high for closing prices.</p>
            <p>With the US dollar getting weaker, money flowing into Taiwan, and the Taiwan stock market rising, the New Taiwan Dollar started at 30.60 against the US dollar today. It quickly became much stronger, passing 30.5, and reached its highest point at 30.454, a big increase of 1.61 cents. But the central bank worked harder to control the rise. It finally closed at 30.522, up by 9.3 cents, keeping the rise to less than 1 cent.</p>
            <p>A foreign exchange trader said that besides the weaker international US dollar, foreign investors and investment trusts brought money into Taiwan today. Exporters also waited and were not in a hurry to sell foreign currency. This made the currency get stronger in one direction. If the Taiwan stock market continues to do well and moves towards 25000 points, more money will flow in, which could make the New Taiwan Dollar continue to get stronger.</p>
            <p>The foreign exchange trader said that people should watch two things closely. First, how the Taiwan stock market moves. Second, the US central bank's meeting in September about interest rates. The market has mostly already reacted to the rate cut. However, whether the statement after the meeting is more gentle or strict, and whether there will be two or three rate cuts this year, will affect how the financial market develops later. It is expected that after the central bank's meeting, the market's direction will be clearer.</p>

            <h1>Former Technician in New Taipei Banqiao Office Charged for Helping Elevator Company</h1>
            <p>New Taipei, September 8 (CNA) A former technician named Zeng from the Public Works Section of the Banqiao District Office in New Taipei City is accused of creating false re-inspection reports. This allowed an elevator maintenance company to avoid paying at least NT$20,000 in late fees. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office has recently charged Mr. Zeng with helping a business for personal gain while working as a public official.</p>
            <p>According to the charges, Mr. Zeng worked as a technician in the Public Works Section of the Banqiao District Office in New Taipei City from February 25, 2022, to August 31, 2024. He was in charge of a project for "113 (2024) New Taipei City Banqiao District Fuzhong Pedestrian Bridge Elevator Maintenance and Repair" and was responsible for everything from bidding to later work and acceptance.</p>
            <p>A woman named Chen worked for the company that won the elevator maintenance project. She was responsible for preparing work photos and documents for the project. The contract said that the company had to maintain two elevators at Fuzhong MRT Station Exit 2 (the "Jieyunti" and "Cihuiti" elevators) in 2024. They needed to replace the elevator steel cables by mid-June 2024 and take photos. Within 7 days of replacing them, they had to send the photos to the district office. If they did not deliver or submit documents on time, they would be fined NT$1,000 for each day they were late.</p>
            <p>The company changed the main steel cable for the Jieyunti elevator on March 7 but did not send the information within 7 days as the contract stated. They also did not change the main steel cable for the Cihuiti elevator until July 9, 2024. On July 8, 2024, Mr. Zeng wrote in the acceptance record that the problems should be fixed by July 19. After that, Ms. Chen wrote false dates, pretending to tell the Banqiao District Office that the main steel cables for the Jieyunti and Cihuiti elevators were changed on May 27 and May 28, 2024, respectively. She used these false letters and work photos for the re-inspection.</p>
            <p>On July 19, 2024, in the re-inspection record, Mr. Zeng wrote that the company's updated information met the contract's rules. He also checked boxes saying "meets contract, drawings, and sample rules" and "not overdue." These were false statements. He pretended that the company had followed all contract rules, so the company did not have to pay at least NT$20,000 in late fees.</p>
            <p>Additionally, when submitting for acceptance and payment, Ms. Chen included photos of the Jieyunti elevator maintenance with false maintenance dates. She also changed the maintenance date for the Cihuiti elevator. This made people who did not know the truth believe that the company had finished the elevator repair and maintenance work, leading to the work being accepted and paid for.</p>
            <p>Also, Mr. Zeng admitted that when he handled the "112 (2023) New Taipei City Banqiao District Road Paving Material Supply" project, he checked boxes for "meets contract, drawings, and sample rules" in the acceptance results. This was false information. He pretended that the documents provided by the company met the contract rules, helping the company pass the acceptance process.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zeng and Ms. Chen both admitted what they did during the investigation. The prosecutors have charged Mr. Zeng with helping a business for personal gain as a public official and with making false public documents. Ms. Chen is charged with making false business documents.</p>
            <p>Regarding the accident where the Jieyunti elevator suddenly fell in 2024, injuring two people, the prosecutors said that a separate investigation is ongoing to see if the company was negligent.</p>
