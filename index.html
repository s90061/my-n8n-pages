            <h1>Trump and Regional Leaders Sign Gaza Agreement, Calls it a 'Great Day' for the Middle East</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump said that today was "a great day for the Middle East." He and several leaders from the region signed an agreement to make the Gaza ceasefire strong. This happened just a few hours after Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian group, exchanged hostages and prisoners.</p>
            <p>Trump made a quick visit to Israel. He gave a speech in the parliament and praised the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. After that, he flew to Egypt to join a meeting about Gaza. There, he signed the agreement with leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. This made him a guarantor, meaning he promised that the Gaza agreement would be kept.</p>
            <p>More than 20 world leaders were at the meeting in the resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Trump said, "Today is a great day for the world, and an even greater day for the Middle East."</p>
            <p>Before signing the agreement, Trump said, "This document will explain the rules, regulations, and many other things." He repeated twice that "this agreement will continue to be effective."</p>
            <p>Hamas released the last 20 hostages who had been held in Gaza for two years. This was part of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza. In return, the Israeli Prison Service said that Israel freed 1968 prisoners, most of whom were Palestinians.</p>
            <p>When Trump spoke to the Israeli parliament members, who gave him a long standing ovation when he arrived, he said, "From October 7th until this week, Israel has been a country at war, carrying a burden that only proud and deeply believing people can carry."</p>
            <p>He added, "For many families in this land, they have not experienced a truly peaceful day for many years. Not only for Israelis, but for Palestinians and many others, this long and painful nightmare has finally ended."</p>

            <h1>China Uses Rare Earths Again: US Treasury Secretary Bessent Explains Three Reasons</h1>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that China has put new controls on exporting rare earths. He believes there could be three reasons for this. First, China's economy is not doing well, so they might be focusing on their economic situation.</p>
            <p>Second, China might be against the United States' efforts to promote peace around the world. China has been helping wars by buying Russian oil and giving resources to war machines. The US has also asked China to stop buying oil from Iran, and this might be a reaction to that.</p>
            <p>The third reason could be that China made a wrong calculation before the leaders of the two countries are set to meet at the end of October in Korea. Bessent thinks that trying to play games with Donald Trump before a formal meeting is a bad idea. On October 10, Trump changed the situation by posting on social media that he would place new tariffs, or extra taxes, and necessary bans on goods from China.</p>
            <p>Bessent added, "This is a bad calculation. The US is still talking, and we are confident we can move forward."</p>
            <p>The TV host, Maria Bartiromo, asked if Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would still meet. She also asked if the new tariffs and other bans would start on November 1st, after their meeting.</p>
            <p>Bessent replied that Trump's message, which he posted on his social media, said that the tariffs could be put off for a while. This gives both sides time to meet and talk. Trump and Xi have a good personal relationship. Bessent believes Trump thinks that this decision might have come from lower-level officials in China.</p>
            <p>He explained that there are different groups within the Chinese system. It might not have been Xi Jinping's decision. It could have come from hardliners, who are people within China who want to hurt the relationship between the two countries.</p>

            <h1>Israel Frees 1968 Prisoners, Hamas Gives Back Two Hostage Bodies</h1>
            <p>The Israeli Prison Service announced today that Israel has released almost 2000 people who were held in prisons. Most of these people are Palestinians. This is part of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The Israeli army also said that Hamas gave the bodies of two Israeli hostages to the Red Cross today.</p>
            <p>According to news reports, the Israeli Prison Service stated that "a total of 1968 terrorists were moved from various prisons across the country to Ofer Prison and Ktziot Prison."</p>
            <p>The statement also said, "After finishing the necessary steps inside the prisons and getting approval from the political leaders, all terrorists have been released from Ofer Prison to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and from Ktziot Prison to Kerem Shalom." Kerem Shalom is a border crossing that leads to the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group, handed over the bodies of two Israeli hostages who were held in Gaza to the Red Cross today. They also expect two more hostage bodies to be handed over.</p>
            <p>The army stated, "Based on information from the Red Cross, the coffins of two dead hostages have been given to them. They are now being taken to the Gaza Strip, where the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency (ISA) will receive them."</p>
            <p>The Israeli army also added, "After this, two more coffins of dead hostages will be transferred."</p>
            <p>In other news, former US President Donald Trump met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas at a meeting about Gaza in Egypt today. This was their first meeting and handshake in eight years.</p>
