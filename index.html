            <h1>New Office to Handle Workplace Bullying, Fines Up to NT$1 Million</h1>
            <p>To follow new rules for protecting civil servants, a special office will open on October 20th. This office will deal with safety at work and cases of bullying. If a boss or head of a department is found to have bullied someone, they could be fined up to NT$1 million (about US$31,000).</p>
            <p>The Civil Service Protection and Training Commission (CSPTC) announced changes to its rules recently. These changes will start on October 20th this year.</p>
            <p>The CSPTC explained that new laws about protecting civil servants and keeping workplaces safe have been passed. Because of these new laws, the CSPTC has more responsibilities. So, they decided to combine some departments, create a new one, and add more staff.</p>
            <p>The new "Safety and Health Protection Office" will be in charge of eight main tasks. First, it will create and carry out plans for civil servants' safety and health at work. Second, it will check if different government offices are following safety rules and will tell them to make improvements if needed. Third, it will form groups to investigate serious accidents or deaths at work to find out what happened.</p>
            <p>Fourth, it will fine government offices that do not follow safety rules. Fifth, it will keep track of bullying cases involving bosses and department heads and issue fines. Sixth, it will teach people how to prevent accidents and bullying at work. Seventh, it will collect and study annual reports from government offices about safety measures. Eighth, it will handle other related tasks.</p>
            <p>Other departments within the CSPTC will also change. The "Protection Department" will become the "Protection Legal Affairs Department," handling legal matters related to civil servant protection. The "Local Civil Servant Protection Department" will become the "Protection Guidance Department," dealing with local civil servant protection and promoting related services. The "Training and Development Department" and the "Training and Assessment Department" will join together to form the new "Training and Development Department," which will manage training plans and resources.</p>
            <p>In June this year, the Legislative Yuan passed changes to the Civil Service Protection Act. These changes clearly define workplace bullying, make it easier to complain, and ensure that those who bully are held responsible. The law also states that if a boss or department head is found guilty of workplace bullying, they can be fined up to NT$1 million.</p>

            <h1>China's Ministry of Commerce: We Don't Want a Trade War, But We Are Not Afraid</h1>
            <p>After China announced stricter rules for exporting rare earth metals, the United States said it might put a 100% tax on Chinese goods and control all important software exports. About the renewed trade conflict between the US and China, China's Ministry of Commerce said today, "We don't want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight."</p>
            <p>Recently, China put new limits on exporting important rare earth metals. This made US President Trump say he would put a 100% tax on Chinese goods and control all important software exports.</p>
            <p>Today, China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement from its spokesperson. It said that in just over 20 days since the US-China trade talks in Madrid in September, the US has continued to add new limits on China. The US has put many Chinese companies on lists that control exports and special nationals. It has also used rules to include thousands of Chinese companies under these controls, even when they are not directly involved. The US has ignored China's concerns and good intentions, and has gone ahead with measures against China's shipping, logistics, and shipbuilding industries. China strongly disagrees with these actions, which hurt China's interests and spoil the mood for trade talks.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that for a long time, the US has used national security as a reason to control exports too broadly. It has treated China unfairly by putting one-sided rules on many products like semiconductor equipment and chips. The US list of controlled items has over 3,000 items, while China's list only has about 900. The US has long used a rule that controls exports even if only a tiny part of a product comes from a certain place, sometimes as low as 0%.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson also said, "Threatening with high taxes is not the right way to deal with China. On trade wars, China's position is clear: we don't want to fight, but we are not afraid to fight." If the US continues to act in this way, China will surely take actions to protect its own legal rights.</p>
            <p>The US will start charging port fees on certain Chinese ships on October 14. China has also announced that it will charge special port fees on US ships starting from October 14 as a countermeasure.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that on April 17, the US Trade Representative's Office announced its final decisions on an investigation into China's shipping, logistics, and shipbuilding industries. These decisions mean that port fees will be charged on certain Chinese ships starting from October 14. The US actions break World Trade Organization rules and go against the fair and equal principles of the "US-China Maritime Agreement."</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said that since the US-China trade talks in London, China has been discussing these issues with the US. China gave a written response to the US's unfair accusations in its investigation report and offered ideas for cooperation in related industries. But the US was not willing to work with China and insisted on carrying out these measures. On October 3, the US announced specific details for charging fees on Chinese ships.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said that to protect its own legal rights, China had to take counter-actions. China hopes the US will work with them and return to talking and discussing solutions.</p>

            <h1>After Holidays, Try Light Fasting? Doctor Warns Four Groups Not to Do It</h1>
            <p>After many holidays like Mid-Autumn Festival and Double Ten Day, many people have eaten a lot of food with family and friends. Some people try "light fasting" to lose weight quickly. But a doctor warns that fasting is not good for everyone. Pregnant women, teenagers, people with poorly controlled blood sugar, and those taking blood sugar medicine should not try it because it could harm their health.</p>
            <p>Many celebrities and internet stars have shared their experiences with "168 fasting," where you don't eat for 16 hours and eat for 8 hours, or "1410 fasting," where you don't eat for 14 hours and eat for 10 hours. Dr. Chen Wei-lung, a doctor specializing in internal medicine and weight loss, recently said in a press release that light fasting after big meals can help your body get back to normal. However, he stressed that the eating period should not be an excuse to eat too much.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen explained that during the eating period of "light fasting," you should not eat whatever you want. After not eating, your stomach is empty. If you immediately eat foods high in sugar or starch, your blood sugar will go up and down very quickly, like a roller coaster. This can make you eat too much and gain weight back. Over a long time, it can also cause problems with insulin and heart disease.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen suggests following four main eating rules during the "light fasting" eating period. The first rule is to "eat mostly whole foods." This means eating vegetables, lean meat, fish, eggs, tofu, or starches that don't raise blood sugar quickly, like sweet potatoes and brown rice. Try to avoid processed foods, sugary foods, and fried foods. The second rule is to "eat a balanced diet," meaning two parts vegetables, one part protein, and one part whole grain starch.</p>
            <p>The third rule is to "control how much you eat." Dr. Chen said that even if your eating window is shorter, you should still eat 2 to 3 meals and stop when you are 80% full. This helps prevent overeating to make up for fasting. The fourth rule is to "eat in a specific order." It's best to drink water first, then eat protein like meat and vegetables, and finally eat starches and fruits. Eating in this order can slow down the rise in blood sugar and help you feel full longer.</p>
            <p>Although "light fasting" after big meals can help your body get back to normal, it is not suitable for everyone. Dr. Chen specifically mentioned that pregnant women, teenagers, people who have trouble controlling their blood sugar for a long time, or patients taking blood sugar medicine should not try any fasting methods on their own.</p>
            <p>If you feel dizzy, your heart beats fast, you eat too much after fasting, or if your periods become irregular or you lose muscle because of extreme fasting, it means your body is under too much stress. You should ask a doctor or a dietitian for help quickly. Dr. Chen said that instead of just trying to eat less, it is more important to focus on eating correctly and doing it for a long time. This is the key to staying healthy and controlling your weight.</p>
