            <p>London, September 2 â€“ Today, the main European stock markets closed lower. Investors were worried about problems like disagreements between US President Trump and the Federal Reserve, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs, and public money issues in Europe.

            <h1>US Removes TSMC's Nanjing Plant Exemption; Ministry of Economic Affairs: No Effect on Industry Competition</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 2 â€“ The US government will remove the special permission for TSMC's Nanjing factory. On the evening of September 2, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) also announced last week that it would remove VEU status from two South Korean companies. So, this action is likely not only for TSMC. Also, the Nanjing factory only makes about 3% of TSMC's total products. It makes an even smaller part of all semiconductor products in Taiwan. The ministry believes this will not affect how competitive the whole industry is.</p>
            <p>According to a US government document published recently, the US will stop the special permission that allowed Intel from the US, Samsung and SK Hynix from South Korea to get US semiconductor making equipment in China. TSMC said today that it has received a notice from the US government. The company's "Validated End-User" (VEU) permission for its Nanjing factory will end on December 31, 2025. TSMC is currently looking at the situation and making plans to respond appropriately. It is working to make sure its Nanjing factory can keep operating without problems.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 2, the Ministry of Economic Affairs replied, saying that if the US government removes the VEU status for TSMC's Nanjing factory, it means that for every piece of US equipment imported in the future, a separate permit will be needed.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that this means the Nanjing factory's permission from the US Bureau of Industry and Security will change. It will no longer be a "green channel" (which means they could get controlled US goods without applying for each shipment). Instead, they will have to apply "case by case." This change will make it harder to predict how the factory will operate in the future.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that TSMC has already announced that it received the notice from the US. The US government's VEU permission for TSMC's Nanjing factory will be removed starting from December 31, 2025. TSMC also said that when it talks with the US government, it will try its best to make sure its Nanjing factory continues to operate without stopping.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that last week, BIS also announced that it would remove VEU status from two South Korean companies, Samsung and Hynix. This suggests that the action is probably not aimed only at TSMC or specific companies. Because the semiconductor supply chain between Taiwan and the US is very close, and the US is putting more controls on semiconductors, companies in Taiwan should continue to follow export control laws more strictly to protect their rights.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs also stated that about 20% of Samsung's DRAM is made in China, and about 40% of Hynix's is. For TSMC, only its Nanjing factory in China is affected by the US BIS rules (for 16-nanometer technology). This factory makes only about 3% of TSMC's total products, and this amount might go down in the future. It makes an even smaller part of all semiconductor products made in Taiwan. So, the ministry thinks this will not harm Taiwan's overall ability to compete in the industry.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs emphasized that it will continue to stay in close contact with the US and with businesses to understand the situation and offer help.</p>
