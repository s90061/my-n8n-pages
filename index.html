            <h1>GCTF Holds Workshop in Lithuania to Make Supply Chains Stronger</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Taiwan's office in Lithuania, together with the US Embassy in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a non-government group, held an "Overseas Workshop of the Global Cooperation and Training Framework" (GCTF) in Lithuania from September 4th to 5th. The workshop focused on making supply chains stronger. This shows Taiwan's strong will to keep helping the world.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a press statement. It said that Taiwan's office in Lithuania worked with the US Embassy in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the non-government group "Civic Resilience Initiative" (CRI). They held the GCTF overseas workshop in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. The main topic was making supply chains stronger.</p>
            <p>People from Taiwan, Lithuania, the United States, Palau, and Japan took part. They were from businesses, government, and universities. They talked about three main topics: "Rethinking Supply Chains," "Being Creative and Flexible," and "Working Together between Public and Private Sectors." Jennifer Olegeriil, the Minister of Justice from Palau, shared how Palau has dealt with economic pressure. Lee Chun, Taiwan's representative to the EU and Belgium, also gave an online speech. He talked about how to make economies strong when there are political problems between countries.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Wang Hsueh-hong, Taiwan's representative in Lithuania, gave an opening speech. She said that democratic countries are facing economic challenges from authoritarian countries. Taiwan wants to share its experiences with other countries to build stronger supply chains together. Kara McDonald, the US Ambassador to Lithuania, Julius Praneviƒçius, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania, and Tomas Kazulƒónas, the Chairman of CRI, also spoke. They all said that democratic countries should work more closely to make supply chains safer.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs noted that about 110 people attended this event. They came from different countries and different areas like business, government, and education. This shows that many countries think making supply chains stronger is very important. Since it started in 2015, GCTF has become a key platform for building skills around the world. This was the second time a GCTF event was held in Lithuania. It shows Taiwan's continuous effort and actions to contribute to the international community.</p>

            <h1>Japan and Australia Say Taiwan Strait Peace is Important; Lin Chia-lung Thanks and Welcomes This</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 6th (CNA) ‚Äì Yesterday, Japan and Australia held a "2+2" meeting in Tokyo. Their foreign and defense ministers attended. After the meeting, they released a joint statement. In the statement, they repeated that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important. Today, Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said he thanks and welcomes Japan and Australia for continuing to care about peace in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The Japan-Australia "Foreign and Defense 2+2" talks happened yesterday in Tokyo. From Japan, Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and Defense Minister Gen Nakatani were there. From Australia, Foreign Minister Penny Wong and Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles were there.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a press statement. It said that the joint statement after the meeting repeated that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important for global safety and wealth. It also asked for a peaceful solution to problems between Taiwan and China through talks. The joint statement also showed great worry about China's growing military actions in the East China Sea, South China Sea, and near Japan's air and sea areas. It strongly disagreed with any attempts to change the current situation by force or pressure. Both Japan and Australia are also very concerned about China and Russia working more closely on military matters to support Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that authoritarian countries are now expanding more and more. They are challenging the world order, which is based on rules. This has made the international situation unstable. Taiwan is a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific region. It will keep working more closely with partners who share similar ideas, like Japan and Australia. Together, they will protect important values like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. They will help keep peace, stability, and wealth in the Taiwan Strait and around the world.</p>
