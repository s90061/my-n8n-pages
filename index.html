            <h1>Dawulun Park Phase 2 Project Delayed; Keelung City Government to Find Out Why and Get Money to Continue</h1>
            <p>The Keelung City Government is working on the second phase of the Dawulun Forest Sports Park. However, there has been a delay. This is because the company hired to advise on the project did not complete important studies like soil and water protection and traffic checks. Also, there are problems with money. The city government will find out who is responsible for these issues. They are also working hard to get money from the central government. They hope to finish the project by 2029.</p>
            <p>Lin Bo-shu, the head of the Keelung City Stadium, said today that the first phase of the park is already finished. This part included a parking lot and a local park. It was completed in stages starting from 2021 and handed over to the Anle District Office for care.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin explained that the second phase of the project is about 4 hectares in size. It is located south of where Wulun Interchange on National Highway 3 meets Jijing 1st Road in Anle District. It is next to the Municipal Baseball Stadium and Xinsan Reservoir. The land is hilly and mostly belongs to the Keelung City Government, with some parts owned by the country.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin said that the second phase plans to build five large forest parks. These parks will focus on different themes: special parks, adventure activities, forest sports, forest relaxation, and protecting nature. They also plan to build an extreme sports area and make the connecting roads wider. This will cost about NT$400 million. They hope the National Land Management Agency of the Ministry of the Interior will provide at least NT$250 million. This would help the city government with the financial cost.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Lin said that last year, when they checked the plan, they found that the consultant company did not do the soil and water protection, water drilling, and traffic impact studies as agreed. Of course, they also did not give these reports to the city government. The relevant departments have started an investigation. They will find out who is responsible and ask for money to cover the damage by law.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin said that to prevent these studies from delaying the project further, the city government has already contacted professional groups for soil and water protection and traffic. They have asked for price quotes and have put NT$5.5 million in next year's budget to finish these studies. They expect to start these studies next year. At the same time, they will ask the National Land Management Agency for money. If they get the money, they hope to invite bids for the project online by March 2027 and start construction by June 2027. The project could be finished as early as June 2029.</p>

            <h1>200 National Guard Members Sent to Portland for 2 Months, Trump's Order Leads to State Lawsuit</h1>
            <p>Today, U.S. Secretary of Defense Hegseth ordered 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to go to Portland for two months. This is under federal command. Former President Trump allowed this action. Now, the Oregon state government has sued, saying that the President's use of military force is not legal.</p>
            <p>According to news from BBC News and Reuters, Hegseth's order, given today, states that at least 200 National Guard members will go to parts of Portland where protests are happening or might happen. Their job is to protect federal buildings.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that if needed, he had given permission to use "full force" to stop protests against immigration centers. It is not clear if "full force" means he allowed the use of deadly force, or under what conditions. The U.S. military can use force to defend themselves when they are in the country.</p>
            <p>Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said that this action is "provoking and unfair." He said it could make protests worse and put public safety at risk.</p>
            <p>Trump said that this action is to protect "any Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) buildings that are attacked by domestic terrorists like Antifa." He also wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that Portland is a "city ruined by war."</p>
            <p>In a statement, Rayfield said, "Sending 200 National Guard members to guard one building is unusual." He was clearly talking about the ICE building in Portland.</p>
            <p>Since early June, the ICE building in Portland has been a target for protesters. Some of these protests have become violent. By September 8, federal prosecutors had charged 26 people with federal crimes.</p>
            <p>Data from the Major Cities Chiefs Association for the first half of 2025 shows that violent crime in Portland has gone down a lot. Murder cases are 51% lower compared to the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Like other Oregon officials, Portland Mayor Keith Wilson learned about Trump's order yesterday through social media.</p>
            <p>Many people inside the U.S. Department of Defense were also surprised by this. One official said the decision came "without warning." This person said that the military's main focus before was on carefully planning for Trump possibly sending troops to cities like Chicago and Memphis.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Defense did not immediately reply when asked for a comment.</p>
            <p>Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB) reported that today, hundreds of people gathered outside the ICE building in Portland to protest the National Guard being sent there. Federal law enforcement officers with long guns were seen on nearby rooftops.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the streets were full of shouting and drumming. The atmosphere was lively but mostly peaceful, with few fights.</p>

            <h1>Liu Huan-yu from Pingzhen Team Hits Well in Taoyuan Cup, Smiles on Field to Relax</h1>
            <p>In the quarter-finals of the Taoyuan Cup Youth Baseball Tournament, Liu Huan-yu, a first-year high school player from Pingzhen A team, hit two times and helped score two runs. The head coach, Wu Bo-hong, praised Liu Huan-yu's hitting skills, saying they were "surprising." He also noted that Liu always smiles on the field, which helps him relax and handle pressure well.</p>
            <p>The quarter-finals of the 2025 Taoyuan Cup Youth Baseball Championship was a "Pingzhen vs. Pingzhen" game, with Pingzhen A team playing against Pingzhen B team. In the first part of the game, Liu Huan-yu hit a triple, which gave his team the lead. In the third part, when the score was tied, he hit another important single, putting his team ahead. Today, he had two hits in three chances and scored two runs, helping his team win 5 to 3.</p>
            <p>Pingzhen's head coach, Wu Bo-hong, said that Liu Huan-yu showed great skill in his first high school tournament, the Giant Cup. His hitting ability really impressed the coaches. He could hit against any pitcher. In the Giant Cup championship game, with two outs and his team behind by one run, he hit a game-winning single against Guibao Vocational High School, becoming a hero.</p>
            <p>Coach Wu also said that people might notice Liu Huan-yu always smiles on the field. This is not a playful smile; it is a smile to help him relax. Perhaps it is his way of dealing with pressure. He often reminds his players that playing baseball is not just about skill, but also about managing their feelings.</p>
            <p>Liu Huan-yu said that moving from junior high to high school was not a big problem for him. His junior high coaches had told him to get ready for the new environment. When he started high school, he felt like a challenger. He noticed that high school pitchers throw faster and have sharper breaking balls.</p>
            <p>As for why he always smiles on the field, Liu Huan-yu explained that he mainly wants to help himself relax. He also hopes to encourage his teammates, so they do not feel too nervous either.</p>
