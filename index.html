Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said today that Israel is ready to talk about a permanent ceasefire in Gaza during a 60-day break from fighting. However, he stated that Gaza, a Palestinian area, must not have any military groups or weapons.

News reports say that Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian group, started talks in Doha on July 6th. They want to agree on a temporary ceasefire. The war between Israel and Hamas began after Hamas attacked in October 2023.

Yesterday, Netanyahu said that Steve Witkoff, a special envoy from the US, suggested a 60-day ceasefire. This would allow half of the 20 hostages still in Gaza to be released. Today, Netanyahu spoke in Washington via video. He said, "When the ceasefire begins, we will discuss how to end the war permanently." Netanyahu also said that Israel's main condition is for Hamas to "put down their weapons" and no longer have "control or military power." He added, "If we can achieve this through talks, that's great. If not, within 60 days, we will use other ways, like force, with our brave army." Hamas said yesterday that they agreed to release 10 hostages. But today, they said they don't agree with the plan because it includes a large Israeli military presence in Gaza. Hamas also wants help to enter Gaza freely to ease the humanitarian problem. They also want true promises for lasting peace.
