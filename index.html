Microsoft has announced its biggest investment in the UK in four decades, planning to spend 2.5 billion pounds over the next three years. This money will be used to build new data centres for artificial intelligence (AI) in the country. Data centres are special buildings that store and process a huge amount of digital information.

The technology giant hopes this large investment will help the UK's economy grow and make it a world leader in AI. Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, stated that the company is committed to the UK and its future. The investment is also expected to create many jobs and boost the development of advanced AI technologies. Additionally, Microsoft plans to train one million people in the UK with new AI skills by 2026, helping workers adapt to future technologies.

**Venice to Introduce Tourist Entry Fee in 2024**

The city of Venice in Italy will start charging a fee for day-trippers from spring 2024. Visitors who come to the city for just one day will need to pay 5 euros to enter. This new rule will begin with a 29-day test period, mostly during spring holidays and summer weekends when the city is most crowded.

The main aim of this fee is to help manage the very large number of tourists visiting Venice and to protect the city's delicate environment and historic sites. Officials have said that this is not a way to make money, but rather a way to control tourism. People who live in Venice, those who work or study there, and children under the age of 14 will not have to pay the fee. Tourists who stay overnight in Venice are also exempt because they already pay a city tax through their accommodation.

**Four-Day Work Week Gains Popularity Worldwide**

More and more companies around the world are trying out a four-day work week without reducing employees' pay. This new way of working involves employees doing their usual hours over four days instead of five, giving them a longer weekend. Recent trials and studies have shown positive results for both workers and businesses.

Companies that have adopted this model often report that their employees feel happier and healthier, leading to fewer days off work due to illness. Workers also say they have a better balance between their work and personal life. For businesses, some trials have shown that people work more effectively, and companies can even attract better employees. While there are still some challenges, like arranging work schedules, the four-day work week is becoming a serious option for the future of work.`;
