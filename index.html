            <h1>Four Astronauts from US, Russia, and Japan Go to Space Station to Practice Moon Landing</h1>
            <p>On August 1st, from Kennedy Space Center, NASA and SpaceX sent a team of four people to the International Space Station (ISS). They will start their newest research trip at this space lab.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, American astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian astronaut Oleg Platonov went into space. They lifted off at 11:43 AM from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. They were on SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, which was on top of a Falcon 9 rocket.</p>
            <p>This mission, called Crew-11, is the 11th time people have gone to the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. This program works with private companies to continue space travel after the space shuttle era.</p>
            <p>During their six-month stay, the astronauts on the Crew-11 mission will practice landing situations. These are like those they might face near the moon's south pole as part of America's Artemis program.</p>
            <p>They will use small handheld controls and different screens. They will test how changes in gravity affect an astronaut's ability to fly a spacecraft, including future moon landers.</p>
            <p>The Crew-11 mission also brought pomegranate seeds from Armenia. These seeds will be compared with a group on Earth. This is to study how small amounts of gravity affect how plants grow.</p>
            <p>The International Space Station will stop working after 2030. Its orbit will slowly get lower until it breaks apart in the atmosphere over a far-away part of the Pacific Ocean called "Point Nemo." People often call Point Nemo the "spacecraft graveyard."</p>

            <h1>Xinzhuang Suitcase Body Case: Man Arrested for Killing Family Member and Other Crimes</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City, August 2nd â€“ In the case of a body found in a suitcase in Xinzhuang District, a man named Chen was sent to the New Taipei Prosecutor's Office yesterday. He was accused of murder and leaving a body. After questioning, the prosecutors asked to keep him in jail and not allow him to see anyone. Late at night, the New Taipei District Court decided to keep Mr. Chen in jail and not allow visits. They believe he killed an older family member and left a body.</p>
            <p>On the night of July 28, the Xinzhuang Police Precinct in New Taipei City received a report. A red suitcase was found in a ditch at the end of Lane 381, Xintai Road, Xinzhuang District. Inside was the body of a man who had been dead for several days. Police immediately set up a special team to investigate the case.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, the Xinzhuang Police Precinct said they looked at nearby security camera videos. A special team checked nearly 22 days of footage and found important pictures. The police identified Mr. Chen as a main suspect. He was seen near where the body was found around July 6th. Police believe he left the body and ran away.</p>
            <p>Police said they arrested Mr. Chen on July 31. Neighbors said that Mr. Chen's father, who is about 70 years old, had been missing for almost a month. He was thin, had trouble moving, and had little hair. These details match the dead man.</p>
            <p>Police said they sent the unclear fingerprints of the dead man to the Criminal Investigation Bureau again. They used a "manual method" to match the fingerprints. This confirmed the dead person was Mr. Chen's father. Also, after the body is examined, DNA tests will be done.</p>
            <p>Police stated that the body had no clear outside injuries. So, it is not yet clear if Mr. Chen killed him or left the body for other reasons. Reports say that when police questioned Mr. Chen, he often did not answer clearly or gave strange answers. After police questioning yesterday afternoon, Mr. Chen was sent to the New Taipei Prosecutor's Office. He was accused of murder and leaving a body.</p>
            <p>After questioning Mr. Chen last night, prosecutors believe he is strongly suspected of killing an older family member. They think he might destroy evidence or run away. So, they asked the court to keep him in jail and not let him see anyone.</p>
            <p>Late last night, the New Taipei District Court said that after the judge questioned the accused, they believe he likely committed the crimes of killing an older family member and leaving a body. The judge thinks there is a real chance he might run away or destroy evidence. Therefore, it is necessary and right to keep him in jail and not allow him to see or talk to anyone.</p>
