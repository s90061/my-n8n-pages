            <h1>Trump and Regional Leaders Sign Gaza Statement; He Says Middle East Has a Great Day</h1>
            <p>(Jerusalem, October 13, Central News Agency) U.S. President Trump praised today as "a great day for the Middle East." He signed a statement with several regional leaders to make the ceasefire in Gaza stronger. This happened just a few hours after Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas traded hostages and prisoners.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Donald Trump made a quick visit to Israel. He gave a speech in the parliament and praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After that, he flew to Egypt for a Gaza meeting. There, he signed the statement with leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey, becoming a guarantor for the Gaza agreement.</p>
            <p>More than 20 world leaders met in the Sharm el-Sheikh resort. Trump said, "Today is a great day for the world, and an even greater day for the Middle East."</p>
            <p>Before signing the statement, Trump said, "This document will list rules, regulations, and many other things." He said two times, "This agreement will stay in effect."</p>
            <p>As part of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza, Hamas released the last 20 hostages today. These hostages had been held in Gaza for two years. In return, the Israeli Prison Service said that Israel released 1968 prisoners. Most of these prisoners were Palestinians.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to members of parliament in the Israeli parliament. He said, "From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a country at war. It has carried a heavy burden that only proud and strong-willed people can carry." When he arrived at the Israeli parliament, the people there clapped for a long time to show their respect.</p>
            <p>He also said, "For many families in this area, they have not had a truly peaceful day for many years. This long and painful nightmare has finally ended, not just for Israelis, but also for Palestinians and many others."</p>

            <h1>China Uses Rare Earths as a Strategy Again; US Treasury Secretary Bessent Gives 3 Possible Reasons</h1>
            <p>(New York, October 13, Central News Agency reporter Liao Han-yuan) U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that China has again put rules on how much rare earth can be sent out of the country. He thinks there are three possible reasons for this. First, China's economy is not doing well. Second, China is against the U.S. trying to bring peace around the world. Third, it might be a plan before the leaders of both countries meet. He believes this is a bad plan, but both sides are still talking.</p>
            <p>On October 9, China officially announced stricter rules for rare earth exports. After this, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a message saying he would add a 100% tax and other limits on goods from China sent to the U.S. The leaders of both countries might meet in Korea at the end of this month. This new tax conflict between the U.S. and China could change things.</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent spoke on Fox Business Network's morning news show. He said there are many reasons. First, China's economy is not good, so they might be focusing on their economic situation.</p>
            <p>The second reason is that China is against the U.S., while the U.S. is trying to create global peace. China is helping to fund wars by buying Russian oil and giving resources for war machines. The U.S. has also asked China to stop buying oil from Iran, and this might be a reason for China's action.</p>
            <p>The third reason is that China might have made a wrong plan before the leaders of both countries meet in Korea at the end of October. Playing games before a formal meeting with Trump is a bad idea. On October 10, Trump changed the situation with a tweet, proposing new taxes and necessary bans on China.</p>
            <p>He also said, "This is a bad plan. The U.S. is still talking, and we are confident we can move forward."</p>
            <p>The show's host, Maria Bartiromo, asked if Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would still meet. She also asked if new taxes and other bans would start on November 1 after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Bessent replied that this was a message from Trump. Trump said in his social media post that it could be postponed. This gives both sides time to meet and talk. Trump and Xi have a good personal relationship. Bessent believes Trump thinks this decision might have been made by lower-level officials in China.</p>
            <p>He explained that there are also different groups within China's government. So, it might not have been Xi Jinping's decision. It could have come from hardliners. There are people in China who want to hurt the relationship between the two countries.</p>

            <h1>Israel Lets Go of 1968 Prisoners; Hamas Gives Back Two Bodies of Hostages</h1>
            <p>(Jerusalem, October 13, Central News Agency) The Israeli Prison Service said today that almost 2000 people have been set free. Most of them are Palestinians. This is part of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The Israeli army also said that Hamas gave the bodies of two Israeli hostages to the Red Cross today.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Israeli Prison Service stated, "A total of 1968 terrorists were moved from many prisons across the country to Ofer Prison and Ktziot Prison."</p>
            <p>The statement added, "After finishing the necessary steps inside the prisons and getting approval from the government, all terrorists have been released. They were released from Ofer Prison to the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and from Ktziot Prison to Kerem Shalom." Kerem Shalom is one of the border crossings to the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military said that the Palestinian group Hamas gave the bodies of two Israeli hostages, who were held in Gaza, to the Red Cross today. The bodies of two more hostages are also expected to be handed over.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military said, "According to information from the Red Cross, the coffins of two dead hostages have been given to them. They are now being taken to the Gaza Strip. There, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israel Security Agency (ISA) will receive them."</p>
            <p>The Israeli military also added, "After this, the coffins of two more dead hostages will be given over."</p>
            <p>Also, U.S. President Donald Trump met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas today at the Gaza summit in Egypt. This was the first time they had met and shaken hands in eight years.</p>
