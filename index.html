**Man Fakes Paralysis for Insurance Money**

A 45-year-old man, surnamed Tu, is accused of pretending to be paralyzed to get insurance money. He worked with his sister and got over 5.39 million New Taiwan Dollars from insurance companies.

The insurance companies became suspicious. They watched Mr. Tu and filmed him getting out of his wheelchair, folding it, and driving away by himself. They also saw him moving around his home and riding a scooter.

The police were called, and now Mr. Tu and his sister have been charged with fraud. The prosecutors asked for a serious punishment for Mr. Tu because he lied many times and spent a lot of money.

**Egg Farms Get Upgrades to Produce More Eggs**

Taiwan's egg farms are improving their facilities to be more hygienic and modern. Experts helped traditional cage-based farms change their systems. Now, chickens have more space to move around and play.

Because of these changes, the farms are producing more eggs. The egg-laying rate has gone up from 75.8% to over 89.4%. This means a farm with 10,000 chickens can get about 7 more boxes of eggs each day. This can earn them about 4900 New Taiwan Dollars more daily.

Also, the new farms don't need as many workers. A farm with 40,000 to 50,000 chickens only needs two workers. They also have new technology to dry chicken waste and turn it into fertilizer, which is good for the environment.
