            <h1>U12 World Cup Baseball: Hu Cheng-en Hits Home Run, Taiwan and Korea Game Paused at 2-2 Tie</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Tainan, August 2) In the U12 World Cup Baseball game tonight, Taiwan was playing against South Korea. Taiwan took the lead with a two-run home run from Hu Cheng-en. But in the bottom of the 4th inning, South Korea tied the game by getting a walk with bases loaded. The game was then stopped because of rain when there were two outs, bases loaded, and the score was 2-2.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Taiwan's team in the U12 World Cup Baseball had won 2 games and lost 2 games. Today, they played against South Korea in the Super Round. The game was supposed to start at 6:30 PM, but it began 15 minutes earlier and without spectators because of worries about the weather.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team started with left-handed pitcher Wu Shang-cheng. In the bottom of the 1st inning, after one out, two hits were made, and players got to scoring positions. Then, South Korea scored one run with a sacrifice fly. Taiwan did not score in the first two innings. In the top of the 3rd inning, Hu Cheng-en hit a two-run home run to give Taiwan the lead. This was his third home run in the competition.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's starting pitcher Wu Shang-cheng left the game after pitching 3 innings and giving up 1 run. In the bottom of the 4th inning, Hsieh Cheng-chun came in to pitch. In that inning, South Korea got two hits and Hsieh Cheng-chun walked two batters. This allowed South Korea to tie the score. With two outs and bases loaded, while pitching to South Korea's first batter with a count of two balls and two strikes, the game was stopped due to heavy rain.</p>
            <p>The games between Taiwan and South Korea, and between the United States and Japan, are important for teams to move forward in the competition. For Taiwan to play in the championship game, Japan must beat the United States, and Taiwan must beat South Korea. The final decision will depend on something called Team Quality Balance (TQB). Right now, the United States is ahead of Japan with a score of 5-0.</p>

            <h1>South Africa Arrests 1,000 People in Crackdown on Illegal Gold Mining by Immigrants</h1>
            <p>(Johannesburg, August 1, CNA wire service report) In South Africa, the police in Mpumalanga province, which is in the northeast, have arrested about 1,000 people. This was part of an operation that started on July 28 to stop immigrants from mining gold illegally in local mines. This information was given to AFP today by police spokesperson Mdhluli.</p>
            <p>This operation was focused on the area near Barberton, a village close to the borders of Eswatini and Mozambique. Barberton Mines, the company that owns the Sheba Mine there, said in a statement that they had to let go of workers earlier this year because the mine was not making money and needed to close. This caused strong protests from local people and workers. The company now says, "Now we know why."</p>
            <p>Barberton Mines stated, "Food and supplies were constantly being sent to a large underground world of illegal mining. This had to be stopped. That is why this operation was carried out with the police and mine security staff. Illegal mining will not be allowed. This message needs to be spread widely."</p>
            <p>During this operation, the police surrounded the illegal mines. This stopped supplies from reaching the people inside, which made them come up to the surface.</p>
            <p>Donald Mdhluli said, "As soon as they came out, they were arrested. About 1,000 illegal miners were arrested, and these people are also illegal immigrants. So far, no deaths have been reported."</p>
            <p>He also said that there are still illegal miners underground, so more arrests might happen. (Translator: Chang Cheng-chien / Editor: Ho Hung-ju) August 2, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Constitutional Court Does Not Accept Rih Sheng Sheng Company's Request, Saying It Lost Its Right to Sue</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Liu Shih-yi, Taipei, August 2) Rih Sheng Sheng Life Technology Company lost a court case about paying late interest. So, they asked the Constitutional Court to review the law. They said that a new change to the Constitutional Litigation Act made it too hard for them to sue, taking away their right to sue that the Constitution protects. The Constitutional Court decided that the request did not meet the requirements, so they did not accept it.</p>
            <p>Rih Sheng Sheng Life Technology Company asked the Constitutional Court to review a law. They claimed that a Civil Judgment from the Supreme Court (No. 2753 of 2023) used rules about pre-sale housing contracts. They said these rules went beyond what the Consumer Protection Act allowed. This took away the right of people to freely discuss contracts and choose how to do business. They also said it went against the rule that laws must be clear. Also, they argued that calculating unlimited late fees based on a fixed percentage was against the principle of fairness. This, they said, harmed people's constitutional rights to property, freedom of contract, and freedom to do business.</p>
            <p>Rih Sheng Sheng company stated that the Constitutional Litigation Act, which was passed by the Legislative Yuan on December 20, 2024, made it too hard for the Constitutional Court to hear cases and make decisions. It set a "fixed number of votes" needed, which did not consider if there were fewer judges available. This rule seriously limited the court's power to accept cases or declare laws unconstitutional. This greatly reduced people's chances of getting help through constitutional lawsuits. In reality, it made the constitutional lawsuit system useless and took away people's right to sue, which is protected by the Constitution. Because of this, the company asked for a review of the law and the court's decision.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Court believed that the final court decision in this case did not use the rules about pre-sale housing contracts or the Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, Rih Sheng Sheng could not ask for a review of the law's constitutionality. Also, Rih Sheng Sheng did not clearly show how the court's decision itself was unconstitutional.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Rih Sheng Sheng asked the Constitutional Court to review the new rules of the Constitutional Litigation Act. However, the Constitutional Court decided that this act was not the law used in the final court decision. This meant it did not meet the requirements for asking for a constitutional review. So, the court decided not to accept the request.</p>
            <p>Even though the court did not accept this request, Justice Chen Chung-wu wrote a separate opinion. The chief judge (acting president of the Judicial Yuan), Hsieh Ming-yang, and Justice Yu Po-hsiang also agreed with it. This has brought attention from the public.</p>
            <p>The separate opinion said that judges should respect the Legislative Yuan's right to make laws, as long as these laws do not go against the Constitution. So, judges should use these laws when they hear cases.</p>
            <p>However, if the Constitutional Litigation Act has parts that are missing or might be unconstitutional, using it could make court processes go against the Constitution's meaning. In such cases, judges, because they must be loyal to the Constitution and protect it, should not be limited by parts of the Constitutional Litigation Act that go against the Constitution. If they were, it would not only make the judges' court processes unconstitutional in specific cases, but it would also let the Legislative Yuan use an unconstitutional law to weaken the judges' power to review laws. This would destroy the separation of powers set out in the Constitution. (Editor: Li Heng-shan) August 2, 2025.</p>
