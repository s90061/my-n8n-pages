Typhoon Danas is near Taiwan, and a sea warning has been put out. Zengwen Reservoir, which is the biggest reservoir in Taiwan, is more than 80% full of water.

The office in charge of water resources in the south said that they will open an emergency center tomorrow at 9 AM. They will decide if they need to let some water out from the reservoir, depending on how much rain falls. Their first goal is to keep the water in the reservoir. If they have to let water out, they will tell people two hours before.

Another reservoir, Mudan Reservoir in Pingtung, is also quite full, at 71.51%.

**Tour Bus Drivers Protest New Card Reader Rule**

Starting next year, tour buses in Taiwan might have to install devices that identify the driver. The government offers about NT$2000 to help pay for each device.

However, a group of tour bus drivers from New Taipei City thinks that the current GPS systems on buses can already give this information. They don't want to pay for new devices. Because of this, around one hundred tour buses will protest at the Ministry of Transportation on July 9th and 10th.

The government wants these devices to keep track of how long drivers work. The Highway Bureau said that bus companies can use their current GPS systems if they can add the driver ID function. They don't need to buy new machines or pay more for data transfer.

**Japanese Citizens Vote in Taiwan for Senate Election**

Japanese people living in Taiwan are voting early for Japan's Senate election, which will happen on July 20th. This is the first time voting places have been set up in Taiwan, at the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung.

Voting is open from July 4th to July 14th, from 9:30 AM to 5:00 PM. One voter, Mr. Yamamoto Masayuki, said it's much easier to vote in person here than sending his vote by mail. He voted because he "hopes to make Japan better."

Unlike voting in Taiwan, where you use a stamp, in Japan, you write the name of the person or party you want to vote for. After writing, you put your vote in a special envelope and give it to a staff member. There are over 20,000 Japanese people living in Taiwan, and more than 16,000 of them can vote.
