            <h1>School Bus Attendant Hu Youping from Suzhou Japanese School Chosen as China's Hero for Doing Righteous Deeds</h1>
            <p>On July 21, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China held its 15th awards ceremony in Beijing. Hu Youping, a school bus attendant, was honored as a "National Hero for Doing Righteous Deeds." In June 2024, she died trying to protect children in a car during an attack at a Japanese school in Suzhou. Seven other individuals and two groups also received this award.</p>
            <p>According to Xinhua News Agency and the official WeChat account of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, Hu Youping was listed as "a resident of Gusu District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province, before her sacrifice." However, the reports did not explain the details of her brave act.</p>
            <p>The announcement stated that at this awards ceremony, eight individuals, including Hu Youping, and two groups were given the "National Hero for Doing Righteous Deeds" title. Also, 40 individuals and 10 groups were honored as "National Models for Doing Righteous Deeds."</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of June 24, 2024, an unemployed man named Zhou Jiasheng, from Anhui and living in Suzhou, attacked a Japanese mother and her child with a knife near the Japanese school in Suzhou. They were waiting for the school bus after school. Zhou then got on the bus and continued his attack, stabbing and killing Hu Youping, the school bus attendant, who tried to protect the children. This event shocked both Chinese and Japanese society. Zhou was arrested later. On January 23 this year, a court sentenced him to death, and he was executed in April.</p>
            <p>After Hu Youping's death, Japanese people living in China and some Chinese citizens shared their sadness. Some Japanese people wanted to donate money to support her family. However, her family later released a statement saying, "We do not accept money or gifts. We also ask not to be disturbed. We only wish for the deceased to rest in peace and for our family to return to a peaceful life soon."</p>
            <p>Soon after the incident, on June 27, 2024, the Suzhou "Evaluation Group for Righteous Deeds" asked the Suzhou city government to honor Hu Youping with the title of "Suzhou Model for Doing Righteous Deeds." The government officially gave her this honor on July 2 of the same year.</p>
            <p>Chen Wenqing, the Secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, said at the awards ceremony that since the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "the work of doing righteous deeds has made new progress." He said they must continue to improve this work so that acting bravely becomes a new trend in society. He also said they should strongly promote the spirit of doing righteous deeds, widely share stories of brave acts, truly care for these heroes, and improve how this work is managed. This will help create a "new situation for doing righteous deeds in the new era."</p>

            <h1>European Parliament Delegation Meets with Chiang Chi-chen, Hopes to Discuss All-Society Defense Strategies</h1>
            <p>On July 21, in Taipei, Taiwan, Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Chiang Chi-chen, met with a group from the European Parliament's "Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all Democratic Processes in the European Union, including Disinformation" (EUDS). Chiang said that Taiwan and the European Union have a strong trade relationship. He hopes they can sign a Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA) soon.</p>
            <p>The leader of the group, Nathalie Loiseau, said through an interpreter that signing the BIA is a good first step. The group wants to discuss several topics with Taiwan, including Taiwan's strategy for making society stronger against threats. They also want to understand how Taiwan manages its relationship with the United States.</p>
            <p>Today, Chiang Chi-chen, with members of the Legislative Yuan from different parties, met the official delegation from the European Parliament's "Special Committee on Foreign Interference in all Democratic Processes in the European Union, including Disinformation" (EUDS) at the Legislative Yuan.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Chiang thanked the European Parliament and the European Union for their support of Taiwan's involvement in the global community over the years. This support has been shown through resolutions, speeches, questions, and public statements.</p>
            <p>Chiang said that in the past five years, the European Parliament has passed more than 40 laws or resolutions that support Taiwan. Besides thanking them, he especially hopes that Taiwan can sign a BIA with the EU soon. This is because the EU is Taiwan's fourth largest trading partner, and their trade relationship is very close. If they can make formal rules, it will greatly help both sides in trade and investment.</p>
            <p>Finally, Chiang thanked the European Parliament for its strong and long-term support for Taiwan. He said, "Even though we are geographically far apart, our values are very similar."</p>
            <p>Loiseau replied that the European Parliament believes it is very important to make its partnership with Taiwan stronger. She said that signing a BIA is a good first step, and both sides are working towards this goal.</p>
            <p>Loiseau also stated that Taiwan faces many outside attacks. She gave Russia as an example to show how authoritarian systems can use a society's weaknesses. The visiting group understands this and hopes to share ideas about Taiwan's ongoing efforts to make its whole society resilient against such threats.</p>

            <h1>US Payment Company Block Joins S&P 500 Index, a Big Step for Fintech</h1>
            <p>On July 21, New York reported that Block, a US payment company, will join the S&P 500 index, one of the main stock market indexes in the US. This is a big step for the financial technology, or "fintech," industry. Before trading began today, Block's stock price went up by almost 10%.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that S&P Dow Jones Indices announced on July 18 that Block would join the S&P 500 index before trading on July 23. Block is taking the place of Hess Corp., an American oil company that was bought by a larger company, Chevron.</p>
            <p>Block was started by American tech billionaire Jack Dorsey and others. Its current market value is about 44.8 billion US dollars (about 1.32 trillion New Taiwan dollars). It is one of the most valuable and important companies in the fintech industry. When it becomes part of the S&P 500, its position will become even stronger.</p>
            <p>Block works at the point where traditional payments and digital money meet. Its digital products include point-of-sale (POS) systems, peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers, and Bitcoin services.</p>
            <p>Block joining the S&P 500 shows that digital payments and financial apps are now widely used. It also means that traditional banking in the US is changing a lot. This will make Block more well-known among investors and show that its power in the American financial industry is growing.</p>
