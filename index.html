            <h1>Indonesian Parliament Members' Housing Allowance Controversy: Opinions Divided on Legitimacy and Public Grievances</h1>
            <p>There is a big protest in Indonesia because of money for housing given to parliament members. People disagree about whether this money is fair. Some people say it is fair because new parliament members do not get free places to live anymore, and many of them come from other cities.</p>
            <p>Other people say that the money is too much and is not fair compared to what ordinary people earn. The government says the new money is fair because these parliament members, unlike those before, do not get free homes from the government. So, they should get money to help them.</p>
            <p>Many of these members do not live in Jakarta, the capital city. Therefore, they have to pay for a place to stay while they work there. Elisabeth Kramer, who works at the University of Sydney, wrote that people were very angry when they heard about the housing money. One reason is that the amount is 50 million Indonesian Rupiah (about 93,280 New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>This amount is much more than what "normal Indonesian people" earn and seems like a waste of taxpayers' money. Because of this pressure, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, a deputy speaker of the parliament, said on August 26 that the money would only be for one year. This period is from October 2024 to October 2025. He also said that the money could only be used for housing.</p>
            <p>He said it was not a pay raise, which some people thought. However, this explanation did not stop people from being angry. Critics say that politicians not only do not understand what ordinary people care about, but they also do not show clearly how they decide on government spending. Also, they are not held responsible for their decisions.</p>
            <p>Kok Bisa, an online news group, compared how long it takes for politicians and normal citizens to buy a house. The results showed that politicians could buy a house in just 2 years and 1 month with their salary. But for people earning the lowest wage, it would take a very long time, 38 years and 7 months, to buy a house. Also, politicians do not pay their own income tax; the country pays it for them.</p>
            <p>People also asked how the parliament decided on the amount of the housing money. Puan Maharani, the speaker of the parliament, said that the decision was carefully made. She said they thought about "the situation and prices in Jakarta." Indonesian groups that fight against corruption, "Indonesia Corruption Watch" and "Indonesian Institute," said that politicians already earn a lot of money. They should not get more public money for their housing.</p>
            <p>The "Forum Indonesia untuk Transparansi Anggaran, Fitra" (Indonesian Forum for Budget Transparency) thinks that politicians actually earn about 230 million Indonesian Rupiah (about 429,331 New Taiwan Dollars) each month. In comparison, information from Indonesia's statistics office (BPS) showed that in August 2024, the average monthly salary for managers in Jakarta was 14,329,826 Indonesian Rupiah (about 26,750 New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Because politicians earn much more than the average salary in Jakarta, people say they do not deserve such high pay. They are also seen as being very far from the lives of ordinary Indonesian people. Online discussions about this decision often said that public money should be used correctly. People also said that Indonesian citizens, as taxpayers, should have a say in how much politicians are paid.</p>
            <p>Kramer said that Indonesian people are used to politicians not doing what is expected. This can be seen from the many stories about corruption in the local news. But the housing money made people especially angry because they could easily compare it to their own income. Kramer also said that more and more people are asking for politicians to be responsible and open to the public.</p>
            <p>This shows that people are not happy with how things are. If this problem is not handled well, there might be more protests in the future.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Photographers and Makeup Artists Come to Hong Kong for Illegal Work, 8 Arrested</h1>
            <p>The police in Hong Kong recently caught eight photographers and makeup artists from mainland China. They were working illegally. These people were in touch with customers in Hong Kong using social media. Then, they came to Hong Kong just to offer their paid services.</p>
            <p>A high-ranking officer from Hong Kong's Immigration Department said today that they found people posting online. These posts said they could take pictures and do makeup. So, the officers pretended to be Hong Kong customers and contacted them.</p>
            <p>The Immigration Department announced that during actions taken in the last week, they arrested four photographers and four makeup artists from mainland China. They also arrested two local people. The government charged seven of these people, and two of them have already been sent to prison.</p>
            <p>It was said that the photographers from mainland China mostly took pictures for customers at popular places after coming to Hong Kong. Each time, they charged from 300 Hong Kong dollars (about 1170 New Taiwan Dollars) to 2000 Hong Kong dollars. Makeup artists rented rooms in hotels to provide their services to customers.</p>
