            <h1>TSMC Stock Price Moves Little, Taiwan Stock Market Shakes Near 23,000 Points</h1>
            <p>Before TSMC's meeting for investors, people who buy and sell stocks are waiting to see what happens. Today, TSMC's stock price moved up and down very little, which made the Taiwan stock market go up and down near 23,000 points. At 10:30 AM, the main market index went up by 16 points to 23,059 points. The total value of stocks traded was about 169.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>TSMC's stock price started at 1,130 New Taiwan Dollars today. Then it went up and down. At one point, it fell by 15 New Taiwan Dollars to 1,115 New Taiwan Dollars. This caused the Taiwan stock market to fall below 23,000 points.</p>
            <p>Other important stocks, like Hon Hai, stayed flat or went up a little today, rising by 1.5 New Taiwan Dollars at most to 164 New Taiwan Dollars. MediaTek's stock went down, falling by 25 New Taiwan Dollars at most to 1,385 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a main part of the Taiwan stock market right now. Stocks related to BBU (Battery Backup Unit) were strong. For example, Shin Sung Li company paid out 2 New Taiwan Dollars per share today. Its stock price went up to 106 New Taiwan Dollars, hitting the daily limit. This made the stock prices of ShunTa and CPT also go up by more than half of the daily limit.</p>
            <p>Liao Bing-kun, a fund manager at PGIM Prudential, said that the main Taiwan stock market is still moving up and down at high levels. If we look at different types of stocks, Nvidia's stock price reached a new high. Last week, its total value went over 4 trillion US dollars. Also, a lot of money came into the market. This made AI-related companies in Taiwan do well and pushed up the electronic stock index.</p>
            <p>However, US President Trump announced new taxes on goods, but Taiwan was not on the list. New taxes on computer chips are also coming soon. For now, the issue of these taxes continues to make investors nervous.</p>

            <h1>Federal Reserve Beige Book Report: US Economic Activity Grows, but Outlook Becomes More Negative</h1>
            <p>On July 16, Washington D.C. reported that as US President Trump's economic plans started to work, businesses in the US told the Federal Reserve (Fed) in June and early July that they were having trouble because trade policies were changing quickly. Also, fewer immigrant workers made their problems worse.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Federal Reserve, which is the US central bank, said in its newest economic report that business activity has increased in recent weeks. But businesses also said that higher taxes on imported goods are making prices go up. The future economic outlook is described as "neutral to a bit negative."</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve's "Beige Book" report states that "people in different industries generally expect that costs will stay high in the next few months, which could make consumer prices start to rise faster by the end of summer." This report is based on surveys, interviews, and observations from business and community contacts by the 12 Federal Reserve banks in different areas, up to July 7.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis said that "a metal maker reported that their business is steady right now, but 'it seems like there is a bad drop in production coming, which means a fast decrease.'"</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta said that "some businesses raised prices before the new taxes on goods started... Other businesses said they would wait for trade policies to be clearer before changing prices. Even though trade policies put pressure on their profits, they can keep price changes small. Some people said they are still using old stock that they bought before the taxes, so they will wait to change prices."</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve noted that jobs only increased a little. "Many contacts expect to wait to hire a lot of people or fire many people until there is less uncertainty," they said.</p>
            <p>Policies about how immigrants are dealt with and sent out of the country are a very important part of US President Trump's plans. However, these policies seem to have caused problems for businesses in many areas.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that "a construction company said that not enough workers caused building projects to slow down. A landscaping company said they could not meet the needs of more than half of their customers."</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said that "some small companies that only work at certain times of the year reported that they could not find enough immigrant workers, so they decided not to open again."</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve's decision-makers have kept their main interest rate the same, between 4.25% and 4.50%, since last December. Most people think the rate will stay the same at least until September because they are watching how the economy changes after new policies, like trade policies.</p>
            <p>Trump has often strongly criticized Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, and has asked the Fed to lower interest rates right away. Earlier today, Bloomberg reported that Trump might fire Powell, but Trump later told reporters he does not plan to do that. However, Trump still criticized Powell's management and did not say he would definitely not fire him.</p>
            <p>Some Federal Reserve decision-makers said they would think about lowering interest rates as early as their meeting on July 29-30, in case the job market gets even weaker.</p>
            <p>In June, US consumer prices increased the most in five months. Prices for some main imported goods, like clothes, home items, toys, and sports goods, pushed prices up.</p>
            <p>Federal Reserve officials, including Lorie Logan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, think that the effect of new taxes on rising prices will become clearer in the autumn. Others, like Susan Collins, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said that the taxes might not make prices go up as much as people fear.</p>
            <p>To understand what will happen, Federal Reserve decision-makers said they are especially watching the everyday experiences of people and businesses, as highlighted in the "Beige Book."</p>

            <h1>Environmental Group: Most Beach Trash is Bottled Water and Tea, Energy Drinks Now Third Highest</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 17 (CNA) â€“ The RE-THINK Environmental Education Association announced today that their newest study of beach trash shows that bottled water and tea drinks are the most common trash. But energy drinks have become the third most common, which means people feel very tired. Most of the trash is plastic bottles, followed by glass and metal cans.</p>
            <p>RE-THINK collected trash from 59 beaches across Taiwan (27 in the north, 17 in the center, 12 in the south, and 3 in the east) for one year, from April last year to April this year. They collected a total of 8,249 pieces of trash from beaches. Out of these, 2,356 pieces were plastic bottles of "water" drinks, making up about 28% of all food packaging trash. "Tea" drinks were second, making up 21.7% (1,826 pieces).</p>
            <p>It is important to note that energy drink trash ranked third in this study, with a total of 1,313 pieces. This shows that people's "tiredness level" is nearly 15.6%. RE-THINK explained that these small, easy-to-carry energy drinks are often used by people who fish or do outdoor activities. However, most energy drinks come in glass bottles, which are hard to recycle and do not break down easily after being thrown away. They often become "hard bones" that stay on the coast for a long time after beach activities.</p>
            <p>When sorting by the material of the trash, RE-THINK said that plastic bottles are still the most common, with 5,677 bottles in total, making up about 67%. Glass bottles are second, at about 14.8%, and metal cans are about 5.4%.</p>
            <p>Further analysis showed that more than 50% of plastic bottles were found in northern areas (New Taipei, Keelung, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Yilan). Because of ocean currents, the northern area also has the highest percentage of trash from other countries (about 20%).</p>
            <p>RE-THINK encourages people to recycle well, saying that Taiwan has very good recycling technology. Also, according to the "Waste Disposal Act," if you throw trash in certain areas, like beaches, you could be fined between 1,200 and 6,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>RE-THINK will officially start the 12th "2025 Reclaiming Taiwan" island-wide beach clean-up on July 19. They plan to visit 9 beaches that are not taken care of, are far away, and have a lot of trash. They will also go to Matsu, an outer island, for the first time. They invite people to join the actual clean-up and to learn deeply about why beach trash exists, so everyone can think again about how their daily habits affect the environment.</p>
