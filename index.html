            <h1>NTNU Women's Football Blood Sample Case: Coach Chou Tai-ying Sent for Further Questioning</h1>
            <p>News from Taipei on August 25th. There is a disagreement about blood samples from the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office told the Taipei City Investigation Office to search the home and office of the person accused, Chou Tai-ying. They also questioned Chou Tai-ying. Four other people, including teacher Chen Chung-ching, were also asked to come as witnesses. They were all sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for more questioning later in the evening.</p>
            <p>Chou Tai-ying, a famous former Taiwanese women's football player and the NTNU women's football coach, is accused of threatening players. She allegedly said she would take away their course credits if they did not give blood samples for a study. On July 16th, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office started an investigation into this "other case." They asked prosecutors who handle crimes against people to lead the investigation with the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau's Taipei City Investigation Office.</p>
            <p>Investigators asked the Ministry of Education, the National Science and Technology Council, National Central University, and National Taiwan Normal University for information about the research project. They also interviewed one research assistant and 18 current and former women's football team members (12 were questioned again by prosecutors).</p>
            <p>After looking at all the documents and checking money flows, investigators believe Chou Tai-ying may have committed fraud and theft. They asked the court for a search warrant, which was approved.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office told the Taipei City Investigation Office to search Chou Tai-ying's home and office in three different places. Chou Tai-ying was called in as an accused person. Chen Chung-ching and four other people were called in as witnesses. They were all sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for more questioning later in the evening.</p>

            <h1>India Worries About Brahmaputra River Dam by China, Builds Its Own Dams Faster to Protect Water Supply</h1>
            <p>News from Parlong, India, on August 25th. India is worried that a big dam China is building on the Brahmaputra River in Tibet could cut India's water supply by up to 85% during dry seasons. This information comes from an Indian government report and four people who know about the situation. Because of this, India is now building its own dams faster to reduce the problem.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that in December last year, China said it would build the world's largest hydropower dam in a border area. This dam will be built before the Brahmaputra River enters India. New Delhi is concerned that China, which claims some parts of India's Arunachal Pradesh, might use control of the river as a weapon.</p>
            <p>Construction on China's Brahmaputra River dam started in July this year. This project will cost 170 billion US dollars (about 5 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). Once finished, it will make enough electricity for all of the United Kingdom every year.</p>
            <p>The Brahmaputra River starts from the Angsi Glacier. In India, it is called the Siang River and the Brahmaputra River.</p>
            <p>The Angsi Glacier provides water for over 100 million people in China, India, and Bangladesh downriver. The Indian government has been thinking about water projects to control water from the Angsi Glacier since the early 2000s. But people living in Arunachal Pradesh, near the Chinese border, are worried that building dams will flood their villages and ruin their lives. Because of this, they have stopped the plans with strong and sometimes violent actions.</p>
            <p>In May this year, India's biggest hydropower company took survey equipment to the planned site of the "Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam." Armed police protected them. If this dam is built, it will be the largest dam in India.</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the situation said that high-level Indian officials have continued to meet this year to speed up dam construction. The office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi organized one of these meetings in July.</p>
            <p>The Indian government wrote a report without a date that explains its worries about the Brahmaputra River dam. Reuters confirmed the details of this report with four people who know about it and was the first to share it.</p>
            <p>Beijing has not released detailed plans for the Brahmaputra River dam to the public. The Indian government's report uses past studies from government groups like India's Central Water Commission. It also talks about how big the Brahmaputra River dam is expected to be.</p>
            <p>According to the sources and the report, New Delhi expects that the dam will let Beijing move up to 40 billion cubic meters of water. The problem of less water will be very clear during the dry months. In these months, large areas of India get hotter and drier.</p>
            <p>The Upper Siang Dam project plans to store 14 billion cubic meters of water. This will allow India to release water during the dry season to help with drought. According to sources and the report, Guwahati, an important city that uses a lot of water for industries and farming, will benefit. Without the dam, Guwahati's water supply would be about 25% less in the dry season. With the dam, it is expected to be only 11% less.</p>
            <p>The sources also said that this project can reduce the terrible results of Beijing releasing too much water.</p>
            <p>If the Upper Siang Dam's water storage is less than 50% of its height, it can completely take in any extra water released by China's water facilities. Two people who know about the situation said that India is thinking about keeping 30% of the dam's space empty at all times. This is to be ready for unexpected floods.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Reuters about the Brahmaputra River dam project. The spokesperson said that the project has been carefully studied for safety, environment, and science. They said it will not cause bad water, environmental, or geological effects on countries downriver. The spokesperson also added that China always acts responsibly when developing and using rivers that cross borders. They also said China has ongoing communication and cooperation with countries downriver like India and Bangladesh.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Modi's office and Indian ministries for water and foreign affairs did not answer questions from Reuters. The state-owned National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) also did not answer Reuters' request for comments.</p>
