            <h1>Health Insurance Data for Other Uses: People Can Apply to Opt Out Starting Today</h1>
            <p>The National Health Insurance (NHI) Administration said today that people can now choose not to let their health insurance data be used for other purposes. This data is mostly used for school and research. There are four types of data people can opt out of: insurance information, medical records, medical images and reports, and test results.</p>
            <p>A court decision in 2022 said that using NHI data for government or school research is allowed by the law. But it also said that there was no way to check how personal data was used, and people could not ask to stop their data from being used. This part was against the law. So, the law had to be changed within three years, and the deadline is August 12 this year.</p>
            <p>Shi Chong-liang, the head of the NHI Administration, went to an event today. After the event, reporters asked him about the right to opt out of the NHI data system. He said that using NHI data for other purposes is mainly for school research and helps the public. However, he also said that people's right to control their own data is important. This means they should have the right to choose to opt out.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shi said that a new law about managing NHI data has not passed yet. But because the main ideas of this law are important, the NHI Administration has announced rules for people to apply to stop their data from being used. These rules, called "National Health Insurance Data Research and Use and Stop Use Application Procedures and Management Guidelines," are the basis for people to opt out. People can start applying today.</p>
            <p>You Hui-chen, who leads a planning group at the NHI Administration, explained that people have four choices when they apply to stop their NHI data from being used for other purposes. The first choice is insurance information, like joining or leaving the insurance, or how much they pay for different jobs. The second choice is medical service records, which include hospital visits and medicine records. The third choice is medical images and reports about illnesses. The fourth choice is lab and test results.</p>
            <p>Ms. You said that people can apply online using the "NHI Express" app, or they can go to a local NHI office. It takes about 5 working days for the application to be approved. After approval, people will get a notice with the date when it starts. Opting out will only stop data from being used after that date. It will not stop data that was already used in the past.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's large amount of NHI data is seen as a very important and full database of health information. It has helped publish more than 9,000 papers in journals both in Taiwan and other countries. This has greatly helped school studies and medical progress. Mr. Shi said he hopes to keep the NHI database complete and hopes people will continue to support it. At the same time, he will keep making personal data protection stronger so that medical research in Taiwan can continue.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shi also said that when NHI data is used for other purposes, it must be reviewed by an ethics committee and the right government department. The data can only be used in special places, with separate computers and storage. The data is also made anonymous, so people cannot be identified. Data from rare cases is not shared with the public. Only study results can be taken out, and no unauthorized data can be taken out. This is to keep people's personal data safe.</p>

            <h1>Sea-almond Roots Have Salt-Resistant Good Bacteria, Help Improve Survival Rate of Windbreaks and Green Belts</h1>
            <p>Many coastal soils in Taiwan have too much salt, which makes it hard to plant trees. The Forestry Research Institute recently found good bacteria in the roots of a tree called sea-almond. These bacteria are very good at living in salty places and helping plants grow. Tests showed that these bacteria can help more windbreak trees and green areas stay alive.</p>
            <p>The Forestry Research Institute announced today that they found good bacteria from sea-almond roots that can live well in salty conditions and help plants grow. They used these bacteria on young Chinaberry trees in tests. The results showed that the bacteria greatly helped these young trees grow and make food through photosynthesis, even when there was a lot of salt.</p>
            <p>The Institute said that coastal plants like sea-almond grow in very salty places all year. Because of this, the small living things in their roots have developed special ways to live with salt. The research team looked closely at the roots of sea-almond trees. They used special ways to grow and choose over 182 types of helpful bacteria. They then tested each one to see how well it worked.</p>
            <p>The Institute found that 30 of the chosen bacteria can make a natural growth hormone called IAA. Also, these bacteria can make a special substance called "extracellular polysaccharides" when there is a lot of salt. These substances help plants keep their water balanced and make their roots strong. This helps plants fight against the harmful effects of salt.</p>
            <p>The Institute also found that some of these bacteria can help break down phosphorus in the soil, which helps plant roots grow. Importantly, some bacteria also have a special ability to break down ethylene, a gas that plants make when they are stressed. This helps plants grow better by reducing the bad effects of stress.</p>
            <p>The Institute said that from many promising bacteria, the research team chose three types: Bacillus subtilis, Rhizobium, and Pantoea ananatis. They put these bacteria on common tree seedlings called Chinaberry. They then did tests in a salty environment like the coast. The results showed that Pantoea ananatis helped the trees grow much better. Not only did they grow a lot more, but they also used sunlight well to make food. Their growth was about 30% better than trees without the bacteria.</p>
            <p>The Forestry Research Institute stated that this study shows how the helpful bacteria in sea-almond roots can make young trees more resistant to salt. In the future, this method could help plant more successful windbreak forests in areas like Taiwan's west and southwest coasts, where planting trees has been hard. This will help stop wind and sand, and protect farms and buildings.</p>

            <h1>Mustard Seed Association's Hualien-Taitung Material Hub Opens, Teams Up with Pxmart to Support Remote Families</h1>
            <p>Because of bad weather and the difficulty of getting supplies in Hualien and Taitung, the Mustard Seed Christian Association has opened a larger "Life Material Supply Center" in Hualien. This center will now be the main place for sending out supplies and helping people in Hualien and Taitung. Also, the Pxmart Sunshine Charity Foundation has now given over 6.4 million New Taiwan Dollars in supplies.</p>
            <p>Today, the Mustard Seed Christian Association held a press conference at the Hualien Training Institute. They announced the opening of the bigger Hualien warehouse for the "Life Material Supply Center." They also held a donation event with the Pxmart Sunshine Charity Foundation, called "Wholeheartedly, Jointly for Public Good."</p>
            <p>Li Zhao-jia, the CEO of the Mustard Seed Association, said that it took 10 years to get approval for the land used by the Training Institute. In March this year, the land use finally changed from "social education" to "social welfare." This means the place, which used to be a school, is now officially a social welfare group. Right now, there are warehouses in Taipei, Changhua, Hualien, and Taitung. They connect these places to gather donations and send them to families who need help. In the aboriginal areas of Hualien and Taitung, there are 11 places to store food, including Yuli, Haiduan in Taitung, and even Lanyu.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li also said that right now, two shipping containers are on their way to Myanmar. These containers hold donations from people in Taiwan, including many desks for students. The hope is that students in Myanmar will have desks to use when school starts in September, instead of just sending money. In Hualien, after the earthquake on April 3 last year, the Mustard Seed Association received donations from Pxmart. These were not just supplies, but also help for emergencies.</p>
            <p>The Mustard Seed Association explained that in July this year, the Hualien warehouse sent out 30% more care packages than in the same month last year. This shows that the need for everyday and emergency supplies in the eastern part of Taiwan is still growing. Also, the Hualien and Taitung areas face dangers from earthquakes and typhoons, and resources are not evenly shared. When roads are blocked, poor families can easily become "material islands," meaning they cannot get supplies during a disaster.</p>
            <p>The Pxmart Sunshine Charity Foundation has supported the Mustard Seed Association for a long time. Chen Yi-mei, a manager from Pxmart, said they have worked with the association for 5 years. This year, Pxmart donated about 1.5 million New Taiwan Dollars in supplies, and their total donations are now over 6.4 million New Taiwan Dollars. They hope to continue working together to help families in remote areas. She also saw the "work-for-relief" program, which helps people who have received help before get back into society by working. This good cycle is very valuable. In the future, they want to keep helping and send resources to every place in Hualien and Taitung that needs them.</p>
            <p>A single mother named A-Fen had health problems and lost her job because of a gas leak. The Mustard Seed Association helped her find work at the Hualien warehouse. She shared that her two children are sponsored by the Mustard Seed Association. With help from sponsors, their family's basic needs slowly became stable. She said, "My children can also help in the warehouse. We are not just people who get help; we can also start helping others." For A-Fen's family, the Hualien warehouse is a place where they can rest, get their lives back in order, and find a stable routine again.</p>
            <p>The Mustard Seed Association invites businesses and people from all parts of society to join them in helping Hualien and Taitung. They hope that by giving supplies and money, everyone can build a warm system of support for daily life.</p>
