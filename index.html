            <h1>Thailand's Prime Minister-elect Announces Some Cabinet Members, Promises to Bring Back Trust</h1>
            <p>Bangkok, September 6 (CNA) â€“ Thailand's new Prime Minister, Anutin, announced today that he will choose a senior diplomat, a high-ranking official, and a former head of an oil and gas company to be the new ministers of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Energy.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Anutin Charnvirakul said that Sihasak Phuangketkeow, a diplomat, Ekniti Nitithanprapas, an economist, and Auttapol Rerkpiboon, the former President and CEO of PTT, Thailand's national oil group, will lead "the main organizations they are in charge of." He added that this will "bring confidence."</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Anutin promised today to lead the temporary government towards new elections.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the parliament voted to confirm Anutin as the new Prime Minister. This ended the period of no clear leader that started a week ago when former Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was removed from her position.</p>
            <p>At a meeting held at his party's office, which was shown on Thai media, he said, "I think, politically, we are very clear that the parliament will be dissolved in four months. I will form the cabinet as quickly as possible."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, before the parliament's vote, the billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra suddenly left the country and went to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. He said he went to see friends and for medical treatment. The Supreme Court will make a decision on September 9 about his bail case, after he came back from exile in August 2023. Some people think this decision might send Thaksin back to prison.</p>
            <p>Anutin told reporters yesterday, "There will be no favoritism, no unfair treatment, and no revenge."</p>
            <p>Anutin was once Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Interior, and Minister of Public Health. He is perhaps best known for making cannabis legal in 2022. The King of Thailand still needs to approve his appointment as Prime Minister.</p>

            <h1>First Time in Over 3 Years: Surfer Dies After Shark Attack in Sydney</h1>
            <p>Sydney, September 6 (CNA) â€“ Today, a surfer was attacked by a shark in Sydney, the main city of New South Wales, Australia. Police have said that the man died from his serious injuries. This is the first time someone has died from a shark attack in Sydney in more than three and a half years. Because of this, some beaches have been closed for now.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the attack happened at Long Reef Beach, which is in northern Sydney. Police said that a little after 10 AM today, the man, whose name is not yet known, was surfing with friends about 100 meters from the shore when a large shark attacked him.</p>
            <p>John Duncan, the police chief for the Northern Beaches area of Sydney, said in a TV news conference that other surfers pulled the man out of the water. However, he had lost too much blood and died right there. His "injuries were very serious."</p>
            <p>Police also said that the man was an experienced surfer. Two broken pieces of his surfboard were found and sent for testing.</p>
            <p>Officials said that they do not know what kind of shark attacked the man today. The Northern Beaches Council in Sydney said in a statement that lifeguards are using jet skis to look for sharks at different beaches.</p>
            <p>The last time a shark killed someone in Sydney was in February 2022, when a swimmer was attacked near a beach. Before that, it was in 1963. This is the fourth shark attack in Australia this year where someone has died.</p>
