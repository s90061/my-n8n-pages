            <h1>Musk Accuses Netflix of Promoting Transgender Ideas, Calls for Unsubscriptions</h1>
            <p>Elon Musk, a very rich person, said today that Netflix, a company that streams shows, is promoting "transgender ideas." He asked his 227 million followers on social media to stop paying for Netflix.</p>
            <p>Musk joined a protest started by a conservative social media account called "Libs of TikTok." This is part of his newest "culture war" actions.</p>
            <p>Libs of TikTok asked people to stop using Netflix. They said Netflix shows a cartoon called "Dead End: Paranormal Park" and has policies that support many different kinds of people.</p>
            <p>The person who made "Dead End: Paranormal Park," Hamish Steele, got into trouble. Some people on the internet thought he spoke badly about a conservative internet celebrity, Charlie Kirk, after Kirk was attacked in September. This caused an angry reaction.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Musk shared a post from Libs of TikTok on his social media platform, X. He wrote, "Cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>The post showed a picture from a Netflix company report. The report said that Netflix has more directors and main characters who are not white.</p>
            <p>Musk later posted again, telling his followers, "For your children's health, cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>Hamish Steele himself wrote a post about this argument on another social media site called Bluesky, but it has now been taken down. He wrote, "These are all lies and bad words!"</p>
            <p>Musk has a personal connection to transgender issues. In 2022, his oldest daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, publicly changed her gender and legally changed her name and gender identity.</p>
            <p>Musk has said before that his children were "killed" by what he calls the "woke mind virus."</p>

            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up a lot, by 308.94 points, or 1.28%, closing at 24422.56 points.</p>

            <h1>Tesla's Third Quarter Deliveries Up 7%, Better Than Expected</h1>
            <p>(New York, October 2nd, Central News Agency) Tesla, a big electric car company, announced today that it delivered 7% more cars in the third quarter compared to the same time last year. This number was better than what experts expected. This helps change the trend of falling sales in the past few quarters. Sales had gone down because some customers did not like how CEO Elon Musk was involved in politics.</p>
            <p>News from AFP says that Tesla delivered 497,099 cars in the last quarter, which ended on September 30th. This is more than the 447,600 cars that FactSet, a financial data company, had predicted.</p>
            <p>Tesla did not share details about sales in different regions. However, car companies saw a clear increase in electric car sales in the US last quarter. This happened before a federal tax discount for buying cars, supported by US President Donald Trump, ended.</p>
            <p>In July, Elon Musk warned that Tesla's financial results might become difficult if the electric car tax discount stopped.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump passed a financial plan. This plan said that the federal tax discount for new electric cars, which was up to $7,500 per car, would slowly end starting from September 30th.</p>
            <p>However, car companies like General Motors and Ford Motor saw their electric car sales grow a lot in the third quarter before this plan ended.</p>
            <p>Recently, Tesla has faced challenges. There is more competition from Chinese electric car brands. Also, there is low demand for its electric truck, the Cybertruck.</p>
            <p>Musk has highlighted Tesla's potential to grow in self-driving and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. But some experts are disappointed that the company has not yet released a cheaper car, which is a long-term goal for Tesla.</p>
            <p>Even with the good delivery numbers, Tesla's stock price started high today but then fell. It dropped by more than 3% during the day.</p>
