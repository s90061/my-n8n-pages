Many companies are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) more and more in their daily work. A recent study shows that many workers worry about this. They feel they might lose their jobs or that their skills are no longer useful. About half of the workers surveyed said they feel like they are "falling behind" because of AI, seeing it do tasks they used to do. However, the study also found that companies are trying to help. Many businesses are investing in training programs. These programs teach employees new skills needed for working with AI. Experts say that AI will change jobs, not always remove them. People will need to learn to work alongside AI, using it as a tool to be more efficient. This means new opportunities for those who adapt.

**European Tourist Hotspots Introduce New Rules for Visitors**

Popular tourist cities in Europe are introducing new rules for visitors. This is happening because too many tourists are causing problems for local people and the environment. Cities like Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona are trying to find a better balance. They want to protect their culture and historic sites while still welcoming guests. For example, Venice has started charging a small fee for day-trippers. Amsterdam is limiting the number of large tour groups in its city center. Many places are also asking tourists to respect local customs and avoid noisy behavior late at night. These rules aim to encourage more responsible tourism. They want visitors to stay longer, spend money locally, and be more aware of their impact. Travel experts say that tourists should check the rules of their destination before they go. Being aware of these changes can help everyone enjoy these beautiful places for years to come.

**New Batteries Promise a Greener Future for Energy**

Scientists have made a significant step forward in green energy technology. They have developed new types of batteries that can store renewable energy for much longer periods. Currently, solar and wind power are excellent, but they don't produce electricity all the time. The sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow. This makes it hard to rely on them fully for our electricity needs. The new "long-duration" batteries can store energy for many hours, or even days. This means that power generated on a sunny or windy day can be used later, when it's needed most. This helps make the energy grid more stable. These new batteries are also becoming cheaper to produce and are safer for the environment than older types. They are made from more common materials. This innovation is very important for fighting climate change. It will help countries use more renewable energy and reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. It's a big step towards a fully green energy future.`;
