Taiwanese Artist Lin Yen-Chun's Sound Art at Swedish Festival

**paragraph1**
Taiwanese artist Lin Yen-Chun showed her special sound art at the Norberg Festival in Sweden. This festival for electronic music happened from July 10th to 12th in the town of Norberg. Her art piece, called "Here, a nut falls twice â€“ drift(in)circles," was liked by many people.

**paragraph2**
Lin Yen-Chun lives in Berlin and is known for her sound art. She mixes sounds, sculptures, dreams, and performances. Her art looks at how we feel between sleeping, waking up, and the unknown. This was a new version of her work, first shown in London. It fits the festival's theme of "re/growth," which means "to grow again."

**paragraph3**
Her art piece is like a living thing that changes. It was shown in an old mine tower. Before the festival, Lin Yen-Chun and other artists turned the tower into a dream-like space of sound. People lay down and listened to the sounds in a half-dream state. This showed how sounds, space, and society can change. Lin Yen-Chun's art shows that Taiwan has strong sound artists who are connected to the world.
