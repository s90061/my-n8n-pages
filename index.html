            <h1>Chicago's Traditional Parade Quiet and Tense Due to Fears of Trump's Immigration Raids</h1>
            <p>In Chicago, USA, the yearly Mexican Independence Day usually has lively and colorful parades for immigrants. But today, the city is quiet and tense. This is because people are worried that US President Trump will increase actions to remove immigrants.</p>
            <p>This year's celebration was different from the usual ones. In Chicago's old Mexican Pilsen area, a small group of folk dancers, wearing beautiful clothes and doing turning dances, gave out "Know Your Rights" booklets to the few people watching.</p>
            <p>Horse riders had Mexican flags tied to their horses' tails and orange whistles around their necks. They were ready to warn parade participants if immigration officers (ICE) arrived.</p>
            <p>Volunteers also stood along the roads, watching for any movement from immigration officers.</p>
            <p>Eddie Chavez, who grew up in the Pilsen area, stood by some lawn chairs along the parade route. He waved a Mexican flag and said, "This place should be full of people... but now it's empty, like a ghost town."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump wrote a post on his social media, "Truth Social." He mentioned the movie "Apocalypse Now," suggesting that immigration raids would happen soon in Chicago.</p>
            <p>Trump's post said, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning... The City of Chicago will understand why this unit (Department of Defense) is called the War Department." The post included a picture of Trump in a military uniform with fires and the Chicago skyline behind him.</p>
            <p>JB Pritzker, the Democratic Governor of Illinois, has always openly criticized Trump. On September 2nd, he said he believed that immigration officers would carry out raids during the Mexican Independence celebrations this weekend and next weekend.</p>
            <p>Some Mexican cultural events in the Chicago area were also postponed or canceled because of worries about these raids.</p>

            <h1>Los Angeles Police Stop Protecting Kamala Harris After Criticism</h1>
            <p>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) has stopped giving temporary protection to former Vice President Kamala Harris. This decision came today, September 6th, after they received strong criticism from inside the department. This happened after US President Trump recently removed her Secret Service protection. It is now unclear who will protect Harris as she begins a tour to promote her new book.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles Times reported that the LAPD stopped protecting former Vice President Kamala Harris today. This was because the police union disagreed. They said it was wrong to use police officers to guard a "rich person worth millions." They felt this took away from keeping Los Angeles citizens safe, especially since she could hire her own private security.</p>
            <p>After leaving office in January, Kamala Harris had Secret Service protection for six months. Former President Joe Biden extended this for another year before he left the White House. However, current President Donald Trump canceled this extension in a written note.</p>
            <p>Harris's protection was supposed to last until July 2026. The Associated Press said that Harris was considered a high-risk person when she was Vice President. But recent checks by the Secret Service showed there are no current serious threats.</p>
            <p>Sources told the Los Angeles Times that many police officers strongly disliked being taken away from their crime-fighting duties.</p>
            <p>Until this morning, some LAPD officers were still working outside Harris's home in Brentwood.</p>
            <p>Last week, an LAPD spokesperson said the department would protect Harris until another plan was made. They added that this temporary help was to make sure the former Vice President's protection did not stop.</p>
            <p>FOX 11, a TV station in Los Angeles, was the first to report that the LAPD was helping with Harris's security. After this, police officers criticized the decision. The police union even released a statement calling Harris a "failed presidential candidate." They also blamed California Governor Gavin Newsom, saying if he wanted to please Harris, he should pay for her security himself.</p>
            <p>These changes to her security come as Harris is about to start promoting her new book. Her memoir, "107 Days," talks about her short time running for president. She plans to visit 15 cities to promote it.</p>
            <p>It is currently unknown who will be responsible for Harris's security during her book tour. People in the US have different opinions about this situation.</p>
