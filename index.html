            <h1>First local paratyphoid case in 2025: Man in his 20s hospitalized with diarrhea and fever</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced today the first local case of paratyphoid fever this year. A man in his twenties, who is not Taiwanese, showed symptoms in late August after coming to Taiwan. Because he was in Taiwan during the time he could have caught the sickness, it is believed to be a local case. The source of the infection is still unknown.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yung-ching, a CDC doctor, explained in today's regular weekly report that the patient is a man in his twenties from northern Taiwan. He is not Taiwanese and has no previous serious health problems. He came from India in early August and lived in central Taiwan until late August. On August 26th, he had a fever, diarrhea, and headache that did not go away. On September 1st, he went to the hospital emergency room and was treated in a regular ward.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yung-ching said that tests on the man's blood showed bacteria that looked like paratyphoid. After telling the CDC, it was confirmed to be a case of paratyphoid fever. He was treated with medicine (antibiotics) and got better. He was in the hospital for two weeks and left in mid-September.</p>
            <p>Regarding the investigation, Dr. Lin Yung-ching explained that the patient was in Taiwan during the 1 to 10 days before he got sick. So, it is thought to be a local case. The three people he lived with do not have symptoms, and their stool tests were negative. Also, the patient said he does not drink raw water, eat raw food, or eat seafood often. Therefore, the source of the infection is still unknown, and they will check his food history more carefully.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo Hung-wei, the director of the CDC's epidemic center, said that the CDC's numbers show one local case of paratyphoid fever this year up to September 22nd. From 2021 to 2025, the number of local cases was 1, 6, 26, 3, and 1. The number of cases from other countries was 0, 0, 2, 1, and 0. For the cases from other countries in 2023 and 2024, the infected countries were Indonesia, India, and Cambodia, one case from each.</p>
            <p>About the global situation, Mr. Kuo Hung-wei stated that about 2.16 million cases of paratyphoid fever are reported each year, and 14,000 of these people die. Most of them are children. The sickness is most common in South Asia, with over 90% of cases. After that are Southeast Asia, West Africa, and East Asia. The countries with the most cases are Pakistan, India, and Nepal.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tseng Shu-hui, a CDC spokesperson, explained that paratyphoid fever is a stomach sickness caused by Salmonella Paratyphi bacteria. It mainly spreads when people eat food or drink water that has been touched by the poop or pee of someone who is sick or carries the bacteria. The time before symptoms appear is usually 1 to 10 days. A person can spread the sickness for 1 to 2 weeks. Common symptoms are a fever that does not go away, headache, feeling unwell, not wanting to eat, stomach pain, diarrhea, a heart rate that is slower than normal, or a rash on the body.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tseng Shu-hui reminded people to always pay attention to food safety and clean hands. Drinking water should be boiled or bottled. Food must be cooked well before eating. When cooking and preparing food, people should avoid raw food touching cooked food. Also, it is important to practice good personal hygiene. Before eating, after going to the toilet, before handling food, or after changing diapers, you should wash your hands well with soap and water. This is the best way to stop the infection.</p>

            <p>Mr. Lin Tian-lai, the chairman of the Taipei Egg Dealers' Association, told reporters that after the Zhongyuan Festival, the demand for eggs went down.
