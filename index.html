Apple has recently shown its strong commitment to artificial intelligence (AI) by launching a new iPad Pro. This latest model comes with a new, very powerful M4 chip. This chip was built especially for handling AI tasks, showing that Apple is now focusing a lot on AI, just like other big technology companies such as Microsoft and Google.

The new M4 chip makes the iPad Pro incredibly thin and light. Despite its light design, it offers excellent performance, making it a great choice for professionals who need a lot of power for their work. This move suggests that AI will play a central role in future Apple products.

**The Rise of the Four-Day Work Week Around the World**

More businesses are testing a four-day work week, where employees work fewer days but still get paid the same amount. This idea is becoming popular globally as companies look for new ways to improve work-life balance.

Early results from these trials have been very positive. They suggest that employees work more effectively, feel happier and healthier, and even take fewer sick days. However, introducing a four-day week isn't always easy. It can be difficult to change how work is done, and some types of jobs or industries find it harder to start than others. Despite these challenges, many countries are becoming interested in this new approach to working.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day-Trippers**

Venice, the famous Italian city, has recently begun to charge a â‚¬5 fee for tourists who visit for just one day. This new rule applies especially on busy days when the city expects many visitors. This step is an effort to control the huge number of tourists and to protect the city's sensitive environment and old buildings.

However, not everyone has to pay. People who live in Venice and tourists who stay overnight in hotels or apartments do not need to pay the fee. The main goal of this new charge is to make tourism more sustainable in Venice and improve the daily life for people who live there. It's hoped that this will help preserve the unique city for the future.`;
