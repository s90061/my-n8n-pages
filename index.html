Artificial intelligence (AI) is now often making important choices about people’s lives. For example, AI can help decide if someone gets a loan or a job. A recent study, which asked nearly 12,000 people in 11 countries, found that many don’t even know AI is involved in these big decisions. People are also worried if AI is fair, clear about how it works, and who is responsible when AI makes a mistake. This shows a growing concern about how AI affects daily life.

Many popular places to visit around the world are getting too many tourists. This problem, called "over-tourism," means there are too many people for the local services, transport, and daily life of the people who live there. Cities like Venice, Amsterdam, and Kyoto are now taking steps to fix this. For example, they are adding special taxes for tourists, making stricter rules for holiday rentals, and limiting how many big cruise ships can visit. These actions aim to control how many people visit and to protect the local areas and the people living there. The idea is to make tourism better for everyone in the long run.`;
