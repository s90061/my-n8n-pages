            <h1>Army Uses Digital Microwave and Satellite Systems to Keep Hualien Disaster Relief Communications Open</h1>
            <p>A lake formed by a landslide in Hualien's Matai'an River has caused floods. The Army announced today that 2,500 soldiers are helping with the disaster relief. To make sure the relief work is effective, the Second Combat Area has sent out mobile digital microwave systems and satellite systems. These systems can connect to regular mobile phones, police and fire radios, and low-orbit satellites. This helps keep communication lines open all day.</p>
            <p>The Army Headquarters shared in a press release this evening that the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Combat Areas continue to help with disaster relief to rebuild the affected areas in Hualien. They have sent about 2,500 soldiers and 472 pieces of equipment for 13 different tasks to help with the recovery. They hope to help people in the affected areas return to their normal lives before the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>The Army explained that the forward command post for the disaster is working hard on relief efforts based on its plans and progress. They have also prepared for rotating troops from other areas, providing food and housing, and arranging transportation. This helps speed up the recovery. While soldiers are working hard, leaders must take good care of their soldiers. They should check on their mental and physical health. Also, they need to share out work and rest fairly to make the whole relief effort better.</p>
            <p>The Army also said, "Operations depend on command, and command depends on communication." Disaster relief is like an operation, so it is very important to keep command and communication open 24 hours a day. To make sure help can be given as quickly and effectively as possible, the communication unit of the Second Combat Area has sent out mobile digital microwave systems and satellite systems. These systems offer regular and internet phone services. They can connect to civilian mobile phones, various radios used by police and fire departments, and low-earth orbit satellites. This keeps communication for command and information transfer open all day.</p>
            <p>Also, the Army has given out full-frequency radios. These radios help leaders of frontline troops in the disaster area connect quickly with police, fire departments, and rescue groups. This brings together military and civilian communication systems. It makes sure that orders and information are sent quickly. This helps the forward command post understand the disaster situation fast and accurately. It also helps them to use rescue workers, machines, and other resources better.</p>
            <p>The Army also said that to help volunteers travel, the transport center of the forward command post has organized transport from the Second, Fourth, and Fifth Combat Areas. They have sent 3.5-ton trucks to help volunteers with rides and delivering meals in groups. So far, they have made 39 trips and helped 897 people.</p>
            <p>The Army stressed that it will continue to send more soldiers to help with the disaster relief as needed by local governments. They will speed up the recovery work. They will also make sure that frontline soldiers are safe and well-cared for. This will keep the rescue teams in the best condition. They will work together with local governments and people to quickly rebuild after the disaster and help those affected return to stable lives.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: Diverting Matai'an River Is to Stabilize Water, Not to Be Confused with Landslide Lake</h1>
            <p>A lake formed by a landslide in Hualien's Matai'an River caused serious damage to Guangfu Township. Some people questioned why the Matai'an River levee was not fixed. The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the levee has been repaired. The main reason for the disaster was that too much water flowed over the levee, more than it was designed to handle, not a problem with the levee itself. The purpose of diverting the water is to make the river flow steadily. Also, the area where the work is being done is different from where the landslide lake is, so people should not mix them up on purpose.</p>
            <p>The floods from the landslide lake in Hualien's Matai'an River caused bad flooding in Guangfu urban area downstream. A 2-kilometer part of the levee in Guangfu Township was also washed away. After two days of hard work by the Water Resources Agency under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the water from the Matai'an River that was flowing into the urban area was successfully moved into a deep channel this morning. This changed the direction of the water.</p>
            <p>Regarding questions about the Matai'an River levee being broken and not fixed, the Ministry of Economic Affairs posted on Facebook today. They said that levees Guangfu No. 2 and No. 3 were repaired by the Water Resources Agency before the storm. The main reason for this disaster was that the amount of water flowing over the levee was more than it was built for, not a problem with the levee itself.</p>
            <p>About why the landslide lake was not dealt with before if water could be diverted, the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that the locations are completely different. The area for diverting water is on the right side of the downstream Guangfu levee section of the Matai'an River. Its purpose is to make the river flow steadily. The landslide lake is in the upstream part of the Matai'an River where there are no roads. People should not confuse these two things on purpose.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the water flow of the Matai'an River was successfully directed into a deep channel this morning. This has reduced the risk of floods. After this, they will start full recovery and dredging work.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs thanked the hard-working employees and teams on the front lines who are helping with disaster relief and repairs. They used 151 pieces of equipment and more than 200 people to build an earthen levee. This reduced the risk of flooding and kept people safe.</p>
