            <h1>Teacher's Award Winners Call for Fewer Credits and Less Admin Work, Letting Students Learn What They Want</h1>
            <p>Today, the 2025 Teacher's Award ceremony was held. 72 teachers received this special honor. When they spoke to the media, the winners gave many suggestions. These included reducing administrative work, focusing on outdoor education, and letting students take fewer classes so they can learn what they really want.</p>
            <p>Wang Zhi-yuan, a professor from Sun Yat-sen University's Business Department, lost his four arms and legs at age 45 because of a serious infection. But he kept teaching with great passion. He not only taught students facts but also how to face life's challenges with strength.</p>
            <p>Today, Professor Wang told reporters that he believes there is a reason he is still alive. Before, he was strict with students and thought they were slow to think. After his life-changing event, his way of teaching changed. He now understands that everyone learns at their own pace. Students need more help, not more pressure.</p>
            <p>Now, many students ask Professor Wang for help when they have problems. He humbly said he is not a trained counselor. So, he mainly listens. He also shares his own life experiences to help students think about solutions and new possibilities in their lives.</p>
            <p>Professor Wang also said that university students today take too many classes. They want to do internships, study abroad, and finish school on time. He often sees students taking 27 or 28 credits in one semester. He explained that students in other countries usually take only 3 to 4 classes per semester. But for every 2 hours of class, they also spend 6 hours on activities outside of class.</p>
            <p>Professor Wang said that Taiwan's university system often leads to "surface learning." Students take many classes but can only truly focus on one or two. This way of learning often wastes both teachers' and students' time. He hopes the system can get better, and students can also think about how to learn more effectively.</p>
            <p>Another Teacher's Award winner is Jiang Yan-lin, a teacher at San Duo Elementary School in New Taipei City. He has spent many years teaching dodgeball. Today, he said that he hopes children can have more chances to suggest what they want to learn, even if it's not a school subject.</p>
            <p>Jiang Yan-lin noted that many people worry teachers won't know how to teach what children suggest. But he said no one knows everything from birth. Teachers and students can try things together. They can talk about "how to learn" and who to ask for help. Even if they fail, it's a good life experience.</p>
            <p>Ni Tong-juan, a teacher at Huiji Junior High School in Taoyuan City, used to be a flight attendant. Abroad, she saw children with more confidence and better speaking skills. In contrast, many Taiwanese students were shy and quiet. So, she decided to become a teacher. She started by teaching English to children and slowly worked her way into the education system.</p>
            <p>Ni Tong-juan also taught Chinese in Michigan, USA, for three years. She hopes that teaching Chinese can help more people understand Chinese culture. This can lead to better understanding among people and help solve problems. She also encourages teachers who like to try new things to be brave and teach abroad.</p>
            <p>Huang Nai-wen, a teacher at Anle High School in Keelung City, has been involved in outdoor education for many years. Today, he shared that the key to outdoor education is not to do it alone. Teachers can form teams across different schools, check for risks, and get professional help. When more people work together, children can have better and safer spaces to explore.</p>
            <p>Jiang Zeng Wei-mei, a teacher at Hualien High School of Business, has worked in school administration for many years. She admitted that 8 hours a day is not enough, and she has to do many things at once. In the past, teachers worked all day and did not rest on holidays. But now, younger teachers want more time to relax. This makes many people not want to do administrative work. She asked for simpler administrative tasks and more focus on making clear rules. This would help new people learn the job faster.</p>

            <h1>Meta's New Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Revealed: Supports AI, Has Built-in Screen</h1>
            <p>Today, Meta showed its first smart glasses for regular people. These glasses have a special screen you can see inside the lens. Meta hopes these new Ray-Ban Meta glasses will continue to be popular, just like their earlier smart glasses that became bestsellers when AI first started to become popular.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, showed the new Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses. He tried to show how to answer a call, but it did not work.</p>
            <p>Zuckerberg said, "I don't know what to say, I keep messing up." Even with this small problem, the people watching still clapped.</p>
            <p>These smart glasses have a small screen inside the right lens. This screen can show simple things like messages. The glasses cost 799 US dollars (about 24,065 New Taiwan dollars). They will be sold starting on September 30.</p>
            <p>Today, Meta held its annual Connect 2025 developer conference in California, USA. The new smart glasses were the most important part of this event.</p>
            <p>Meta has always been a leader in making smart glasses. However, it is behind other companies like OpenAI (which made ChatGPT) and Google (part of Alphabet) in making advanced AI programs.</p>
            <p>To catch up in the AI race, Zuckerberg has started a big competition for talented people in Silicon Valley. He is hiring engineers from other companies. He has also promised to spend tens of billions of US dollars to buy the best AI chips.</p>
            <p>Zuckerberg believes that smart glasses will be perfect for "super smart" personal assistants. This is because people can wear glasses all day. They can see, hear, and interact with the world through the user's eyes.</p>
            <p>To make this idea happen, Meta also showed a new pair of Oakley glasses called Vanguard today. These are for people who play sports. They cost 499 US dollars (about 15,000 New Taiwan dollars) and will be available on October 21. These glasses can connect to fitness apps like Garmin and Strava. They give real-time training information and summaries after exercise. The battery lasts for 9 hours.</p>
            <p>Besides these two glasses, a new version of the Ray-Ban series was also released. It has double the battery life of the old model and a better camera. These cost 379 US dollars (about 11,400 New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>All these devices have the same features as before. These include Meta's AI assistant, a camera, and hands-free operation. They can also share content directly to social media like Facebook and Instagram.</p>
            <p>IDC, a company that studies data, thinks that in 2025, the number of augmented reality/virtual reality headsets and smart glasses without screens sent out around the world will grow by 39.2%. This means 14.3 million units. A big part of this growth will come from the Ray-Ban series products made by Meta and the Italian glasses company EssilorLuxottica.</p>

            <h1>Yang Shuang-tzu and Jin Ling's Columbia University Lecture: Discussing Taiwanese Identity and Yuri Feelings</h1>
            <p>Today, Yang Shuang-tzu, the writer of "A Stroll Through Taiwan," and Jin Ling, the translator, gave a talk at Columbia University. They met with international students and professional translators. Andrew Nathan, a well-known political expert from Columbia University, led the discussion. They talked about many things, including Taiwanese identity and the love between women, known as "yuri."</p>
            <p>Since last year, "A Stroll Through Taiwan" has won important awards, like the US National Book Award and the Asia Society's translated literature award. Starting on September 17, writer Yang Shuang-tzu and translator Jin Ling are giving more talks in the US. They are meeting readers and online attendees.</p>
            <p>The first talk was at Columbia University's Weatherhead East Asian Institute in New York. Many international students and people who translate books came to listen.</p>
            <p>Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University expert in politics and Chinese affairs, led the talk. He was very interested in the book's themes. These included Taiwanese national identity, colonial history, same-sex love, and food. He praised the writer for her detailed historical research for the book.</p>
            <p>Yang Shuang-tzu explained that two Japanese women writers came to Taiwan during the colonial period. They traveled all over Taiwan and ate many local foods. When she wrote the book, she focused on three main things: Taiwan in the 1930s, the main railway across the island, and the delicious food available then.</p>
            <p>She also mentioned "yuri" as another important part. This refers to the special love between the two women. She said that this theme helped make the story feel softer, even when talking about difficult topics.</p>
            <p>Jin Ling, who studied at Columbia University, returned to her old school. Because she translated many Taiwanese foods in the book, readers might think she knows a lot about food. But she said she is not picky about food at all. When she worked at Columbia, she ate at the nearby Dig Inn restaurant every day. She often thinks about colonialism and politics. She said her translation of these themes runs through the whole book "A Stroll Through Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Interestingly, some readers ask her about the food in the book, but sometimes Jin Ling doesn't remember. She laughed and said, "There's so much food in the book, but I focused more on the historical parts."</p>
            <p>Many people at the event were very interested in how Taiwan's identity has changed. They asked about the shift in power in Taiwan's recent history, from Japanese rule and the Republic of China to today's democratic Taiwan. They also asked about women's roles, the country, and Taiwan's future. Yang Shuang-tzu spoke freely about all these topics.</p>
            <p>Yang Shuang-tzu and Jin Ling will give more talks in New York, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Texas. They hope to reach more American readers.</p>
