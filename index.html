            <h1>South China Sea Conflict: Philippines Says Chinese Coast Guard Hit Its Ship</h1>
            <p>The Philippine coast guard says a Chinese ship deliberately hit a government boat near Thitu Island in the South China Sea today. They called this a 'clear danger.' This makes the situation more tense in the South China Sea, where different countries claim ownership.</p>
            <p>Ships from the Philippines and China often face each other in the South China Sea. China claims almost the whole South China Sea, but an international court has said this claim is not legal.</p>
            <p>The Philippines reported that a Chinese coast guard ship used water cannons on the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries boat, BRP Datu Pagbuaya, at 9:15 AM today.</p>
            <p>The statement said, 'Only three minutes later, the same Chinese ship purposely hit the back of the Philippine boat. This caused some small damage to the boat's structure, but no one on the boat was hurt.'</p>
            <p>The Philippine coast guard said this event happened near Thitu Island. This island is one of the Spratly Islands, which many countries claim. China has been trying to control this area for a long time.</p>
            <p>Pictures and videos from the Philippine coast guard show a Chinese coast guard ship firing water cannons while following a Philippine ship.</p>
            <p>The Philippine coast guard said, 'Even with their strong and aggressive actions... we will not be afraid or forced to leave.'</p>
            <p>After the Philippines said a Chinese coast guard ship 'hit' a Philippine government boat in the South China Sea, China blamed the Philippines for the crash.</p>
            <p>Liu Dejun, a spokesperson for the China Coast Guard, said the Philippine government boat 'did not listen to China's serious warnings many times and came too close' to other Chinese ships. He said, 'The Philippines is fully responsible.'</p>
            <p>Last month, the Philippine government said a Chinese coast guard ship attacked the Philippine Bureau of Fisheries boat, BRP Datu Gumbay Piang, with water cannons near Huangyan Island. This island is controlled by China. The attack broke the windows of the boat's control room and injured one person.</p>
            <p>In August, a Chinese navy ship also hit its own coast guard ship while chasing a Philippine patrol ship near Huangyan Island.</p>

            <h1>Qantas: 5.7 Million Customer Details Leaked After July Cyberattack</h1>
            <p>Qantas Airways announced today that hackers have put the personal information of 5.7 million customers online. This information was stolen in a big computer attack in July.</p>
            <p>News agency Agence France-Presse reported that Qantas said in a statement: 'Qantas is one of many companies globally whose information has been shared by cybercriminals. This company was attacked by hackers in early July, and customer information was taken through another company's computer system.'</p>
            <p>In July, Qantas said that hackers attacked a customer service center and entered a computer system that another company used.</p>
            <p>The large Australian airline stated that hackers successfully got personal details. These included customers' names, email addresses, phone numbers, and birth dates.</p>
            <p>Qantas confirmed today that this information is now online. They are working with computer security experts to learn precisely what data was leaked.</p>
            <p>Qantas also got a special legal order from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. This is the court in the area where their main office is. This order 'prevents anyone, including other companies, from looking at, sharing, using, sending, or making public the stolen information.'</p>

            <h1>Thai Foreign Minister Goes to Malaysia to Discuss Border Tension with Cambodia</h1>
            <p>Thailand's Prime Minister, Anutin, announced today that Foreign Minister Sihasak will travel to Malaysia. He will attend a meeting organized by Malaysia. The main goal is to reduce the tension between Thailand and Cambodia at their shared border.</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Post newspaper reported that Anutin Charnvirakul said Thailand welcomes Malaysia's efforts to help create peace. However, Thailand will stick to its four conditions before making any long-term agreement with Cambodia.</p>
            <p>These four conditions are: Cambodia must take away its heavy weapons, clear landmines from the border, fight against online scams that cross the border, and move Cambodian people who are living illegally on Thai land.</p>
            <p>Thailand and Cambodia have had disagreements for many years about who owns certain parts of their border that are not clearly defined. In July, a land dispute caused fighting at the border, and at least 48 people lost their lives. Malaysia helped both countries, and they agreed to stop fighting on July 28. However, small conflicts still happen now and then.</p>
            <p>Also, on October 9, Sihasak Phuangketkeow said that Thailand would think about having a public vote to decide if two agreements about the border with Cambodia should be stopped. Prime Minister Anutin said he would wait for the results of the parliament's study first.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the Thai army is still working to remove landmines in the border area between Thailand and Cambodia. The Nation newspaper reported yesterday that the Thai army found three PMN-1 landmines, which are dangerous for people, in a border village in Sa Kaeo province.</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Post had previously reported that this work to clear landmines is mostly to get Cambodian people who are living illegally on Thai land to leave.</p>
            <p>The Thai Army's Burapha Task Force stated that these landmines were old but could still cause serious injury. Experts have removed them safely by following proper procedures.</p>
            <p>The Thai army explained that these landmines were left from past conflicts. Because Cambodian authorities had stopped Thai soldiers from going into some border areas, the mines could not be removed completely. After checking, it was confirmed that these mines came from Cambodia. The Thai army also pointed out that finding these mines shows how important it is for Thailand and Cambodia to work together to clear them.</p>
