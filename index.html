            <h1>Beitou Junior High Girls' Softball Team Wins Championship; Taipei City to Add One Million for Awards and Support</h1>
            <p>Taipei City's Education Department announced today that Beitou Junior High School's girls' softball team won the championship at the 2025 Babe Ruth League U16 Girls' Softball World Series. Besides congratulating them right away, the city will also give another NT$1 million (New Taiwan Dollars) for awards and special support.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Babe Ruth Softball 16U World Series was held in Alabama, USA. On August 9th, the Beitou Junior High School girls' softball team won the championship by beating Puerto Rico 12 to 1. This was the first time Taiwan had entered the competition, and they won.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, and Taiwan's representative in the US, Yu Da-tsai, sent congratulatory messages right away. They congratulated the Taiwan team for their great achievement. Liu Po-chun, an ambassador who helped the team go to the US, said she hopes to encourage the players to "see the world."</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Education Department said the team showed amazing strength. They won 7 games in a row against strong softball teams from countries like the United States, Japan, Australia, and Canada. To honor them for bringing fame to Taipei City, another NT$1 million will be used for awards and special support.</p>
            <p>The Education Department stated that the money will be used to reward individual players' good performance and to recognize the coaches' hard work. It will also help the school by improving training facilities, updating equipment, and providing new supplies. Also, it will help with setting up sports care stations.</p>
            <p>The Education Department also mentioned that before the competition, they gave NT$300,000 for the team to join. This was based on rules for helping excellent sports teams from schools go abroad for training and international sports events. They also cared for students who needed help on the team. An extra NT$114,000 was given through a fund for students from poor families. This, along with the long-term efforts of the school and coaches, and the students' hard work every day, led to this great achievement.</p>

            <h1>"Magical Taiwan â€“ Taiwan Literature Exhibition" Opens in Osaka at Cultural Expo</h1>
            <p>Today, "We TAIWAN: Taiwan Culture in Osaka, Kansai Expo" launched the "Magical Taiwan â€“ Taiwan Literature Exhibition." Wang Shih-sze, the Deputy Minister of Culture, said the exhibition space felt like a magical place. It brought spirits, monsters, and mythical creatures into a classic setting. Chen Ying-fang, the Director of the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, hopes the exhibition will help people in Taiwan and Japan understand each other better. She also hopes it will show the diverse and accepting nature of Taiwan's literature.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is held at the Osaka Central Public Hall. This old building was built in a Western style in 1918. The ceiling of the exhibition room has paintings of Japanese myths. The Taiwan literature exhibition shows six topics using three double-sided displays shaped like theater stages. These topics include "Indigenous Culture," "The Influence of Japanese Culture," and "Rediscovering Taiwanese Folklore."</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze said that the Osaka Central Public Hall is a magical place. This very old building matches the National Museum of Taiwan Literature from a certain time. That museum is in the old Tainan State Hall, which was built in 1916. She added, "Today, we bring monsters, spirits, and mythical creatures into this space, making it a blessed place."</p>
            <p>She said that in Taiwan, the relationship between gods and people is special. "We are a country that treats gods as friends," she explained. In many literary works, you can see people's hopes, desires, things they regret that they couldn't finish, and strong feelings they can't let go of. These all become characters in stories and are kept forever.</p>
            <p>She said that when we see spirits, monsters, or mythical creatures, we can think about them differently. Maybe in literature, they are not really scary. Instead, they represent desires and wishes that could not be achieved in this life. These ideas continue through different times and different stories, fulfilling their purpose and completing the world between humans, gods, and supernatural beings.</p>
            <p>The National Museum of Taiwan Literature planned this exhibition. Chen Ying-fang said they especially worked with the Taiwan Provincial Cheng Huang Temple this time. This temple is the first Cheng Huang Temple in Taiwan. When they show spirits, monsters, and mythical creatures, they also want to show Japanese visitors how special Taiwanese gods are. Taiwanese gods are not just powerful protectors; they also represent blessings and good fortune. This unique cultural idea, like Taiwan's literature, is full of diversity and acceptance, allowing for different views and voices.</p>
            <p>She said she hopes this literature exhibition will help people in Taiwan and Japan feel a connection. At the same time, she hopes it will make people aware of their differences and help them understand each other better. This is the main message they want to give to visitors through this exhibition.</p>
            <p>Chen Ying-fang pointed out that this literature exhibition starts with Indigenous literature, showing how Taiwan's literature has changed over time. It not only displays Indigenous works but also includes works by Japanese writers who lived in Taiwan and wrote about it from an outsider's view. For example, writers like Nishikawa Mitsuru (1908-1999) and Sato Haruo (1892-1964) described Taiwan's unique character through their different cultural perspectives.</p>
            <p>She said the exhibition also shows Taiwanese folklore as an important source of creative energy. It presents works by modern writers who combine Taiwan's real society and nature. Their works mix history, natural environment, and magical realism. Also, Taiwanese poetry is very impressive. Through different types of works, they hope Japanese visitors can feel the charm of Taiwanese literature, like words from a magician.</p>
