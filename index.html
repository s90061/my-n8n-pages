            <h1>Taiwan's Startup Funding Reaches New High in 2024, Over NT$100 Billion</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te wants to make Taiwan a great place for new businesses and ideas. Today, the National Development Council (NDC) announced good news about this plan. In 2024, new businesses in Taiwan received 3.34 billion US dollars, which is about 107.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is the first time it has gone over 100 billion NT dollars. Even though it is a difficult time for money around the world, Taiwan's startup funding grew and reached a new high.</p>
            <p>President Lai's plan, called the "National Hope Project," aims to make Taiwan a strong environment for new companies. The goal is to get 150 billion New Taiwan Dollars in new business investments every year.</p>
            <p>Today, the NDC held a press conference to share its progress. Hsiao Chen-jung, who is in charge of industrial development at the NDC, said that in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made digital new businesses grow faster, like online shopping and cloud services. This caused investments in new businesses around the world to be very high in 2021. But after that, the money went down, and it became harder to get funding. However, in Taiwan, money for new businesses kept going up and reached new highs. In 2024, Taiwan's new businesses received more than 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars, about 107.2 billion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsiao explained that to reach the goal of 150 billion NT dollars after passing 100 billion, it's important to not only have more money available but also to have enough new companies to invest in. Right now, the government has three main plans: first, to put more money into investments and loans to help businesses; second, to encourage more people to start new companies; and third, to give more training to help these companies do well.</p>
            <p>To make more money available, the National Development Fund is trying new ways. They are using ten "10-billion-dollar funds" to help different industries grow. Right now, there are 7 of these big funds. Soon, they will also create 10-billion-dollar funds for health, sports, and military industries.</p>
            <p>James Chan, who is a high-level official at the NDC, added that the National Development Fund is still making more money available by investing in specific areas. They also have a new plan called the "Startup Blossom Program." This program aims to find more new businesses to help and to increase their chances of success by giving them advice.</p>
            <p>The NDC said that in the second half of 2025, they will start the "Startup Blossom Program." This program will choose 100 good local and regional teams. The best 3 teams will get 10 million New Taiwan Dollars each. Six other teams will get 6 million New Taiwan Dollars each. The rest of the teams will get 3 million New Taiwan Dollars each to help them start. In total, more than 300 million New Taiwan Dollars will be given out as awards.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chan said that the main idea is not just to give a lot of money. It is to help people who want to start new businesses. They will get training and learn the right ways to start a company. This will help them be more successful in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chan also noted that the NDC will help new businesses in Taiwan connect with international resources. They will also invite new businesses from other countries to come to Taiwan. This will make connections stronger. This helps big companies in Taiwan meet new international businesses, which can help them find new ways to grow.</p>

            <h1>Woman Suspected of Drunk Driving Stops Car on Highway 82, Causing Crash and Four Injuries</h1>
            <p>Last night around 8 PM, on Highway 82 in Chiayi, three cars crashed into each other. Four people were hurt and went to the hospital. Police think a woman named Fan was driving drunk. She reportedly stopped her car in the road. This caused two cars behind her to hit her car. After the crash, Ms. Fan left the scene. The police have now sent her case to the court.</p>
            <p>The Puzi Police Station in Chiayi County said today that Ms. Fan probably stopped her car in the lane because it broke down. After the accident, she walked away. When the police were told, they quickly found Ms. Fan to ask her what happened. Her alcohol level was 0.51 mg/L. She is suspected of drunk driving and leaving the accident scene. Her case has been sent to the Chiayi court to be looked into.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi County Fire Department said that last night, they got a call about a car crash near the 11-kilometer mark on Highway 82. They sent a team right away. When they got there, they saw three cars had crashed. Four people were hurt, one adult and three children. All of them were awake but felt pain in their bodies. Ambulances took them to Puzi Hospital for help.</p>

            <h1>Historian Chen Yi-shen: "End of War" Means Just That, Criticisms of Being Pro-Japan Are Unfair</h1>
            <p>Chen Yi-shen, who is the head of the Academia Historica, said today that some groups, like the Taiwan Affairs Office in China, say using the words "end of war" means supporting Japan. He said that criticizing something just by its title shows how divided and politically opposed society is. But he believes "it is not needed and not fair to us." He also said that for many people today, "end of war" simply means the war is finished, which is a neutral way to say it.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Chen Yi-shen went to an event. It was an academic meeting about the Sino-Japanese War and the time Taiwan was taken over after the war. There was also a book launch for "Chiang Kai-shek's Diaries (1937-1947)." He said that the three-day meeting and a small exhibit called "Light and Shadow: Important History from Taiwan Around 1945" want to help people look back and think about the history of this important time in a more complete way.</p>
            <p>He explained that the Academia Historica has been planning to publish the diaries of Chiang Kai-shek and his son for the past two years. This is part of their regular work, not a special event. But the diaries of former President Chiang Kai-shek that are being released now cover the years 1937 to 1947. This includes the eight years of the Sino-Japanese War and two years after the war. This time period fits well with the meeting. So, having the book launch at the same time makes sense and helps both events.</p>
            <p>He said that the Republic of China started to fight against Japan's attacks in 1931. After an event in 1937, it started a long and full war of resistance, mostly led by Chiang Kai-shek. The situation only changed a lot at the end of 1941 when the Pacific War started. Then, China, the US, and Britain became allies. In the end, these allies won in 1945.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that some news groups, people online, and even a spokesperson from China's Taiwan Affairs Office have criticized the Academia Historica. They say that using "end of war" shows support for Japan. They also say that not directly saying "Victory in the War of Resistance" means avoiding or twisting history. He said that such attacks, which only look at the title, show that there are disagreements and political fights in society. But he thinks "these attacks are not needed and not fair to us."</p>
            <p>He repeated that he often heard his father use phrases like "Japanese era" and "surrender." At first, he thought his father meant the same as what schools taught, which was "Restoration." This was because the words sound similar in Taiwanese and Japanese. However, "surrender" is how the Japanese saw it, and "Restoration" is how the Chinese saw it. These ideas are very different. He said this is because people have different life experiences, and we should respect each other's views. Also, he added that many people today use the term "end of war." This simply means the war is finished, which is a neutral way to say it.</p>
            <p>He said that one reason the Japanese military leaders gave for attacking China was to "fight communism." But this actually made Chiang Kai-shek stop fighting the communists. Instead, he had to work with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to "fight Japan." During the eight years of fighting, the CCP became stronger. After the war, in the Chinese Civil War, the CCP won with help from the Soviet Union and good political messages. This led to the creation of the People's Republic of China, a communist country.</p>
            <p>He said it is very ironic in history that Japan's attack on China helped create a communist China. On the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek led the full fight against Japan. He was asked to go to the Cairo Conference. In the end, he worked with the US, UK, and Soviet Union to defeat Japan. At the same time, he helped start the United Nations, and the Republic of China became one of its five main member countries. From a Chinese history point of view, these achievements are very important and cannot be forgotten.</p>
            <p>He also said that in Taiwan in 2025, when we look back at the big changes of 1945, 80 years ago, we can see things from different sides. The small exhibit called "Light and Shadow: Important History from Taiwan Around 1945" wants to show this. At that time, many smart people in Taiwan were happy because Japanese rule ended. They welcomed their "motherland" and accepted the idea of "Restoration." But also, the Republic of China government was not modern enough. They took over roughly and could not govern well. So, in less than a year and a half, the 228 Incident happened. The exhibit shows examples and diaries of people like Lin Hsien-tang to prove these changes.</p>
            <p>He said that in 1991, Stanford University published the first book about the 228 Incident. Its title was "A Tragic Beginning." This can be seen as the start of Taiwan's "Republic of China period." Later, when Taiwan became a democracy, it was called the beginning of the "Republic of China (in) Taiwan."</p>
            <p>He said this beginning involved the United States helping the Nationalist army take over Taiwan. This was based on promises made in the Cairo Declaration. It was like a "shared control" situation. This is why the US government did not get involved in the 228 Incident. It was not until late 1949, especially early 1950 when the Korean War started, that the US changed its mind. They then made a special plan for Taiwan and Penghu through the San Francisco Peace Treaty.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-shen said that this small exhibit of "Important Historical Materials" just wants to show how complex Taiwan was in 1945. It wants to avoid telling only one side of the story. It is not meant to give all the answers.</p>
