**Unrest During US Independence Day Holiday: Shootings and Boat Explosions**

The US Independence Day holiday this year was not peaceful. Many shooting incidents happened across the country. In Indianapolis, at least two people died. The police chief there said he was very upset and frustrated about the violence.

The Indianapolis police chief, Chris Bailey, said this violence was "completely unacceptable and unnecessary." He also said that parents and guardians need to teach their children better. He added that many children are not being supervised and that parents are responsible for their children's actions. One child died that night.

Other cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, and Brockton in Massachusetts also had many shootings. In Brockton, six people went to the hospital after a gunfight. Additionally, in Georgia, two boats exploded on lakes. One explosion on Lake Lanier injured seven people with burns, aged 5 to 45. Another boat sank on Lake Nottely, also injuring seven people with burns.

Violence and shootings often increase in the US during summer, especially around July 4th, which is often one of the deadliest times of the year.

**Wimbledon Upset: Defending Champion Krejcikova Out, Swiatek Advances to Round of 16**

At the Wimbledon tennis tournament, the defending women's singles champion from the Czech Republic, Barbora Krejcikova, lost today. She was defeated by American player Emma Navarro with scores of 6-2, 3-6, 4-6 in the third round. Meanwhile, Polish player Iga Swiatek, who used to be the world's top player, easily won her match and moved into the last 16 players.

Krejcikova, the 17th seed, won the first set, but then her play got worse. In the final set, she looked very tired and even needed a doctor. She has been struggling with a back injury this season. Even though she was sad, she kept fighting. When the score was 3-5 in the final set, she started crying while getting ready to serve. But she still managed to win her serve and make the score 4-5. However, Navarro, the 10th seed, stayed calm and won the next game, taking the match. Navarro will now play against Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian player.

On the other hand, Iga Swiatek had an easy win in her third-round match. She defeated American player Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3. Swiatek wanted to show she can play well on grass courts. She broke Collins's serve early in the first set and then served strongly to win it. Collins, who had beaten Swiatek earlier this year, tried hard but made many mistakes. Swiatek, who has won five Grand Slam titles but only reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before, won her match easily. She will play Clara Tauson from Denmark in the fourth round on July 7th.
