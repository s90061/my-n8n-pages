            <h1>Myanmar Earthquake Relief: Mustard Seed Association Starts Long-Term Aid</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 31 (CNA) â€” A big earthquake hit Myanmar in March, killing more than 3,000 people. The Christian Mustard Seed Association has continued to help. They have sent many groups of emergency supplies by air. They plan to give supplies for at least one year. They hope to help families in the disaster area have a stable daily life for a long time.</p>
            <p>On March 28, the strongest earthquake in 100 years hit Myanmar's Sagaing Region. It killed over 3,000 people and injured thousands. More than 50,000 people lost their homes and have not yet rebuilt their lives.</p>
            <p>The Christian Mustard Seed Association announced today that they started the "Myanmar Helping Net" project right after the earthquake. This was based on their goal to help people. They offer emergency aid, hot meals, set up children's centers, and run "work-for-rebuilding" programs to fix buildings. They work with local groups in Myanmar to put their "Three Blessings" idea into action. They keep showing Taiwan's care and love to the affected areas with real actions.</p>
            <p>The Mustard Seed Association said that in the first month after the earthquake, they sent 4 tons of emergency supplies by air. These included tents, sleeping bags, milk powder, diapers, canned food, and medical supplies. They sent them to shelters and orphanages in the Mandalay disaster area. These helped people and children with their urgent daily needs. They also gave 3,200 hot meals every day and continue to provide hot meals for 500 families daily to keep people healthy.</p>
            <p>Also, the Mustard Seed Association said that to keep giving supplies, they sent daily items by sea in three groups starting June 18. These included bedding and 768 boxes, almost 10 tons, of Japanese cooking oil. They finished sending these on July 16. All supplies were moved to the Mandalay disaster area. They plan to continue giving supplies for at least one year, or four seasons. They hope to help families in the disaster area have a stable daily life for a long time.</p>
            <p>Besides short-term help, the Mustard Seed Association also works with local partners in Myanmar to set up "Hope Home" children's centers. They are now taking care of 33 children who lost their parents. They give them a stable life and help with education. They also set up supply stations to give daily items and school supplies. They also started a "work-for-rebuilding" program. They hire people from the disaster area to help take care of the children, manage supply distribution, and do repair work. This helps them earn money and become independent.</p>
            <p>For rebuilding, the Mustard Seed Association will also help build 150 strong straw houses for a short time. They will also dig 13 drinking water wells in the community to make daily life better. At the same time, they supported 10 affected families in the Mandalay area to fix their houses. They also gave 150 desks and chairs to three primary schools to help children return to school.</p>
            <p>Li Chao-chia, the CEO of the Mustard Seed Association, said that in the disaster, they saw great sadness, but also a chance to rebuild. They will continue to stay with the people affected in Myanmar. They hope that hope can grow even in hard times. By giving care, education, and job chances, they wish to help those who receive help become independent and feel confident and hopeful for the future. (Editor: Wu Su-jou) 1140731</p>

            <h1>Macau Police Arrest Former Pro-Democracy Lawmaker Au Kam San, Suspected of Breaking National Security Law</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, July 31 (CNA) â€” The Judiciary Police of Macau yesterday arrested a 68-year-old man named Au. They said he was suspected of breaking the National Security Law. Reports say the arrested person is Au Kam San, a former pro-democracy lawmaker in Macau.</p>
            <p>This might be the first time someone in Macau has been arrested for possibly breaking the National Security Law.</p>
            <p>The Macau Judiciary Police announced today that the arrested man has been in contact with an "anti-China" group from outside Macau since 2022. He is suspected of giving many untrue and exciting pieces of information to this group. The group used this information for public displays outside Macau and online. After the new National Security Law started in 2023, he continued to let the group use this information to keep their activities and effects going.</p>
            <p>The police also said that the arrested man is suspected of having long-term contact with many "anti-China" groups outside Macau. He often gave false information about Macau to these groups or their media. This was for spreading their message. The goal was to make people in Macau and other countries who did not know the truth hate the central government of China and the Macau government. It also aimed to stop the 2024 Chief Executive election in Macau and make other countries act against Macau.</p>
            <p>According to "Hong Kong01," an online news source, the arrested man is Au Kam San, a former pro-democracy lawmaker in Macau.</p>
            <p>Macau's National Security Law started in 2009 and was changed in 2023. (Editor: Chen Kai-yu) 1140731</p>

            <h1>US Allows H20 Chips to China; Chinese Officials Question Nvidia About Chip Security</h1>
            <p>Beijing, July 31 (CNA) â€” US President Trump and his team have decided to let Nvidia's H20 chips be sold to China. But today, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) met with Nvidia. They asked Nvidia to explain safety risks, like problems and secret ways in the H20 chip, and to give related information. This makes the sale of H20 chips to China uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced that recently, Nvidia chips were found to have serious safety problems. Earlier, US lawmakers asked that advanced chips sent from the US should have a "tracking and locating" function. Experts in US artificial intelligence also said that Nvidia's powerful chips have mature technology for "tracking and locating" and "remote shutdown."</p>
            <p>The announcement said that to protect the internet and data safety of Chinese users, based on laws like the "Cybersecurity Law," "Data Security Law," and "Personal Information Protection Law," the CAC met with Nvidia on July 31. They asked Nvidia to explain the safety risks, like problems and secret ways in the H20 chips sold to China, and to provide related proof.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that two weeks ago, Nvidia said the company was asking the US government for permission again to sell its H20 graphics processing units (GPUs) to China. The US government had said that Nvidia would get the permission soon.</p>
            <p>Kevin Hassett, the US White House National Economic Advisor, also said on July 29 that President Trump and his team had decided to allow Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips to be sent to China. This was to stop China from getting ahead in the race to make the best chips. Now, Nvidia is facing questions from Chinese officials, which makes the sale of H20 chips to China uncertain.
