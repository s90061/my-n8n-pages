            <h1>Reuters Poll: Most Americans Believe Countries Should Recognize Palestine</h1>
            <p>More than half (58%) of Americans think that all countries in the United Nations should recognize Palestine as a country. This is according to a new poll by Reuters/Ipsos. 33% of people asked did not agree, and 9% did not answer.</p>
            <p>Reuters/Ipsos did an online poll for six days. They asked 4446 adults across the United States. The results could be wrong by about 2 percent more or less. This poll showed that Americans have different opinions about recognizing Palestine, based on their political party.</p>
            <p>78% of Democrats support recognizing Palestine. This is much higher than Republicans, who support former US President Trump (41% support). A little over half of Republicans (53%) do not agree that all UN countries should recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>About 65% of people asked said that the United States should do something in Gaza to help people who are very hungry. 28% of people did not agree with this, and 41% of those were Republicans.</p>
            <p>The poll also showed that 59% of Americans believe Israel's military actions in Gaza are too much. 33% of people asked did not agree with this view.</p>

            <h1>CNBC: Intel Talks with Big Investors About Getting More Money at a Lower Price</h1>
            <p>US business news channel CNBC says that Intel is talking with other big investors. Intel wants to get more money from them by selling shares at a lower price. This information comes from people who know about the talks.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. said it would invest 2 billion US dollars in Intel. There were also rumors that the US government might invest in Intel in different ways. After this, Intel's stock price went up for a short time. But today, its stock price fell by more than 7%.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, told CNBC that the US government must get a share of Intel's ownership if it gives money from the "CHIPS Act" to Intel.</p>
            <p>People who know about the situation say that Intel is now looking for other big investors, not just SoftBank, to get more money.</p>
            <p>Intel has had fewer sales and a smaller share of the market for many years. Now, the company is trying to change and become strong again.</p>
