            <h1>Trump: New Trade Deals Coming, Tariffs for Over 150 Countries</h1>
            <p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, is announcing new tax rates on goods from different countries. These new taxes, called tariffs, do not include Taiwan. Trump said today that "some good agreements will be announced." India might be one of these countries. He also said he will send letters directly to over 150 other countries. These countries have not talked with the United States about trade. They will all get the same new tariff rate.</p>
            <p>In April, Trump started a plan to put tariffs on many countries, with rates from 11% to 50%. Then, he gave them 90 days to talk with the US. Last week, he signed an order to make this waiting period longer, until August 1st. He has been sending letters to leaders of many countries to tell them about the new tax rates that will start on August 1st.</p>
            <p>So far, Trump has made deals with the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and Indonesia. He also has a trade plan with China. Politico, a news group, said yesterday that Taiwan, Switzerland, and India have not yet received a tariff letter from Trump. This means they might be close to making a deal, and an announcement could come in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p>Trump met with the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, at the White House today. He told reporters they would talk about many things, including trade.</p>
            <p>He also said that the US has made deals with some countries. He mentioned the deal with Indonesia that was announced yesterday. He added that another deal is coming soon, possibly with India.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "We will announce some good agreements."</p>
            <p>But he also repeated that "every tariff letter is an agreement." He said the best agreement is to just send a letter telling a country what tariffs they will pay. He mentioned rates like "30%, 35%, 25%, 20%," and Brazil even faces 50% tariffs.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that for the other more than 150 countries that are not talking with the US, America will just send them a tariff letter. He said these countries are smaller and "do not trade much with us." They will all have the same tariff rate.</p>
            <p>He explained that these countries are not big ones like China or Japan. The US is talking with China and Japan. But for Japan, he thinks the US might still use the tariff letter method.</p>
            <p>Trump has sent four sets of tariff letters so far. These went to 24 countries and the European Union, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Canada, and Brazil. Japan and South Korea both face 25% tariffs. Last week, Trump's letter to Indonesia said they would get 32% tariffs. But yesterday, he announced a deal with Indonesia. Now, goods from Indonesia to the US will have a 19% tariff.</p>
            <p>Regarding trade talks between Taiwan and the US, Yen Hui-hsin, a top negotiator from Taiwan's government office for trade talks, said on July 16th that Taiwan hopes to get a tariff rate that is not higher than its competitors like Japan and South Korea.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Is Not Replacing Central Bank Head Powell Now, But Does Not Rule It Out</h1>
            <p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, said today that he does not plan to replace Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank, called the Federal Reserve (Fed), right now. However, Trump also said that he does not rule out any possibilities.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that US news media said today that Trump has political support to fire Powell. He told a group of Republican lawmakers that he plans to replace Powell.</p>
            <p>A White House official told CNBC, a business news channel, that "They (Republican lawmakers) agreed with firing him (Powell). The President hinted he would do it soon."</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump if he would replace Powell, he answered, "He is doing a very bad job, but no, I'm not talking about that now." He also said, "I do not rule out anything, but I think it is very unlikely."</p>
            <p>Trump mentioned that he can, in any case, replace the head of the Federal Reserve when Powell's term ends next year.</p>

            <h1>US Media: Trump Told Lawmakers He Will Fire Federal Reserve Head Powell</h1>
            <p>CBS, a US news channel, reported that many people who knew directly said President Trump asked Republican members of Congress yesterday if he should fire Jerome Powell. Powell is the head of the US central bank, called the Federal Reserve. Several people who were there said Trump suggested he would do it.</p>
            <p>CBS reported that sources said Trump talked about this when he met with Republican members of the House of Representatives last night. The meeting was in the Oval Office at the White House.</p>
            <p>For the past few months, Trump has often said bad things about the Federal Reserve's money rules. He is angry that the Federal Reserve has not lowered interest rates.</p>
            <p>Officials at the Federal Reserve have not wanted to lower interest rates. They are waiting to see if Trump's taxes on goods from other countries will make prices go up again. This is called inflation.</p>
            <p>Trump has asked Powell to leave his job. However, the President does not have the power to fire the head of the Federal Reserve just because they disagree on money policies.</p>
