The Ministry of Education has approved a grant of NT$540 million for the new main library in Chiayi City. Chiayi Mayor Huang Min-hui stated that the future library complex will become a new landmark for culture and education in Chiayi. Legislator Wang Mei-hui also said that this project will provide citizens with a new place for knowledge.

Legislator Wang Mei-hui's office announced today that they worked with the government to get this funding. Before, it was hard to get money because the central government's budget was already used. But after knowing about Chiayi's need, they helped talk to the government to make it happen.

The Chiayi City Cultural Affairs Bureau said that the city government is actively working on the new library. They have already started looking for architects to design the best plan for the new library. Mayor Huang said the new library will not just hold books. It will be a smart library that uses technology and allows people to learn and share. The city hopes this new library will connect with another city renovation project to create a "knowledge economy living area."

Wang Mei-hui thanked the Chiayi City Government for their hard work on this plan. She said that working together, both the central and local governments, was key to making this project happen. She believes the main library is not just a place to read but also a symbol of Chiayi's progress in education. She will continue to support education and culture in Chiayi.

Guided by his mother's good example, he understands the importance of being grateful and helping others. He is also very interested in learning and sharing his native language and has won a national award for reading in the Puyuma language, showing his cultural pride.

Wang Chun received his award and scholarship from the New Taipei City Government on July 2nd. He wore a flower crown and traditional clothes. He spoke in Puyuma to thank his language teachers, school teachers, and family. He also received an award at the Presidential Office today.

The New Taipei City Department of Education said that Wang Chun has always done well in school. He especially loves learning his native language. He started learning languages in kindergarten and often takes part in cultural events. He also regularly donates his pocket money to sick children at Taitung St. Mary's Hospital and visits elderly people with his family.

The Department of Education also mentioned that Wang Chun won an award for reading in Puyuma and passed the basic test for indigenous languages. He wants to be a bridge for cultural heritage. He has also done well in English singing, sports, and storytelling, showing his cultural confidence. Wang Chun said he hopes to spread his native language and become an engineer who helps people by using the internet to promote Puyuma culture.

Principal Hsu Ching-lin said that Wang Chun is raised by his mother alone, and their family does not have a lot of money. Even though it's hard, he learned to be independent and take care of his family from a young age. He is happy to help others, and it's touching that he wants to promote his native language at such a young age. Wang Chun's mother said that her son is happy and likes to help those who need it. Even though they don't have many things, she hopes her children will spread love and kindness and choose to do good things.
