            <h1>Italy's Fashion King Armani Dies, Dedicated to Love and Beauty Until the End of His Life</h1>
            <p>Giorgio Armani, the famous Italian fashion designer known as "Italy's King of Fashion," passed away today at the age of 91. He spent his life working for love and beauty. His company said he continued to work on fashion, which he loved, until his last moments. He had recently announced he would buy the bar where he met his late partner, which was seen as a perfect example of Italian romance.</p>
            <p>The Armani group released a statement today, sadly announcing the death of its founder, Giorgio Armani. His funeral home in Milan will be open for family and friends to visit this weekend. The funeral will be a private event, as Armani wished.</p>
            <p>The statement said that Armani's family and his partner of nearly 20 years, Leo Dell'Orco, were with him when he died. Dell'Orco is Armani's head designer for men's fashion. Earlier this year, Armani did not attend Milan Fashion Week, which was unusual. Dell'Orco led the team instead. Many people believe Dell'Orco will be the one to lead the Armani group in the future.</p>
            <p>The news of Armani's sudden death shocked the Italian fashion world. Armani had just turned 91 on July 11 this year. Even though he was old, he was still very active at work. A few days ago, he announced that he bought a famous Italian restaurant and bar. He did this to remember the place where he met his late partner and business partner, Sergio Galeotti, in the 1960s. Armani also personally reviewed the collection for the 50th-anniversary show at Fashion Week.</p>
            <p>The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that Armani was in the hospital a few weeks before his birthday due to a lung infection. He then went home to rest. A few days ago, Armani had a bad stomach ache, but then he started eating normally again. He was still guiding his work by phone, so no one in the fashion world expected the sad news today.</p>
            <p>Armani was born in Piacenza, a city in northern Italy. He first studied medicine at university but stopped because he had to serve in the army. After leaving the army, he worked at the famous Italian department store "Rinascente." In 1965, a well-known Italian designer named Nino Cerruti saw Armani's talent and gave him a series of clothes to design.</p>
            <p>Armani then slowly became famous in the fashion world. In 1975, he started the Armani company with his partner at the time, Galeotti. From then on, his business grew more and more, and he became famous on international fashion runways. This earned Armani the title "King of Fashion."</p>
            <p>Sadly, Galeotti died early, just a few years after they started the company. He did not get to see the Armani empire that came later. Armani once said that when Galeotti died, he felt a part of himself also disappeared. At the end of August this year, just before his own death, Armani announced he would buy the restaurant and bar called La Capannina where they first met, as a way to remember their legendary love story.</p>

            <h1>Cathay Life Insurance Teams Up with Criminal Investigation Bureau to Build a National Anti-Fraud Network</h1>
            <p>Cathay Life Insurance announced today that it is working with the National Police Agency's Criminal Investigation Bureau. They are starting an anti-fraud safety network. This plan focuses on four main areas: "knowledge, technology, cooperation, and care." It aims to teach people of all ages how to protect themselves from fraud. In the past two years, they have stopped 176 fraud cases and saved people about 192 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life Insurance shared the results of its partnership with the Criminal Investigation Bureau in a press release today. In the last two years, they successfully stopped 176 fraud cases and protected 192 million New Taiwan Dollars of people's money. The amount of money they saved makes up 90% of all the money saved by the life insurance industry, making them number one among insurance companies.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life Insurance's own numbers show that most fraud cases (57%) are about fake investments. Fake relationships are second (23%), and fake police or prosecutors are third (5%). This means that fraud victims are not just children and older people, but people of all ages.</p>
            <p>Liu Shang-chi, the general manager of Cathay Life Insurance, said that Cathay Life and the Criminal Investigation Bureau have worked together for a long time. They have set up ways to share information and work together online. They also go into communities and schools to teach people of all ages about fraud prevention. They use four main ways to protect people: a "knowledge network," a "technology network," a "cooperation network," and a "care network," to build a "fraud prevention safety net."</p>
            <p>First, the knowledge network focuses on training employees. They learn about new fraud methods by sharing real-life cases where fraud was stopped and by taking regular online courses. This helps staff in all departments stay updated on fraud prevention knowledge and information. Second, the care network helps customers understand fraud better and lowers their risk of being tricked. They do this through regular visits, talking to customers at counters, and holding anti-fraud events.</p>
            <p>Third, the technology network uses data systems. It uses AI to calculate how likely a customer is to be scammed. This technology has successfully identified 80% of high-risk customers who were targeted by fraud. Lastly, the cooperation network brings together different resources to keep customers' money safe. Inside the company, they use the "Cathay Shieldâ€”Group Risk Collaboration Platform" to check customers' identities very carefully and improve how they watch for risks. Outside the company, they work with the 165 anti-fraud hotline to set up early warning systems for common types of fraud.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life Insurance also supports government policy by offering a "designated contact person service for insurance policies." This service allows customers to name a family member as a contact person when they buy a policy or change it. This third person can then step in quickly to stop fraud and lower the risk of being scammed.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Fubon Bank's Kuo Pei-ting: Central Bank's Control Over Property Loan Concentration is Stricter Than Banking Law</h1>
            <p>Kuo Pei-ting, the general manager of Taipei Fubon Bank, said today that the maximum limit in Article 72-2 of the Banking Act is 30%. Taipei Fubon Bank's own warning level is 28%, and they are still far from reaching 28%. He explained that the Central Bank's rules for how concentrated real estate loans can be are currently stricter than the Banking Act, and they also calculate it differently. Taipei Fubon Bank expects to lower its real estate loan concentration to 38% by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>To fight fraud better, Fubon Life Insurance and Taipei Fubon Bank today signed an agreement with the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office Taichung Branch and the Taichung City Government. This agreement focuses on sharing information to stop fraud and teaching people how to prevent it. Kuo Pei-ting and Fubon Life Insurance General Manager Chen Shih-yue both attended the signing ceremony in person.</p>
            <p>Article 72-2 of the Banking Act is often called the "strict rule for property loans." It says that the total amount of money commercial banks lend for building homes and businesses cannot be more than 30% of their total deposits and money from selling financial bonds at the time of the loan. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) issued a new rule today, saying that loans for the "New Youth An" housing program will not count towards this 30% limit. However, private banks are currently not offering loans for the "New Youth An" program.</p>
            <p>After the event, Kuo Pei-ting was asked about the rules. He said that the Banking Act's limit is 30%, and Taipei Fubon Bank's internal warning level is 28%. He added that they are currently still far from hitting the 28% mark. However, he noted that the Central Bank is now more strictly controlling banks' real estate loans.</p>
            <p>In mid-August last year, the Central Bank quietly asked banks to control the total amount of real estate loans they give out over the next year (from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year). This plan is currently in its second quarter and will continue until the fourth quarter of this year. After that, they will check the results.</p>
            <p>Kuo Pei-ting pointed out that the Central Bank calculates these numbers differently from the Banking Act. He said that at the end of last year, Taipei Fubon Bank's real estate loan concentration was higher. But it has gone down from 44% to 40% now. They are slowly improving it each quarter and plan to reach 38% by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>He further explained how Taipei Fubon Bank manages this. The total amount of loans (the "denominator") naturally grows with business. For the amount of new loans (the "numerator"), they make sure it stays within the amount of money customers pay back each quarter. This creates space for new loans. Currently, the interest rate for a regular home loan at Taipei Fubon Bank is about 2.5% to 2.6%, and people can still get these loans.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is more competition for participating whole life insurance policies in the market recently. Fubon Life Insurance started offering these policies again in 2023. Chen Shih-yue said that participating whole life policies are likely to become the main product in the market in the future. Currently, these policies make up more than 50% of Fubon Life Insurance's new policy income. Their goal for this year is also 50% to 60%.</p>
