            <h1>Berlin Police Arrest 3 Hamas Suspects, Find Weapons, Suspect Terrorist Attack Planning</h1>
            <p>On October 1st, the German federal prosecutor ordered the arrest of three people believed to be members of Hamas. The prosecutor said that since this summer, the suspects have been collecting guns and bullets for Hamas. They were planning to attack Jewish and Israeli places in Germany. During the police action, an AK-47 assault rifle, several pistols, and hundreds of bullets were found.</p>
            <p>The German federal prosecutor stated that the three arrested people are Abed Al G. (36 years old), Wael F. M. (43 years old), and Ahmad I. (44 years old). Two of them are German citizens, and one was born in Lebanon. According to the Berlin newspaper, the two German suspects have Syrian and Lebanese backgrounds.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor said that the three people are suspected of joining a foreign terrorist group. They worked as "overseas agents" for Hamas and were in direct contact with the military leaders of the group. They were planning violent actions that would harm Germany's national security.</p>
            <p>Investigators watched the suspects for a long time. On October 1st, they learned that the suspects were exchanging weapons in the Moabit area of Berlin. Berlin police quickly raided the location and arrested the three people on the spot. They found an AK-47 assault rifle, several Glock pistols, and a lot of ammunition.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor stressed that these weapons were meant for Hamas to carry out deadly attacks on Israeli or Jewish places in Germany. The suspects got the guns and bullets from the black market and tried to launch attacks inside Germany.</p>
            <p>This event has caused great concern in Germany. Stefanie Hubig, the Federal Minister of Justice, called it a "very serious event." She said that the country has a duty to protect Jewish life and will not accept antisemitism.</p>
            <p>Alexander Throm, a member of the CDU party, asked for strong actions. These include taking away German citizenship from people involved in terrorism and deporting them after they serve their prison time, especially those with dual citizenship. He believes that people who plan terrorist attacks should not be allowed to stay in Germany.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Jendro, a spokesperson for the Berlin Police Union, said that the weapons found show a worrying threat. He asked the government to quickly give new technology to security departments and provide clearer laws to deal with terrorist attacks more effectively.</p>
            <p>The three suspects will be taken to Karlsruhe on October 2nd. A pre-trial judge from the Federal Supreme Court will decide if they should be kept in custody.</p>
            <p>In December 2023, German prosecutors arrested four Lebanese men in Berlin. These men were following Hamas's orders to find hidden weapons in Europe. They were accused of planning attacks on Jewish places. This case changed how German security agencies saw Hamas. They now believe that Germany, which was once thought of only as a hiding place for Hamas's support, has become a target for Hamas's terrorist attacks.</p>

            <h1>Czech Republic Bans Unapproved Russian Diplomats and Official Passports to Stop Spies</h1>
            <p>Czech Foreign Minister Jan LipavskÃ½ announced that the Czech government has stopped Russian diplomats and people with official passports, who are not officially approved by the Czech state, from entering the Czech Republic. This is because Russian spies often use diplomatic status to hide their work. He said, "Schengen should help Europeans, not be used against Europe."</p>
            <p>On September 30th, LipavskÃ½ posted on X (formerly Twitter) that, based on his idea, the government has banned Russian diplomats and official passport holders who are not approved by the Czech state from entering the Czech Republic. This rule applies to international airports in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>LipavskÃ½ pointed out that "actions to cause trouble are increasing. We will not risk letting agents work under diplomatic cover. We are setting an example for other countries, and I will continue to push for the strictest rules at the Schengen level. We will protect the Czech Republic."</p>
            <p>Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, called this ban a "crazy measure." The Russian Foreign Ministry is looking into it and will give a more detailed answer later.</p>
            <p>According to LipavskÃ½, this ban will be enforced at the Czech Republic's external borders of the Schengen area, mainly at the six international airports in the country. This rule does not apply to diplomats approved to work in the Czech Republic, or to people who are just traveling through Czech territory to their assigned country, or to those attending meetings of international organizations.</p>
            <p>Last week, the EU's foreign affairs department suggested new rules for sanctions against Russia. These rules would require Russian diplomats working in the EU to report all their movements within the region. This idea supports LipavskÃ½'s argument for "limiting the free movement of Russian diplomats in the Schengen area," which he has been pushing for almost two years, but it has not yet received enough support.</p>
            <p>LipavskÃ½ told the Czech News Agency (ÄŒTK) that he is working to explain to the EU that diplomatic relationships need to be fair to both sides.</p>
            <p>LipavskÃ½ stressed that Russian spies often use diplomatic status as a cover. "So, I believe there is no reason for us to make it easy for them to travel in Europe. Schengen should help Europeans, not be used against Europe."</p>
            <p>The Czech visa centers in Russia stopped taking all applications on September 29th. Visa applications are now handled by the consular department of the Czech Embassy in Moscow. Since Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022, the Czech Republic has stopped giving tourist visas to Russian citizens.</p>
            <p>Two weeks ago, the Czech government also approved a rule that Georgian diplomats and official passport holders need to apply for a visa for short trips to the Czech Republic. This was done because the Georgian government is cracking down on civil society.</p>

            <h1>US Crude Oil Stock Increases, International Oil Prices Fall</h1>
            <p>New York, October 1st (CNA) â€“ Investors are thinking about the possibility that OPEC+ (a group of oil-producing countries) might increase oil production faster. Also, the amount of crude oil stored in the United States has gone up. Because of these reasons, international oil prices went down today.</p>
