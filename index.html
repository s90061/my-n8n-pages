            <h1>European Stock Markets Close Higher as US Interest Rates and Powell's Future Are Watched</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, London, July 17) European stock markets closed higher today. This happened as investors thought about what might happen with US interest rates and the future of Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed). US President Trump said he does not plan to remove Powell right now, but he did not say it would never happen.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 46.09 points, or 0.52%. It finished the day at 8972.64 points.</p>

            <h1>Bali District Office Says No Anti-Recall Fliers Were Inside Recall Notices</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, New Taipei, July 17) There were reports from Bali District in New Taipei City that "no recall" flyers were put inside official recall notices. Late tonight, the Bali District Office said that after checking, this was not true. They said it might have been a mistake because other groups were giving out flyers at a similar time. The office also stated that it remains fair and does not support any side.</p>
            <p>Tonight, New Taipei City Councilor Cheng Yu-en from the Democratic Progressive Party wrote on Facebook. She said people in Pitou Village, Bali District, told her they received recall notices. These notices supposedly had anti-recall flyers from Kuomintang legislator Hung Meng-kai inside them.</p>
            <p>Lin Chao-chieh, the head of Bali District, spoke to the Central News Agency by phone. He said he watched as the office put together the recall notices and voting slips. He confirmed that "there were definitely no anti-recall flyers put inside."</p>
            <p>Lin Chao-chieh also said that the head of Pitou Village picked up the notices at 2:30 PM today and started giving them out around 3 PM. He understood that volunteers for Hung Meng-kai gathered at a local temple around 4 PM to give out their flyers. This might have caused the misunderstanding.</p>
            <p>Hung Meng-kai said that giving out flyers to get people's support before an election, especially during important times, is normal for promoting against the recall. He added that volunteers delivered all the flyers in that area by walking door-to-door.</p>
            <p>The Bali District Office released a statement late at night. They explained that after checking with village chiefs, neighborhood leaders, and community heads, there were no flyers put inside. They also said that voting notices are being sent out in villages recently. If groups who support or oppose the recall give out their flyers at the same time as village leaders, both the voting notice and the flyers might appear in community mailboxes at the same time. They asked people not to spread incorrect stories about this.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Bali District Office stated that it will always remain fair and not support any side. They confirmed that no flyers were put inside or attached to the voting notices.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission said that the commission and all election staff in New Taipei City will always be fair in their work. They stated that if there is clear proof of any wrongdoing reported, they will investigate it thoroughly based on their duties.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine's Presidential Chief of Staff: Xi Jinping Should Meet with Zelenskyy</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Kyiv, July 17) Andriy Yermak, who is the chief of staff for Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, has asked China's President Xi Jinping to meet with Zelenskyy soon for the first time. Yermak said that China has an important chance to help bring peace.</p>
            <p>Yermak recently spoke to "The Times," a newspaper in the UK. He said, "It is very strange that Chinese President Xi Jinping has never met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I think now is the time." He asked China to help find a peaceful solution for the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Also, Yermak said that Ukraine has captured some Chinese prisoners of war and has their identity papers. He questioned China's claim that they know nothing about this. He said, "In China, it is very hard to become a mercenary without anyone knowing." He believes China keeps telling its soldiers to go to Russia to fight as mercenaries, which indirectly helps Russia's military actions.</p>
            <p>The report also said that since the war between Russia and Ukraine started, Europe has put many punishments on Russia. Because of this, Russia depends more and more on trading with China.</p>
            <p>Right now, 47% of Russia's oil and 44% of its coal go to China. Oil and gas make up about 60% of Russia's total exports and one-third of the country's total income. This shows how important the relationship between China and Russia is. After China, India is the next most important trading partner.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, after meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Beijing recently, Xi Jinping said that both sides will make their overall strategic partnership deeper. They will also support each other more on different international platforms.</p>
            <p>Regarding the "50-day ceasefire idea" that US President Trump recently suggested to Russia, Yermak said in the interview that secondary punishments would work. He meant that these punishments could really affect China and India.</p>
            <p>He said, "Only economic pressure can make Russian President Vladimir Putin agree to a compromise. It will make him think that this war is too expensive." Yermak expects to see results this year.</p>
            <p>Yermak also talked about the relationship between Ukraine and the US. He said the two countries "are speaking the same language." He trusts Trump's decisions and thinks he will not easily change the policy of punishing Russia. He pointed out that Trump knows Putin does not want a ceasefire. He also learned from the problems with Iran that "force can sometimes bring peace."</p>
            <p>Even though China's government has said many times that it is neutral in the war and has not given weapons to either side, Ukraine has often said that China secretly helps Russia. Recently, Ukraine held two Chinese citizens. They are thought to have collected secret information for Chinese intelligence about Ukraine's own "Neptune" cruise missile technology.</p>
            <p>In addition, Ukraine also stated that about 60% to 65% of the electronic parts used inside Russia's suicide drones come from China.</p>
