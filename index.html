The special team investigating the former South Korean government's rebellion case asked the court to arrest former President Yoon Suk-yeol. The court believes Yoon Suk-yeol might hide evidence and issued an arrest warrant early today. Yoon Suk-yeol will be arrested again after four months.

According to Yonhap News, the Seoul Central District Court held a hearing for about 6 hours and 40 minutes on the afternoon of July 9. Then, at 2:07 AM today, the court approved the arrest warrant requested by the special team for Yoon Suk-yeol. He is suspected of abusing power, obstructing public duties, forging official documents, and violating the Presidential Security Act.

Yoon Suk-yeol's side denies all accusations. However, the court's decision seems to be based on statements from related people and physical evidence presented by the special team. This includes claims that Yoon Suk-yeol might have told others to delete phone records. The report also says that Yoon Suk-yeol's lawyer is accused of trying to influence the investigation of people like Kim Sung-hoon, the former head of presidential security. This might have also affected the court's decision.

Yoon Suk-yeol suddenly declared martial law on December 3 last year. After it ended, he was impeached by the National Assembly and investigated for rebellion. He refused to cooperate with the investigation. He was arrested on January 15 this year and released on March 8, so he will be arrested again after about four months. Yoon Suk-yeol has often refused to help with investigations. After the special investigation team for rebellion was set up last month, they asked to arrest Yoon Suk-yeol. This request was denied, but they asked again, and this time it was approved. The investigation is expected to move faster now.

**Trump's Second Round of Tariffs: Philippines to Pay 20%, Brunei 25%, Taiwan Not Included**

US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on social media today. The Philippines will face a 20% tariff, Brunei and Moldova 25%, and Algeria, Iraq, and Libya 30%. These new tariffs will start on August 1. So far, new tariffs for 20 countries have been announced, but Taiwan is not one of them.

In early April, Trump started "reciprocal tariffs," placing duties of 11% to 50% on goods from many countries. This caused problems in global financial markets. He then announced a 90-day pause, during which only a 10% basic tariff would apply. Countries used this time to talk with the US, hoping for lower rates. The pause for reciprocal tariffs was supposed to end today. But on July 7, Trump signed an order to extend it until August 1. On the same day, he used his social media platform "Truth Social" to share the first letters about tariffs sent to leaders of 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea. Both Japan and South Korea will face new tariffs of 25%.

This morning, Trump continued to share new tariff letters on social media. He sent letters to the leaders of 6 countries: the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Iraq, and Libya. Goods from these countries sent to the US will face new tariffs between 20% and 30%. The Philippines' new tariff rate is 20%, which is higher than the 17% announced in early April. Brunei's new tariff will be 25%, also higher than the previous 24%. Algeria's new tariff rate is the same as before. Moldova, Iraq, and Libya's new rates are lower than their previously announced reciprocal tariff rates.

Almost all of Trump's letters use the same words. They tell the new tariff rates and warn that if countries act against these tariffs, the US will add even higher tariffs. But he also said that "these tariffs might go up or down depending on our relationship with your country." He also wrote in the letters that these tariffs will be "separate from all industry tariffs." If goods are sent through a third country to avoid higher tariffs, they will still be charged the higher rate. If companies choose to build factories or make products in the US, they will not pay this tariff.

Besides Japan and South Korea, Trump's first set of tariff letters included Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Laos, Myanmar, Tunisia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Serbia, Cambodia, and Thailand. These countries face rates between 25% and 40%, starting August 1. So far, Trump has sent tariff letters to 20 countries. Yesterday, he said he would announce more countries this afternoon. Regarding talks between Taiwan and the US, national security officials said earlier that the tariff talks are not stuck and are still ongoing. The US has announced a trade plan with China and trade agreements with the UK and Vietnam.
