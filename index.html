Under President Trump's firm control, Republican lawmakers in the US Congress voted for the "Big and Beautiful Bill." This new law will change how the government spends and collects money. Rich people and companies will pay less tax, and restaurant workers' tips will not be taxed. However, millions of people might lose their basic healthcare, and it will be harder for illegal immigrants to enter the US. These changes are expected to greatly affect how American society works.

President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson worked hard to get Republican members of Congress who were against more debt to agree. After a long 24-hour debate in the House, the bill passed with 218 votes for and 214 against. Only two Republican members voted no.

The new law follows Trump's election promises. It includes lower taxes for businesses and wealthy individuals, no taxes on tips and overtime pay, less money for healthcare programs for the poor (Medicaid), and less food help. It also cancels tax breaks for clean energy and increases spending for defense and border security. These changes are expected to have a big impact on how American society operates in the long run.

The tax cuts by Trump will mean the US government collects 4.5 trillion dollars less in taxes over the next 10 years. Medicaid spending could go down by almost 1 trillion dollars, but millions of low-income and jobless people might lose their healthcare if they don't meet new work hour rules. Also, the government can now borrow 5 trillion dollars more, so the Trump government won't face issues with the debt limit this year.

This bill's passage is seen as a big political win for Trump in his first year of his second term. It shows his strong control over the Republican party in Congress. The "Big and Beautiful Bill" aims to improve the US economy after trade disputes. If the economy doesn't get better as expected, it could hurt Trump's supporters and affect Republican chances in next year's elections.

**Taliban Government Officially Recognized by Russia for the First Time**

The Taliban government in Afghanistan announced today that Russia is the first country to officially recognize its rule. The Taliban called Russia's decision "brave."

This news came after Afghanistan's Foreign Minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, met with Russia's Ambassador to Afghanistan, Dmitry Zhirnov, in Kabul.

Muttaqi shared a video of the meeting on social media platform X, saying, "This brave decision will be an example for other countries... The process of recognition has begun, and Russia is ahead of everyone."

A spokesperson for the Taliban's Foreign Ministry, Zia Ahmad Takal, told a news agency that "Russia is the first country to officially recognize the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan," which is their formal name.

Russia's special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told a Russian news agency that the Russian government has "recognized" the Taliban government. The Russian Foreign Ministry also confirmed this news to another agency.

Many countries, including China and Pakistan, have allowed the Taliban to have ambassadors in their capitals. However, no country had officially recognized the Islamic Emirate until now.

**US House Passes "Big and Beautiful Bill," Trump to Sign It Tomorrow**

After some difficulties, the US House of Representatives today passed the Senate's version of President Donald Trump's large tax cut and spending bill. The vote was 218 for and 214 against. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Trump is expected to sign the bill into law tomorrow.

The "Washington Post" reported that Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" aims to continue his tax cuts from his first term. It also includes promises from his campaign last year, like making tips and overtime pay tax-free. The bill also spends hundreds of billions of dollars on immigration enforcement and defense. Furthermore, it increases the country's debt limit by 5 trillion dollars to avoid the risk of the Treasury Department not being able to pay its debts.

Leavitt told reporters that the bill signing ceremony is planned for tomorrow afternoon at 5 PM Eastern Time at the White House.

She also released a statement saying that this bill includes the biggest middle-class tax cut in US history, permanent border security, a lot of money for the military, and a return to "financial common sense." She believes this law will lead to "unprecedented economic success."

She added that Trump looks forward to signing the bill into law, officially starting an "American Golden Age."

For a bill to become law in the US, it must be passed with the exact same wording by both the House of Representatives and the Senate, and then signed by the President.

Even though Trump says this bill will give American people tax cuts, a secure border, and a stronger military, leading to huge economic growth, it was hard for Republican members of Congress to pass it. The Senate barely passed its version on July 1st, needing Vice President JD Vance's deciding vote. In the House, Republicans only have a small majority (220 seats to 212).

After the Senate version passed narrowly, some House Republicans did not want to accept it completely. News reports said that some moderate members from competitive areas were against the bill's big cuts to Medicaid (healthcare for the poor). Also, some conservative members were against the bill because they felt it strayed from financial goals.

US media reported that in today's House vote, all Democratic members voted against the bill. Two Republican members, Thomas Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick, also voted against it.

To delay the bill's vote, Democratic House leader Hakeem Jeffries spoke for 8 hours and 44 minutes, breaking the record for the longest speech in House history. In his speech, he criticized the bill's cuts to programs like Medicaid.

Former US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, also criticized the Republican budget bill on X. He called it "not only reckless, but also cruel." He said it greatly cuts Medicaid, which would cause millions of Americans to lose healthcare and rural hospitals to close, and would increase energy costs. He also said it would greatly increase the national debt.

The Associated Press previously reported that according to the US Congressional Budget Office, the Senate's changes to the "Big and Beautiful Bill" would increase the national debt by 3.3 trillion dollars and greatly reduce healthcare coverage.
