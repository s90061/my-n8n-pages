            <h1>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu to Run for Re-election, Will Face Kraft in November</h1>
            <p>Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who was often criticized by the Trump government, won today's primary election. This means she is one step closer to being re-elected. She is expected to be a strong candidate for the final election in November.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Wu is the first Asian-American and female mayor of Boston. She will face another candidate in November. One of these candidates is Josh Kraft, who is also a Democrat and leads a non-profit group. His father is Robert Kraft, who owns the New England Patriots, a professional American football team.</p>
            <p>Other people running are Robert Cappucci, a veteran and former school board member, and Domingos Darosa, a community activist.</p>
            <p>Wu's popularity grew partly because she often defended Boston against attacks from the Trump government. People from the Trump government, led by Tom Homan, who was in charge of border issues, often said that Boston was not doing enough to stop illegal immigrants. They also threatened to arrest more people. Boston is often called a sanctuary city. Wu has said many times that she wants Boston to be a friendly place for immigrants.</p>
            <p>Right now, Kraft is Wu's biggest challenge. Kraft is the most well-known of the three challengers. But so far, he has found it hard to create a campaign message that voters like and that would help him win. He spent a lot of money on advertisements all summer. He strongly criticized Wu on many issues, from the high cost of living in Boston to how she handles areas with serious drug problems.</p>
            <p>Wu also has strong support from the city council and most Democratic leaders in the state. She can also use her position as mayor to show her leadership. She continues to start new plans, especially for housing.</p>
            <p>When Wu went to vote today, she said that the Trump government targeted Boston because Boston "shows all the good things about our democracy." She said, "We prove that when people work together, anything is possible; we also prove why they are wrong."</p>
            <p>Wu often works with her young daughters. She also has a lot of support from the city council and many Democratic leaders. This summer, she also used her position as mayor to show her achievements in housing, fighting climate change, and reducing crime. She also started many related plans.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Kraft has found it hard to make his voice heard in debates. He often criticizes the Trump government's attacks along with Wu. Last month, during a campaign event with steelworkers from a union, Kraft said that Trump "actively attacks democratic systems and creates hate and division in states across the country."</p>
            <p>Kraft is in charge of the Kraft Family Philanthropies and the New England Patriots Foundation. But so far, he has not been able to create a strong message that voters like. He focuses on issues like bike lanes, the cost of living in Boston, and problems with homeless people and drug addiction in the "Methadone Mile" area (also called Mass and Cass).</p>
            <p>By the end of August, Kraft had spent 5.5 million US dollars on his campaign, which is much more than Wu's 1.1 million US dollars. This is mostly because he used more than 5 million US dollars of his own money for his campaign team.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Kraft attacks Wu, and sometimes he presents himself as someone who wants to bring positive change to Boston.</p>
            <p>Kraft told the Associated Press that when he talks to voters, he feels that Wu's control over the mayor's office might not be as strong as people think.</p>
            <p>He said, "Everywhere I go, myself, our team, across all neighborhoods in this city, no matter their race, economic status, group, or language, we hear the same thing: they feel they are not being listened to, and they don't feel connected to the mayor and the city team."</p>
            <p>He said, "Some polls show a big difference, but let me tell you: elections are not decided by polls, but by the people."</p>

            <h1>Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Starts Receiving Goods; Store Staff Happy to Return After Half a Year</h1>
            <p>Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store closed after a gas explosion on February 13. From today until September 25, the store will start receiving new goods to prepare for reopening. Store staff and suppliers said they are very happy to come back after being "without a home" for half a year and waiting patiently.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Urban Development Bureau stated that Shin Kong Mitsukoshi reported its plan yesterday. So, suppliers can start bringing in goods from 9 AM today, September 10, according to the rules. They expect to finish bringing goods to all floors by September 25. The Urban Development Bureau has approved this plan. During this time, they must follow the approved plan strictly to ensure public safety.</p>
            <p>On the first day of receiving goods, Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi arranged for suppliers on the 6th floor to bring their items. This included about 50 brands of children's clothes, baby products, and children's toys. Zeng Wen-cheng, the deputy director of the Urban Development Bureau, also came to check. He said he saw that the process was orderly and that the store followed its plan. Suppliers had ID cards, signed in and out, and the delivery truck paths were organized to keep things moving smoothly.</p>
            <p>Zeng Wen-cheng pointed out that Shin Kong will finish receiving goods by September 25. Considering the type of goods, today focused on dry goods. The restaurant area on the 12th floor will receive goods on the last day. The Urban Development Bureau will work hard to ensure the safety of the entire building.</p>
            <p>Shin Kong Mitsukoshi said that the Taichung Zhonggang store started receiving goods today. They are following the principle of "safe and orderly." They are checking everyone's identity and dividing the process by floor and area. They are also controlling the flow of people, goods, and vehicles to ensure public safety.</p>
            <p>A store staff member named Lin said she is back today to prepare for reopening and has been waiting a long time. She added that all staff members will return together.</p>
            <p>Another staff member named Hsu said she is very happy. She has been "without a home" for half a year and is very happy to be back now. She said her heart broke when she first heard about the closure, and she couldn't sleep at night, feeling like she had lost everything. She is very grateful to be able to return, and everyone stayed in their jobs and did not leave.</p>
            <p>A supplier named Li said that he has worked with Shin Kong for a long time. Everyone is looking forward to the reopening and has supported them strongly. He has great confidence in Shin Kong's public safety, and he believes the safety checks are of the highest standard.</p>

            <h1>Trump Again Says He Did Not Write Indecent Letter; White House Supports Handwriting Analysis</h1>
            <p>A Democratic member of the US House of Representatives shared a rude letter yesterday. They said President Trump wrote it to the rich person Jeffrey Epstein, who committed sex crimes. Today, Trump again said he did not write the letter. The White House also said it supports checking the handwriting to prove Trump is telling the truth.</p>
            <p>Reuters and AFP reported that Trump and the rich person Jeffrey Epstein knew each other for 15 years. Photos often showed them together in the past. But they had a fight in 2004 over a property deal. Epstein lost his good name because of charges of sex trafficking. He died in prison in 2019 while waiting for his trial.</p>
            <p>Recently, people have been talking about a letter that might be from Trump, sent in 2003 to wish Epstein a happy birthday. It reportedly had drawings of naked women. The Democratic representative posted pictures of the letter on social media yesterday. The White House quickly said Trump did not write it.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters today that the signature on the letter was not his, and the way it was written did not sound like him. He said, "People who have interviewed me for a long time know that is not how I talk. It's all nonsense."</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, told reporters that the White House will support checking the handwriting. This will show that what Trump says is true.</p>
            <p>She said, "The President did not write this letter, and he did not sign this letter."</p>
            <p>Leavitt also said that Trump did not sign a check to Epstein that was said to have his signature.</p>
            <p>She said, "The President's signature is one of the most famous in the world, and it has been for many years."</p>
            <p>James Comer, a Republican who leads the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, is in charge of the Congress's investigation into the Epstein case. He said he believes what Trump says.</p>
