            <h1>Some Parts of National Highways Were Crowded in the Morning, 12 Busy Sections Expected in the Afternoon</h1>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau announced that on the morning of September 28th, some parts of the national highways were very busy. The main crowded section was National Highway 1 Northbound, from Yuanshan to Xizhi. In the afternoon, they expect 12 sections to be crowded with many cars, including Xiluo-Puyan System northbound. Drivers should pay attention to these areas.</p>
            <p>Today is the second day of the Teachers' Day holiday. The Freeway Bureau said in a press release that by 11 AM, the total traffic on all national highways was 31.2 million vehicle-kilometers. They expect the total traffic for today to be 113 million vehicle-kilometers.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau explained that in the morning, the main crowded sections were National Highway 1 Northbound from Yuanshan to Xizhi, and National Highway 1 Southbound from Hukou Service Area to Hsinchu. Other road sections had normal traffic.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau believes that there will be a lot of travel traffic during peak hours today. They predict that the main crowded sections in the afternoon will be National Highway 1 Northbound (Xiluo-Puyan System, Nantun-Houli, Miaoli-Hukou), National Highway 3 Northbound (Zhushan-Zhongxing, Caotun-Wufeng, Dashan-Xiangshan, Guansi-Daxi), National Highway 5 Southbound (Nangang System-Toucheng), National Highway 5 Northbound (Yilan-Pinglin), National Highway 4 Westbound (Tanzi System-Fengshi), National Highway 6 Westbound (Jiuzheng-Wufeng System), and National Highway 10 Westbound (Renwu-Zuoying End).</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau suggests that drivers going southbound on National Highway 5 should leave after 5 PM to avoid traffic jams. They also advise drivers to use the 1968 website and app for real-time traffic information and listen to the Police Broadcasting Service while driving.</p>

            <h1>US H-1B Visa Fees Will Increase a Lot, Foreign Engineers Rush Back to US and Find Ticket Booking Systems Blocked</h1>
            <p>The US Trump government will greatly increase the fees for H-1B visas. This has caused strange online pranks. Some people on the right-wing website 4chan asked others to block airline booking systems. This created a fake situation where tickets were hard to find and prices went up, causing panic.</p>
            <p>The application fee for a US H-1B visa will go up from a maximum of US$4,500 to US$100,000.</p>
            <p>Amrutha Tamanam, a software engineer living in Austin, Texas, was on holiday in India recently. Because of the Trump government's new visa policy, she had to rush back to the United States. But she found that users on the 4chan website were attacking flight booking systems to stop Indian H-1B visa holders from booking tickets.</p>
            <p>This prank was called "clog the toilet." In the end, Tamanam bought a ticket to return to the US for twice the usual price.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that these 4chan discussions also spread on social media like Telegram and other less known forums. Many far-right supporters of Trump joined in.</p>
            <p>Some posts said: "Indians just heard about the new H-1B visa news. Want to keep them stuck in India? Just clog the booking system!"</p>
            <p>Later posts had many racist words. They even taught users how to go to major airlines and booking websites. They told them to reserve seats on flights from India to the US but not pay. This was to create a fake situation where no tickets were available and to make prices higher.</p>
            <p>It is hard to measure the real effect of this prank. However, Heidi Beirich, who started the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said that the clear goal was to "cause panic among H-1B visa holders."</p>
            <p>Beirich stressed that the scary thing about 4chan is how quickly users can be brainwashed by extreme ideas and go down the wrong path. Several people who committed mass shootings in the US had posted their plans there.</p>
            <p>The US H-1B visa allows companies to hire skilled foreign workers, such as scientists and computer programmers. It is first valid for three years and can be extended to six years. Only about 85,000 are given out each year, and about three-quarters of the applicants are from India.</p>
            <p>Brian Levin, who started the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, pointed out that in the age of information warfare, this prank shows how bad people can attack systems with just "a few lines on a keyboard."</p>
            <p>Levin said: "As nationalism spreads around the world, some international, loosely connected opposing groups will use all kinds of extreme tools, including cyberattacks."</p>
            <p>He added: "It is important to note that this hatred spreads quickly, and the people involved come from many different countries. They can easily cross borders and organize quickly through the internet."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Choreographer Liu Yi-Ling's Dance Piece Performed at New York City Center's Fall for Dance Festival</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese choreographer Liu Yi-Ling's dance piece, "And or...", was performed on September 26th and 27th at the New York City Center's Fall for Dance Festival. Her work was shown alongside famous groups like the Stuttgart Ballet from Germany and the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater from the US. Her dance successfully kept the audience's full attention using only body movements, without music.</p>
            <p>Dancers Lin Chun-Yi and Hung Wei-Ting were on stage at the New York City Center's Fall for Dance Festival. There was no music, only the sound of their fast steps and bodies hitting each other. At first, the audience did not understand the dance. But then, they watched closely as the dancers moved in ways very different from traditional ballet. Sometimes, people in the audience laughed when they understood something. "And or..." received loud applause.</p>
            <p>After the show, choreographer Liu Yi-Ling said she was very excited that her work was performed in a large theater for the first time. She was happy that both shows went well and were performed excellently. Her work tried to see if she could attract the audience with only body movements, without music. This tested the audience's attention and was a challenge for herself.</p>
            <p>She said she was very happy that the audience was very involved. Even sitting in the audience, she could feel everyone's engagement. The dancers clearly reacted to every small thing. She held her breath the whole time and could only relax and breathe out when the show ended.</p>
            <p> "And or..." was performed between two shows: one by the Stuttgart Ballet from Germany and one by the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater from New York, USA. It was a mix of modern ballet and lively movements from different cultures. It combined theater, martial arts, and body stretching and twisting. This simple Taiwanese dance stood out in the large theater with over 2,000 seats.</p>
            <p>"And or..." was also shown at the "East Asian Contemporary Dance Festival" in New York at the end of last year. New York audiences had another chance to see the performance, which had some changes in choreography and costumes.</p>
            <p>This dance only has two dancers. They rely on their unspoken understanding, breathing, steps, and touching each other. This also kept the audience focused and deeply moved. Dancer Lin Chun-Yi said it's hard to say if their relationship is love or hate; it includes many different feelings and very complex emotions.</p>
            <p>The New York City Center has held the Fall for Dance Festival since 2004. It shows dances from all over the world at low ticket prices, so tickets are very popular. This year's festival ran from September 16th to 27th. Dance groups from Taiwan, the US, Canada, France, the Netherlands, Argentina, Germany, and other countries took part. The styles included modern dance, tap dance, ballet, tango, and hip-hop.</p>
