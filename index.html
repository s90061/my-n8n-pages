            <h1>Green Party Group Suggests Releasing Harmful News? Chung Chia-pin: Stop Political Fighting</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 24 (CNA) The overflowing of Matatun Creek's dammed lake caused serious damage. Today, some media and a former lawmaker shared messages from a DPP lawmaker group. These messages suggested that the Executive Yuan and the DPP headquarters should release clear but damaging information. This information would help their allies, DPP lawmakers, and government officials fight back. They gave an example of a social media page that attacked Hualien County Mayor Hsu Chen-wei. The DPP legislative group said that disaster relief is most important, and political arguments should stop. The group was discussing real situations on the front line of the disaster. The media reports completely twisted what they meant.</p>
            <p>Media reports said that DPP lawmaker Wang Ting-yu spoke in the lawmaker group. He tagged Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chang Tun-han, Deputy Secretary-General Ruan Chao-hsiung, and DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung. He suggested using media and other groups to release clear but damaging information. This would help their friends, DPP lawmakers, and government workers to fight back. He also showed a picture from a specific fan page that attacked Hualien County Mayor Hsu Chen-wei as an example.</p>
            <p>In response, Chung Chia-pin, the head of the DPP legislative group, said tonight that the DPP group has three rules for disaster relief: "central government helps, local areas help each other, and the party supports." He said that disaster relief is the most important thing, and political arguments should stop. Rebuilding homes is the most urgent task. Right now, the most important thing is to give the disaster area the most help possible. This includes supplies and media support. It is not good for disaster victims to hear a lot of public arguments. He wished Hualien well.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu, the secretary of the DPP legislative group, said in an interview that if you look at the screenshot and compare it to the news report, everyone was talking about the real situation of the disaster relief. They wanted to know more facts because many rumors started spreading last night. For example, they discussed if the Ministry of Agriculture made mistakes. They also talked about whether there were problems with people leaving the area.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu believes that the media reports cut off parts and used bad headlines. This changed the original meaning of their discussion. She said that the DPP group was not trying to attack the Hualien County Government. Instead, they were talking based on facts. Also, about the screenshot of the group chat getting out, Chen Pei-yu stressed that the party group might have some problems to discuss internally. But she said this is not important right now because saving people and helping with the disaster come first. She added that they should not keep making political arguments.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Internet Celebrity's Social Media Accounts Banned After Promising Donations for Attack on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 24 (CNA) Zhang Xuefeng, a famous Chinese tutor for entrance exams, who often makes unusual comments, had his social media accounts banned today. Weibo showed that this was because he broke laws and rules. On the day of the Chinese Communist Party's "September 3rd military parade," Zhang Xuefeng said that if Taiwan were attacked, he would personally donate at least 50 million RMB (about 125 million NTD).</p>
            <p>According to reports from mainland Chinese media, on the afternoon of September 24, Zhang Xuefeng's accounts on Douyin, Kuaishou, Weibo, Bilibili, and Xiaohongshu were all blocked from getting new followers at the same time. These accounts together had over 50 million followers. Weibo stated: "This user is banned from being followed because they violated laws and regulations or the 'Weibo Community Convention'."</p>
            <p>However, Zhang Xuefeng's related accounts were not affected. His smaller live-streaming accounts, like Douyin's "Zhang Xuefeng Talks About College Planning" and accounts under his company "Fengxue Weilai," are still working normally. Some of these accounts were even live-streaming today. This shows that the ban on followers is a personal issue, not a business one.</p>
            <p>The reason why Zhang Xuefeng's personal accounts were banned at the same time has caused a lot of discussion on Chinese social media. According to news reports, Zhang Xuefeng only told a reporter that "the ban on followers is an account problem" before hanging up the phone.</p>
            <p>Public information shows that Zhang Xuefeng graduated from Zhengzhou University. In June 2016, he became famous online for his "Seven-Minute Analysis of 34 Project 985 Universities." In 2021, he started "Fengxue Weilai." This company now has several businesses, including college planning guidance, skill development, book writing and planning, internships and jobs, study tours, and live-stream shopping.</p>
            <p>As a famous internet tutor, Zhang Xuefeng's words and actions have caused arguments many times and have been trending topics online.</p>
            <p>On the day of the Chinese Communist Party's "September 3rd military parade," Zhang Xuefeng gathered hundreds of employees from his education company to watch the live broadcast. He then said that China has these weapons not to scare others, but to unify the country.</p>
            <p>Zhang Xuefeng also excitedly said that when the time comes for the country to unite, and the gunshots begin, he would donate at least 50 million. He said his company would always have this money, and they would donate at least 100 million in total.</p>
            <p>The video of Zhang Xuefeng saying he would donate 100 million if Taiwan were attacked spread quickly in China. It also caused concern and anger in Taiwan. He later admitted in a live stream that relevant authorities had told him to be careful about the impact of his comments.</p>
