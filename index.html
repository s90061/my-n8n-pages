            <h1>US Job Numbers Are Weak; US Stock Market Falls, Dow Drops 600 Points</h1>
            <p>The United States released weak job numbers today. This made investors worry more about the US economy. They were already worried because Washington added new taxes on goods from other countries. Because of this, the three main US stock markets dropped at least 1.5% this morning. The Dow Jones Index fell by over 600 points.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the US Department of Labor said today that only 73,000 new jobs were created in July. Also, the number of new jobs for May and June was much lower than previously reported. After this news, the earnings from US government bonds decreased quickly. People buying and selling futures also expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower interest rates in September.</p>
            <p>About 25 minutes after the US stock market opened today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.5% at 43477.54 points. The S&P 500 Index fell 1.7% to 6231.49 points. The Nasdaq Index dropped even more, by 2.3% to 20644.16 points.</p>
            <p>Looking at single companies, Amazon, a large US technology company, gave a money prediction that caused concern. People worried that its big spending on artificial intelligence (AI) would harm its profits. So, its stock price dropped 7.0% in early trading today.</p>

            <h1>Slovenia Is First in EU to Stop All Weapon Sales to Israel</h1>
            <p>The government of Slovenia has said that it will stop all weapon trading with Israel. This decision is because of the war happening in the Gaza Strip. Slovenia says it is the first country in the European Union (EU) to do this.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Slovenian government made a statement late yesterday. It said, "Slovenia is the first European country to stop buying, selling, and moving weapons to Israel."</p>
            <p>The statement also explained that Slovenia acted by itself. This is because the EU "could not take clear actions due to disagreements and not being united."</p>
            <p>The Slovenian government's statement also spoke about the very bad war in Gaza. It said that "people are dying because they are always stopped from getting help." It added that "it is what every responsible country must do to act, even if it means doing it before other countries."</p>

            <h1>Huang Wei-sheng Gets 4 Hits as Brothers Beat Monkeys; Thanks Coach for Watching Him</h1>
            <p>Huang Wei-sheng from the CTBC Brothers baseball team hit four singles today. Chiang Kun-yu also got three hits and brought in four runs. In the end, the Brothers won against the Rakuten Monkeys with a score of 7 to 5. After the game, Huang Wei-sheng said he was very thankful to his head coach, Hirokazu Hirano. He said the coach is like a security camera, always watching him.</p>
            <p>The game today was at the Taipei Dome. The Monkeys started well in the first part of the game. Chen Chen-wei, Lin Zi-wei, Lin Li, and Lin Hung-yu all hit the ball well, scoring 3 points. But the Brothers scored 1 point in the second and third parts of the game. In the fifth part, Tseng Sung-en, Huang Wei-sheng, and Chiang Kun-yu hit the ball, getting 2 points and taking the lead 4 to 3.</p>
            <p>The Brothers scored more points in the seventh part of the game. Tseng Sung-en and Huang Wei-sheng hit the ball. Then Wang Wei-chen hit the ball high, and the left fielder Chen Chen-wei made a mistake, which led to 1 point. After that, Chiang Kun-yu hit the ball again, getting 2 more points. The Monkeys scored 2 points in the ninth part, but the Brothers still won 7 to 5.</p>
            <p>Huang Wei-sheng hit four singles in this game and was chosen as the best player. When asked about his hitting this year, Huang Wei-sheng said that last year, during training before the season, he hit more long balls. But this year, his timing was not good when the season started. He said, "The hitting coaches help me look at how I hit the ball. I also go to the field early every day to practice hitting. Because I don't start every game, I want to be ready to play quickly when I get on the field."</p>
            <p>The Brothers' head coach, Hirokazu Hirano, often helps Huang Wei-sheng with his hitting during practice. Huang Wei-sheng said, "I am very happy to have a coach in professional baseball who pays so much attention to me. He is like a security camera, always watching me. He also tells me to get back up if I fall down. He expects a lot from me, and I want to do well for him. I hope I can try hard and show him what I can do."</p>
            <p>The Brothers' starting pitcher, Brandon Leibrandt, threw 95 balls in this game. He pitched for seven parts of the game. He let the other team hit 8 times and did not walk anyone. He got 2 outs by striking out players. He only let the other team score 3 points, which was a very good start. He got his second win this season.</p>
            <p>Also, today at Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium, the game between the Wei Chuan Dragons and the TSG Hawks ended with no score (0-0) after six parts because of heavy rain. The game between the Uni-President Lions and the Fubon Guardians, which was planned for Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium, was delayed because of rain.</p>
