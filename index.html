            <h1>Bangkok Building Fell Down in Earthquake; 23 People, Including a Rich Builder, Are Charged</h1>
            <p>A tall building in Bangkok, Thailand, fell down during a big earthquake in Myanmar in March. Today, Thai prosecutors have charged 23 people linked to this event. One of them is a very rich man in the building business, Premchai Karnasuta.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the 30-story building fell down just seconds after the 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit Myanmar on March 28. This earthquake killed thousands of people.</p>
            <p>The building was supposed to be the new office for Thailand's Audit Office. It was the only building in Bangkok that fell down during that earthquake. A total of 89 people died there, mostly construction workers.</p>
            <p>Because the building fell so suddenly, a legal investigation started. The Thai Attorney General's Office said that the case has been sent to the criminal court. A decision is expected in a few months.</p>
            <p>The Attorney General's Office said in a statement: "Investigators agree to charge 23 people and companies for doing their job wrongly and for faking documents."</p>
            <p>The charges list 16 people and 7 companies. It also names people who represent some of the companies being charged, including a building company and a Chinese construction company.</p>
            <p>Investigators from the Ministry of Justice had said before that they were checking the quality of the building materials used at the construction site.</p>
            <p>Premchai Karnasuta, who is a very important person in Thailand's building industry and the president of Italian-Thai Development Plc, has also been charged. If he is found guilty, 71-year-old Premchai could go to prison for up to 10 years and pay a fine of 200,000 Thai Baht (about 6,000 US dollars).</p>
            <p>Italian-Thai Development Plc is one of the biggest construction companies in Thailand. It is also part of the charges brought by the prosecutors.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu: Israel Plans to Fully Control Gaza with Its Military</h1>
            <p>Even though people inside and outside the country are criticizing the destructive war in Gaza more and more, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that Israel plans to have full military control over all of Gaza. The war has been going on for almost two years.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Netanyahu was asked by Fox News if Israel would take over Gaza. He said, "We plan to do this. We don't want to keep it. We want to have safe borders. We don't want to rule there. We don't want to be the government there."</p>
            <p>He said that Israel wants to give control of the area to Arab armies.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said these things to Fox News today before meeting with a small group of important ministers. In the meeting, they talked about the military's plan to control more of Gaza.</p>
            <p>Surveys show that most Israelis want the war in Gaza to end with an agreement. They want the people who are being held by Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, to be set free.</p>
