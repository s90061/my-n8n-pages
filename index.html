A significant shift is happening in the world of personal computers. Microsoft recently announced a new category of laptops called "Copilot+ PCs," designed to make artificial intelligence a central part of how we use computers. These new devices will feature special chips dedicated to handling AI tasks, which will make them much faster and more efficient when running AI programs. This development is expected to change how people work and create.

These new PCs are designed to offer powerful performance and longer battery life, even when performing complex AI operations. They will come with new features that use AI, such as "Recall," which helps users find things they've seen on their computer by remembering everything; "Cocreator," which allows users to create images from text descriptions or even modify existing images with AI; and "Live Captions," which can instantly translate audio from over 40 languages into English. Major computer manufacturers like Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Samsung will release these new models. Experts believe these AI-focused computers could soon become a standard for many users, offering a new level of assistance for daily tasks and creative projects.

**Venice Introduces Fee to Control Tourist Numbers**

The historic Italian city of Venice has started charging a fee for day-trippers as part of its efforts to manage the large number of tourists visiting each year. This new system, which began in late April, requires visitors who do not stay overnight in the city to pay a â‚¬5 entrance fee. The trial period will last for several specific days, mostly on weekends, until mid-July. This move is designed to reduce the problem of "over-tourism," where too many visitors can negatively affect the daily lives of local residents and damage the city's delicate infrastructure.

Venice is famous for its canals and unique architecture, but it faces increasing challenges from mass tourism. The new fee applies to anyone over the age of 14 entering the city during the busiest hours. However, those who are staying in hotels or guesthouses in Venice, as well as commuters and residents, are exempt from paying. Visitors must book their visit online in advance and receive a QR code, which can be checked by officials. Those who fail to pay or show proof of exemption could face fines of up to â‚¬300. City officials hope this measure will help find a better balance between protecting Venice's heritage and allowing people to experience its beauty.

**Europe's Offshore Wind Power is Growing Rapidly**

Europe is seeing a rapid increase in its capacity for offshore wind power, a key step towards achieving its climate goals and becoming more energy independent. Recent reports show that new offshore wind farms are being built at a faster pace, with significant investments being made across the continent. This growth is important because offshore wind farms use the strong and consistent winds found at sea to produce clean electricity, helping to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.

This expansion is not only good for the environment but also for the economy. It is creating many new jobs in manufacturing, construction, and maintenance. However, the industry still faces some challenges. These include getting permits approved quickly, ensuring there are enough materials and workers in the supply chain, and connecting new wind farms to national electricity grids. Despite these obstacles, European countries have set ambitious targets for offshore wind capacity by 2030, showing a strong commitment to this renewable energy source. Experts believe that with continued investment and policy support, offshore wind will play a major role in Europe's future energy mix.`;
