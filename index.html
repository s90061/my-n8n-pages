            <h1>Israel Attacks from Air, Yemen Rebels Say Their Leader Died</h1>
            <p>Yemen's Houthi group said today that recent air attacks by Israel on Sanaa, the capital city of Yemen, killed some important government officials. These officials were from the government that the Houthi group controls. Among those who died were Prime Minister Rahawi and some ministers.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Houthi group said in a statement that Rahawi (Ahmed al-Rahawi) and several ministers died in the air attack on Sanaa on August 28.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said on August 28 that its forces "hit military targets of the Houthi group in the Sanaa area of Yemen very accurately."</p>
            <p>Rahawi had been the Prime Minister of the Houthi-led government since August 2024.</p>
            <p>The Houthi group has often fired missiles at Israel while Israel is fighting against Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, in the Gaza Strip. The Houthi group says these attacks are to support the Palestinian people.</p>

            <h1>Japan Will Put Long-Range Missiles in Kyushu, Can Reach China's Coast and Taiwan's Sea</h1>
            <p>To deal with China's growing actions in the sea, Japan is quickly making its southwestern islands stronger in defense. This year, Japan has decided to put better long-range "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" at the Ken-gun army base in Kumamoto City, Kyushu. These missiles can reach China's coast and the waters around Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Japan's Ministry of Defense chose to place these improved "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" at the Ken-gun army base in Kumamoto City this year. This is to make the defense of the southwestern islands stronger.</p>
            <p>The government is also thinking about putting them at the Yufuin base in Yufu City, Oita Prefecture, and the Katsuren base in Uruma City, Okinawa Prefecture, in the next few years.</p>
            <p>Currently, the land-to-ship missiles used by Japan's army can only go a few hundred kilometers. The new, improved missiles will go over 1,000 kilometers. If they are placed in Kyushu, they can cover the sea around Taiwan and the coastal areas of China.</p>
            <p>The report said that an official from the Ministry of Defense explained, "This will make our ability to stop attacks much stronger."</p>
            <p>Some people believe China might be ready to attack Taiwan as early as 2027. Japan's Ministry of Defense is very worried about a problem with Taiwan. So, they decided to deploy the improved "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" this year, earlier than their first plan for 2026 or later. They are also thinking about putting them in all seven land-to-ship missile groups across the country later.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Kazumi Ito, who is in charge of defense in Kyushu for the Ministry of Defense, visited Takashi Kimura, the governor of Kumamoto Prefecture, at the government office. Ito explained about putting the improved "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Guided Missiles" at the Ken-gun base in Kumamoto City.</p>
            <p>Governor Kimura said, "Defense of the country is the central government's job. This decision to put missiles there was made after many years of talking about it." Kimura said he understands, but also mentioned that some people in the area are worried. He asked the Ministry of Defense to talk to the people and do things like training to keep everyone safe.</p>
            <p>Governor Denny Tamaki of Okinawa is against this plan. In March this year, when Tamaki met with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi in Okinawa, he said, "If these improved missiles are placed here, there is a higher chance of being attacked. The people of Okinawa Prefecture do not agree with this."</p>

            <h1>US Senators Visit Taiwan, Foreign Minister Says Taiwan-US Friendship is Strong and Protects Democracy</h1>
            <p>The visit of US senators from the Armed Services Committee to Taiwan ended today. The group was led by Chairman Roger Wicker. Taiwan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Joseph Wu, said the visit sent a strong message that the friendship between Taiwan and the US is "very strong." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will keep working with the US Congress and government to protect democracy and help everyone do well.</p>
            <p>US Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29. They left by plane today at 3:40 PM. This was the first time Wicker led a group to Taiwan as the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was also the first time a chairman from this committee visited Taiwan in nine years.</p>
            <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu wrote on Facebook tonight that Wicker's visit was very important. It showed a strong message that the friendship between Taiwan and the US is "very strong." He said that the "Taiwan Relations Act" passed by the US Congress in 1979 and the "Six Assurances" from former US President Ronald Reagan in 1982 have always been key parts of the Taiwan-US relationship. These promises continue to help Taiwan make its defense stronger.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu also said that peace in the Taiwan Strait and the safety and wealth of countries in the Indo-Pacific area are now facing problems and dangers from powerful governments that want to control more. He stressed that peace can only be kept if Taiwan shows it is determined to defend itself and works with other countries that think similarly.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu shared that under President Lai's leadership, Taiwan is slowly putting more money into its defense. In 2026, this money will be 3.32% of Taiwan's total economic output (GDP). The goal is to reach 5% by 2030. Also, Taiwan hopes to work more closely with the US to improve its special ways of fighting.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu pointed out that Wicker's group also visited Palau, a country that is Taiwan's friend, and the Philippines, with whom Taiwan is working more closely. Taiwan also wants to build a good partnership with the US through new chances to work together on technology and energy. Taiwan hopes to expand this cooperation to other countries, like those in the first island chain, using a "Taiwan-US joint fleet" idea. This is to help countries that share similar ideas work well and benefit each other.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said again that Taiwan and the US are not just partners in strategy, but they are also a group of countries that believe in democracy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will keep working directly with the US Congress and government to make the Taiwan-US relationship deeper. They will protect democracy together and help everyone become wealthier, making peace in the region even stronger.</p>
