The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly boost the adoption of co-packaged optics (CPO), which will benefit many chip and component suppliers, including Broadcom and Nvidia. This information comes from a J.P. Morgan report.

According to J.P. Morgan's analyst, Samik Chatterjee, while challenges like managing heat and easy repair still exist, progress in these areas and the pressure on current technologies have started to make people more positive about CPO.

**Taiwan Adds Chinaâ€™s Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List**

Taiwanâ€™s Commerce Ministry has added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list. This decision is part of ongoing trade and technology tensions with China.

The move means that certain advanced technologies and products can no longer be sold to these Chinese companies without special permission from the Taiwanese government. This action by Taiwan aligns with similar measures taken by the United States, which has also imposed restrictions on Huawei and SMIC to limit Chinaâ€™s access to critical technologies, especially those related to advanced semiconductors.

This new control measure is expected to impact the global technology supply chain, as Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors. The decision reflects Taiwan's efforts to protect its technological advantages and align with international partners on strategic trade policies.
