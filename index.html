            <h1>Reuters Poll: Most Americans Think Countries Should Recognize Palestine</h1>
            <p>According to the newest poll from Reuters/Ipsos, more than half of Americans (58%) think that countries in the United Nations should recognize the State of Palestine. 33% of people asked did not agree, and 9% did not answer.</p>
            <p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll was done online for six days. It gathered answers from 4446 adults across the United States. The results can be off by about 2 percentage points.

            <p>78% of Democrats support recognizing Palestine. This is much higher than Republicans, where only 41% support it. More than half of Republicans (53%) do not agree that all UN countries should recognize the State of Palestine.</p>
            <p>About 65% of the people asked said that the United States should do something in Gaza to help people who are facing starvation. 28% of people did not agree, and 41% of them were Republicans.</p>
            <p>This poll also showed that 59% of Americans believe Israel's military actions in Gaza are too much. 33% of people asked did not agree with this.</p>

            <h1>CNBC: Intel Is Talking to Large Investors About More Shares at a Lower Price</h1>
            <p>US business news channel CNBC reported that people who know the situation said Intel is talking to other big investors. They are discussing the possibility of these investors buying more shares in Intel at a lower price.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. announced it would invest 2 billion US dollars in Intel. Also, there were rumors that the US government was thinking about investing in Intel in different ways. After these announcements, Intel's stock price went up for a short time, but today it fell by more than 7%.</p>
            <p>Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, said yesterday in an interview with CNBC that the US government must get shares in Intel in exchange for providing money from the "CHIPS Act."</p>
            <p>People who know the situation said that Intel is now looking for other large investors besides SoftBank to get more money.</p>
            <p>Intel is trying to change and become strong again after many years of lower sales and losing market share.</p>
