**Trump Announces New Tariffs: Philippines at 20%, Brunei at 25%**

Following his announcement of new tariffs for 14 countries, US President Donald Trump has now revealed another set of tariff rates on social media. Starting August 1st, the Philippines will face a 20% tariff. Brunei and Moldova will both have a 25% tariff, while Algeria, Iraq, and Libya will see a 30% tariff on their goods.

In early April, Trump introduced "reciprocal tariffs" ranging from 11% to 50% on various countries, which caused financial markets worldwide to become unstable. He then announced a 90-day pause, during which only a 10% basic tariff was applied. This gave countries time to talk with the US and try to get lower rates. The pause was supposed to end today, but Trump signed an order to extend it to August 1st. He continues to announce the new tariff rates to countries through social media.
