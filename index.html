        const text = `**Sea and Air Shipping Rush Ends, T3EX Sees Normal July**

Due to changes in US-China trade rules, many companies rushed to send goods by sea and air in June. This made prices go up. However, a shipping company called T3EX says this rush is now over. They expect shipping to return to normal in July.

T3EX's money earned in June was NT$2.066 billion. This was more than in May, but less than last year. For the first six months of the year, their total earnings were NT$11.244 billion.

In June, sea shipping earnings for T3EX went up because customers sent goods early. But then, many ships were added, and prices started to fall. Air shipping earnings were good because of steady orders for AI computer parts and other high-tech goods. Also, more online shopping packages helped.

T3EX said that after the special rush orders were finished, and with more ships available, prices started to drop in late June. They believe the market is now getting back to its usual way of working. Another company, Dimerco, also saw more goods shipped by air and sea in June, but strong local currency made their earnings seem lower.

**Trump May Add Taxes on BRICS Countries, But Only if They Act Against the US**

A source has said that former US President Donald Trump will not immediately put new taxes on countries in the BRICS group. However, if these countries do things that are "anti-America," then the US might add a 10% tax.

Trump announced this on his social media. He said the US would tax any country that follows "anti-America policies" with BRICS. BRICS countries have denied that they are against the US. The date for these possible new taxes has been changed from July 9 to August 1.

Trump did not explain what "anti-America policies" mean. Experts say this threat is to make countries, especially those who trade a lot with the US, think carefully. Before Trump's announcement, BRICS leaders had released a statement. They spoke against attacks in Gaza and Iran and warned that new taxes could harm world trade.

The BRICS group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Other countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates have also joined recently.
