            <h1>Hyundai's Korean Workers Arrested: This Might Make Companies Afraid to Invest in the Future</h1>
            <p>Hundreds of South Korean people who were arrested in immigration checks in the United States have now flown back home. The government of South Korea said that this event was "very upsetting" and could stop companies from investing money in the US in the future.</p>
            <p>On September 4, American immigration officers checked a Hyundai-LG battery factory in Georgia. They arrested 475 people because they broke immigration laws. More than 300 of these people were South Koreans who were thought to be working in the US illegally.</p>
            <p>After South Korea said the problem was solved, a special Korean Air Boeing 747-8I airplane was seen leaving Atlanta. Pictures published by South Korea's Yonhap News Agency showed the workers smiling and waving as they got onto a bus to leave.</p>
            <p>South Korea is a strong friend and important investor for the United States. Its top companies have put billions of dollars into building factories and buildings in the US.</p>
            <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung called the checks "very upsetting." He said they might make companies less likely to invest in the future. He said the checks happened because of "cultural differences." He explained that in South Korea, Americans teaching English with a tourist visa is not seen as a "very serious mistake."</p>
            <p>President Lee Jae-myung said that after the workers were arrested, South Korean companies will surely think about if it is worth the risk to build factories in the US. He said, "This could have a big effect on choices about future investments, especially when companies decide if it is possible to run their businesses directly in the US."</p>
            <p>Many South Korean companies send their own workers during big projects. People who know about the industry told AFP that it is normal for companies to find ways to use different visas. This helps them bring in skilled workers and keep projects on time.</p>
            <p>President Lee Jae-myung said that for South Korean companies, "when new buildings, machines, and factories are being set up, skilled workers are very important. Someone must put the machines together, but the US does not have enough of these workers." He added that companies have always used engineers who come for a short time to train local workers. "But now, even this basic need is being refused."</p>
            <p>President Lee Jae-myung said that South Korea is talking with Washington "to make sure that visas for investments are given out properly." This might mean "asking for more visas" or even making new types of visas. He believes "the US will find a way to fix this."</p>
            <p>"But right now, South Korean companies might be slow to invest directly in the US."</p>
            <p>Kim Dae-jong, a professor at Sejong University, told AFP that the checks showed the Trump government did not understand what was most important. They were "actively bringing in many factories but did not pay attention to training local workers."</p>
            <p>Cho Dong-geun, a respected economics professor at Myongji University, said that South Korean companies knew about these visa problems for a long time.</p>
            <p>He said, "It is a pity that action against President Trump's anti-immigration rules did not happen sooner. Something should have been done a long time ago."</p>

            <h1>Chiu Chui-cheng Meets US Lawmakers from Both Parties to Explain China's False Information Activities</h1>
            <p>Minister Chiu Chui-cheng from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council is visiting Washington. He met with lawmakers from both main political parties in the special committee of the US House of Representatives. This committee looks at how the US competes with the Chinese Communist Party. Minister Chiu will also give a speech at a think tank. Yesterday, the committee shared photos of the meeting. The chairman, Mr. Moolenaar, said in a statement that they talked about how to fight against China's false information and its efforts to gain influence.</p>
            <p>The US House of Representatives Select Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party posted many photos on X (which used to be Twitter) yesterday. These photos showed a meeting with a group from Taiwan in Congress. People who were there included Minister Chiu Chui-cheng, Taiwan's representative in the US, Ms. Hsiao Bi-khim, and US lawmakers Rob Wittman, Nathaniel Moran, and Jill Tokuda.</p>
            <p>Lawmaker Moran said on X that China's United Front Work Department is working harder to stop freedom and spread wrong information. He said, "In the US-China Strategic Competition Select Committee, we heard directly from Taiwan's Minister Chiu Chui-cheng. He explained how Taiwan strongly protects itself from these threats and keeps freedom in the Taiwan Strait."</p>
            <p>The committee's chairman, Mr. John Moolenaar, said in a statement that they had good meetings. They talked about how to stop China's false information and its efforts to unite people, and how to make the security and money relationship between the US and Taiwan stronger. The committee fully supports Taiwan's democracy and freedom.</p>
            <p>Mr. Moolenaar, who is well-known for being against China, was recently attacked by Chinese hackers. The hackers pretended to be him and sent emails to people he trusted. They tried to trick these people into opening files and links. This was so the hackers could get their information during important talks about trade between the US and China, and the victims did not even know it was happening.</p>
            <p>The committee used very professional technical analysis to confirm this. The hackers made hidden ways to secretly steal important information directly to their own computers. This is what spy operations supported by a country often do.</p>
            <p>On September 8, Mr. Moolenaar said that this is another example of China's strong cyber attacks. These attacks want to steal US plans and use them against the US Congress, the government, and the American people. He made it clear, "We will not be scared. We will continue to work hard to keep America safe."</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, Minister Chiu Chui-cheng will speak at The Heritage Foundation. His topic will be "Keeping Peace and Stability in the Taiwan Strait is Good for Both Taiwan and the US." Mr. Steve Yates, who used to be a security advisor for a US Vice President, will be the host.</p>

            <h1>US Inflation Numbers Are as Expected, European Stocks Close Higher</h1>
            <p>Today, the main stock markets in Europe closed at a higher price. This happened because new information about how much prices are rising in the US (inflation data) was just what people thought it would be. This made it more likely that the US central bank (the Federal Reserve) will lower interest rates next week. Also, the European Central Bank kept interest rates the same for the second time in a row, which was also what people expected. They also said they think the economy and prices in the Eurozone will grow more this year.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 72.19 points, or 0.78%. It closed at 9297.58 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 70.70 points, or 0.30%. It closed at 23703.65 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 62.20 points, or 0.80%. It closed at 7823.52 points.</p>
