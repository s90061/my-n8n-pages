            <h1>China Tells Companies to Stop Buying NVIDIA AI Chips; US House Speaker Says Beijing Makes Things Worse</h1>
            <p>A British news organization said that China's National Internet Information Office has told many Chinese companies to stop buying NVIDIA AI chips. Today, US House Speaker Johnson criticized China for making the relationship between the two countries more difficult. He directly called China an "opponent" of the United States.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times, a British newspaper, reported that three people who know about the situation said China's National Internet Information Office told several Chinese companies this week, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop buying NVIDIA's artificial intelligence (AI) chips. They also said to cancel current orders, including tests and purchases of NVIDIA's RTX Pro 6000D.</p>
            <p>Johnson spoke on the CNBC show "Squawk Box" today. He said, "They (China) steal our intellectual property."</p>
            <p>He also said, "They do not care about US trademark laws or other rules that protect fair trade. It is not America's fault that the relationship is tense."</p>

            <h1>Obama Says US is at a Turning Point to Unite or Divide After Kirk's Death</h1>
            <p>Former US President Barack Obama said that after the murder of conservative activist Kirk, the United States is at a "turning point." He hinted that the current President, Trump, is not trying to bring people together but is making the country more divided.</p>
            <p>According to a written record obtained by the Associated Press, Obama spoke last night in Erie, Pennsylvania, at an event by the Jefferson Education Society. He said, "There is no doubt here: the main idea of our democracy is that we must be able to have different opinions, and even strong arguments, without using violence."</p>
            <p>Obama has been mostly quiet since he left office. Yesterday, he answered a question from the host and shared his thoughts on what Trump said and did after Kirk's death.</p>
            <p>Obama talked about a shooting in 2015 at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina, where nine people died. He showed strong leadership as president then. He also talked about what Republican President George W. Bush did after the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
            <p>Obama said he believes a president's job during a crisis is to "always remind us that we are united."</p>
            <p>Obama said that after Charlie Kirk's death, Trump and his staff called political opponents "pests, enemies... This shows a bigger problem."</p>
            <p>Kirk was an important person in conservative politics. He started "Turning Point USA" in Arizona, which is one of the biggest political groups in the US. This made him a close friend of Trump.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that after Kirk's death, Trump spoke more loudly, saying he would stop what he called "radical leftists." This made people worried that the Republican government might use the anger from Kirk's death to stop people from disagreeing.</p>
            <p>The Trump administration responded to Obama's words today. White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement, "Obama always uses every chance to cause division and make Americans fight each other. After he became president, more and more Americans felt that Obama divided the country, instead of uniting it."</p>

            <h1>US Job Market is Weak, Federal Reserve Lowers Interest Rate</h1>
            <p>The US job market is not strong. Because of this, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced today that it would lower its main interest rate by 0.25%, which is called one "quarter point." This is the first time they have lowered rates this year.</p>
            <p>Recent information from the US shows that the job market is not as good as expected. Last week, the US Department of Labor gave early numbers. They said that the number of new jobs created outside of farming in the US might be reduced by 911,000 for the year up to March this year.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has kept interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50% since their last rate cut in December last year. The people who make decisions are still watching how President Trump's tariffs (taxes on imported goods) affect inflation (when prices go up).</p>
