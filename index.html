            <h1>Low-pressure system brings more rain to central and southern Taiwan; watch out for local heavy rain</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration (CWA) said today that a low-pressure system will bring more rain to western Taiwan. Central and southern Taiwan will have short rain or thunderstorms throughout the day, with a chance of local heavy rain. Northern Taiwan will also have local short rain or thunderstorms due to leftover moisture from the low-pressure system. Eastern Taiwan will be mostly cloudy, with local thunderstorms in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>For temperatures, most places will have high temperatures between 30 and 32 degrees Celsius. It will feel hot and humid when it's not raining. Low temperatures will be between 26 and 28 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>For the islands, Penghu will be cloudy to sometimes overcast with short rain or thunderstorms, temperatures from 27 to 31 degrees. Kinmen will be cloudy with short rain or thunderstorms, temperatures from 27 to 32 degrees. Matsu will be overcast with short rain or thunderstorms, temperatures from 26 to 29 degrees.</p>
            <p>The CWA reminds people that Lanyu, Green Island, areas north of Taichung, the Hengchun Peninsula, and parts of Penghu may have strong winds, with average speeds of 6 (Beaufort scale) or gusts of 8. The coastlines of Keelung's North Coast, eastern Taiwan (including Lanyu and Green Island), and the Hengchun Peninsula may have high waves, up to 2 to 3 meters. People should be careful when doing activities near the sea.</p>
            <p>Also, before July 27, there will be a very high tide of the year. In Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Taitung, the Hengchun Peninsula, and the coastlines of Keelung's North Coast and Yilan, water levels will be high during high tide. Low-lying areas near the coast might experience flooding from the sea. People should be extra careful about poor drainage and avoid staying in areas like coasts, ports, or tidal flats.</p>
            <p>Regarding typhoons, the 8th tropical storm, CO-MAY, was 370 kilometers southeast of Taipei at 2 AM. It is moving north-northeast and will soon become a tropical depression. The 9th tropical storm, KROSA, was about 2410 kilometers east of Eluanbi at 2 AM. Because it is very far away, it will not directly affect Taiwan's weather for now.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Ministry of Environment about air quality, due to the low-pressure system, winds will change to mainly west or southwest. These southwest winds might bring a small amount of pollution from outside Taiwan to Taiwan and its islands. Northern Taiwan is downwind, so pollutants may build up slightly. The air quality in Hualien and Taitung areas will be "Good." The air quality in northern, Hsinchu-Miaoli, central, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Yilan areas, and Matsu will be "Normal." Some areas in western Taiwan might reach "Orange Alert" level for a short time. Kinmen and Penghu will be at "Orange Alert" level.</p>

            <h1>"The Missing" and "What's in Our Home" shown at New York Asian Film Festival; Directors share how to tell good stories</h1>
            <p>The movies "The Missing" and "What's in Our Home" will be shown at the New York Asian Film Festival in the "Taiwan Emerald" section. Directors Jian Xuebin and Pan Keyin worked on the scripts for a long time. They want to show good new Taiwanese commercial and drama films to people in New York.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Emerald" section of the New York Asian Film Festival will show Pan Keyin's "What's in Our Home" on July 26 and Jian Xuebin's "The Missing" on July 27. Both films talk about real social problems and family truths. The directors held a press conference and gave interviews at the Taipei Cultural Center in New York on July 25.</p>
            <p>"The Missing" stars Zhang Xiaoquan, Li Mu, and Lou Junshuo. The story starts with a father looking for his daughter. It then talks about bigger social issues like organ trade and live streams on the dark web, showing how cruel class differences can be. The film was released in Taiwan in April and had a special showing in Hong Kong in June.</p>
            <p>Director Jian Xuebin said that "The Missing" was first a drama film. But over the last 10 years, the film industry in Taiwan and global streaming platforms have changed a lot. Different types of films are now popular in Taiwan, so they changed it into a crime thriller. This was after big challenges like the pandemic and actors getting hurt, which delayed filming.</p>
            <p>He said, "'The Missing' has a real-life topic. Many countries, especially South Korea, are making films like this. Taiwan also needs to tell similar stories. It's important to pay attention to the serious problem of organ trade in some developing countries. We want to tell the audience about it through a commercial film."</p>
            <p>When talking about the problems and challenges facing the global film industry, Jian Xuebin said that the story of "The Missing" changed many times over 10 years. The world keeps changing, and what audiences like is also changing. Genre films (films of a specific type) are a trend, but they are hard to make. Getting people to go to the cinema is a big challenge for directors today.</p>
            <p>He explained that the budget for Taiwanese films is usually around 50 million New Taiwan Dollars. Filmmakers must create within this budget. They cannot write scripts that need a lot of money. This is a challenge: to tell a good story within these limits, so that the plot, action, and choice of actors can be better in this situation.</p>
            <p>"What's in Our Home" is the first long film by director Pan Keyin, who started as an editor. The script expanded from his short film "Sister" to tell the story of a family of four. In April this year, it received great applause at the Udine Far East Film Festival in Italy.</p>
            <p>Pan Keyin said, "My sister came to our family because she was adopted. My relationship with her is no different from any other siblings. I wanted to share my feelings about my own family." He added, "My sister was sick in the intensive care unit, and my mother held her hand and cried. At that moment, I felt something very strong. They are not related by blood, but they have a strong bond. I want to use my work to share why this is so, the unconditional care and love that exists between people."</p>
            <p>"What's in Our Home" tells the story of a home from the point of view of the four family members. It looks at the family at different times to see how it formed and changed.</p>
            <p>He said that after growing up and leaving home for school and work, he rarely went back home as an adult. Every time he returned, he felt that the family's situation was always changing. He said, "A home is like a person growing and changing. After being away for a while, you might find that someone is no longer there, or people go to work or get married. The home also gets older. At that moment, I feel a sense of sadness."</p>
            <p>These two films about family made people connect Pan Keyin with Hirokazu Kore-eda, a Japanese director known for making films about families.</p>
            <p>Pan Keyin thought deeply and said that their styles are different, and he is not as gentle. But this comparison puts a lot of pressure on him. He does not want to think too much about what his style is right now. If he feels something or thinks of something, he just goes in that direction.</p>
            <p>He said that if he makes a second film in the future, it should not be like the first one. Being compared to Kore-eda is, of course, a compliment and an honor. He believes that if he continues to make films, people will see his own style.</p>
            <p>"What's in Our Home" stars Tseng Jing-Hua, Lan Wei-Hua, Kao Yi-Ling, Huang Pei-Qi, Yao Chun-Yao, and Zhu Yi-Ming. It is expected to be released in Taiwan in September.</p>

            <h1>Recall Vote Until 4 PM: No Canvassing, No Phones â€“ 7 Key Rules to Know</h1>
            <p>Today, July 26, is the day for voting on the recall cases for 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an. Voting will be from 8 AM to 4 PM. People must bring their national ID card, personal stamp (chop), and voting notice to vote at their assigned polling place. Also, no campaigning or helping with the recall activity is allowed today. If someone breaks this rule, they will be fined.</p>
            <p>Today is the voting day for the recall of lawmakers of the 11th Legislature and the 11th Mayor of Hsinchu City. The people facing recall include KMT lawmakers Fu Kun-chi, Huang Chien-pin, Cheng Cheng-chien, Lin Pei-hsiang, Wan Mei-ling, Lu Ming-che, Tu Chuan-chi, Niu Hsu-ting, Liao Hsien-hsiang, Lo Ting-wei, Huang Chien-hao, Liao Wei-hsiang, Chiu Jo-hua, Lu Yu-ling, Ding Hsueh-chung, Yeh Yuan-chih, Wang Hung-wei, Lee Yen-hsiu, Hsu Chiao-hsin, Lai Shih-bao, Lo Chih-chiang, Hung Meng-kai, Chang Chih-lun, Lin Te-fu, and Kao Hung-an.</p>
            <p><b>People who go to vote should bring their national ID card, personal stamp, and voting notice.</b> If you don't have your stamp, you can still sign or use a thumbprint. If you don't have your voting notice, you can still vote. But if you remember your number in the voter list, like "page X, number Y," telling the staff when you get your ballot will save time.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission (CEC) lists 7 important rules for voting:</p>
            <p>First, <b>starting from 12 AM on July 26, you cannot campaign or help with recall activities on messaging apps like LINE, social media like Facebook, or other media.</b> If you do, you will be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$1,000,000. If you do not stop after being told, you will be fined repeatedly. Political parties, candidates, and their employees, agents, or users will be fined more, between NT$200,000 and NT$2,000,000.</p>
            <p>Second, <b>you cannot shout, disturb, or try to convince others to vote or not vote within 30 meters of a polling place.</b> If you continue after security tells you to stop, you can be put in prison for up to 1 year, or held in custody, or fined up to NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>Third, <b>you cannot bring mobile phones or other cameras into the polling place (but if your mobile phone is turned off, this rule does not apply).</b> If you do, you will be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000.</p>
            <p>Fourth, <b>you cannot put anything other than the recall ballot into the ballot box, or intentionally tear up the recall ballot.</b> If you do, you will be fined between NT$5,000 and NT$50,000.</p>
            <p>Fifth, <b>you cannot use a camera to secretly look at what a voter has marked on their recall ballot.</b> If you do, you can be put in prison for up to 5 years and fined up to NT$500,000. Any camera found will be taken away.</p>
            <p>Sixth, <b>you cannot take the recall ballot out of the polling place.</b> If you do, you can be put in prison for up to 1 year, or held in custody, or fined up to NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>Seventh, <b>marking the recall ballot with a personal stamp or thumbprint is not valid. You also cannot use your own marking tools, ink pads, or stamp pads to vote.</b> You must use the marking tool provided by the Election Commission.</p>
            <p>According to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, for a recall to pass, the number of valid "yes" votes must be more than the "no" votes, and the "yes" votes must be at least 1/4 of all voters in that election district. The CEC will review and announce the results on August 1. If a recall passes, the person will legally lose their job and cannot act as a lawmaker or use lawmaker powers from August 1.</p>
            <p>If the number of "no" votes is more than the "yes" votes, or if the "yes" votes are less than 1/4 of all voters, the recall fails. During the term of the person who faced recall, no new recall proposals can be made against the same person.</p>
