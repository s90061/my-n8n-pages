In the UK, the rate at which food prices are increasing has slowed down. This is good news, as it means "food inflation" is falling. However, despite this drop, the cost of everyday groceries is still much higher than it was two years ago. For many families, this means that essential items like sugar, olive oil, and some vegetables remain very expensive. Shoppers are still feeling the financial pressure when they buy food. Supermarkets are trying different ways to help customers, but people continue to spend more money on their weekly food shop compared to previous years.

**Coming Back to the Office: Is It Making Employees Leave?**

Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office, either full-time or for several days a week. However, a recent study suggests that this might make staff unhappy and even cause them to look for new jobs. The survey found that a lot of workers prefer having the flexibility to work from home, at least some of the time. If companies demand a full return to the office, they might struggle to keep their best employees. Experts say that offering options like hybrid work (a mix of office and home working) could help companies keep their staff happy and avoid losing talented people.
