            <h1>Economics Minister's View on Minimum Wage Formula, Labor Minister Says He Reflects Employers' Ideas</h1>
            <p>The discussion about the minimum wage adjustment is coming soon. Economics Minister Kung Ming-hsin recently said that the current formula for adjusting the minimum wage is not suitable this year. Labor Minister Hung Shen-han replied today that Kung Ming-hsin is sharing the ideas of employers. Hung said that the Ministry of Labor's job is to carefully look at all important numbers and economic situations when deciding.</p>
            <p>The world is facing issues with equal tariffs. Kung Ming-hsin said earlier that even though the economy grew well in the first half of this year, this growth was mainly in high-tech industries. Small and medium-sized businesses and traditional industries were greatly affected. If they follow the old minimum wage formula, the minimum wage would definitely increase. "The old formula is not suitable, at least for this year," he said, and he will tell the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Labor his department's ideas.</p>
            <p>Today, Hung Shen-han responded to Kung Ming-hsin's comments for the first time. Hung Shen-han said that Kung Ming-hsin was indeed sharing the ideas of employers. However, every year, when they decide how to adjust the minimum wage, they must consider opinions from workers, employers, the government, and experts.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han stated that the Ministry of Labor is the body that reviews the minimum wage. So, they will follow the law and fully understand the current economic numbers, the social situation, and the opinions of all people involved. They will think about everything carefully during the review.</p>

            <h1>UMC's August Revenue Falls Below NT$20 Billion, Showing a Double Decline</h1>
            <p>UMC (United Microelectronics Corporation), a company that makes computer chips, announced its revenue for August. It was less than NT$20 billion, reaching NT$19.16 billion. This is a 4.39% decrease from July and about 7.2% less than August last year. This shows a drop both month-over-month and year-over-year.</p>
            <p>UMC had previously expected that its chip shipments in the third quarter would increase by 1% to 3% compared to the second quarter. They also expected the average selling price of their products in US dollars to stay the same, and their factory use rate to be around 74% to 76%.</p>
            <p>UMC's total revenue for the first eight months of the year was NT$155.816 billion, which is a 1.86% increase compared to the same time last year. The total revenue for July and August was about NT$39.2 billion. Experts believe that UMC's performance in the third quarter should meet its expectations.</p>
            <p>UMC believes that its 22-nanometer and 28-nanometer technologies will continue to be used by customers. Its share in the wireless communication market is expected to grow. To meet customers' needs for different ways of making products and to make the supply chain stronger, UMC plans to start producing chips at its new Phase 3 factory in Singapore in 2026.</p>

            <h1>Will Removing New Youth Loans from Bank Act Lead to Property Speculation? Peng Jin-lung: Different from Last Year</h1>
            <p>Today, the Executive Yuan decided that starting September 1, new youth-friendly housing loans will not be included in the rules of Article 72-2 of the Bank Act. People are worried that this new rule might cause property prices to go up again. However, Peng Jin-lung, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), said that based on the number of applications, these new youth-friendly loans are now used by people who want to live in the homes themselves. Also, the Ministry of Finance has made improvements, so the situation is completely different from last year.</p>
            <p>Article 72-2 of the Bank Act states that commercial banks cannot lend more than 30% of their total deposits and financial bonds for building homes and businesses. This is often called the "golden rule" for bank property loans. Recently, some people trying to get home loans were told by banks that they had no money left to lend. The Executive Yuan decided today that from September 1, new youth-friendly loans will not count towards this limit. Some people think this will make it easier to get home loans, but it also makes them worried that housing prices might rise sharply again.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, Peng Jin-lung led officials from different departments to a Ghost Festival worship event. After the event, Peng Jin-lung spoke to reporters. He said that home loan issues involve many things, and he only spoke from the FSC's point of view. He explained that the FSC manages Article 72-2 of the Bank Act, which is a system to manage how much money banks have available.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung pointed out that over the past 10 years, property loans have grown by almost 85%, while deposits have only grown by about 73%. Recently, the property market has been quite active, and the amount of money available for lending has been tighter. He said that many numbers show they must try their best to help people who want to buy their first home or a home to live in. Banks are special businesses, and they must provide loans for people's daily needs. Therefore, for the Bank Act, new youth-friendly loans made after September 1 will not be part of the Article 72-2 limit. This aims to give state-owned banks more room to offer home loans.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if this easing of rules might cause another wave of property speculation and if there are other plans to prevent this. Peng Jin-lung said that regarding the new youth-friendly loans, from last year's highest point to the first half of this year, these loans are now mainly for people who want to live in the homes themselves. This is true for both the number of loans and their purpose. Also, the Ministry of Finance made improvements last year, so these loans should now be for people buying homes to live in. He believes the situation is completely different from last year.</p>
            <p>Ruan Ching-hua, the Deputy Minister of Finance, explained more at a press conference after the Executive Yuan meeting this morning. He said that new youth-friendly loan applications reached over 8,000 at their highest point last year, but in July this year, they dropped to more than 3,000. He believes that after the rules are eased, the ability to give out loans will increase.</p>
