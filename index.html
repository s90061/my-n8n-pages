            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Gets Stronger: Hualien and Taitung See Over 200mm Rain in One Day</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration (CWA) says that light typhoon Wipha is closest to Taiwan today. In the last three hours, it has become a bit stronger, and its stormy area has grown. Because of the typhoon's outer bands, Hualien and Taitung counties have received over 200 millimeters of rain from midnight until 8 AM.</p>
            <p>The CWA continues to give a sea typhoon warning. According to the CWA website, Wipha's center was about 240 kilometers southwest of Eluanbi at 8 AM. Its central pressure is 980 hectopascals. The fastest wind near the center is 28 meters per second, which is like a level 10 wind. The fastest gust is 35 meters per second, like a level 12 wind. The average stormy area with level 7 winds is 150 kilometers. It is moving at 24 kilometers per hour, first to the northwest and then to the west.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsieh Pei-yun, a technical specialist at the CWA's Weather Forecast Center, said that the typhoon is expected to get stronger and its stormy area will get bigger. It should move away from Taiwan's nearby waters later today. Because of its outer bands, there will be a lot of rain. Besides Hualien and Taitung, other areas will also have short rain showers.</p>
            <p>For the next 24 hours of rain, Ms. Hsieh Pei-yun said that today's rain will still be very heavy. People in eastern Taiwan need to be very careful. Mountainous areas in Hualien and Taitung might get very heavy rain. Flat areas in Hualien and Taitung, mountainous areas in Yilan, Nantou, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Hengchun Peninsula will also get heavy rain. New Taipei City, Taipei City, Yilan County, Kaohsiung and Pingtung areas, Taoyuan City, and mountainous areas in Taichung will have local heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Due to the sinking air from the typhoon's outer bands, the CWA has issued a high-temperature warning. Miaoli County has an orange light today, meaning there is a high chance of temperatures staying at 36 degrees Celsius. Hsinchu City, Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Changhua County, and Kinmen County have a yellow light, meaning they should watch out for temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>The CWA also continues to give a strong wind warning for land. From today until tomorrow, parts of Keelung City, New Taipei City and Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County and City, Miaoli, Taichung, Nantou County, Tainan City, Pingtung County, Yilan County, Hualien and Taitung (including Orchid Island and Green Island), Penghu County, Kinmen, and Lienchiang County may have average winds of level 6 or higher, or gusts of level 8 or higher. Today, the greater Taipei area should watch out for stronger gusts.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that today, the northern coast of Keelung, eastern Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), the south, the coast of Hengchun Peninsula, and Penghu will likely have long waves. In the Bashi Channel, the sea southeast of Taiwan, and the southern Taiwan Strait, waves will get higher than 5 meters. In the northern and northeastern sea of Taiwan and the northern Taiwan Strait, waves will also slowly get higher, from 3 to 4 meters. People are advised to avoid going near the sea.</p>
