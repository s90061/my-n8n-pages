            <h1>WTT Sweden Grand Slam: Cheng I-Ching and Chien Tung-Chuan Win First Match and Reach Top 16</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese table tennis player Cheng I-Ching played with Chien Tung-Chuan for the first time in the WTT Swedish Grand Slam women's doubles on August 18. They won their match against Izabela Lupulesku and Sabina Surjan from Serbia with scores of 11-8, 11-7, and 11-7. This win helped them move forward to the top 16.</p>
            <p>Cheng I-Ching, a well-known female table tennis player from Taiwan, used to play with Lee Yu-Chun. But in the WTT Iguazu Contender event this year, she played with a new young player, Huang Yu-Chiao, who is 22 years old and won a silver medal at the Universiade. They stopped at the top 8 in that event.</p>
            <p>For this WTT Swedish Grand Slam, which is the second highest level, Cheng I-Ching changed partners again and played with Chien Tung-Chuan, who is also part of the Paris Olympics team.</p>
            <p>In their first match in the top 32, Cheng I-Ching and Chien Tung-Chuan, who are a left-handed and right-handed pair, played against the Serbian team of Lupulesku and Surjan.</p>
            <p>In the first game, both teams were trying to understand each other's style. The Taiwanese pair was behind twice, 4-6 and 6-8. But then, Cheng I-Ching led a comeback. She used many strong forehand shots to score points quickly and won 5 points in a row to take the first game.</p>
            <p>From the second game, Cheng I-Ching and Chien Tung-Chuan started to play better and control the game. When they were behind 3-4, they scored 4 points in a row to take the lead. They slowly increased their lead and won the next two games easily.</p>
            <p>In the third game, they started behind 0-2, but then the Taiwanese pair quickly scored 5 points in a row to take the lead. With Cheng I-Ching's leadership, they stayed ahead for the whole game and won three games to zero. This was a great start for them playing together for the first time.</p>
            <p>Their coach, Cheng Chia-Chi, said that for their first time playing together, they did very well. He noted that even though there were ups and downs in the game, Cheng I-Ching used her experience to help her teammate adjust, and they got a good result.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Life Issues NT$20.81 Billion in Subordinate Bonds to Increase Capital</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Life decided in May this year to issue subordinate corporate bonds for up to NT$30 billion. Today, Taiwan Life announced that the first part of these bonds totals NT$20.81 billion. These bonds are split into two types, A and B, based on their conditions. The main reason for issuing these bonds is to add more money to the company's capital and make its capital ratio stronger.</p>
            <p>In recent years, insurance companies have been issuing a lot of bonds to get more money. According to the Financial Supervisory Commission, six life insurance companies were allowed to issue bonds in 2024. The total amount of these bonds was NT$205.79 billion, which is the highest amount ever. This year, other companies like Fubon Life, Nan Shan Life, Global Life, and San Shang Mei Bang Life have also announced plans to issue bonds.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Life's board decided on May 9 to issue subordinate corporate bonds. The total amount will be no more than NT$30 billion (or the same amount in foreign money). They can issue these bonds all at once or in smaller parts, depending on the market.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Life released an important announcement tonight to give more details about the bonds they decided to issue on May 9. The total amount for this first issue is NT$20.81 billion.</p>
            <p>The announcement says that these subordinate corporate bonds are divided into two types based on their terms. Type A bonds are for NT$10.21 billion and have a fixed interest rate of 3.75% per year for 10 years. Type B bonds are for NT$10.6 billion and have a fixed interest rate of 3.88% per year for 15 years.</p>
            <p>Currently, the first part of the bonds issued by Taiwan Life is NT$20.81 billion. Taiwan Life explained that they have applied to the GreTai Securities Market to issue a second part, which will be US$102.5 million in dollar-denominated bonds. They will issue the remaining NT$9.19 billion when the market conditions are good.</p>
