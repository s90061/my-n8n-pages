The Taiwan People's Party said recently that many serious scam cases have happened. They stated that big scams are now a normal thing in Taiwan. In June alone, people in Taiwan lost 8.9 billion NT dollars because of scams. This means people lose almost 300 million NT dollars every day. Over 16,000 scam cases were reported in June.

The party mentioned sad stories, like a family of five in Taichung who lost money in fake investments. Another family in Taichung also lost 16 million NT dollars, and a woman in Keelung lost over 5 million NT dollars to fake cryptocurrency investments.

The Taiwan People's Party wants the government to do more. They asked where the government's "Anti-Scam National Team" is. They will continue to watch how well the government's "Anti-Scam 2.0 Action Plan" works. They also reminded everyone to be careful about scams and to talk to their friends and family. Common scams include fake investments, people pretending to be police, or fake romantic relationships. If you are scammed, do not feel ashamed. Report it to the police quickly and call the 165 anti-scam hotline.

**Xitou Park Closed Due to Typhoon Damage, Cingjing Farm Reopens**

Typhoon Danna hit Taiwan and caused a lot of damage, especially in the Xitou Nature Education Area. Strong winds caused many trees to fall down, and about 5 or 6 cars were damaged by the falling trees. Because there is no water or electricity, and the park needs to be cleaned up, Xitou Park will stay closed tomorrow, July 8th. The roads leading to Xitou were partly cleared today.

In Shuili Township, an old mango tree, over 300 years old, fell down because of the strong winds. It damaged three metal houses, but luckily, no one was inside, so no one got hurt. Another tree fell in Puli, damaging four houses, but again, no one was injured.

However, Cingjing Farm announced good news. The animals there are safe, and the farm did not suffer any major damage from the rain. The roads to Cingjing Farm are normal. So, Cingjing Farm will open again tomorrow, July 8th, and the guesthouse will also be open.
