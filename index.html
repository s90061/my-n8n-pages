            <h1>Trump Changes Stance After US-Russia Summit, Promotes Peace Agreement for Russia-Ukraine Instead of Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>After a meeting between US President Trump and Russian President Putin, Trump changed his mind about a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. He now thinks a direct peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine is the way to end the war. US media say Trump agrees with Putin on this, which is different from what European friends think.</p>
            <p>The Russia-Ukraine war has been going on for almost 3 and a half years. Trump and Putin met yesterday in Alaska to talk about the war. This was the first time the current US and Russian presidents met since 2021. After the meeting, Trump held a press conference with Putin. He said they agreed on many things, but they didn't make a deal yet.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that Ukraine and Russia should make a final peace agreement directly. He no longer wants just a ceasefire. The Washington Post reported that this big change happened a few hours after the meeting. It made Trump's position the same as Putin's.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post also said that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, with support from European leaders, has always said that a ceasefire must happen first before any talks about ending the war. Before the US-Russia summit, European officials were hopeful that the US was starting to agree with them, especially after Trump had talked about a ceasefire before.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting in Alaska, French President Macron said earlier this week that Trump had told Europe he wanted a ceasefire. German Chancellor Merz also said that a ceasefire must be the first step for talks.</p>
            <p>However, after meeting Putin, Trump changed his mind. He wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," that "everyone believes the best way to end this terrible war between Russia and Ukraine is to make a direct peace agreement. This will truly end the war, not just a ceasefire. Ceasefires often don't last."</p>
            <p>Putin has always refused calls for a ceasefire. He insists on long talks to reach a final peace agreement. But Ukraine and its European friends see this as Russia trying to delay things to keep what they have gained in the war.</p>
            <p>After the US-Russia summit, Trump immediately called Zelenskyy and European leaders to talk about the meeting. Trump told Fox News that he and Putin agreed the Russia-Ukraine war will end with land being exchanged and the US giving some kind of safety promise.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post quoted two people who know about the talks. They said Trump told Zelenskyy that Putin wants Ukraine to give all of the Donbas region to Russia, plus other land Russia has already taken. In return, the war would end.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump at the White House on August 18. Trump said that if everything goes well, "we will then set up a meeting with President Putin."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Zelenskyy also said on social media that he supports future talks between the US, Ukraine, and Russia. He believes that direct talks between leaders are the only way to discuss important issues like country independence and land.</p>

            <h1>Putin Reportedly Asks Ukraine to Leave Two Eastern Regions, Willing to Freeze Other Front Lines in Exchange</h1>
            <p>British media, like the Financial Times, reported that Russian President Putin has asked Ukraine to leave the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. He wants this as a condition to end the war. He also told US President Trump that if Russia's main demands are met, he can stop fighting on other front lines.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times said that four people who know about the talks directly reported that Putin made these demands yesterday when he met Trump in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Trump then called Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and several European leaders today to share Putin's message.</p>
            <p>Reuters, AFP, and Bloomberg News also reported similar information from their sources.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times noted that parts of Donetsk and Luhansk have been held by Russia for over 10 years. If Ukraine agrees to leave, Russia would then control all of both regions.</p>
            <p>According to three sources who know about the Trump-Putin meeting, Putin said that in return, he would freeze the front lines in the southern Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. This means he would not start new attacks to take more land there.</p>
            <p>Putin made it clear that he has not given up on his main demands to "solve the basic reasons for the conflict." These demands would mostly end Ukraine's current state as a country and stop NATO from moving further east.</p>
            <p>However, a former high-ranking Kremlin official said that if these "basic reasons" are solved in a way Putin likes, he is also ready to compromise on other issues, including land.</p>
            <p>About 70% of the Donetsk region is controlled by Russian forces. But a series of cities in the far west are still controlled by Ukraine. These cities are very important for Ukraine's military actions and defense in the east. For the Luhansk region, almost all areas are controlled by Russian forces, except for a small part in the far west.</p>
            <p>People who know Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian leader will not agree to give up Donetsk. However, he is open to talking about land issues with Trump. Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump in Washington on August 18.</p>
            <p>The White House did not respond to the Financial Times' request for comments about the details of the Trump-Putin talks.</p>

            <h1>German Chancellor Supports US Security Guarantees for Ukraine, Suggests US-Russia-Ukraine Talks in Europe</h1>
            <p>German Chancellor Merz said today that the United States is ready to be part of Ukraine's security promises. He also said that US President Trump's idea for a three-way meeting between the US, Russia, and Ukraine could happen in Europe. The goal is to reach a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Reuters and AFP reported that US President Trump talked to Merz and other European leaders about his meeting with Russian President Putin. This meeting happened the day before in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Afterward, Merz told the German public TV channel ZDF, "The good news is that the United States is ready to join in giving these security promises to Ukraine. Europe will not have to do it alone."</p>
            <p>Merz said that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump in Washington on August 18. After this, a three-way meeting with Putin, Trump, and Zelenskyy should happen soon. The aim is to reach a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>He said, "If it works, it will be more valuable than just a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>He added that the "date and place for the three-way meeting are not decided yet. We have suggested finding a place in Europe."</p>
            <p>At the same time, the leaders of eight Nordic-Baltic countries released a joint statement today. They said again that they strongly support Ukraine. They also support Trump's efforts to end Russia's attack through talks.</p>
            <p>In the statement, the leaders from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said that for peace between Russia and Ukraine, there needs to be a ceasefire and safety promises for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "We are happy to see President Trump's statement that the US is ready to be part of security promises. Ukraine's military and its cooperation with other countries should not be limited in any way."</p>
