            <h1>Jiaxing Hospital and Dr. Wang Tianxing's Old House Become a Chiayi City Historic Site</h1>
            <p>Jiaxing Hospital and Dr. Wang Tianxing's old house are on Wufeng South Road in Chiayi City. Dr. Wang's family asked for them to become historic sites. The committee that checks cultural things decided that the buildings are special. They are different from typical street-front hospitals and show how hospitals were built during the Japanese colonial period. So, they decided to make them official historic sites for Chiayi City.</p>
            <p>Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui said that Dr. Wang Tianxing's family asking for this shows they care about local history and culture. It also means more people support keeping old buildings safe. This building shows Dr. Wang's important work in medicine in Chiayi. Its style mixes Japanese and Western designs. It has important history and social value. For the people of Chiayi, it is a very special memory of their city.</p>
            <p>The committee members said that Jiaxing Hospital has two floors. It mixes Japanese and Western styles. Some parts of its structure and space are broken. The back part, which had two floors for treatments, has completely fallen down. However, the ground still has the old foundations and bases for columns. From these, we can guess how the building was built and where the stairs were.</p>
            <p>Also, Dr. Wang Tianxing's old house is a one-story wooden building. It has five sections. The roof has five ridges and four slopes. It has Western-style wooden beams. The pillars have Chinese poetic couplets written on them. In the main hall, there is a Buddhist altar. The style, parts, and materials used mix Chinese and Western designs. This clearly shows the different styles and ways of life for Han Chinese people during the Japanese colonial period.</p>
            <p>The committee members think that both buildings together show how hospitals and homes were at the same time during the Japanese colonial period. But they are different from street-front hospitals. This makes them important for studying hospital types from that time. Also, the work on them is very detailed. They show high skill in craft and art. So, the committee decided to make them official historic sites for Chiayi City.</p>
            <p>To help the owner understand the rules for protecting cultural buildings, the Cultural Affairs Bureau brought experts to visit the site many times early this year. In March, Chiayi City Cultural Affairs Bureau Director Hsieh Yu-che visited the owner. They talked about how to fix and use the buildings in the future.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi City Cultural Affairs Bureau said that Wang Tianxing was a descendant of General Wang De-lu, a famous general from the Qing Dynasty. His father, He Qixu, was a scholar in the Qing Dynasty. Wang Tianxing went to the Taipei Medical College of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. He got three medical degrees in Taiwan and Japan: a Taiwan medical degree, a Tokyo medical degree, and a tropical medicine degree. Jiaxing Hospital offered many services, including internal medicine, pediatrics, ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynecology, dermatologic surgery, proctology, and physical therapy. The hospital also had a research lab to make its own medicines to help local people.</p>

            <h1>Declassified: Kissinger Once Thought About Luring Chinese Army to Diaoyutai Islands in 1974, But Changed His Mind</h1>
            <p>New declassified documents from the US government show that in January 1974, when China took control of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea, Henry Kissinger, who was the US Secretary of State at the time, asked his staff if they could trick the Chinese army into going to the Diaoyutai Islands (which Japan calls the Senkaku Islands). But he later decided not to do it.</p>
            <p>Japan's Kyodo News reported today that officials in the US State Department did not agree with this idea. So, the plan was never put into action.</p>
            <p>The report also says that Kissinger might have been unhappy that Japan made friends with China in September 1972, before the US did. He was also worried that Japan was getting too close to Beijing. He might have wanted to "warn" Japan this way. However, it is not clear how he planned to trick them.</p>
            <p>On January 19, 1974, China fought with South Vietnam and took full control of the Paracel Islands that same month.</p>
            <p>According to the declassified papers, on January 31, Kissinger had a meeting with his staff at the State Department. They were talking about what to do about the situation in the South China Sea. He said, "Can we lure them (China) to the Senkaku Islands? That way, we can teach the Japanese a lesson."</p>
            <p>Arthur Hummel, who was the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs then, asked Kissinger, "I understand we need to teach the Japanese a lesson, but is it worth doing this much?"</p>
            <p>Kissinger replied "No" and stopped thinking about the idea.</p>
            <p>Rust Deming, who was a diplomat at the US Embassy in Japan at that time and later became the Deputy Chief of Mission in the 1990s, told Kyodo News that he believed Kissinger thought Japan "should take more responsibility for defending its land."</p>
            <p>Kissinger became National Security Advisor in 1969 when Richard Nixon was president. In September 1973, he also became Secretary of State. After Nixon left office in 1974, Kissinger stayed in both jobs under President Gerald Ford until November 1975, when he stopped being National Security Advisor. But he continued as Secretary of State until 1977.</p>
            <p>Kissinger was involved in talks about Okinawa returning to Japan. He also helped make decisions about the Diaoyutai Islands.</p>
            <p>He helped Nixon visit Beijing in 1972 and worked for the US to start official relations with China in 1979. However, he disagreed with Japan on textile trade issues and kept a distance from Japan.</p>
            <p>Kissinger passed away in November 2023. He was 100 years old.</p>

            <h1>Dadaocheng International Arts Festival Starts in October, Costume Parade Invites Everyone to Have Fun</h1>
            <p>A costume party that goes back 100 years will return to Dadaocheng in Taipei. The 2025 Dadaocheng International Arts Festival will begin in October. Every year, many people join the "1920s Costume Event." This year, local businesses have even formed their own bands to join in, inviting everyone to have fun together.</p>
            <p>The theme for the 2025 Dadaocheng International Arts Festival is "The Age of Acceleration." It tries to respond to the fast changes happening in the world today. The festival's opening press conference happened today. Chou Yi-cheng, who started the festival, said that art is not just a mirror that shows what is happening. It is also a powerful tool for thinking critically and getting new ideas. "In this age of acceleration, we face both challenges and new chances. Art is an important power that helps us move forward," he said.</p>
            <p>The Dadaocheng International Arts Festival will last for one month. This year's events include a dance competition for new talents, discussions on many topics, performances by artists from different countries, and local neighborhood activities. The festival focuses on connecting with the local area. For example, Dadaocheng is famous for its textile industry. A group called the "Taipei High School Team," made up of students from several Taipei high schools, created an online game called "Circular Textile Battle." They joined the festival by linking the industry to the festival's theme. This helps people learn more about clothes made from sustainable materials.</p>
            <p>There will also be the "1920s Costume Parade," which is popular every year. It invites people to dress up and go back to the 1920s. Weng Yu-ching, the festival's production director, said that this year, the parade will start from five different routes and meet at Yongle Square. The main stage will have many exciting performances. For example, Hsieh Hsiao-hui, the chairperson of Huangjia, who recently went to the International Fabrics and Accessories Exhibition in Paris, will lead her own band to perform.</p>
            <p>Minister of Environment, Peng Chi-ming, came to support the event today. He used the example of many places in Taiwan facing typhoons one after another. He said that extreme weather can also be seen as part of "the age of acceleration." The Dadaocheng International Arts Festival combines many activities with sustainability. A culture of sustainability will be the start of all changes. He hopes for more cooperation in the future.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Dadaocheng International Arts Festival will take place from October 1st to October 31st.</p>
