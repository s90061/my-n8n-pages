            <h1>Ministry of Finance: 60% of Taiwan's Companies Survive for 5 Years; 1% Showed High Growth in 2023</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance's newest report on businesses shows that about 1% of active businesses in 2023 grew a lot. This means their sales or number of workers grew more than 20% for three years in a row, with a total growth of 72.8%. Most of these fast-growing companies (90%) are businesses that earn more than NT$10 million a year and pay taxes automatically.</p>
            <p>Compared to information from other countries, the Ministry of Finance says that Taiwan has fewer new businesses starting and fewer businesses closing. For the first year, more than 80% of companies in Taiwan, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand stay open. After five years, Taiwan has a higher survival rate of 60%.</p>
            <p>In September, the Ministry of Finance released a report called "Building Taiwan's Business Dynamics Statistics from Tax Data." It follows rules from the EU and OECD. This report uses information about company sales and the number of employees. It looks at all tax records to find active businesses and then calculates four things: how many new businesses start, how many close, how many survive, and how many grow a lot.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance explains that an active business is one that had sales or hired workers during the year. When we talk about businesses starting or closing, we mean the number of new active businesses each year and the number of active businesses that disappear. If a business is active for two years in a row, it is considered to have survived.</p>
            <p>Statistics from the Ministry of Finance show that each year, between 6.5% and 7.2% of businesses are new, and between 5.4% and 5.7% close down. Companies with smaller sales and businesses owned by one person have higher rates of starting and closing than the average. This is especially true for companies that earn less than NT$500,000 a year, where 17.1% are new and 18.1% close. These rates are about three times higher than the average. Also, businesses owned by partners have a higher closing rate than average.</p>
            <p>Looking at how starting and closing rates differ among industries, the Ministry of Finance explains that manufacturing, transport, and storage industries have low rates of starting and closing. This is because they need to invest in expensive machines. The electricity and gas supply industry has a high starting rate and a low closing rate because of energy policies. Online shopping and food service industries have the most new businesses starting and closing.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance says that the number of businesses that close each year is getting smaller and more steady. It went from 10% in the first two years to 4.9% in the fifth year. This shows that businesses become stronger after facing market challenges. About 40% of businesses that start close within five years. More than half of these close in the first two years. This highlights that the first two years are very important for a new business.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance says that how long businesses survive depends on how the industry develops. For example, in the electricity and gas supply industry, helped by energy policies, 80% of businesses survive for five years. However, in the accommodation and catering industry, because of strong competition, and in the arts, entertainment, and recreation services industry, partly due to claw machine shops, the five-year survival rates are lower, at 55% and 41% respectively.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance observed that in 2023, about 1% of all active businesses were high-growth companies. 90% of these were companies that earned more than NT$10 million a year and used the automatic tax payment system. The percentage of high-growth companies is directly related to their sales. Companies earning more than NT$10 million but less than NT$100 million were three times the average, at 3.1%. Companies earning over NT$100 million were 13 times the average, at 13.4%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance added that these high-growth companies were mainly in industries affected by big events or short-term supply and demand issues. For example, shipping companies did well in 2021 and 2022 because of port delays. In 2023, banks and travel services grew a lot due to higher interest rates and people traveling more after the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Compared to international data, the Ministry of Finance explained that Taiwan's business starting and closing rates are quite low. This is due to things like how tax data is collected and differences in industries. Taiwan's rates are only 60% of the EU average (10.5% for starting, 8.7% for closing) and also lower than South Korea. The percentage of high-growth companies is also lower than the EU average of 9.2%, but higher than South Korea (0.1%). The survival rate for businesses in their first year in Taiwan is similar to Australia, the UK, and New Zealand, all over 80%. Taiwan has a higher five-year survival rate, at 60%.</p>

            <h1>TSMC Leads Taiwan Stocks Higher, New Taiwan Dollar Also Rises Past NT$30.1</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market continued to rise, which made the New Taiwan dollar stronger. Today, the New Taiwan dollar started at 30.21 against the US dollar. As Taiwan's stocks went up, the New Taiwan dollar also gained more value. It went up by more than 0.1 NT dollars, reaching as high as 30.119. This means it is back above 30.1 and slowly moving towards 30.</p>
            <p>TSMC, a very important company, paid out NT$5 per share today. Right after the market opened, its stock price quickly went up to cover this payout. In the morning, TSMC's stock reached a new high of NT$1280. This helped Taiwan's stock market go up by over 200 points in the morning, reaching 25623 points, which is a new record.</p>
            <p>The strong stock market caused more money to flow into Taiwan. The New Taiwan dollar started at 30.21 against the US dollar today. With the stock market doing well and more money coming in, its value increased. It reached a high of 30.119, gaining 0.109 NT dollars.</p>
