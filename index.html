Many people travel during the summer holidays and need a place for their pets. The Taipei Animal Protection Office said today that pet owners should choose legal businesses with special permits to ensure their pets are well cared for. The office's website lists 183 legal businesses and their latest reviews.

The Animal Protection Office shared that if you need to board your pet, you should pick a legal business. These places are checked yearly by the government. They also have staff who studied animal care or had special training, so your pets will be safe.

The office reminded people that some online platforms for pet services don't check if businesses are legal, which can cause problems. Also, if you see ads for home-based pet hotels or pet sitters online, check if they have a permit number. If not, they might be operating illegally.

The office also received reports that some businesses offer free pet boarding but then charge extra for food or other things. If a business charges illegally for pet boarding, they can be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$3,000,000.

**Young Shot Putter Jiang Jing-yuan Hopes for a Medal at Universiade**

Jiang Jing-yuan, an 18-year-old Taiwanese shot put athlete, will wear the national team uniform for the first time at the Universiade. She feels confident and said after the team's flag ceremony today that she hopes to perform well and win a medal.

Taiwan has never won a medal in women's throwing events at the Universiade. The closest was last time, when Yu Ya-chien finished fourth in the hammer throw.

In May this year, Jiang Jing-yuan set a new national record in shot put with a throw of 17.83 meters at a track and field competition in Shizuoka. After that, she won a bronze medal at the Asian Athletics Championships in Korea. She has been doing very well this year.

Jiang Jing-yuan told CNA, "This is my first time at the Universiade. I'm very excited. It's my first big competition for adults after turning 18. I'm also excited to compete against good athletes from other countries."

She also said that her training has become more stable in the past few months. "After competing in the National High School Games, Asian Championships, and Taiwan International Athletics Open this year, I know what I need to improve. My goal now is to get a good score in my first three throws on the field."

With her famous smile, she added that she doesn't have a specific goal for her score, "but I hope to stand on the podium and win a medal for Taiwan."

**Jensen Huang to Visit China; Nvidia Plans New Chip for China in September**

Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, plans to visit China soon. The Financial Times reported that Nvidia plans to release a new AI chip designed for China as early as September. This chip is a changed version of Nvidia's current RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell processor, made to follow stricter US export rules.

The Financial Times reported on July 10 that this new chip for China will not have the most advanced features, like high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and NVLink, which helps send data faster.

Sources close to the matter said the chip won't be sold before September. Nvidia wants to make sure the US government agrees that the chip follows new export rules and won't be banned soon after it's released. The chip's details might change depending on what Nvidia discusses with Washington.

Sources also said that Nvidia's Chinese customers have been testing samples of the chip and want to order many of them.

The report noted that even though this chip might not be as powerful as some Chinese rivals' best products, customers still want to buy it. This is because it would be very expensive for them to switch from Nvidia's Cuda software system to other systems.

The report stated that the demand for this chip is not expected to be as high as for Nvidia's H20 chip. In April this year, US government export rules stopped the less powerful H20 chip from being sold in China, causing Nvidia to lose up to US$5.5 billion (about NT$165.9 billion).

Sources also mentioned that Chinese customers are becoming worried about relying too much on Nvidia products because of unsure US policies. Leading AI companies like Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencent have been testing other chips made in China.

The report said that for Nvidia to launch new products in China and deliver them regularly, they need to have a lot of chips ready. If export rules remain unclear, it could be a financial risk for Nvidia.

China is currently Nvidia's fourth-largest market. A spokesperson for Nvidia did not comment on the new AI chip for China.

The Financial Times also reported that Jensen Huang plans to meet with Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Vice Premier He Lifeng during his visit. He will also attend the China International Supply Chain Expo in Beijing from July 16 to 20.
