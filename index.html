Taiwan's central bank has warned that the United States' rapidly increasing national debt could affect global trust in U.S. Treasury bonds. This concern was highlighted in a report by the central bank, noting that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important for global finance, the continued accumulation of debt could pose risks. Taiwan, holding over 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasuries, is closely watching these developments. The central bank emphasized that this situation raises questions about the debt's long-term sustainability and its potential impact on international financial markets.

**Stock Market Today: S&P 500, Nasdaq Fall Amid Geopolitical and Economic Concerns**

U.S. stocks mostly declined on Friday as investors reacted to various global developments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight increase of nearly 0.08%, but the S&P 500 slipped about 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%. Traders are weighing the possibility of direct U.S. military involvement in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, now in its second week.
Chip stocks also declined following reports that the U.S. might revoke waivers for some semiconductor firms. Inflation concerns remain a major focus, as the Producer Price Index (PPI) showed that wholesale prices in May increased more than expected. These factors are leading strategists to reduce their predictions for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with markets now expecting only one 25-basis-point cut this year.

**Taiwan Adds Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List, Impacting China's AI Chip Ambitions**

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has officially added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list. This move is seen as a significant blow to China's ambitions in artificial intelligence chip development. The decision reflects ongoing global tensions and restrictions related to trade and technology, particularly concerning advanced semiconductors.
This action further aligns Taiwan with Washington's efforts to limit companies that are advancing Beijingâ€™s AI capabilities. While not a direct response to a single event, the discovery of TSMC-made chips in Huawei products last year prompted Taiwan to re-examine its oversight mechanisms to prevent indirect supply chain loopholes. This highlights increasing trade and technology tensions between Taiwan, China, and the United States.
