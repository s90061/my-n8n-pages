            <h1>Tibetan Youth Singer Detained by China for Praising Dalai Lama</h1>
            <p>The Tibetan government-in-exile is in India. They said that a young Tibetan singer and activist named Asang, who is in his twenties, was taken by Chinese authorities. This happened after he sang a song called "Prince of Peace," which praised the Dalai Lama, who is the spiritual leader of Tibet. Nobody knows where Asang is now.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Voice of Tibet says that the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), which is the Tibetan government-in-exile, made a statement yesterday. They said that a Tibetan singer named Tzukte, also known as Asang, was taken by Chinese authorities in early July. This was after he sang a song that praised the Dalai Lama. The song was called "Prince of Peace."</p>
            <p>Asang is about 20 years old. He is a student of Gebe, who is a famous Tibetan singer.</p>
            <p>The Tibetan government-in-exile said that taking Asang is part of a bigger effort by Beijing to silence Tibetan voices. This especially affects Tibetan artists and writers.</p>
            <p>Chinese authorities did not answer AFP's request for comment.</p>
            <p>The Tibetan government-in-exile also said that Asang was held but was not accused of any crime. Also, no one knows where he is being held. They said this goes against international rules for human rights. It also shows that China continues to stop Tibetans from having freedom of speech, cultural rights, and religious beliefs.</p>

            <h1>Traffic Interrupted in Nanè¿´ Line Between Dawu and Longxi Due to Tunnel Flooding; TRA Estimates Resumption at 7 PM</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) reported today that the electric system in the Dawu Tunnel on the Nanè¿´ Line stopped working. This happened because water flowed into the tunnel. Because of this, trains cannot run between Dawu and Longxi. The train stations in Dawu, Longxi, and Taitung are very crowded. Buses are now taking people instead of trains. The TRA expects trains to start running again by 7 PM tonight. A woman named Wang, who was going home to vote, faced train delays twice in seven days.</p>
            <p>Today at noon, the TRA suddenly announced at Taitung and Dawu train stations that the railway between Dawu and Longxi stations would be closed from 12:40 PM. This caused delays for trains going in both directions.</p>
            <p>At that time, some trains were already at Longxi and Dawu stations. They stopped on the platforms for almost an hour. The trains did not tell people why they stopped, which made people upset. Many people who had gone home to vote were ready to take the train back to work. When they arrived at Taitung train station, they found out that the trains were not running. They did not know what to do.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang, who was going back to Jiayi, said she was very surprised when she got to Taitung train station. It was full of people. She asked and learned that the trains were not running. She said, "I didn't expect this to happen twice in one week." She explained that on Monday (July 21st), she wanted to take a train back to work in Jiayi around 5 AM. But the train stopped at Jinlun because heavy rain had flooded the tracks. The train had to go back to Taitung station and did not start running again until about 6 PM that evening.</p>
            <p>She said she went home to vote yesterday, and today she was going back to work in Jiayi. But the trains were not running again. She also said that TRA did not announce this online.</p>
            <p>The TRA said in a message to media that at 12:40 PM today, Dawu station reported that electric trains could not run between Dawu and Longxi. The line was closed, and power was cut. A vehicle for power repair came from Dawu to check and fix the problem.</p>
            <p>TRA said that they found a lot of water leaking from the top of the Dawu Tunnel on the Nanè¿´ Line. This caused a short circuit in the electric rails, which made the power go out. The engineering and power teams in Taitung immediately sent workers, machines, and materials to fix it. They expect to fix the power and finish repairs by around 7 PM tonight.</p>
            <p>The TRA said that they created a first-level emergency team at 1:30 PM. They also made smaller teams for the southern and eastern areas. At the same time, they started using buses to move people by road. They also sent diesel trains to pull other trains. This is to keep trains running between Dawu and Longxi, where the power is off.</p>
