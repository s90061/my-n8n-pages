            <h1>New Taipei City Official Suspected of Leaking Personal Data for Money, Detained</h1>
            <p>Prosecutors in Taipei are looking into a fraud case. They found that a land agent, Mr. Cai Shang-yue, worked with a lawyer, Mr. Cai Hong-shen, and also police officers, court clerks, and local leaders. They are accused of using fake wills to trick lonely old people and steal their inheritances, totaling over 140 million New Taiwan Dollars. After the case went to court, Mr. Cai Shang-yue was sentenced to 14 years in prison, and Mr. Cai Hong-shen to 25 years. The case is currently being reviewed by a higher court.</p>
            <p>While investigating this case, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office found that a household registration officer named Ms. Wang, who works at the Xindian Household Registration Office, took bribes. From 2014 to 2024, she allegedly received millions of New Taiwan Dollars from several companies that develop land and update cities. She used her position to help these companies find information about property owners and their heirs. She is being investigated for breaking anti-corruption laws by taking bribes for doing illegal things and also for breaking personal data protection laws.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, prosecutors ordered the Taipei City Investigation Office to search 20 places, including Ms. Wang's office and various construction companies. They also called 14 people, including Ms. Wang and the involved business owners, to answer questions.</p>
            <p>After questioning them all night, prosecutors believed Ms. Wang was very likely guilty. They also thought she might try to work with others to hide evidence or run away. So, early this morning, they asked the court to keep her in custody and not allow her to meet anyone. The business owners involved were released after paying bail ranging from 60,000 to 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Farmers Delegation Signs Agreement with Indiana State Due to More Demand for US Farm Products</h1>
            <p>A group of farmers from Taiwan signed a letter of intent with Indiana State in the United States today. This agreement is for buying soybeans and corn. Mr. Du Wen-chen, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture in Taiwan, said that this year's farming group is the largest ever, and they plan to buy more goods. This shows that Taiwan needs more agricultural products from the U.S. Governor Mike Braun of Indiana said that signing this agreement is good for both sides.</p>
            <p>Mr. Du Wen-chen, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Lei Yen-feng, the Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago, and other members of the Taiwan farming delegation attended the signing ceremony. It took place at the Indiana State House of Representatives. Mr. Hong Yao-kun, the head of Taiwan's Vegetable Oil Refining Industry Association, and Mr. Yang Jie, a director from the Feed Industry Association, signed agreements. They signed with the heads of the Indiana Soybean Alliance and the Indiana Corn Marketing Council to buy soybeans and corn from the U.S.</p>
            <p>Many important people were there, including Indiana Governor Mike Braun, Lieutenant Governor Micah Backwith, U.S. Congressman Jefferson Shreve, Secretary of State Diego Morales, Secretary of Commerce David Adams, Treasurer Daniel Elliott, Secretary of Agriculture Don Lamb, West Lafayette Mayor Erin Easter, and co-chairs and many members of the Indiana House and Senate's Taiwan Friendship Caucus.</p>
            <p>Governor Braun said that the trade relationship between Taiwan and Indiana is strong and important. He thanked the delegation for making their friendship even stronger and improving trade between them. He also mentioned that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will open an office in Indiana, which shows how important Indiana is for U.S. agriculture. He said the agreement between Taiwan and Indiana is a win-win situation.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Governor Backwith pointed out that Taiwan and Indiana are sister states, meaning they share similar values and interests. He said that agricultural trade between them helps to make the U.S. more secure and protects American farmers from outside threats. This is very important for national safety.</p>
            <p>Deputy Minister Du Wen-chen stated that Taiwan has sent farming delegations many times since 1998. This year's group is the biggest, and they are buying more products, which shows that Taiwan needs more agricultural products from the U.S. He said this trip shows the deep friendship with Indiana, Taiwan's first sister state. Both sides believe in sustainable farming, protecting the environment, and growing good quality farm products.</p>
            <p>Director-General Lei Yen-feng said that this year marks 46 years since the Taiwan Relations Act became law. Taiwan and the U.S. have a strong partnership that helps each other, and they share common values and interests like freedom and wealth. In 2024, Taiwan's investments in the U.S. grew by almost 40%, and trade between them is strong. Academic and scientific exchanges between Taiwan and the U.S. continue to grow. He added that the relationship between Taiwan and Indiana is growing a lot in many ways.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago held a welcome party on the evening of September 24th. Indiana government officials were there, as well as co-chairs and members of the Indiana House and Senate's Taiwan Friendship Caucus, including Daryl Schmitt, Ryan Lauer, David Abbott, and Beau Baird. They gave the delegation House Resolution No. 40, which shows that both political parties in Indiana support the farming partnership and the sister-state relationship between Taiwan and Indiana. This helps to make the agricultural trade partnership between Taiwan and the U.S. even stronger.</p>

            <h1>Before Cleaning Up After the Hualien Disaster, Take Photos and Sort Trash</h1>
            <p>In Hualien, the Matian River formed a landslide dam and then overflowed, causing a lot of damage to homes in the Guangfu area. After the water went down, people started cleaning their homes. The Hualien County Government reminds everyone that they must take photos of their damaged property, including how high the water or mud reached. This will help them apply for money later. They also need to sort their trash when cleaning.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Jia-fu, the Director of the Social Affairs Department in Hualien County, told the Central News Agency that before people clean their homes, they must keep proof of the damage. They should use a tape measure or something similar to mark and photograph the height of the floodwater or mud. They also need to take pictures of any damage to their houses and broken appliances or furniture. If they have receipts for these items, they can use them to apply for government help in the future.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government said that there isn't a clear system for compensation right now, but different government groups like the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the National Land Management Agency, foundations, or special loans might offer help. No matter which group helps, people will need to provide proof to get their applications approved faster.</p>
            <p>Also, as people go back to clean their homes, the Hualien County Environmental Protection Bureau asks everyone to sort their trash. This is because the Guangfu landfill was damaged and is now closed. They have worked with Taiwan Sugar Corporation to find a temporary place to put the trash.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government also stated that cars washed onto the streets by the flood will be moved to the parking lot of the Danongdafu Forest Park. This is being done according to the "Disaster Prevention and Relief Act" to keep traffic flowing smoothly.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Environmental Protection Bureau said that people can put large furniture, mud, and other trash separately on the side of the road. They should then register with their village chief. The Environmental Protection Bureau will arrange for vehicles to pick up the trash. After most of the trash is collected, the military will come to clean and disinfect the area.</p>
