            <h1>Hsinchu County Yimin Creative Exhibition Opens, 12 Schools Show Painted Pig Art to Pass on Culture</h1>
            <p>The "Yimin Creative Exhibition" for the Yimin Festival in Hsinchu County started today. It shows painted pig artworks made by 12 elementary schools. Deputy County Magistrate Chen Chien-hsien came to the opening. He said he hopes this event will help children learn about the loyal and brave spirit of Yimin heroes. He also hopes it will help pass on traditional culture to younger generations.</p>
            <p>The 2025 National Yimin Festival is happening in Hsinchu County. Before this, the Hsinchu County Government Cultural Affairs Bureau held a painted pig competition. Twelve schools took part, and they sent in 208 artworks. Today, a hundred of these creative painted pigs are on display. Their cute look caught the attention of many people.</p>
            <p>Chen Chien-hsien said that this year marks the 237th anniversary of the Yimin Temple. The county government also organized many events before the Yimin Festival. Through the painted pigs, children can learn about the meaning and history of the Yimin Festival, which helps keep the traditional culture alive.</p>
            <p>Chiu Hsing-wei, the Deputy Minister of the Hakka Affairs Council, explained that the Yimin Festival is a special Hakka culture. It shows the strong spirit of the Hakka people. The festival includes activities like offering food, using holy pigs, and floating water lanterns. The Hakka Affairs Council will continue to support the Yimin Festival in Hsinchu County to help pass on Hakka culture.</p>
            <p>Chu Shu-min, the Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, said that for this year's painted pig competition, the Cultural Affairs Bureau gave plain pig models. They asked elementary schools in the county to take them and create art. This helps promote the Yimin Festival activities and its meaning.</p>

            <h1>China's Military Parade Shows Power, Experts Say It Hides Removal of Top Military Leaders</h1>
            <p>Today, Chinese President Xi Jinping led China's biggest military parade ever. He warned the world that it must choose between peace and war. Experts say this parade made the world look at China's modern military equipment. But it also hid the problem of high-ranking military officials being removed from their jobs.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this big event was to remember the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II. Most Western leaders did not come. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who are seen as outcasts by the West because of the Russia-Ukraine war and their nuclear goals, were honored guests.</p>
            <p>The parade aimed to show China's military strength and its influence in the world. At the same time, US President Donald Trump's trade taxes and changing policies were making things more difficult between allies and rivals.</p>
            <p>In Tiananmen Square, Xi Jinping told over 50,000 people, "Today, humanity again faces a choice: peace or war, talking or fighting, win-win or zero-sum." He also said that the Chinese people "firmly stand on the right side of history."</p>
            <p>Wen-Ti Sung, a researcher at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub in Taiwan, said: "Xi Jinping confidently believes the situation has changed. Now China is taking the lead again."</p>
            <p>He added: "When we talk about the main things causing uncertainty in the world, it's about Trump's 'America First' policy, not China's 'wolf warrior' diplomacy."</p>
            <p>In the last two years, more than 10 generals in China's army were removed from their positions in a big fight against corruption. Many of them used to be close to Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Jon Czin, a foreign policy expert at the Brookings Institution in the US, said: "This parade allowed Xi Jinping to make the world focus on China's great progress in modern military equipment. At the same time, it hid the tough problems the army faces, especially the ongoing removal of top leaders."</p>
            <p>CNN reported that today's parade sent a message. It showed that Xi Jinping's idea for a new world order, led by China, will be supported by high-tech weapons. In many ways, these weapons seem better than those of Beijing's competitors.</p>
            <p>CNN also pointed out that the large amount of military equipment shown in the parade proves China's industrial power. This power can support its words and perhaps one day help Xi Jinping achieve his world vision.</p>
            <p>This kind of industrial power was also important when the US won World War II. But now, 80 years later, the US cannot produce weapons in large numbers like China can.</p>
            <p>Malcolm Davis, a senior defense strategy analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said: "What the Chinese are showing here is that they can develop advanced military abilities on their own. Not only can they use them in real fights, but they can do it faster than Western countries."</p>
            <p>He added: "Also, the total number of weapons China has is much larger than other countries. This is truly worrying."</p>

            <h1>AirTAC's August Sales Set New Record for the Month, Sees Small Impact from Tariffs, Demand Slowly Recovering</h1>
            <p>This afternoon, AirTAC-KY, a company that makes pneumatic parts, announced its sales for August. The total sales were NT$2.586 billion. This is 2.35% less than July but 5.92% more than August 2024. It is the lowest sales in six months, but it is still the highest sales for August in the company's history.</p>
            <p>AirTAC-KY said that some of its customers' plans to make more products are still delayed because of matching tariffs (taxes on imports). However, the company still expects that overall market demand will slowly get better.</p>
            <p>AirTAC-KY explained that in August, the amount of new orders was still more than the amount of products shipped. This was better than the company expected. The average value of products shipped each day was also higher than in July and August of last year. However, because there were fewer working days, August sales were lower than July. But compared to last year, sales still grew well. In August, sales were better for the battery, car, and machine tool industries.</p>
            <p>From January to August this year, AirTAC-KY's total sales were NT$22.285 billion. This is an 8.49% increase compared to the same period last year.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to this year's business, AirTAC-KY said that the Chinese government will continue to provide support policies as needed. Also, the company keeps making new products, making its brand better, and creating sales plans for different industries to get a bigger market share. In addition, sales in the second half of last year were lower, so it is easier to show growth now. Even with some uncertain things happening in the world, AirTAC-KY still has the same good outlook for this year as before.</p>
            <p>At an investor meeting at the end of July, AirTAC-KY said that changes in exchange rates and tariffs would only have a small effect. They believe their pneumatic parts business will grow more than the average for the industry this year. The whole group aims for a growth rate in the low double digits (about 11% to 13%).</p>
