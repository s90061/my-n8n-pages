A recent study by Gallup, in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, highlights a significant global issue: nearly half of the world's adult population believes they do not get enough sleep. This finding comes from surveying people in 116 different countries. The report suggests that insufficient sleep is becoming a widespread problem that affects public health globally. Lack of sleep can lead to various health issues, including problems with heart health, obesity, and even certain types of cancer. It can also cause difficulties with concentration, mood, and overall well-being. Experts say that getting enough good quality sleep is as important for health as eating well and exercising regularly. The study encourages individuals and governments to focus more on improving sleep habits and environments to help people live healthier lives.

**AI's Impact on Jobs: Opportunities and Challenges**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has recently stated that artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to affect a large portion of jobs around the world. According to the IMF, about 60% of jobs in wealthy countries, known as advanced economies, could be influenced by AI. For emerging markets and developing countries, this number is slightly lower, at about 40%. The report explains that AI might either take over some tasks, leading to job losses, or it could work alongside humans, making jobs more efficient and productive. This means some jobs might change, and new jobs might be created. The IMF suggests that governments should prepare for these changes by focusing on education and training programs. These programs would help workers learn new skills needed for future jobs and support those who might lose their current jobs because of AI.

**New Travel Trends for the Year Ahead**

As we move further into the new year, travel experts are noticing some shifts in how people plan their trips. The idea of "revenge travel," where people took many trips after the pandemic, is becoming less common. Instead, travelers are now more interested in sustainability, meaning they want to travel in ways that are better for the environment. This includes choosing eco-friendly transport or supporting local businesses. Another big trend is finding budget-friendly options, as many people are looking for ways to save money while still exploring new places. This could mean choosing less expensive destinations, looking for deals on flights and hotels, or planning shorter trips. Additionally, there's growing interest in unique experiences and deeper cultural immersion, rather than just visiting famous tourist spots. People are seeking more personal and meaningful journeys.
