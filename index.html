Taiwan's weather agency announced this evening that the chance of very strong heavy rain will go down tonight. They will stop the special alert for heavy rain at 5 PM. The agency reminds people that there might still be heavy rain in southern Taiwan tonight. Starting tomorrow morning, central Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu might also have some heavy rain.

The weather agency said that Taiwan was in a low-pressure area today. Strong winds from the southwest brought a lot of moisture, making the weather unstable. During the day, there was a lot of rain in areas south of Chiayi, with very heavy rain in Dawu Township, Taitung County, and Majia Township, Pingtung County. Mountain areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung also had very heavy rain.

The agency said that from tonight until tomorrow morning, a low-pressure area and southwest winds will continue to affect Taiwan. Rain will mostly be in southern Taiwan tonight. From tomorrow morning, rain will spread to central Taiwan and the islands of Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. There is a chance of local heavy rain in these areas. The agency expects the rain to slowly stop starting tonight as the air becomes less wet.

**Chou Yung-chao Becomes Juming Museum Director, Plans Retrospective Exhibition**

The Juming Culture and Education Foundation announced today that Chou Yung-chao will be the new director of the Juming Museum. She has worked in education and art exhibitions in the United States for a long time. She has experience with international museums and a background in art history. One of her main goals is to hold a special exhibition looking back at Ju Ming's artworks.

Chou Yung-chao got her Ph.D. in art history from the University of Kansas. She has lived in the United States for many years and worked at museums such as the San Diego Museum of Art in California, the Peabody Essex Museum in Massachusetts, and the Dayton Art Institute in Ohio. She also taught art history at universities like the University of California, San Diego.

Chou Yung-chao said today through the Juming Culture and Education Foundation that her connection with Ju Ming started when she was a student at the University of Kansas. She was very impressed by Ju Ming's "Tai Chi" artworks shown on campus. In 2017, when she was the head of Asian Art at the San Diego Museum of Art, she talked with the Juming Museum again and felt the strong and charming energy of its outdoor sculpture spaces.

Chou Yung-chao said that taking on the role of director now continues her past connection. She believes she can help the Juming Museum and start new collaborations. For exhibitions, her first task is to organize Ju Ming's artworks and create a "Ju Ming Retrospective Exhibition." This will show his creative journey and how he influenced art in a clear way.

The Juming Museum will also work with the Asia Art Center to show an international modern painting exhibition. This will bring more kinds of art to the museum. Chou Yung-chao said that future exhibitions will focus on three main things. First, they will explore where Ju Ming got his ideas and his spiritual world. Second, they will invite international artists to show their work, helping Taiwanese visitors see more international modern art.

Lastly, the Juming Museum will work more closely with international museums. This will help them share art collections and improve the museum's professional skills. Chou Yung-chao also said that they will publish three books of interviews with Ju Ming in the future. They also plan to make the public space bigger for art exhibitions, so Ju Ming's name can reach more people and his art can have a greater impact.

**BYD Reaches 39% of Sales Goal in First Half of Year; No Price War Hurts Future**

BYD, China's leading car company, sold 2,145,954 cars in the first six months of the year. This is a big increase of 33%. However, their goal for the year is 5.5 million cars, so they only reached 39% of their target in the first half. Because the government has stopped price wars and there is a lot of competition in the market for their main low-to-mid-range cars, it might be hard for BYD to reach their goal.

Chinese news reported that BYD's sales of 2,145,954 cars in the first half of the year seem very good, keeping them as the top car company in China. But, to reach their yearly goal of 5.5 million cars, they only finished about 39%. This means they need to sell about 3.36 million more cars in the second half of the year, which is about 560,000 cars each month.

In June, BYD sold 382,500 cars. This is still nearly 180,000 cars less than the monthly average of 560,000 they need. Also, the sales of their Dynasty/Ocean series, which make up over 90% of their sales, have stayed almost the same for the past three months.

At the end of May, BYD started a price war, offering discounts of up to 34% on 22 models in their Dynasty/Ocean series. But in June, sales did not increase much; instead, they went down by 5,656 cars compared to May.

Reports say that the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers has told car companies not to have "price wars." The government also said it will try to stop unfair competition in the car industry. This means BYD might not be able to lower prices in the second half of the year, which is a big problem for them.

Also, BYD faces very strong competition in the Chinese market. For new energy cars costing around 100,000 Chinese Yuan (about 410,000 New Taiwan Dollars), there are old competitors like Geely and new ones like Leapmotor. Even traditional gas car companies like Dongfeng Nissan and GAC Toyota are entering this market. The competition for sales and performance among car companies will be very tough in the second half of the year.

On the other hand, BYD's overseas sales in the first half of the year went up a lot by 132%, selling over 470,000 cars. If BYD can keep this sales pace in the second half, they might reach their goal of 800,000 overseas sales for the whole year.

Reports say that if BYD's international market keeps growing fast, for example, by exporting over 100,000 cars each month, and if they release new car models in China and increase production, they still have a chance to reach their goal. Most people in the market think BYD's final sales will be between 5 million and 5.5 million cars, close to the goal but maybe not fully reaching it.
