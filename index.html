China's car industry has a lot of competition. To make cars cheaper, companies often paid their suppliers late or asked for lower prices. This made it hard for smaller companies to earn money.

Now, 17 big car companies have promised to pay their suppliers within 60 days. The Chinese government has also opened an online place where suppliers can complain if they are not paid on time. This is to help small and medium-sized businesses.

Some people think this is a good step by the government. Others are not sure if it will really help, as suppliers might be afraid to complain. The government hopes to make things fairer for everyone in the car industry.

**Largan Company Lost Money Because of Currency Exchange**

Largan Precision, a company that makes camera lenses, had a tough second quarter. They lost 4.22 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) because of changes in money exchange rates.

Their profit was much lower this quarter, only 1.032 billion NTD. This is 84% less than last quarter. For each share, they earned only 7.73 NTD, which is a lot less than before.

The company's boss said that the changing currency rates had a big effect on their profits. He also mentioned that if the New Taiwan Dollar gets stronger by 10%, it can reduce their profit by 4 to 5 percent. The company holds half of its money in New Taiwan Dollars and half in US Dollars.
