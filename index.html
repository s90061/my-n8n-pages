            <h1>Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang Issues Sensitive: Thai Arts Centre Gives in to Chinese Pressure, Removes Exhibition Works</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported from Bangkok on August 7th that one of Thailand's main art galleries, the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, changed or removed art pieces from an exhibition. These pieces were about how Beijing treats minority groups and Hong Kong. This happened because China asked them to. Artists said this is another time China has tried to stop criticism from outside its borders.</p>
            <p>The exhibition at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre was called "Constellation of Complicity: Visualising the Global Machinery of Authoritarian Solidarity." It looked at how strict governments in different countries work together across borders. The artworks were made by artists who had to leave their homes in places like Tibet, Xinjiang, Russia, Iran, and Syria.</p>
            <p>Today, Reuters reporters went to the exhibition. They saw that some artworks that were shown in advertisements and photos before were gone. This included a multi-media art piece by an artist from Tibet. Other artworks were changed. Words like "Hong Kong," "Tibet," and "Uighur," or the names of the artists, were covered up.</p>
            <p>Sai, an artist from Myanmar and one of the people who organized the exhibition, said that the show opened on July 24th. Three days later, people from the Chinese embassy, with officials from Bangkok City, came to the exhibition hall. They asked for the exhibition to be stopped.</p>
            <p>Reuters saw an email from the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre dated July 30th. It said: "The Chinese embassy put pressure on us through the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and especially through the Bangkok City Government, which is our main supporter. We were warned that this exhibition could cause diplomatic problems between Thailand and China."</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre also wrote in the email that they "had no choice but to make some changes." This included covering the names of artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and the Uighur region.</p>
            <p>Sai, the organizer, said that later, the Chinese embassy asked them to take down even more artworks. He said these artworks included the Tibetan snow lion flag, the East Turkestan flag of the Uighur people, several postcards showing Chinese President Xi Jinping, and one postcard about the relationship between China and Israel.</p>
            <p>One of the removed artworks was by the Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron. It included a video where Tibetan people held the Palestinian flag and asked for people to be held responsible for genocide. Another video was called "Listen to Indigenous People."</p>
            <p>Reuters reporters saw that the video player showed a black screen at the exhibition. Another video by a Uighur artist was still playing, but the artist's name was covered with black paint.</p>
            <p>Sai said he has left Thailand because Thai police are looking for him. He also shared recent news from his contacts in Bangkok. They told him that Chinese officials returned to the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre yesterday. They asked for a flyer to be removed and repeated that they want Thailand to follow the "One China policy."</p>
            <p>Sai said, "It is sad and ironic that an exhibition about how strict governments work together was censored because of pressure from a strict government. For a long time, Thailand has been a safe place for people who speak out against governments. But this event sends a scary message to all artists and activists who live in exile in this area."</p>

            <h1>Taipei Ranks First as World's Most Desired City to Live In, Beats Singapore in Survey</h1>

In this report, Taipei was named the "world's most desired city to live in," beating other big international cities like Singapore, Sydney, and Berlin.</p>
            <p>Gensler's global survey, "City Pulse 2025: The Magnetic City," collected opinions from 33,000 city residents in 65 cities around the world. It looked at why and where people choose to live.</p>

            <p>According to Gensler's survey, out of 152 factors, the top 5 reasons why people choose to live in a city for a long time are: "I don't get bored in this city," "I feel at home in this city," "I am proud of this city," "This city is becoming better for older people," and "My sense of belonging to the city grows over time."</p>
            <p>In the United States, the top 10 cities where people want to live long-term are: Minneapolis (53%), San Antonio (53%), San Diego (50%), Raleigh (49%), Chicago (47%), Tampa (47%), Portland (47%), Phoenix (46%), San Francisco (46%), and Austin (46%).</p>

            <h1>Singapore's 60th National Day Approaching: PM Wong Says Economic Strategy Needs to Change to Face Challenges</h1>
            <p>Singapore, August 8th â€“ Tomorrow is Singapore's 60th National Day. Tonight, Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong gave a speech. He said that the world's economy still faces big challenges. Singapore's economy is strong right now, but the future is not clear. Singapore needs to change its economic plans to stay competitive. This includes using new technologies like Artificial Intelligence in all parts of its economy.</p>
            <p>Singapore's National Day is on August 9th. It marks 60 years since it became an independent country in 1965. Prime Minister Wong gave his National Day Message tonight. He said that when we look back, we can see how risky the situation was when Singapore became a country. But even with many difficulties, Singapore has built the home it is today.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong pointed out that the world is changing very quickly and in a more serious way. New conflicts are happening all the time, political tensions between countries are getting worse, trade barriers are growing, and countries want to protect their own businesses more. The global system that Singapore has known and relied on for decades is now being greatly affected.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Singapore's ruling party, the People's Action Party, won in most areas and stayed in power. They got more votes than in the 2020 election, showing people clearly supported them. Prime Minister Wong said that Singaporeans clearly chose the team they believe can best lead Singapore through these difficult times. The global economy still has big challenges, and businesses everywhere are putting off their plans for growth and investment. Singapore's economy is strong now, but the future is still uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Singaporean government recently created a group called the Economic Resilience Group, led by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong. Prime Minister Wong said that the government is helping businesses with today's challenges and helping people keep their jobs steady. They are also looking at risks and making plans to be ready for the next wave of changes. Big countries will use all their powerâ€”economic, technological, or politicalâ€”to get what they want. This will put more pressure on small countries like Singapore when they compete.</p>
            <p>He explained that because of this, Singapore must change its economic plans to stay strong in competition. This means actively using new technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence and robot technology. They need to use these effectively in all parts of the economy to help people and businesses fully use these technologies. This will make them more competitive.</p>
            <p>Recently, the new taxes from the United States have been watched by many countries. Since the free trade agreement between Singapore and the U.S. started in 2004, trade between the two countries has grown. The U.S. sells more to Singapore than it buys. Singapore's tax rate on former US President Trump's list of taxes was 10%, which is quite low.</p>
