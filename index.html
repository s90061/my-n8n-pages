            <h1>US Defense Secretary: Military Has Permission to Attack Drug Boats in the Caribbean</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. (Central News Agency) â€“ The US Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said that the US military has all the necessary permission to attack ships in the Caribbean Sea. These ships are thought to be carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hegseth said this in an interview on Fox News Channel today. On October 3, the US military carried out an attack that killed 4 people. This was at least the fourth similar action in recent weeks.</p>
            <p>In his interview on "The Sunday Briefing" show, he said: "We have all the necessary permission. These targets are considered foreign terrorist groups."</p>
            <p>Hegseth and US President Trump have not yet shown clear proof that the targeted ships were actually carrying drugs. Last week, Trump told Congress that he had decided the US was in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug groups. However, he did not provide new legal reasons for this.</p>
            <p>Hegseth stated: "If you are in our area, in the Caribbean Sea, north of Venezuela, and you want to bring drugs to the United States, you will be a target for the US military."</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that the US military's presence in the Caribbean has successfully stopped drug trafficking from South America.</p>
            <p>He told reporters at the White House: "No drugs are entering our waters now. We will think about the next steps."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Hamas Will Be Destroyed If They Don't Give Up Control of Gaza</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. (Central News Agency) â€“ US President Trump recently told CNN that the Palestinian armed group Hamas will be "completely destroyed" if they refuse to give up control of Gaza.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Jake Tapper, a host on CNN, sent a message to Trump asking what would happen if Hamas kept power. Trump replied: "Complete destruction."</p>
            <p>Trump recently talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the situation in Gaza. After that, he released a 20-point peace plan for Gaza.</p>
            <p>In his message to Trump, Tapper mentioned what US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham understood. Graham thought that Hamas refusing to "disarm, keep Gaza under Palestinian control, and link releasing hostages to negotiations" meant they rejected the plan.</p>
            <p>Trump replied, "We will know soon. Time will tell everything." He expects to know soon if Hamas is truly serious about peace.</p>

Then, Yeh Pao-ti hit a three-run home run, which put his team ahead. This was his first career home run in the CPBL, and it won the game for his team. Yeh Pao-ti was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the game.</p>
            <p>The Hawks' starting pitcher, Sakurai Shuto, pitched for 6 innings and allowed 2 runs. He pitched well but did not get the win or loss. The win went to relief pitcher Huang Chun. Relief pitcher Lin Shih-hsiang pitched for 1 inning, striking out 2 batters and not allowing any runs. He got his 30th save of the season.
