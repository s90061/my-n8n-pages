            <h1>Financial Supervisory Commission: Number of warning accounts decreased in September for the first time; demands improved accuracy of AI models</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 13 (CNA) Banks are working to stop fraud. Lawmakers are concerned that some banks' AI models for detecting fraud are too broad. This leads to people's bank accounts being frozen, so they cannot make payments. People then have to visit a bank in person to unfreeze their accounts, which makes them unhappy.</p>
            <p>Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that in September, the number of warning accounts went down for the first time. If a bank's AI detection model is not good enough, the FSC will ask the bank to fix it and make the model more accurate. This will help reduce how often accounts are frozen by mistake.</p>
            <p>The Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan invited Peng Jin-long, the chairman of the FSC, and other leaders from related organizations to report on their work and answer questions today.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers like Yan Kuan-heng, Lee Yen-hsiu, Huang Shan-shan, and Lin Chu-yin all asked about a common problem. Many people shared online that their accounts were frozen when they transferred money to another one of their own accounts, or when small amounts of money were sent to them because they were a group buying leader. Some people only found out their accounts were frozen when they were told they could not make a payment. They hope banks can make their AI detection systems more accurate and inform people when their accounts are frozen.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long explained that there are two types of these accounts. One type is a warning account reported by police to the bank. Banks cannot unfreeze these accounts. If there is a problem, people need to complain to the police. The other type is high-risk accounts that financial institutions can partly freeze after the anti-fraud law was passed last year. This second type has caused some complaints recently.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long said that in 2021, there were about 66,000 warning accounts. About 3,000 new accounts were added each month. At the beginning of this year, there were 150,000 warning accounts. Fraud groups kept using inactive accounts. Financial institutions also continued to take action. In September, the number of warning accounts went down for the first time. In April of this year, only about 10 banks saw a decrease in warning accounts. Now, about 25 banks have seen a decrease, which shows that the controls are working well.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long pointed out that the FSC did not tell companies exactly how to do things. It only asked companies to manage warning accounts. Some banks' AI models froze accounts incorrectly. The FSC immediately talked to these banks and asked them to improve and make their models more precise. The FSC requires every bank to have a 24-hour customer service hotline so people can contact them right away. Banks must also share their experiences with freezing accounts by mistake with other banks. The FSC believes this problem will get better over time.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long stressed that the FSC's decision to stop fraud will not change. He also asked the Bankers Association's anti-fraud committee to discuss and share experiences about accounts frozen by mistake. He hopes this kind of event will not happen again.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Tong Cheng-chang, the head of the FSC's Banking Bureau, explained that banks are now using AI detection to find suspicious accounts early. In September, the number of warning accounts went down for the first time, decreasing by more than 580 accounts in one month. This shows that the controls are generally effective, and management will continue.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers are worried that banks' AI models might be too broad. Tong Cheng-chang explained that if models are not precise, they can bother people. He asked banks to review and improve their models, including making the settings more accurate and the models more effective. If people want to report a problem, banks must set up a good way to handle it and create a special hotline. For simple cases, people can also use online robot systems to unfreeze accounts.</p>
            <p>Tong Cheng-chang explained that freezing an account is a temporary control. Its purpose is to ask users to do KYC (Know Your Customer) again to understand why their money flow has changed. (Editor: Chang Liang-chih) 1141013</p>

            <h1>Controversies in KMT Chairman Election; Lien Sheng-wen Asks Teams Not to Harm the Party</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 13 (CNA) There have been many problems in the Kuomintang (KMT) chairman election. It was reported that outside forces were trying to influence the election. Lien Sheng-wen, the head of the KMT chairman election committee and vice-chairman, said today that he and his father, Lien Chan, were also affected. He asked all campaign teams and their supporters behind the scenes to stop helping in ways that hurt the KMT. He said this only gives the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) more reasons to criticize the KMT, which is actually harming the KMT.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairman election will happen on October 18, and the competition is very intense. Lien Sheng-wen said on Facebook tonight that he has received many questions from party members. They are worried about the problems in the chairman election, for example, that the KMT has never done any internal surveys for the chairman election.</p>
            <p>Lien Sheng-wen explained that the KMT has gone through three big elections in less than four years. If the party had any money left, it would be used to help party workers who are being treated unfairly by the government in court. The party would definitely not spend any money to do surveys for any candidate.</p>
            <p>About the problem of internet trolls trying to influence the election, Lien Sheng-wen said that he and his father, Lien Chan, were also strangely affected by fake messages from fake accounts in this election. However, neither he personally nor the party headquarters has the legal power to investigate this. So, he can only strongly ask all campaign teams and, most importantly, the supporters behind them, to stop using these harmful ways to help the election in the last week before the election. These methods might not help themselves but will definitely hurt the KMT.</p>
            <p>Lien Sheng-wen stressed that these actions only give the DPP more reasons to criticize the KMT in the future. He said it is actually harming the KMT. At the same time, he also asked that even if people have doubts, if there is no strong proof, they should not blame other groups. This is to avoid problems within the party after the election.</p>
            <p>Lien Sheng-wen believes that after two general elections and one important recall vote in less than four years, the KMT faces even more serious problems for its survival. He found it amusing and difficult to understand that some media talked about the challenges the KMT faces in a very light way, as if they were simple. He said this is like saying, "watching others drink hot water, but not feeling the burn yourself."</p>
            <p>Lien Sheng-wen mentioned that some important issues for the KMT, like cooperation between the KMT and Taiwan People's Party, can be dealt with on the second day after the chairman is elected. Cross-strait policy can be dealt with on the third day after taking office. Nominations for the local elections can even wait until one month after taking office. However, the problem of survival is a challenge that the next party chairman will face from the very first second they take office.</p>
            <p>Lien Sheng-wen said that as a volunteer who has worked hard for the KMT for four years, he again sincerely asks all candidates to guide all party members and the public who care about the KMT. He wants them to say what real actions they will take to lead the KMT out of trouble and bring back its glory. (Editors: Su Lung-chi, Chang Jo-yao) 1141013</p>

            <h1>Czech President Welcomes New Ambassadors, Deepening Diplomatic Ties with Many Countries</h1>
            <p>Prague, October 13 (CNA) Petr Pavel, the President of the Czech Republic, recently met with new ambassadors from many countries at Prague Castle. He personally accepted their official documents. These ambassadors are from Germany, Sweden, Norway, Brazil, Cyprus, and Yemen. A CNA reporter was invited to watch this important diplomatic event.</p>
            <p>"Letters of Credence" are official documents signed by a country's leader, like a president or king, when they send an ambassador to another country. These documents introduce and give the ambassador the power to handle diplomatic matters for their country. They show that the ambassador has official diplomatic power and ask the leader of the receiving country to recognize and trust them.</p>
            <p>The ceremony for presenting these documents took place in the Throne Hall inside Prague Castle. The Throne Hall is a very important place for ceremonies in the Czech Republic. The president often uses this hall for important official duties. Besides accepting documents from ambassadors, the president also appoints government officials, generals, judges, and university rectors here.</p>
            <p>The inside of the Throne Hall is very beautiful. The paintings and carpets show art and skill from hundreds of years ago. The most noticeable thing is a historical painting called "The Coronation of Ferdinand V as King of Bohemia in St. Vitus Cathedral, Prague, in 1836." This painting shows the long history of royal power and culture in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Peter Matthias Reuss, the new German Ambassador to the Czech Republic, told President Pavel when he presented his documents: "It is a great honor for me to be the Ambassador to the Czech Republic. Our cultures are very close, and we share the same democratic values. The relationship between our two countries is very good. As an ambassador, I hope to make these relationships even stronger."</p>
            <p>Reuss also said that too few Germans are learning Czech, and this is something that should be improved. Also, in the future, he plans to work with local politicians and community groups, not just with the government.</p>
            <p>Besides the new German ambassador, other ambassadors who presented their documents were SnÃ¶frid ByrlÃ¸kken Emterud from Norway, HÃ¥kan Jevrell from Sweden, Orlando Leite Ribeiro from Brazil, Aliki PaschaliovÃ¡ from Cyprus, and Muhammad AbdallÃ¡h HazramÃ­ from Yemen.</p>
            <p>The ceremony for presenting the documents was done in groups. President Pavel will accept the documents from ambassadors of Israel, Liechtenstein, Bangladesh, and Montenegro later this afternoon. With these new ambassadors officially starting their work, it is expected that the Czech Republic's interactions with various countries will become deeper, and two-way cooperation will continue to grow.
