            <h1>Trump Changes Stance After US-Russia Meeting, Pushes for Russia-Ukraine Peace Deal Instead of Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>After a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump changed his mind about a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war. He now believes that a direct peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine is the way to end the war. American media say that Trump's view is the same as Putin's, which is different from Europe's allies.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. Yesterday, Trump and Putin met in Alaska to talk about the war. This was the first time that the current leaders of the US and Russia met since 2021. After the meeting, Trump held a press conference with Putin. He said they agreed on many things, but they did not make a final deal.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that Ukraine and Russia should make a direct peace agreement. He no longer asked for a ceasefire. The Washington Post reported that this big change happened just a few hours after the meeting. This made Trump's view the same as Putin's.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post also said that Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, with support from European leaders, always said that a ceasefire must happen first before any talks about ending the war can start. Before the US-Russia meeting, European officials were a little hopeful. They thought that America was starting to agree with them after Trump had pushed for a ceasefire before.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting in Alaska, French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week that Trump had told Europe he wanted a ceasefire. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also said that a ceasefire should be the first step for talks.</p>
            <p>But after meeting Putin, Trump changed his mind. He wrote on his social media "Truth Social" that "everyone thinks the best way to end this terrible war between Russia and Ukraine is to make a direct peace agreement. This will truly end the war, not just a ceasefire, because ceasefires often don't last."</p>
            <p>Putin has always said no to calls for a ceasefire. He insists on long talks to reach a final peace agreement. But Ukraine and its European allies believe this is just Russia's way to delay things and keep the land they have taken.</p>
            <p>After the US-Russia meeting, Trump quickly called Zelenskyy and European leaders to tell them about the talks. Trump told Fox News that he and Putin agreed that the Russia-Ukraine war would end with exchanging land and the US giving some kind of safety promise.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post, citing two people who know about the talks, said that Trump told Zelenskyy that Putin asked Ukraine to give all of the Donbas region to Russia. This is in addition to other land Russia has already taken. In return, Russia would promise to end the war.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy is expected to visit the White House on August 18th to meet Trump. Trump said that if things go well, "we will then set up a meeting with President Putin."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Zelenskyy also said on social media that he supports future talks between the US, Ukraine, and Russia. He believes that only direct talks between leaders can deal with important issues like a country's power and land.</p>

            <h1>Putin Reportedly Asks Ukraine to Leave Two Eastern Regions, Willing to Freeze Other Front Lines in Exchange</h1>
            <p>The Financial Times and other news sources from the UK have reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin wants Ukraine to leave the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. This is his condition to end the war. He also told US President Donald Trump that he would stop fighting on other front lines if Russia's main demands are met.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times reported that four people who knew about the meeting said Putin made these demands yesterday when he met Trump in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump called Ukraine's President Zelenskyy and several European leaders to share Putin's message.</p>
            <p>Reuters, Agence France-Presse (AFP), and Bloomberg News also reported on this, citing their own sources.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times said that parts of Donetsk and Luhansk have been controlled by Russia for over 10 years. If Ukraine agrees to leave, Russia will fully control all the land in these two regions.</p>
            <p>Three people who know about the Trump-Putin meeting said that in exchange, Putin stated he would stop fighting on the front lines in Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. He would not launch new attacks to take more land.</p>
            <p>Putin clearly said that he has not given up his main demands to "solve the basic reasons for the conflict." These demands would mostly end Ukraine's current form as a country and stop NATO from growing eastward.</p>
            <p>According to a former high-ranking official from the Kremlin, Putin is also ready to make compromises on other issues, including land, if these "basic reasons" are settled in a way that he likes.</p>
            <p>About 70% of Donetsk is controlled by Russian forces. However, a group of cities in its western part are still controlled by Ukraine. These cities are very important for Ukraine's military actions and defense in the east. For Luhansk, almost all of it is held by Russian forces, except for a small part in the far west still controlled by Ukraine.</p>
            <p>People who know Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian leader will not agree to give up Donetsk. But he is open to talking about land issues with Trump. Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump in Washington on August 18th.</p>
            <p>The White House did not answer the Financial Times' request for comments about the details of the Trump-Putin meeting.</p>

            <h1>German Chancellor Supports US Security Promise to Ukraine, Suggests US-Russia-Ukraine Talks in Europe</h1>
            <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said today that the US is ready to be part of promising safety for Ukraine. He also said that US President Donald Trump's idea of a three-way meeting between the US, Russia, and Ukraine could happen in Europe. The goal of this meeting would be to make a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Reuters and Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that after US President Donald Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska yesterday, he spoke with Merz and other European leaders about the meeting.</p>
            <p>Merz later told the state-owned German TV channel ZDF, "The good news is that the United States is ready to be part of these safety promises for Ukraine, instead of leaving Europe to do it alone."</p>
            <p>Merz said that Ukraine's President Zelenskyy is expected to meet Trump in Washington on August 18th. After that, a three-way meeting between Putin, Trump, and Zelenskyy should happen as soon as possible, aiming to reach a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>He said, "If it works, this will be more valuable than a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>He added that the "date and place for the three-way meeting are not set yet. We have suggested finding a place in Europe."</p>
            <p>At the same time, the leaders of eight Nordic and Baltic countries released a joint statement today. They strongly restated their support for Ukraine and for Trump's diplomatic efforts to end Russia's attack.</p>
            <p>In the statement, the leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said that for peace between Russia and Ukraine, there needs to be a ceasefire and safety promises for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "We are happy to see President Trump's statement that the United States is ready to be part of safety promises. The Ukrainian armed forces and their work with other countries should not be limited in any way."</p>
