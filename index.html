            <h1>Apple's Autumn Event on September 9th Will Show New iPhones and Other Products</h1>
            <p>Today, Apple officially sent invitations to the media for its autumn event. It will happen on September 9th (or 1:00 AM on September 10th, Taiwan time). The company is expected to launch new iPhone models, watches, and other devices.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Apple will hold the autumn event at the Steve Jobs Theater in Apple Park, its headquarters in California. At the event, Apple plans to show how it is adding Artificial Intelligence (AI) to its devices.</p>
            <p>Investors in Apple are watching this event closely. They are worried that Apple might be behind other faster companies in using AI technology.</p>
            <p>Media reports also say that Apple will show a new, thinner iPhone. It might be called the iPhone Air, like the iPad Air and MacBook Air products.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News also reported that Apple is expected to launch new basic and advanced Apple Watch smartwatches. They will also show updated iPad Pro models and a Vision Pro headset that works faster.</p>

            <h1>National Development Council Head Liu Jing-ching: US Chip Taxes Will Not Affect TSMC Much</h1>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching, the head of Taiwan's National Development Council, said in an interview with "Nikkei Asia" on August 25th that TSMC will not be greatly affected. This is true even if the US President Donald Trump's government puts threatening taxes on computer chips.</p>
            <p>The report stated that Liu Jing-ching, who is also a board member for TSMC, explained: "TSMC is investing directly in the United States. So, only 1% of its semiconductor parts are sold directly to the US."</p>
            <p>TSMC is the world's biggest chip maker. It has already built and started operating chip factories in the US. In March, it also announced plans to invest an extra 100 billion US dollars (about 3.056 trillion New Taiwan dollars) in the US.</p>
            <p>When talking about how taxes will affect Taiwanese companies in general, Liu Jing-ching said that "75% of export products are not affected right now." The other 25% are mostly goods like steel and aluminum, which already have extra taxes.</p>
            <p>He also said that Taiwan is talking with the US states where Taiwanese factories are located. They are trying to lower the tax burden for these companies, especially in states like Texas and Arizona, where many semiconductors are made. He hopes that when Taiwanese companies decide to build facilities in the US, they can get tax benefits from the local areas.</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching also talked about a case where an employee of Tokyo Electron (TEL), a Japanese company that used to work with TSMC, was thought to have shared TSMC's business secrets. He said: "The company (TSMC) will decide what to do based on the investigation results."</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching said that Taiwanese companies and Japanese makers of chip-making machines have a strong relationship. He believes "this event will not affect this relationship."</p>
            <p>He also showed interest in bringing talented people from other countries to Taiwan. The National Development Council plans to make it easier to hire graduates from top universities around the world. They also plan to make the current system bigger this year.</p>
            <p>On August 25th, Liu Jing-ching attended the "Taiwan-Japan Innovation Summit" in Tokyo. In his opening speech, he said: "When Taiwanese startup companies grow around the world, Japan is often chosen as the first place." He thinks this is because Taiwan and Japan share many cultural points. He also hopes that startup companies from both Taiwan and Japan can work together more closely.</p>
