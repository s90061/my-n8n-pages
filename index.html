            <h1>Volvo Loses $1.2 Billion Because of US Taxes and Car Delays</h1>
            <p>(Stockholm, July 15, Central News Agency) Volvo, a car company from Sweden owned by China, said it will record a cost of $1.2 billion in the second quarter. This is because of new taxes from the United States and delays in making two of its newest electric cars.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Volvo said in a report to its shareholders yesterday that "It is hard for Volvo's main electric car, the ES90, to make money in the US because of import taxes. These taxes also reduce how much profit it can make in Europe."</p>
            <p>In April this year, US President Trump said there would be a 25% tax on cars brought into the country. This means Volvo faces higher costs and problems when selling new cars in the US.</p>
            <p>Volvo explained that its new car, the EX90, was delayed, and there were extra costs to make it. Also, the ES90 was affected by the taxes. Because of these things, the company had to check its sales predictions for both cars again. As a result, Volvo will record a loss of about $1.2 billion in the second quarter.</p>
            <p>Fredrik Hansson, the chief financial officer, said that the taxes and delays in making the cars mean that these two cars will make less money over their lifetime than they first thought.</p>
            <p>Volvo has factories in many places around the world, like South Carolina in the US, Sweden, and China. Hakan Samuelsson, the CEO, said in April this year that Volvo would make more cars in its US factory. They are also thinking about moving the ES90 production line there.</p>
            <p>Also, at the end of May, Volvo announced that it would cut 3,000 jobs. This is about 15% of its office workers, and almost half of them are in Sweden. (Intern compiler: Chen Che / Editor: Liu Shuqin) July 15, 2025.</p>

            <h1>France's 2025 Report: China's Threat to Taiwan Makes the Region Unsafe</h1>
            <p>(Paris, July 15, Central News Agency) France's "National Strategic Assessment" for this year was released on July 14. It says that Russia is clearly the biggest danger in Europe. China is also called a "real strategic challenge." The report talks many times about Taiwan being in danger. It says that China often does very big military exercises and puts pressure on Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait. China also harms other countries' power in the South China Sea, which makes the area unstable.</p>
            <p>The French Ministry of Defense released its newest "National Strategic Assessment" for 2025. This report was asked for by the country's leader. In it, the Ministry of Defense, national security groups, and the Prime Minister's office worked together. They looked at the newest possible dangers to France's safety and what to do about them.</p>
            <p>The world is getting worse, and there are many small wars in different areas. So, President Emmanuel Macron announced before France's National Day on July 14 that the defense budget should go up by 3.5 billion euros (about 121.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in 2026. It should go up by another 3 billion euros in 2027. This is to protect freedom and fight against "imperialist policies" and "forces that take over." The report being released now has gotten a lot of attention.</p>
            <p>Russia is seen as the biggest threat in Europe. It is showing more and more unfriendliness towards France and its friends by using strong ways to influence others. Not only does the Kremlin have many weapons near Europe's border, but it also uses nuclear threats, controls information, attacks computers, spies, puts foreign people in prison, enters other countries' land, and gets involved in elections.</p>
            <p>Besides Russia, the report also calls China a "real strategic challenge." It says that China is targeting many French lands in the Pacific Ocean. For example, the riots in New Caledonia in 2024 might have been secretly caused by Azerbaijan and China.</p>
            <p>The 2025 National Strategic Assessment writes that in the "Melanesia" area (one of the three big groups of islands in the Pacific), China is focusing on influencing others. It is targeting New Caledonia because of its important location and its nickel.</p>
            <p>France's strategic report also cares about China's threat to Taiwan. The report says that China wants to become the world's strongest power by 2050, when the Chinese Communist Party will be 100 years old. This helps explain why China is doing more and bigger military exercises around Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense wrote that in 2024 and 2025, China has been doing military exercises around Taiwan again and again. These exercises are bigger than ever before. This shows that China's military power is growing faster. "China might also put more pressure on Taiwan without using military force. Because the US is not always clear about its promise to keep its friends and partners in Asia safe, the situation in the region is especially dangerous and unstable."</p>
            <p>China continues to use a "done deal" policy in the South China Sea. It harms other countries' power by "changing the current situation." China is also quickly making new plans that combine its military and people for both regular weapons and nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>The report shows that China is making more nuclear weapons. It is the only country among the permanent members of the UN Security Council and the countries that signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that has not said it will stop making fissile material (materials used for nuclear weapons).</p>
            <p>China continues to make its missiles better. Last year, it tested ballistic missiles 310 times. It also launched an intercontinental ballistic missile from Hainan into the Pacific Ocean. This missile is said to be able to travel 12,000 kilometers. This was mainly a message to Taiwan and the United States.</p>
            <p>The report also highlights how important Taiwan is for the economy and technology. It says that trade and safety issues are now very closely linked. "Because countries depend on each other for important things, we now need to guess the global economic dangers that any possible fight could bring. For example, Taiwan is a very important part of making computer chips."</p>
            <p>The French military says that Beijing is quickly making progress in defense technology, such as quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and space technology. "To keep growing, it is using new kinds of actions that mix different methods, like cyber attacks and taking science and technology from others."</p>
            <p>Also, China has sent its military to Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. It uses economic connections and talks with other countries to create a special relationship called "Clientelism." This helps Beijing and tries to "change how the world is managed."</p>
            <p>The report also mentions that China and Russia are working together. It says this "directly makes Russia stronger in the war between Russia and Ukraine." Beijing and Russia continue to work more closely together in the military. China sees Russia as an important and long-term strategic friend and wants to form a united front with them.</p>
            <p>The report also looked at other dangers to national security, both inside and outside the country. These include people moving to new countries, global warming, getting important raw materials, and unsure relationships across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
            <p>The second main part of the strategic report focuses on goals for 2030. It also gives 11 big plans to deal with problems. These include making nuclear weapons a stronger and more trusted way to stop attacks, preparing the country's mindset for crises, getting the economy ready for war, being strong against cyber attacks, dealing with different types of threats, making decisions about military actions, and improving science and learning to make France more independent.</p>
            <p>The report also suggested starting a "volunteer military service." This would let adults in France get basic military training to create a group of reserve soldiers who can be called to action in times of crisis. This idea has caused a lot of discussion.

            <h1>Shindo Yoshihiko Learned by Himself to Be a Full-Time Creator and Buys Equipment to Work Better</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 15, Central News Agency) Shindo Yoshihiko, who is part Taiwanese and part Japanese, started watching YouTube when he was in the fifth grade of elementary school. He taught himself and followed his dream to become a full-time creator. For the past 6 years, he has worked alone and updated his channel every week. His channel now has more than 370,000 subscribers. He thinks that even though being a YouTuber is busy, it lets him show his own style. When he works alone, he needs to feel sure about his equipment so he can work better.</p>
            <p>Shindo Yoshihiko's YouTube channel has many different kinds of videos. He makes videos about daily life, vlogs, travel, questions and answers for couples, luxury items, and shopping for daily things. He has made over 300 videos, and his channel has 375,000 subscribers. Today, Apple invited him to share his ideas and experiences with the media.</p>
            <p>Thinking back to how he started as a full-time creator, Shindo Yoshihiko said he started watching YouTube in the fifth grade of elementary school. He got ideas and inspiration from other creators' videos. In his second year of high school, he loved dancing and wanted to make videos about it. He went to a professional video studio. Even though it was too expensive for him, it led him to learn video skills by himself.</p>
            <p>Shindo Yoshihiko loves taking photos and videos. At first, he used a MacBook Air laptop and iMovie software to edit videos. If he had a problem, he would look it up on YouTube. Slowly, he learned more skills and ideas. After his channel got more than 100,000 subscribers, he started to work full-time and take on jobs from companies. His equipment also improved to a MacBook Pro and Final Cut Pro software.</p>
            <p>Besides Apple laptops, Shindo Yoshihiko's main computer for editing videos is a Mac Studio desktop computer with an M2 Max chip. It can handle many sound layers during editing without problems, which makes him feel very confident.</p>
            <p>If he needs to work in another country, he will think about how much work he has. Then, he will choose to take a Mac mini with an M4 chip or an M4 MacBook Air. Sometimes, he also takes an M4 iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil Pro and a Magic Keyboard. This helps him draw storyboards easily whenever he needs to.</p>
            <p>Shindo Yoshihiko pointed out that "When you create alone, your equipment is like your assistant. You need to feel confident about your equipment to work." If the equipment works well enough, it can save a lot of time.</p>
            <p>When asked what advice he has for people who want to become full-time creators in the future, Shindo Yoshihiko said that they should be a little ready in their minds because the work can be quite busy. The most important thing is to take the first step. "If you don't take the first step, there will be no next step." Even if the first videos you make don't get many views, it's okay. You can try topics that many people like to first get viewers to your channel. Then, slowly find your own special style to keep your loyal fans. (Editor: Yang Lan-xuan) July 15, 2025.</p>
