            <h1>Yu-chien Tseng Plays Brahms Violin Concerto Again, Says It's Like Running a Marathon</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 25) Violinist Yu-chien Tseng will work with conductor Jaap van Zweden and the Evergreen Symphony Orchestra. They will play Brahms' "Violin Concerto." Mr. Tseng has not played this piece for six years. He said, "This piece is like a marathon for a violinist's body and mind."</p>
            <p>Yu-chien Tseng won a silver medal in the Tchaikovsky International Violin Competition. In an interview with the Central News Agency, he said that Brahms' "Violin Concerto" is a difficult but very lively classic work. He explained that the piece is more than 40 minutes long, and there is no time to rest. "I must focus completely and show strong feelings from the very first note. I cannot relax until the very end," he said.</p>
            <p>To build up his playing strength, Yu-chien Tseng not only practices violin but also swims and exercises in his community building. People living there have even recognized him.</p>
            <p>After several years, Mr. Tseng is playing Brahms' "Violin Concerto" again. He said that playing it after some time helps him understand the music in new ways. He explained that this concerto is special because it is not just a piece of music, but also a conversation. "This is not a piece where only the violin shines. Both the orchestra and the violin are important. They work together to move the music forward. It needs perfect teamwork," he said.</p>
            <p>Yu-chien Tseng pointed out that Brahms' Violin Concerto has a strong musical structure and deep feelings. It requires very precise control of pitch, rhythm, and sound quality. "Not one note is extra," he said. "Because of this, every note must be perfect. Any small mistake will be seen easily. This is both pressure and enjoyment."</p>
            <p>Yu-chien Tseng said, "I like the pure and controlled feeling in Brahms' music. His romantic style is not over-the-top; it is gentle and warm."</p>
            <p>Looking back, Mr. Tseng has played many Brahms sonatas and chamber music pieces over the past few years. He believes that these experiences have helped him understand the composer's spirit better. Yu-chien Tseng said that each performance is like getting to know Brahms again. "Before, I always felt his music was very quiet and distant. But the more I play it, the more I feel that he was actually a very emotional person, but he expressed himself in a deep and hidden way."</p>
            <p>Yu-chien Tseng will work with Jaap van Zweden for the first time. Mr. Tseng said that when he studied in New York, he often listened to the New York Philharmonic. "When I was at the Curtis Institute of Music, Jaap van Zweden was the music director. I was very impressed by how sensitive he was to details, how well he understood the whole piece, and the energy he brought to rehearsals," Yu-chien Tseng said. He is very excited to work with the Evergreen Symphony Orchestra led by Jaap van Zweden.</p>
            <p>The concert "Maestro Jaap van Zweden, Yu-chien Tseng, and ESO" will be held on September 18th and 21st. The location is the National Concert Hall in Taipei. Besides Brahms' Violin Concerto in D major, the program also includes Beethoven's "Egmont" Overture and Brahms' "Symphony No. 1" in the second half.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi City: 36 Parks to Be Cleaned by End of July, Aiming for a Stronger City</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Chiayi City, July 25) Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Chiayi City. Now, all 36 parks, except for Chiayi Park and Metropolitan Forest Park, are expected to be cleaned up by the end of July. At the same time, the city government is also planning to plant new trees, take care of plants, and set up a warning system for future risks. This is to make the city stronger against disasters.</p>
            <p>Chiayi City Government released a press statement today. After Typhoon Danas, roads in Chiayi City were blocked, streetlights were not working, signs fell down, and even roofs of houses were blown away. The city looked very damaged. Because the city has many green areas, the strong winds from the typhoon badly affected the trees along roads and in parks. Many trees fell over.</p>
            <p>The city government said that different departments immediately worked together to check the damage and help. Facing the big job of clearing roads, the city also asked for help from outside. The central government and county governments from different places sent help. Because of this help, Chiayi City was able to clear the main roads and fix traffic lights at important intersections within 5 days after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Min-hui said that Typhoon Danas greatly damaged the city. This also reminded them that a city's progress needs more than just buildings; it also needs to be strong and able to recover. While working hard to fix the damage, the city government also had deep discussions about how to fix green areas and plants. They made clear plans for choosing tree types, growing them, and later improving and caring for planted areas.</p>
            <p>Huang Min-hui said that they hope to use a complete recovery plan. This plan will make all parks and roadside tree systems in Chiayi City stronger and able to last for a long time. They want the warning from this typhoon to help the city become more lasting and strong in the future.</p>
            <p>The city government said that all walking paths in the city's 38 parks are now clear. Chiayi Park and Metropolitan Forest Park are very large and have many trees, so they will take more time to clean up. But the other 36 parks are expected to be fully cleaned up by the end of July.</p>
