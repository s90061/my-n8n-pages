            <h1>True Yoga Fitness Closes Down and Goes Bankrupt; Lawmakers Ask Government to Investigate Possible Illegal Actions</h1>
            <p>True Yoga announced on September 30 that it would stop operating from October 1st. The company will also start the process to close down, dissolve, and go bankrupt. Several lawmakers and city council members held a press conference today. They said that the legal representative of True Yoga left Taiwan in January 2020 and has not returned. They suspect that this person might have run away without caring about customers' rights. They are asking the government to investigate immediately to see if any illegal actions were committed.</p>
            <p>This morning, lawmakers Fan Yun and Wang Mei-hui from the Democratic Progressive Party, along with Taipei City Council members Ho Meng-hua and Miao Po-ya, and New Taipei City Council member Chang Wei-chien, and Taoyuan City Council member Huang Chiung-hui, held a press conference in the Legislative Yuan. The conference was titled "True Yoga Suddenly Closes! Who Will Protect the Rights of Tens of Thousands of Victims?"</p>
            <p>"True Yoga Fitness," a gym chain with many branches across Taiwan, suddenly announced it was closing down. This has harmed the rights of tens of thousands of members and instructors nationwide. A group for victims has quickly grown to over 3,500 people.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun explained that True Yoga was the largest yoga chain in Taiwan. Now that it has suddenly announced its closure, members will find it hard to get back their pre-paid annual fees and class payments. Also, many instructors and employees have been fired and not paid. Many suppliers are also owed money by True Yoga, causing many problems. This situation reminds people of the bad closure of Alexander Fitness. It shows that this is not just one customer problem, but a bigger problem with how the fitness industry is supervised and how consumer protection works. The government department in charge should offer help right away, check on the refund guarantees, and plan legal help for victims and ways to solve work disagreements. This is to protect the rights of tens of thousands of victims.</p>
            <p>Ho Meng-hua said that by law, there is only 210 million NT dollars available in the trust account. However, the total amount of money that customers are trying to get back could be over 420 million NT dollars. Suppliers can only get 50% of their money back. The True Yoga management team has not shown up, and even their refund email cannot be reached. The government should fully review how customers are protected in "pre-paid transactions" to stop them from becoming victims again and again.</p>
            <p>Huang Chiung-hui also stated that the Taoyuan City Government's consumer protection officer should get involved actively. She also asked the Labor Bureau to properly handle the labor disputes involved and protect the basic rights of workers. A harmed supplier complained that True Yoga previously owed them over 2 million NT dollars for construction work. The company even replied, "Go ahead and sue us, many companies are suing us anyway."</p>
            <p>Miao Po-ya said there are over 40,000 registered members, but only over 200 million NT dollars are left in the performance guarantee account. This means each member might only get about 5,000 NT dollars back, which worries many customers. The Taipei City Government should be more active. If they wait for consumer protection groups to file a class action lawsuit, True Yoga could already have gotten rid of its assets. So, it is most important to protect all changeable assets first for the members.</p>
            <p>Liang Ming-chen, a consumer protection officer from the Executive Yuan's Consumer Protection Department, said that his department will quickly contact the Financial Supervisory Commission and banks about disputed credit card payments and trust account funds. Currently, they can help with credit card disputes. According to current rules, if a purchase was made within 540 days and the business stopped services within 120 days, and both conditions are met, customers can usually ask their bank for a refund. The Executive Yuan's Consumer Protection Department will meet with relevant government bodies next week to discuss this.</p>
            <p>Liu Tzu-chun, Deputy Director of the Sports Department's Industry Division, said that if a class action lawsuit is filed, the Sports Department will offer relevant help. They will check for any weaknesses in the current system for fitness businesses and improve it.</p>
            <p>Jin Shih-ping, Section Chief of the Labor Relations Department at the Ministry of Labor, said that hundreds of workers have already applied for mediation. He urged employees who have not yet applied to the Labor Bureau to do so quickly. He also hopes True Yoga will quickly solve the problem of unpaid wages. If the problem is not solved, the local government will report it to the Ministry of Labor, and they will handle it according to the law.</p>
