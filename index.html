            <h1>42 M1A2T Tanks Arrive in Taiwan, Moved to Training Base in Hsinchu Early Morning</h1>
            <p>The second group of 42 M1A2T tanks that Taiwan bought from the United States arrived at Taipei Port last night. Large private trucks started moving them out of the port around 12:10 AM today. They are going to the Armored Force Training Command in Hukou, Hsinchu. The police and military police helped control the traffic.</p>
            <p>The Army has about one thousand tanks, including CM-11 Brave Tiger tanks and M60A3 tanks. But these tanks have been used for more than 20 years. So, new engines are being put into the M60A3 tanks. Also, the Army has set aside 40.52 billion New Taiwan Dollars (about 1.3 billion US dollars) from 2019 to 2027 to buy 108 M1A2T tanks from the US. These tanks are called the "strongest tanks on earth." They will be placed in the Sixth Army Corps to protect the northern area.</p>
            <p>The first 38 M1A2T tanks arrived in Taiwan last December. On July 10, they practiced firing their 120mm tank guns at the Kengzukou training ground in Hsinchu. Four tanks fired 19 shots. The targets looked like the front of Chinese tanks. The tanks hit all targets using their Hunter-Killer system.</p>
            <p>The second group of 42 M1A2T tanks was supposed to arrive at Taipei Port by ship on the evening of July 26. But due to a typhoon, they were delayed until last night.</p>
            <p>A Central News Agency reporter was outside Taipei Port. Around 12:10 AM today, many M1A2T tanks, covered with black waterproof cloth, were driven out of the port by private trucks. They took the West Coast Expressway to the Army Armored Force Training Command in Hukou, Hsinchu. The police controlled traffic along the way, and military police vehicles drove in front and behind the tanks.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that Taiwan bought 108 M1A2T tanks. At the same time, it also bought 14 M88A2 recovery vehicles, 16 M1070A1 transport vehicles, and 16 M1000 transport trailers.</p>

However, the Taiwanese team did not give up. They slowly found their rhythm in the second set and won it 6-3, making the score even.</p>
            <p>In the deciding tie-break, Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao had a close match with their opponents. But the Taiwanese team won four points in a row at a key moment, giving them match point first. Even though their opponents saved two match points, Hsu Yu-hsiou and Huang Tsung-hao still won the match 11-9. They successfully won the ATP Challenger Tour men's doubles title. This is also Huang Tsung-hao's first ATP Challenger Tour men's doubles title in his career.</p>
            <p>After the match, Hsu Yu-hsiou told the Central News Agency that winning this first ATP Challenger Tour men's doubles title together was not easy. He said that they won three matches by coming from behind. The most important thing was taking their chances in the tie-break. He also said he was very happy to win the championship. "We will play together for two more weeks of Challenger tournaments in the United States, and we hope to get good results there too," he added.</p>
