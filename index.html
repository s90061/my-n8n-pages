            <h1>Lin Fei-fan: Stand Up and Vote on July 26 to Protect Taiwan's Sovereignty</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Wen Guixiang, Taipei, July 24) The first wave of recall votes will happen on July 26. Lin Fei-fan, who is the deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, said tonight that 11 years ago, he and many people worked together to stop Taiwan from being taken over by China. Now, 11 years later, he is in a different role but still works to keep Taiwan's sovereignty. He asked everyone to come out and vote on July 26 and August 23.</p>
            <p>The recall cases for 24 Kuomintang (KMT) legislators and the recall case for Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is suspended, will have their votes and counting on July 26. The Central Election Commission recently approved the recall cases for KMT legislators Luo Ming-tsai, Chiang Chi-chen, Yang Chiung-ying, Yen Kuan-heng, and Lin Sze-ming. Their votes will be on August 23.</p>
            <p>Lin Fei-fan responded tonight to the "All Industries Support Recalls" event by posting a photo from the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement on Facebook. He said he now works in national security and is also a father. He was lucky to be part of a historical event 11 years ago that changed Taiwan. They worked together to stop China from taking over Taiwan's economy. 11 years later, in a different role, he still believes Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy, and freedom must not be taken away or given up.</p>
            <p>Lin Fei-fan said thank you to everyone who came out, including partners and citizen groups. He also thanked those who have walked the same path for 11 years, continuing to protect this small, mountainous country they love so much. He asked everyone to stand up and vote on July 26 and August 23. (Editor: Lin Keren) 1140724</p>
