Due to Typhoon Danas getting closer, sea and air travel to and from Mazu has stopped. This has left about 2,000 travelers stuck in Mazu. The Lianjiang County Government said today that when the weather gets better, they will arrange for more military planes to take travelers back to Taiwan.

Today, the Lianjiang County Government held a meeting about Typhoon Danas. Because the typhoon is coming, 42 middle school students and teachers from Mazu are stuck in Fuzhou, China. They were there for a student exchange program, but travel has stopped. The Education Department said they have asked the Mawei District Government in China for help. They are arranging food, housing, and indoor activities for the students. The Education Department will also stay in touch with the teachers to make sure the students are healthy and safe.

The county government said that about 2,000 travelers are stuck because sea and air travel stopped due to the typhoon. They talked with airline companies. Since there are too many people for regular flights in one day, they will arrange extra military flights on July 8th after the typhoon passes. Also, if the sea is safe, extra ferry trips will be added by the New Taima and Taima Star ships. The Lianjiang County Transportation and Tourism Bureau also announced that besides the New Taima, Taima Star ships, and air travel stopping, inter-island boats on July 7th will also be affected. Boats from Nangan to Beigan will run as usual. But the first and second boats from Nangan to Juguang are canceled. The third boat will depend on the sea conditions (announced by 11 AM that day). All other island boat trips are canceled.

Because of Typhoon Danas, it is raining a lot in Hualien. This has made the Xiuguluan River flood over the temporary road of Luntian Bridge. The Yuli Police Station in Hualien closed both ends of the road around 4 PM today, working with the township office to keep people safe.

Do not try to go through closed roads. Please follow the police and other groups' advice to keep yourself and others safe.
