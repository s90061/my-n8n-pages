            <h1>三得利會長購買涉麻保健品請辭 週刊文春專訪揭始末</h1>
            <p>Takeshi Niinami, the head of Suntory Holdings, has resigned today. Three hours before Suntory held a press conference this afternoon, Mr. Niinami gave an interview to "Weekly Bunshun." He told the whole story. He said that his decision to resign was very sudden. He was not happy about it, but he felt that if resigning could cause less trouble for Suntory, "then everything is for Suntory."</p>
            <p>"Weekly Bunshun" reported that on the morning of August 22, more than ten men entered a home in a very nice building in Tokyo. These men were police officers from Fukuoka Prefecture. They had a search warrant for the home of Mr. Takeshi Niinami, who is 66 years old.</p>
            <p>People involved in the investigation said that on August 9, Fukuoka police found products with illegal THC. THC is a part of cannabis. They arrested the person in Fukuoka who had the products. But during the investigation, they found that one of the addresses for these products was Mr. Niinami's home. So, the police searched his home because they thought he broke the "Narcotics Control Act."</p>
            <p>The search finished around noon that day. Police did not find any illegal drugs in his home. Also, Mr. Niinami's urine test was negative, meaning he had not used drugs. Police have temporarily taken his phone and computer and are checking them now.</p>
            <p>After "Weekly Bunshun" learned about the search of Mr. Niinami's home, they asked Suntory questions on August 25. They asked if the search was real and if he used illegal drugs. But the company's public relations department said they "could not answer." The day after the search, Mr. Niinami went to America for work. He came back to Japan early in the morning on September 1.</p>
            <p>On September 2, Mr. Niinami talked to "Weekly Bunshun" for about 80 minutes and explained everything that happened.</p>
            <p>Mr. Niinami said that around 2022, he met a female massage therapist in New York. She was about 60 years old and helped Japanese important people stay healthy. He met her through the president of Suntory's American company. This massage therapist liked to use CBD (cannabidiol) a lot and always told him to use it. "I asked her if it was safe. She said, 'It's totally fine, even my 15-year-old daughter uses it.'"</p>
            <p>CBD is one of the main parts of cannabis. People think it can help with stress and sleep. In 2023, Japan changed its "Cannabis Control Act" and allowed CBD. However, the "Narcotics Control Act" was also changed. It now says that another part of cannabis, THC, which caused this problem, is an illegal drug.</p>
            <p>He said, "At first, I wanted to bring the health products back to Japan myself. But I stopped because I had to go through Dubai, which has very strict laws. Half of the products were given to her brother, who lives in Fukuoka, when she came to Japan. Then, he sent them to my house. For the other half, she said she would send them by air to Moji Port in Fukuoka, and her brother would send them to my house from there. Because of this, her brother was arrested for possibly breaking the Narcotics Control Act."</p>
            <p>Mr. Niinami said that on August 9, he was in New York. He got a call from the massage therapist. She told him, "Mr. Niinami, your name is also on the delivery address, so the police might come to your house. It might cause you trouble." He was planning to travel abroad on August 23. He thought the police might come the day before. And indeed, at 7:30 AM on August 22, the police arrived. The search took about 2.5 hours. They also wrote a 6-page report next to his bed.</p>
            <p>About knowing if the health products had THC, he said, "Of course, I didn't know. Both of them (the massage therapist and her brother) also didn't know it was illegal. I don't know why it had this part. I think products made in America are probably not very accurate and they just add things. Also, I have never met her brother. He just followed his sister's orders to send things to my house."</p>
            <p>Suntory learned about the situation on August 21. On the evening of August 22, an outside lawyer spoke with Mr. Niinami. On August 26, a special board meeting was held. Mr. Niinami, who was still in America for work, explained things by video. On August 28, all board members except Mr. Niinami talked about it. They all agreed to ask him to resign. Mr. Niinami said he could not accept this decision.</p>
            <p>Mr. Niinami said that after he returned to Japan yesterday, he heard from President Torii Nobuhiro about the board's decision. "He said that as the head of a company that sells health products, buying such a product carelessly is a problem, and I should resign."</p>
            <p>He said he arrived at the airport at 4:30 AM on September 1 and was immediately called to the company. From around 5 AM, he talked with the president for more than four hours. "I said, I cannot accept this decision. He replied, if you cannot accept it, then you will be fired. The board is controlled by the Torii family, who started the company. Since he said that, there was no point in me arguing anymore. But I believe it was wrong to make a decision while I was away for work. I also wanted to attend the board meeting and be part of the discussion myself."</p>
            <p>In 2014, Mr. Niinami was invited by then-Suntory Chairman and President Nobutada Saji to become the first president from outside the founding family since Suntory started in 1899. In 2025, Nobuhiro Torii, from the founding family, took over as president, and Mr. Niinami became chairman in a way that gave power back to the family.</p>
            <p>During the 10 years Mr. Niinami was president, Suntory's income doubled, and its profits increased 2.5 times. He worked hard to grow the company's business overseas, making more than half of its income come from outside Japan. The company became a truly global business.</p>
            <p>He said, "For these 10 years, I traveled a lot for the company. I flew about 500,000 miles, which is like going around the Earth 15 times. Overseas business was very hard, and it made me very tired. But I still worked very hard. The massage therapist told me to use CBD and warned me that if I didn't sleep, I might get dementia. But CBD actually didn't work at all. Now I use sleeping pills to sleep."</p>
            <p>During the interview, Mr. Niinami's eyes sometimes became red. He showed his strong feelings for the company.</p>
            <p>He said, "My employees, whom I helped grow, cried and said that without me, Suntory would not have grown. While I was touched to hear these words, I also felt very sorry. Maybe the board did not really understand my hard work in America over the last 10 years. For these 10 years, I worked very hard. If my resignation can cause less trouble for the company I love most and make customers feel safe, then I think stepping down is all for Suntory."</p>

            <h1>川普政府敗訴 法官禁止在加州部署國民兵執法</h1>
            <p>A judge has stopped the Trump government from using the National Guard in California to fight crime. This happened after California Governor Gavin Newsom sued President Trump. In June, President Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the U.S., to help with law enforcement.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Judge Charles Breyer's decision will not start until September 12. It is likely that the Trump government will try to appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. This was in response to many protests there because of a large operation to find immigrants.</p>
            <p>This action made the situation in Los Angeles more tense. Also, members of the Democratic Party said that Trump was using the army to stop people who disagreed with his strict immigration rules. This also brought up new questions about the U.S. President's legal power.</p>
            <p>Gavin Newsom, a well-known Democrat, said that the Trump government broke a long-standing U.S. rule and the Posse Comitatus Act. This law strictly limits using federal military forces for law enforcement inside the country.</p>
            <p>The Trump government said that the U.S. Constitution allows the President to use the army to protect federal workers and property. They said this part is not limited by the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
            <p>However, Judge Breyer wrote in his decision today that the evidence from the trial showed the Trump government used soldiers and military vehicles to create security areas, block traffic, and control crowds. "Simply put, the defendants broke the Posse Comitatus Act."</p>
