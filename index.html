            <h1>Matatag Stream Barrier Lake Disaster: 15 Dead, 7 Missing; Volunteers Arrive in Hualien, Disaster Center Improves Transport and Communication</h1>
            <p>A barrier lake in the Matatag Stream in Hualien overflowed, causing a disaster. Many people have come to help with the recovery. The Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center said that many volunteers came today. The center will improve transport and communication. So far, 15 people have died and 7 are missing. 78 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>The Matatag Stream barrier lake overflowed in the afternoon of September 23. This caused a lot of damage to homes in Guangfu Township and resulted in deaths and injuries. Today is the fourth day after the disaster. Many volunteers and groups have come to help clean up, clear the area, and assist the affected people.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center held a special meeting this morning about the Matatag Stream barrier lake. Huang Chao-chin, the Deputy Commander and Political Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, led the meeting.</p>
            <p>According to the center's report, as of 9 AM today, 15 people have died, 7 are missing, and 78 are injured because of the overflowing lake. One person who was thought to be missing was found dead yesterday in Fozhu Street. Their family identified them. So, the number of missing people has been changed to 7.</p>
            <p>Before the different government departments gave their reports, the Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center had a video meeting with the local forward command center. The command center talked about things like clearing waste, helping volunteers with transport, making communication better, and giving supplies to the affected people.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center said that if waste continues to be left on the roads, it could cause environmental problems. They asked central government units to quickly find suitable places to put the waste. They also said they would quickly deal with helping volunteers with transport and making mobile phone communication better.</p>
            <p>The center's report said that before the lake overflowed, it was 200 meters high. Now, it has gone down to 86 meters. The lake area was 140 hectares, but now it is only 15.5 hectares. The total amount of water in the lake was 91 million tons, but now it is 7 million tons.</p>
            <p>Also, a helicopter from the National Airborne Service Corps checked the dam area today. They confirmed that water is still washing away the dam through the overflow opening. The surrounding unstable slopes are still collapsing. Also, rain in the water collection area is still adding water to the lake. So, the "red alert" remains in place.</p>
            <p>The report also states that the first protective line for the Matatag Stream riverbed will be finished within 2 weeks. This is to stop water from flowing out again. They plan to repair the damaged Guangfu No. 1 levee within 1 month and make it stronger within 3 months. The full rebuilding will be finished before the flood season in 2026. Heavy machines needed for the disaster area are expected to arrive by noon today.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center said that because the Matatag Stream bridge was washed away, a temporary road will be finished in about 1 month. A steel temporary bridge will be finished in 4 months. A one-way bridge will be open by the end of 2026, and all bridges will be finished and open the year after.</p>
            <p>In addition, to help volunteers working in the disaster area, Taiwan Railways will add 10 train services from today until September 29. They are also thinking about adding more train cars. The local police have set up checkpoints on important roads and sent more police to control traffic. They have also told the public about alternative routes.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center stated that it has created plans to help affected residents. These plans include interest subsidies for rebuilding or buying new homes, interest subsidies for repair loans, rent subsidies, and short-term hotel stays. Information about these plans will be announced soon.</p>
            <p>Huang Chao-chin said that they will continue to work with the local government to find the 7 missing people. Because drone footage still shows water overflowing from the barrier lake, the "red alert" will stay. He understands that affected residents want to return home, but he suggests they stay in temporary housing first to ensure their safety.</p>

            <h1>Former Democratic Official at Microsoft: Trump Calls for Her to Be Fired</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 26, (CNA) Former US President Donald Trump said today that Microsoft should fire Lisa Monaco. Monaco has worked for two Democratic presidents and is now the President of Global Affairs at Microsoft.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this seems to be Trump's latest action to get back at people he believes are his political enemies. This happened the day after James Comey, a former FBI director, was charged.</p>
            <p>Monaco helped the Department of Justice manage its response after Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021.</p>
            <p>Monaco was a security advisor for former President Barack Obama. She also served as the Deputy Attorney General during former President Joe Biden's government. Her LinkedIn profile shows that Monaco joined Microsoft in July. She is in charge of the company's work with governments around the world.</p>
            <p>Trump said on his social media site, "Truth Social," that Monaco "is a threat to American national security." He especially mentioned this because Microsoft has important contracts with the US government.</p>
            <p>In his post, he wrote: "I think Microsoft should immediately end Monaco's employment contract."</p>
            <p>Monaco's security clearance was taken away in February this year. Trump said today that the US government has also stopped her from entering all federal buildings because of "Monaco's many wrong actions."</p>
            <p>Microsoft did not want to comment on Trump's post. Monaco herself did not respond right away.</p>

Novak stated that Russia and China are working on several projects together. These include taking out and processing natural gas in the Arctic region.</p>
            <p>According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry's website, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak held the 22nd meeting of the China-Russia Energy Cooperation Committee in Beijing on September 26.</p>
            <p>Ding Xuexiang said that working together on energy is a good example of how China and Russia cooperate in a fair, useful, and mutually beneficial way. He gave 3 ideas for improving energy cooperation between China and Russia. First, they should work more closely together and make sure important projects are built and run well. Second, they should find more ways to work together on new types of energy like renewable energy, hydrogen energy, and energy storage. This will help change how energy is used. Third, they should work together more to support real multilateralism and make global plans for energy work.</p>
            <p>China's Foreign Ministry said that during the meeting, both countries talked about their cooperation in oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy, and nuclear energy. They had deep discussions about future cooperation and agreed on many things. After the meeting, Ding Xuexiang and Novak signed the meeting notes together.</p>
            <p>According to Russia's Sputnik news agency on September 26, Novak said at the meeting that Russia wants to work more with China on electricity. This includes buying and selling electricity and building important power structures. He also said that Russia and China are planning new ways to supply natural gas, such as a route through the Far East and another one through Mongolia.</p>
            <p>Novak also mentioned that they are working on several projects together. These include taking out and processing natural gas in the Arctic, building a large gas processing center in the Baltic Sea area, the Amur Gas Chemical Complex, and working together to develop the Zashulanskoye coal mine in the Trans-Baikal area.</p>
