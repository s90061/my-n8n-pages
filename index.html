            <h1>Former US National Security Advisor Bolton Says Not Guilty of Mishandling Secret Information</h1>
            <p>Today in Washington, D.C., US media reported that John Bolton, a former national security advisor, said he is not guilty in court. He was charged with "wrongly handling secret information." Bolton worked as a national security advisor for 17 months during President Donald Trump's first term. Later, he openly criticized Trump.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Bolton faces 18 criminal charges. These include sharing and keeping top secret defense information. Today, he said he was not guilty in a court hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
            <p>The report said that Bolton was released after the hearing without needing to pay bail. His next court date is November 21.</p>
            <p>Bolton was charged on October 16. The charges say that Bolton shared secret documents by email with two "people who were not allowed to see them." The people were not named, but it is thought that they are his wife and daughter.</p>
            <p>The US Justice Department said these documents "showed secret information about future attacks, foreign enemies, and foreign policy relationships."</p>
            <p>Each charge can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison.</p>
            <p>Bolton said in a statement that he denied the charges. He said he "is the newest person to be affected by the Justice Department using its power for political reasons."</p>
            <p>Bolton is now the third person who criticized Trump to be charged in recent weeks. Before him, James Comey, the former head of the FBI, and Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, were also charged.</p>

            <p>Today in Washington, D.C., Lars Klingbeil, who is Germany's Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister, criticized China's choice to make rare earth export rules stricter. He hopes that the situation will get better after US President Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Klingbeil spoke at meetings for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Washington. He said, "We have shown within the Group of Seven (G7) countries that we do not agree with what China is doing."</p>
            <p>Klingbeil pointed out, "We are watching the situation closely. We are trying our best to stop more tension between the US and China through political talks." He also said, "I now have a little hope that many problems can be made clear when President Trump meets President Xi Jinping."</p>
            <p>At the same time, Klingbeil also said that China's recent actions could "endanger" the economies of Germany and Europe.</p>
