            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Huang Qiaowen, Taipei, July 30) Because of a southwest air current, heavy rain has fallen in central and southern Taiwan. Today, the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications announced that parts of Provincial Highway 18 in Alishan Township, Chiayi County will be closed at night as a precaution.

            <p>The Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan Branch of the Highway Bureau's Maintenance Engineering Division released a press statement. It said that because of the outer area of Typhoon Zhujiecao and the southwest air current, there has been heavy rain in Alishan Township, Chiayi County for several days.

            <p>To keep drivers and travelers safe, the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan Branch of the Highway Bureau said that Provincial Highway 18 in Alishan Township, Chiayi County, from kilometer 68.5 to 88 (Fushan to Alishan), will be closed starting at 6 PM tonight.

            <h1>Taiwan Mobile Starts "Planting Happiness with Electricity" Plan; Jamie Lin: 16% Green Energy Use</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Jiang Ming-yan, Taipei, July 30) Taiwan Mobile announced its "2025 Planting Happiness with Electricity" plan today. This plan uses green energy combined with public fundraising to help society. Jamie Lin, the general manager of Taiwan Mobile, said that Taiwan Mobile now uses 16% green energy. They will also make their network stronger against disasters and set up more satellite communication. He also agreed with creating "disaster roaming."</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile announced today that it will again work with everyone to start the "2025 Planting Happiness with Electricity" plan. This plan uses public fundraising, combining green energy and helping others, to turn sunlight into real support for good causes.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile explained that this year's fundraising will start on August 1. They plan to raise NT$4.5 million within 61 days to build 189 solar panels. These panels will have a total power of 92.61 kWp. In 20 years, they expect to make over 2.15 million units of green electricity and earn about NT$7 million. This will make the charitable giving 1.54 times bigger.</p>
            <p>Jamie Lin, the general manager of Taiwan Mobile, stated that Taiwan Mobile currently uses around 16% green electricity. They aim to use 100% green energy by 2040 and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile had previously announced that it is investing in Fubon Energy along with Ho-Ming Energy and Fubon Life Insurance. The total investment is NT$11 billion, with Taiwan Mobile owning 10%. They will build energy storage sites that can hold 354 MW of power. Because there is not enough supply from other companies, they will invest more. The platform will grow further in the future, making their investments faster.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan Mobile is the only company listed among the first 12 investors in the Ministry of Environment's "Plan to Increase Investment in Green Growth and Net-Zero Industries."</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused many network outages in southern Taiwan, which made people very concerned about how strong communication networks are. Taiwan Mobile said they are happy to support and will actively help with measures like building strong base stations that can handle disasters, putting cables underground, and adding more satellite vehicles.</p>
            <p>Jamie Lin added today that over 10% of base stations were affected by broken cables and over 10% of equipment failed during the recent typhoon. He said they will work to put cables underground, but this might not help much with the problems caused by this storm. Taiwan Mobile is happy about setting up "disaster roaming." Lin mentioned that there are three networks in Taiwan that should already back each other up, and they should be available for use in special situations.</p>
            <p>"Disaster roaming" means that when an emergency happens, users of any telecom company in Taiwan can use the services of other telecom companies directly, without needing to apply or set up anything extra.</p>
            <p>Regarding the mobile phone market, Lin Dong-min, the Chief Business Officer of Taiwan Mobile's Personal User Business, said that Taiwan Mobile's sales of Samsung foldable phones, for example, more than doubled compared to last year. Also, the total number of phones sold in the first six months of this year has grown. This year is also the first year for AI smart glasses, at a time when AI is popular and the making of devices (ODM and OEM) is well-developed. Taiwan Mobile is positive about the potential of the Taiwanese market and will be part of it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Jamie Lin explained that he led a team to visit Google and said they hope to bring the "Taiwan Tongues" project into Google's Gemini training. This would help traditional Chinese become a bigger part of AI language models. Other collaborations are something to "look forward to."</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Tongues" project, started by the IMA Information Managers Association late last year, is actively building a collection of Taiwanese language data. This is not only to help Taiwanese AI models understand Taiwanese languages, but also to help international open-source language models understand Taiwanese languages.</p>
            <p>Also, regarding satellite plans, he pointed out that Taiwan Mobile previously worked with Lynk Global, a satellite communication company. They tested space base station technology, which allows phones to directly connect to low-earth orbit satellites to send text messages and make calls. They will continue to work with international companies in this area in the future.</p>
            <p>So far, Taiwan Mobile has also invested in almost 30 new companies. In recent years, they have invested in game companies like Magic Entertainment and Japanese entertainment content companies like REMOW. Other areas they are interested in include AI, Web3, and smart devices like smart glasses. (Edited by Zhang Ruo-yao) 1140730</p>
