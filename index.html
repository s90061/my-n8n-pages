US stocks experienced mixed results on Friday as investors reacted to a variety of global events. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a small increase of almost 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both declined. A significant concern for traders is the possibility of the US military becoming directly involved in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, which is now in its second week. Other factors affecting the market include expectations about future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and ongoing tensions between the US and China over chip technology.
