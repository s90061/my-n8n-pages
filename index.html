            <h1>Zelensky: Gaza Ceasefire Gives Hope for End of Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky praised the "extraordinary" ceasefire in the Gaza Strip today. He said it makes people hope that Russia's war against Ukraine can also end. He believes leaders like US President Trump can help make this happen.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Zelensky wrote on social media: "When peace happens in one part of the world, it brings more hope for peace in other areas."</p>
            <p>He added: "If there is a ceasefire and peace in the Middle East, then the strong efforts of global leaders will surely work for us in Ukraine too."</p>
            <p>Russia started a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. This led to the biggest war in Europe since the end of World War II. Russia has often said no to ceasefire requests. It has asked for tough conditions, basically wanting Kyiv to surrender for peace.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump once promised to stop the Russia-Ukraine war within hours of becoming president. But even though the US has had many talks, and Trump has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, there has not been much progress towards a peace deal for Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>13 Financial Companies in Taiwan Made NT$69 Billion Profit in September, Up Over 80%</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 13 (CNA) â€“ The US central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed), started lowering interest rates in September. This made the stock market better. As a result, 13 financial holding companies in Taiwan made NT$69.011 billion in profit after tax in September. This is an increase of 87.6% compared to last year. If we also add the profit of Shin Kong Financial before it merged, all financial holding companies together made NT$403.282 billion profit in the first nine months. This is 19.5% less than last year.</p>
            <p>According to public records, the 13 financial holding companies made NT$432.829 billion profit in the first nine months. However, if we include Shin Kong Financial's loss of NT$29.547 billion for the first six months, the total profit for all financial holding companies in the first nine months was NT$403.282 billion.</p>
            <p>Looking at the profits of the 13 financial holding companies in the first nine months, there were different results. In the first half of this year, the exchange rate went up strongly. This caused most life insurance financial holding companies to have lower total profits compared to last year. But on the other hand, companies like CTBC Financial, E.SUN Financial, E.SUN Financial, First Financial, Hua Nan Financial, Mega Financial, and Taishin Financial had higher profits than last year. These companies are mainly focused on banking.</p>
            <p>However, Fubon Financial, which is a life insurance financial holding company, still won the top spot. It had the highest profit for September, the highest profit for the first nine months, and the highest earnings per share (EPS).</p>
            <p>Fubon Financial reported a profit of NT$17.44 billion after tax in September. For the first nine months, its total profit after tax was NT$90.92 billion, which is almost 25% less than last year. But its total earnings per share (EPS) was NT$6.38, which is still the best in the industry. Fubon Financial and its companies like Fubon Life, Taipei Fubon Bank, Fubon Securities, and Fubon Insurance all had their highest September profits ever. Taipei Fubon Bank also had its highest profit ever for the first nine months.</p>
            <p>Fubon Financial explained that Taipei Fubon Bank made NT$3.43 billion profit after tax in September and NT$29.17 billion for the first nine months. These numbers are 28% and 16% higher than last year, respectively. Both the September and total profits are the highest ever. This is mainly because net interest income and net service fee income both grew by more than 10% compared to last year in the first nine months. Also, loans from overseas, small and medium businesses, and individuals grew, which made the bank's total loan amount increase by 10%.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial made NT$9.74 billion profit after tax in September. For the first nine months, its profit after tax was NT$74.78 billion, which is 27.5% less than last year. Its EPS was NT$4.83, making it the second-best in the industry. Cathay Financial said that Cathay United Bank, Cathay Century Insurance, and Cathay Securities Investment Trust all had their highest total profits ever for the same period last year. Cathay Securities had its second-highest total profit for the same period.</p>
            <p>CTBC Financial made NT$11.179 billion profit after tax in September. For the first nine months, its profit after tax was NT$60.759 billion, which is 3.6% more than last year. Its EPS was NT$3.06. CTBC Bank's deposits and loans were steady, and its wealth management business was strong. This led to a profit of NT$42.057 billion in the first nine months, an increase of 16% and a new high for this period. Its company, Taiwan Life, made some money from selling stocks in Taiwan, which helped its profit for September. However, its profit for the first nine months was NT$17.74 billion, which was lower than last year because of more losses from exchange rates.</p>
            <p>KGI Financial announced a profit of NT$4.528 billion for September. For the first nine months, its profit after tax was NT$19.05 billion, which is 34.6% less than last year. Its EPS was NT$1.09. KGI Financial said that when the US Federal Reserve started lowering interest rates in September, it helped the financial market. KGI Bank and KGI Securities gave more than 80% of the financial holding company's cash dividends last year. Because of good business in these areas, the two companies made NT$13.458 billion profit after tax in the first nine months of this year, an increase of 7% compared to last year. This will help the financial holding company pay dividends in the future.</p>
            <p>Yuanta Financial announced a profit of NT$3.417 billion for September, an increase of 41.4%. For the first nine months, its profit after tax was NT$26.695 billion, a decrease of 1.5%. Its EPS was NT$2.</p>
            <p>Taishin Shin Kong Financial's profit includes the original Taishin Financial's profit and Shin Kong's profit after the merger. Taishin Shin Kong Financial's total profit after tax for September was NT$7.5 billion, which is the highest ever for a single month. For the first nine months, its profit was NT$26.04 billion, also a new high. Its EPS was NT$1.51. Taishin Bank made NT$1.9 billion in September, and NT$15.46 billion in the first nine months, continuing to reach new highs.</p>
            <p>E.SUN Financial made NT$2.897 billion profit after tax in September. For the first nine months, its profit after tax was NT$26.202 billion. This is a new record for this period, an increase of 25.5%, and it is already more than the total profit of NT$26.084 billion for the whole year of 2024. Its profit is growing very well, and its EPS was NT$1.62. E.SUN Financial explained that its bank, securities, venture capital, and investment trust companies all made more profit in the first nine months than last year. E.SUN Bank's net interest income grew by 18.9% and was the highest ever for this period.</p>
            <p>Regarding the four big public financial holding companies: Mega Financial's profit after tax for the first nine months was NT$28.285 billion, a decrease of 3.5%. Its EPS was NT$1.91, still the highest among public companies. First Financial's profit after tax for the first nine months was NT$21.699 billion, an increase of 4.3%. Hua Nan Financial's profit after tax for the first nine months was NT$19.91 billion, an increase of 11.5%. Cooperative Bank Financial's profit after tax for the first nine months was NT$16.238 billion, an increase of 0.1%.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei's Dalun Mountain in Shiding to Become a Special Area for Soil and Water Protection, Making Slopes Stronger</h1>
            <p>The New Taipei City Government has announced that Dalun Mountain in Shiding District will be made into a special area for soil and water protection. This is because there are worries that the slopes on the mountain might slide. The Ministry of Agriculture has approved this plan, and it is expected to start in November. This plan will include building water collection wells and other structures to make sure the slopes are stable and safe.</p>
            <p>The Department of Agriculture said in a press release that after Typhoon Megi in September 2016, new cracks and sinking ground appeared on the roads and around buildings at Huafan University, which is in the Dalun Mountain area of Fengtian Village, Shiding District.</p>
            <p>The Department of Agriculture stated that Huafan University and the Agency of Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation immediately started working on fixing these problems. They continued to watch the area and saw signs that the slopes were still sliding. To make the soil and water protection better overall, the city government sent a plan to the Ministry of Agriculture in August to make Dalun Mountain in Shiding District a special soil and water conservation area. The Ministry of Agriculture approved this plan on August 29.</p>
            <p>The Department of Agriculture added that Dalun Mountain in Shiding District is expected to become a special soil and water conservation area in November. In the future, they will build water collection wells, horizontal drainage pipes, and slope protection structures. These will help keep the slopes stable and safe in the area. They will also keep doing emergency drills and exercises for communities to help people react better during disasters and know what to do.</p>
            <p>The head of the Department of Agriculture, Chen Hsi-hui, said that making high-risk mountain slopes into special soil and water conservation areas and fixing them will do many things. It will lower the amount of water under the ground and make the slopes stronger. Also, when there are heavy rains, it will stop big landslides and other problems caused by soil and sand.</p>
