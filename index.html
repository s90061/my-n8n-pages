            <h1>Taitung Group Says County Meetings Used to Stop Recall, County Leader Does Not Reply</h1>
            <p>A group in Taitung called "Operation Frustration" went to the Taitung Prosecutor's Office today. They accused Taitung County Magistrate Rao Ching-ling and her secretary Hong Wei-guang of breaking election rules and not being neutral. The group said that county meetings were used to speak against recalling someone. Rao and Hong did not answer.</p>
            <p>The leader of "Operation Frustration," Hong Chuan-cheng, wants to remove Huang Chien-pin, a KMT legislator. Today, he went to the Taitung Prosecutor's Office to report them. He told reporters that the Taitung County Government used "county affairs meetings" to tell people to vote against the recall of Huang Chien-pin. Since June 3rd, they have held more than 19 such meetings in different village centers. The meetings invited Wu Hsiu-hua, who leads the KMT in Taitung County, County Magistrate Rao Ching-ling, and Huang Chien-pin himself to speak.</p>
            <p>Hong Chuan-cheng said that these meetings were not about county business. Instead, they told people to vote "no" to the recall. He said that on July 7th, his group spoke about this. The county government then said that County Magistrate's secretary, Hong Wei-guang, organized these meetings by himself. They said that the county leader's picture and the county government's logo were used without permission, causing a misunderstanding.</p>
            <p>Hong Chuan-cheng said that Hong Wei-guang is just the county leader's secretary. He wondered how the secretary could use government money and help to speak against the recall in private. But the county leader said it was just the secretary's own action. The recall group reported this to the prosecutor's office because they want to find out the truth.</p>
            <p>County Magistrate Rao Ching-ling and Hong Wei-guang did not want to speak about the group's accusations.</p>

            <h1>Lin Chia-lung Welcomes Guatemala's Parliament Speaker, Hopes for Stronger Ties</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Lin Chia-lung, welcomed a group led by Guatemala's Parliament Speaker, Nery Abilio Ramos y Ramos, yesterday. Minister Lin said he hopes Taiwan and Guatemala can work together even more closely.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin wrote on Facebook that he had just returned from a trip to Paraguay on July 16th. Yesterday, he went with Speaker Ramos to meet President Lai Ching-te. President Lai thanked Speaker Ramos for always supporting Taiwan's involvement in international affairs.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin said that this is Speaker Ramos's second visit to Taiwan since July last year. At the dinner, Minister Lin congratulated Speaker Ramos on being chosen again as speaker last October. He noted that Guatemala's parliament has many different groups and cultures. So, Speaker Ramos's re-election shows that his good leadership is valued.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin also pointed out that Guatemala's President Bernardo ArÃ©valo visited Taiwan with his wife in June. During that visit, Taiwan and Guatemala signed three agreements. These agreements were about working together on the semiconductor industry, having political talks, and helping companies invest in both countries. Minister Lin said this shows that Taiwan and Guatemala are talking more and working together more deeply.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin said, "People are the key to a country's growth." He mentioned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is planning to start a special master's program called "Guatemala Semiconductor Technology Master's Program." They are also talking with universities in Guatemala to offer "dual degrees." He hopes that working together on higher education will bring Taiwan and Guatemala even closer and make their friendship stronger.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin also said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invited Taiwanese companies to visit Guatemala. These companies are in different areas like clothes, seafood, coffee, and technology. They met with business groups and companies in Guatemala to find ways to work together.</p>
            <p>Minister Lin explained that since he became Foreign Minister, he has been working on "Comprehensive Diplomacy." He also started the "Prosperous Alliance Program." This program uses Taiwan's strengths in industries to work with friendly countries. They work together in areas like health, farming, education, and helping women. He said this has brought good results and helped people in both countries.</p>
            <p>Finally, Minister Lin said he hopes that in the future, the government and private companies will continue to work together. He wants to deepen the cooperation between Taiwan and Guatemala in more ways and make it more real. This will help both Taiwan and Guatemala become prosperous together.</p>

            <h1>Woman in Nantou, 45, Had Brain Bleeding from a Rare Brain Problem</h1>
            <p>A 45-year-old woman in Nantou had bleeding in her brain and was sent to the hospital. Dr. Chen Yi-an, a brain doctor, said that the bleeding was not in a usual place for brain bleeds, and the woman was quite young. Also, she had felt confused and vomited before going to the hospital. More tests showed she had a rare problem called "intracranial arteriovenous malformation," or AVM.</p>
            <p>Nantou Hospital said today in a press release that the 45-year-old woman was taken to the emergency room. She was confused and could not move her left arm and leg well. A special scan called a CT scan showed bleeding in her brain. Because she had been confused and vomiting recently, the doctor thought something was wrong. They did more tests and found she had a rare AVM in her brain. She is now getting strong treatment.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen Yi-an, a brain doctor from Tri-Service General Hospital who also works at Nantou Hospital, explained how blood usually flows. Blood goes from arteries, through very small blood vessels called capillaries, and then to veins. But with AVM in the brain, which often happens because of something wrong from birth or a family problem, arteries connect directly to veins. They do not go through the small capillaries. This can cause bleeding in the brain, weakness in arms or legs, or seizures.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen said that about 0.14% of people have AVM. Usually, people do not have clear signs of it. Most people find out they have it when they have a brain bleed or a seizure. Some also find out during a health check. The bleeding in this woman's brain was not where bleeding often happens. So, doctors did more scans, like an MRI, and a special X-ray of her blood vessels to confirm it was AVM.</p>
            <p>Dr. Chen said that brain bleeding often happens when a person's high blood pressure is not controlled well. But if a patient is younger, or if the bleeding is not in a common place for high blood pressure, doctors need to check for other reasons. He told people that if they have a very bad headache, weak arms or legs, or seizures, they should go to a doctor quickly. If they are found to have AVM, doctors will choose the best treatment based on how big it is, where it is, how the blood drains, and the patient's overall health.</p>
            <p>Hong Hung-chang, the head of Nantou Hospital, said that in recent years, with help from the government, the hospital has improved its medical tools, staff, and how it handles emergencies. In 2020, Nantou Hospital opened a heart treatment center. It has saved many patients with sudden heart problems. This year, with help from a larger medical center, they have also started to treat blood vessel problems in the head and neck.</p>
