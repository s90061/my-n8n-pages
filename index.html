(Taipei, July 15, Central News Agency) Lin Qunguo, the chairman of PuHone Information, a company that provides financial payment platforms, said today that because of current global political, economic, and cybersecurity situations, it is important for information security to be made locally. PuHone has launched a new kind of financial machine for banks. They hope this will replace machines bought from other countries and become a new important product that helps PuHone make more money this year.

PuHone Information is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year and held a meeting with the media today. Lin Qunguo said that since the company started, it has worked with banks in Taiwan. Their five main types of products are for payments, banking, information security, data protection, and IT services from other companies.

Lin Qunguo said that recently, many banks told them that they are facing more pressure. This is mainly because rules for cybersecurity are getting stricter, and there are not enough skilled people in financial IT. This makes it very hard for banks to follow the rules and keep their operations safe.

Lin Qunguo also said that the prices of software and hardware from big international companies have gone up quickly in recent years. Also, their rules for using products are more complex, and products are supported for a shorter time. This makes it hard for banks to spend money on IT and still make enough profit.

He added that in today's world, with its political, economic, and cybersecurity situations, it is very important for the financial industry to have its own information security and strong main financial systems.

PuHone's "financial machine" helps banks with their biggest problems. It focuses on making security products locally and replacing imported ones. It meets what banks need, like quickly getting services back after a problem, stopping big accidents, setting up financial cybersecurity, and being fully responsible for following rules.

He said the new "financial machine" also includes financial rules before it leaves the factory. They believe this new product will help their company's income grow this year.

***Big Offshore Wind Projects Boost Foreign Investment by 126% in First Six Months***

(Taipei, July 15, Central News Agency) The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced today that foreign and overseas Chinese investments in Taiwan grew by a lot in the first six months of this year. While the number of approved investments dropped a little (about 4%) to 1016 cases, the total money invested reached 7.36 billion US dollars. This is a big increase of 126.46%. This large growth happened because of big investments in offshore wind farms, including those from Ã˜rsted Energy and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP).

Today, the Investment Commission of the Ministry of Economic Affairs released numbers for foreign investment in Taiwan, Chinese investment in Taiwan, and Taiwanese investment outside Taiwan and in mainland China. In the first half of this year, a total of 1027 investment cases in Taiwan were approved (this includes foreign, overseas Chinese, and Chinese investments). The total investment amount was 7,466,615,000 US dollars.

For foreign and overseas Chinese investments in Taiwan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that from January to June this year, 1016 cases were approved. This is 4.15% fewer cases than the same time last year. However, the money invested was 7,365,871,000 US dollars, which is a 126.46% increase.

The Ministry explained that this increase was mainly due to big investment projects. These include: ORSTED WIND POWER TW HOLDING A/S from Denmark (Ã˜rsted Energy) investing about 2.02 billion US dollars to set up Dazhanghua Southwest Holdings Co., Ltd.; CI FENGMIAO SCSP from Luxembourg adding about 671.51 million US dollars to Copenhagen Infrastructure Fengmiao Co., Ltd.; and STONEPEAK OCEANVIEW (CAYMAN) HOLDINGS COMPANY from the British Cayman Islands adding about 268.07 million US dollars to Peak Oceanview Investment Co., Ltd.

Also, from January to June this year, 11 investment cases from mainland China were approved. The total money invested was 100,744,000 US dollars. The main reason for this increase in investment money was that in January, Hong Kong-based Pengding International Co., Ltd., which has a Taiwanese business background, was approved to add 3 billion New Taiwan dollars to Pengding Technology Co., Ltd.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that even though Hong Kong-based Pengding Co. is fully controlled by Zhending-KY Co., which is listed in Taiwan, and its main big owner is Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn), it is considered to have a Taiwanese business background. However, because the investment came through a Pengding company in Shenzhen that invested in Taiwan, it still needed approval under the rules for investments from mainland China.

For Taiwanese investments outside Taiwan, from January to June this year, 414 cases were approved. This is a 20.35% increase from the same time last year. The money invested was 18,311,147,000 US dollars, which is a 24.29% decrease.

The numbers show that for investments in mainland China, from January to June this year, 101 cases were approved. This is a 42.61% decrease from the same time last year. The approved investment money was 574,447,000 US dollars, which is a 62.86% decrease from the same time last year.

***TCC Chairman Chang An-ping Returns to Taiwan After Sanyuan Energy Fire, Demands Full Investigation and Strict Accountability***

(Taipei, July 15, Central News Agency) A fire happened on July 14 at Sanyuan Energy's Xiaogang factory. This factory is part of Nengyuan Technology, which is owned by TCC (Taiwan Cement Corporation). TCC Chairman Chang An-ping stopped his work trip overseas and came back to Taiwan right away, going to the factory. He said that they will thoroughly look into why the fire started and will hold anyone responsible strictly accountable. He also said they must make sure the company keeps working and can still provide products to its high-tech industry customers around the world.

Also, TCC announced today that Sanyuan Energy's battery factory has completely stopped working. It is not yet known if the company will have to pay a fine. They are still figuring out how this will affect the company's money and business.

A press release from TCC said that when Chang An-ping arrived at the factory and heard reports from top managers, he learned that the factory had not talked enough with the local community. He asked top managers from the main office to work with top managers from Nengyuan Technology to form a special group. This group will rebuild the community relations team to talk better with neighbors, make sure information is clear, and answer the community's worries.

Chang An-ping said that even though the Sanyuan factory uses many automatic sensors in the area where the fire started, called the formation area, with over 332,800 temperature sensors, 17,400 smoke sensors, and a plan for how to act in many stages of a disaster, the system clearly did not work as expected in this fire.

Chang An-ping emphasized that a special team has been created to investigate. The most important thing now is to cool down the area. Then, they will go back into the factory to find computers and monitoring devices to check all the information. They will look at all the records of how the equipment worked and how it was set up. They need to find out why the system's reaction was different from what actually happened. They will check if it was a problem with management, if someone made a mistake, or if the equipment itself had a problem.

Chang An-ping stated that inside the company, they will hold people very responsible. If there was any mistake in management or if an employee was at fault, they will deal with it according to company rules. Outside the company, they will also make sure suppliers take responsibility. Especially, the company that gave Sanyuan factory its production equipment is a very famous international company. They should have a lot of experience with battery making equipment. They will look closely to see if their equipment had any problems or design flaws. They will also take legal action right away to ask for proper payment for damages and for changes to be made.

Chang An-ping noted that the company group's battery brand, Molicel, is the only major international battery supplier from Taiwan. International customers need a lot of Molicel's high-quality batteries. This event could have a big effect on high-tech companies all over the world, so they hope to try their best to reduce any problems for customers waiting for orders. Sanyuan Energy Technology's parent company, Nengyuan Technology, has started checking and moving its production at its factory in the Southern Taiwan Science Park to make as many batteries as possible and help with the orders that were affected.
