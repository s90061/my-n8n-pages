US President Trump shared today that the US and Vietnam have a new trade agreement. Under this agreement, goods from Vietnam sent directly to the US will have a 20% tax. However, goods that come from China or other countries, and then are just sent through Vietnam to the US, will have a 40% tax.

Trump also said that Vietnam has agreed to remove all taxes on goods coming from the US. This means American products can be sold in Vietnam without extra fees.

This agreement is important because many companies, like Nike and Lululemon, moved their factories from China to Vietnam. Vietnam is now a major supplier of clothes and sports items to the US. Last year, Vietnam was the 6th largest country to send goods to the US, with nearly 137 billion dollars in exports. After Trump's announcement, shares of furniture and clothing companies went up.

**European Stock Markets Show Mixed Results, London Down**

European stock markets had a day with mixed results. Some markets went up, and some went down. In London, the stock market went down by a small amount. This happened because of news about the UK's finance minister and the possibility of him leaving his job.

However, the stock market in Frankfurt, Germany, went up. The stock market in Paris, France, also went up.

These changes happened after US President Trump said he would not delay new taxes, and after it was reported that fewer people got jobs in the US in June than expected.
