            <h1>ADATA's August Sales Nearly NT$5 Billion, Up Over 60% Annually, Setting a New Record for the Same Period</h1>
            <p>ADATA Technology, a company that makes memory modules, announced its sales for August reached NT$4.983 billion. This is a 16.93% increase from the previous month and a 64.53% increase compared to August last year. This is the highest sales figure for August in the company's history.</p>
            <p>ADATA stated that the rise in memory prices was the main reason for the increased sales in August. The total sales for the first eight months of the year were NT$31.928 billion, which is an 18.29% increase from the same period last year.</p>
            <p>Chen Li-Bai, the chairman of ADATA, said in a press release that the company is positive about orders for DDR4 and DDR5 DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>Chen Li-Bai also mentioned that suppliers of NAND Flash (storage memory) are still careful about how much they produce. On the demand side, data centers need a lot of storage, and new electronic products also need more storage. He expects the NAND Flash market to continue to grow steadily in the third quarter. ADATA expects strong business performance in the third quarter.</p>

            <h1>Matsu Art Island Gets Support from Locals and Businesses, Artworks Now in Hotel Lobbies</h1>
            <p>Artworks can now be seen in hotel lobbies and restaurants. The 3rd Matsu International Art Island has a special plan to work with local businesses. This allows art to stay in these places for longer. Chen Ching-Pao, a photographer from Matsu, also joined the plan. He used his camera to tell the stories of older people in the area.</p>
            <p>One of the plans for the 3rd Matsu International Art Island is called "Nong Ke Qi Zuo: Light, Don't Shine Out." The planner, Hsin Chi, told the media that this plan will have three groups of artworks. All of them are based on the history of "light control" during the time when Matsu was a military area. The artworks will be shown in restaurants and hotels. The goal is to let visitors feel the local atmosphere through these places where many people go.</p>
            <p>For example, one of the artworks is "Dark House Tiles" by artist Hsu Ching-Ting. It is displayed at the entrance of "Longfu Mountain Villa," the first legal hotel in Matsu. It uses wooden lamp frames that look like traditional Minnan-style wooden buildings. It also has "roof tiles," which are special to Matsu, and a large blackout curtain with words in Mindong language. This artwork reminds people of the time when Matsu was a military area, and every house had to cover its lights with cloth.</p>
            <p>Wang Yuan-Song, the general manager of Longfu Mountain Villa, said he noticed that more local people in Matsu are taking part in the art island events compared to the previous two years. When he heard that the Matsu Art Island was working with businesses for the first time, he immediately signed up. The Longfu Mountain Villa's building itself doesn't look much like traditional Matsu buildings. The "Dark House Tiles" artwork is planned to replace the hotel's old crystal chandelier in the future. He hopes this lamp, which shows Matsu's culture, will make the hotel feel more connected to the local area.</p>
            <p>Besides the business cooperation plan, some artworks from the Matsu Art Island will continue to be displayed after the exhibition ends. For example, "Fishing Tide," an artwork created by artist Liu Chih-Hung with Matsu residents and students, teaches traditional fishing net weaving methods. This artwork will become a permanent display in the "Wu Jian Pai" historical building in Qiaozai Village, Beigan, Matsu.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-Pao, who was born in Beigan, Matsu, is also one of the planners for this Matsu Art Island. Besides planning artworks, he is also showing his photography series "Ordinary Homes." This series features older people from the area. He went into their homes and photographed their lives. Some photos show living rooms with "wind lamps," which are special to Matsu. Others show older people who still follow old traditions, like believing that keeping a coffin in the corner of the house brings a long life.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-Pao said that people in Matsu used to make a living from traditional fishing for a long time. Their lives only improved a lot after martial law ended. People who lived through traditional fishing and military rule had a harder life. So, his main goal was to show respect to these older people and thank them for their hard work over the years.</p>
            <p>The 3rd Matsu International Art Island will take place from now until November 16.</p>
