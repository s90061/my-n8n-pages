The Milwaukee Bucks basketball team has decided to let go of their star player, Damian Lillard. They did this to sign Myles Turner, a center from the Indiana Pacers. Turner will get a four-year contract worth $107 million. Lillard's remaining salary of $113 million will be paid to him over the next five years.

Lillard got hurt in a game against the Pacers earlier this year. He injured his left Achilles tendon, which means he might not play for the entire 2025-26 season. Because of this, the Bucks chose to cut him to sign Turner.

Myles Turner has played for the Pacers for ten years, making him their longest-serving player. He wanted to stay with the Pacers, but after their loss in the finals, his team worked to get him a new contract. The Pacers also wanted to manage their money better because another player, Tyrese Haliburton, was injured. This helped the Bucks sign Turner.

This season, Turner played 72 games. He scored 15.6 points, got 6.5 rebounds, and blocked 2 shots per game. He also shot well, making 48.1% of his shots and 39.6% of his three-point shots. He helped the Pacers reach the finals.
