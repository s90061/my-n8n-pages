The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently issued a warning about the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on jobs. They said that about 60% of jobs in rich countries could be changed by AI. This means AI might either take over some tasks, making jobs easier, or even replace some jobs entirely.

In developing countries, the situation is different. Around 40% of jobs might be affected in emerging markets, and about 26% in low-income countries. This shows that the impact of AI will vary greatly around the world.

AI has the power to make workers more productive, leading to economic growth. However, it also creates challenges. Some workers might lose their jobs, and others will need to learn new skills. The IMF suggests that governments should prepare for these changes. They should offer training programs for workers and improve social support systems. This way, societies can benefit from AI while reducing its negative effects.

**Oceans Record Hottest Temperatures for Over a Year**

For the past 13 months in a row, the average temperature of the world's oceans has been the highest ever recorded for that time of year. Data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service shows this worrying trend. April 2024 marked the latest record-breaking month.

Scientists explain that this continuous warming is mainly due to climate change. Greenhouse gases, released by human activities, trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and oceans. Natural events like El NiÃ±o, which warms parts of the Pacific Ocean, have also added to the problem.

These rising ocean temperatures have serious consequences. They harm marine life, destroy coral reefs, and can lead to more extreme weather events like stronger storms and heavier rainfall. The warming also contributes to sea level rise, threatening coastal communities. Experts stress the urgent need to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to protect our planet's oceans.

**Cannes Film Festival Lights Up the French Riviera**

The 77th Cannes Film Festival is currently taking place on the beautiful French Riviera. This famous event is one of the most important gatherings in the global film industry. It brings together filmmakers, actors, producers, and critics from all over the world.

During the festival, many new films are shown for the first time, hoping to win the prestigious Palme d'Or award. Beyond the red carpet glamour, Cannes is also a major business event. Film companies buy and sell film rights, and important deals are made.

The festival also has a big impact on the local area. Hotels, restaurants, and other businesses in Cannes and nearby towns benefit greatly from the thousands of visitors, including film professionals and tourists. Discussions at the festival often touch on the future of cinema, including how streaming services and new technologies like AI are changing the industry.`;
