            <h1>Ni Peipei Receives Golden Bell Special Contribution Award, Thanks Late Brother Ni Min-ran</h1>
            <p>The Golden Bell Awards for radio were given out tonight. Ni Peipei, a well-known DJ who has worked in radio for over 50 years, received the Special Contribution Award. She thanked her brother, Ni Min-ran, who has passed away. She said, "He is a star in heaven. He taught me how to be professional in my work."</p>
            <p>This year, the Minister of Culture, Li Yuan, personally gave the Special Contribution Award to Liao Chiang-hua, a sound engineer, and to DJ Ni Peipei, who has worked in radio for half a century.</p>
            <p>In the 1980s, Ni Peipei became a very popular DJ with her program "Stars Tonight." She helped and inspired many people. She then changed from a radio host to a manager of radio stations. She has worked for 50 years without stopping.</p>
            <p>Ni Peipei said with emotion that her first teacher was her late brother, Ni Min-ran. "He is a star in heaven. He was very talented and full of new ideas. He influenced me a lot. He taught me how to speak well and how to be professional in my work."</p>
            <p>Also, sound engineers were very important behind the scenes in early radio programs. In the past, sound engineers had to create all sound effects by hand. This made radio programs feel real. Liao Chiang-hua, a sound engineer, worked behind the scenes his whole life. This was his first time to be on stage. Liao Chiang-hua said he thanked the listeners for their support. Because of them, there are sound engineers today. He hopes this art and culture can continue.</p>
            <p>Tang Chi-yang won the "Lifestyle Program Award" for podcasts at the Golden Bell Awards last year, which was her first time. This year, she gave out an award. She said, "I wish all radio workers well. Keep sharing your voices."</p>
            <p>Du Man-sheng, a well-known actor and voice actor, gave an award with actress Wang Chuan. Du Man-sheng, who is over 80 years old, joked that he watched Wang Chuan's shows when he was younger, and he can still watch her shows now.</p>

            <h1>Israel Moves Prisoners to Jails as It Prepares to Release Them Under Gaza Ceasefire Deal</h1>
            <p>Today, the Israeli prison service said that Israel has started moving prisoners to two jails. This is part of the plan to release prisoners following the ceasefire agreement in Gaza. The main goal of this agreement is for the Palestinian group Hamas to free the people they are holding.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas for the Gaza Strip says that Israel will release 250 prisoners. Some of these prisoners were sentenced to life in prison for deadly attacks. Hamas, on the other hand, must release the remaining 48 Israeli captives, alive or dead, by October 13th at the latest.</p>
            <p>The Israeli prison authority announced today that thousands of staff, including prison officers, worked all night to carry out the government's decision. This decision is part of a plan to ensure all Israeli captives are released.</p>

            <h1>Trump Adds 100% Tariff; Chinese Scholars Say He Is More Worried Than China</h1>
            <p>Shanghai, October 11th (CNA) â€“ U.S. President Donald Trump has said he will add a 100% tax on goods from China. This is because China has limited its exports of rare earth minerals. Scholars in mainland China say that China's strong stance recently is because the U.S. recently added more names to its "entity list" for sanctions. They believe the U.S. does not understand China's strong points in talks. They also think Trump is more worried than China. Trade talks between the U.S. and China in October will be very important.</p>
            <p>On October 10th, local time, Donald Trump said he would put a 100% tariff on goods from China starting November 1st. This is because China has been "very aggressive" in controlling rare earth mineral exports.</p>
            <p>Wu Xinbo, who leads the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University, told CNA that China's tougher approach towards the U.S. recently is mainly because of new rules from the U.S. Department of Commerce on September 29th. Xing Yuqing, an economics professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Japan, also thinks that this "entity list" is one reason why China is unhappy with the U.S.</p>
            <p>On September 29th, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced that it would expand its "entity list." This means that if a company has one or more subsidiaries (smaller companies it owns) that are more than 50% owned by a company on the list, then these subsidiaries will also be on the list. Companies on the entity list cannot get American goods and technology without the government's permission.</p>
            <p>Wu Xinbo said that this rule will affect many Chinese companies. Currently, about 2,000 Chinese companies are on the U.S. "entity list." If the new rule is followed, the subsidiaries of these companies will also face punishment. This means thousands of companies will be affected. He thinks that China's recent actions are a response to the September 29th rule because "that was a very bad thing."</p>
            <p>Also, this rule was announced on September 29th, but Trump and Xi Jinping had a phone call on September 19th. Wu Xinbo believes this shows that the U.S. does not truly want to improve relations. He said, "If the U.S. does this, China will naturally fight back."</p>
            <p>Wu Xinbo mentioned that China chose to limit rare earth exports because it found that some foreign companies bought rare earths from China and then sold them to the U.S. The U.S. then used these rare earths for military purposes. China has already stopped selling rare earths to U.S. military buyers. So, the goal of this new rare earth control policy is also to stop any loopholes.</p>
            <p>He thinks that even after talks, this rare earth limit will not be removed. However, rare earths for business use can still be exported normally if approved.</p>
            <p>Xing Yuqing believes that rare earths are China's most powerful tool for the next 2 to 5 years. He said, "China is getting better at using them now."</p>
            <p>Xing Yuqing stated that the U.S. does not fully understand China's strong points in trade talks, nor China's strong desire to reach a fair agreement. The U.S. and China have had three trade talks already, but there has been no progress. This "shows that it is very difficult for the U.S. and China to reach an agreement." He thinks that China will not agree to not place tariffs on the U.S., like the EU and Japan did.</p>
            <p>Besides rare earths, Xing Yuqing also pointed out that because the U.S. and China have different systems, "Chinese leaders and decision-makers do not need to look at the stock market" during trade talks. Also, China's system "allows its people and companies as a whole to handle pressure, or economic pressure, much better than the U.S." Even if the U.S. tries to block China with its advanced technology, China can still keep its economy running with older technology.</p>
            <p>Regarding future tariffs, Xing Yuqing believes that "China will certainly fight back." China will likely put the same tariffs on the U.S. The relationship between the U.S. and China could become tense again, like it was a few months ago. This will happen unless the U.S. removes its expanded "entity list" limits and lowers its tariffs.</p>
            <p>Wu Xinbo, however, thinks that "Trump is more worried than China" right now. The U.S. will still try to solve problems through talks. They might hope for good results from the trade talks in October. This is why the tariffs will start on November 1st. If there is real progress in the next round of trade talks, a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping might still happen.</p>
