            <h1>Major General Found Guilty of Stealing Washing Machine; Disciplinary Court Gives No Further Punishment</h1>
            <p>Major General Lin Cheng-chia (whose old name was Lin Ti-chih) was found guilty of corruption. He stole a washing machine from the government that cost 7990 NT dollars. He was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison. The court also decided he could not hold public office anymore. Because he already lost his right to hold public office, the Disciplinary Court decided not to give him another punishment. They said it would not be useful. People can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>The court's final criminal decision says that in December 2017, Major General Lin found out that the Kinmen Defense Command was buying washing machines for soldiers. He suggested buying one for the Deputy Chief of Staff. But the Deputy Chief of Staff did not need a new washing machine. So, Lin sent the washing machine to his home in Taiwan and kept it for himself. Later, Lin heard that people knew about it. He then bought the same type of washing machine and sent it back to the army camp. He sent the original washing machine back to Kinmen and put it in a friend's office. His friend did not know about this.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen District Court first gave Lin 12 years in prison and took away his public office rights for 3 years, based on the Anti-Corruption Act for stealing public property. The Kinmen Branch of the High Court then changed the sentence to 6 years and 8 months in prison and took away his public office rights for 3 years. Lin appealed again, but the Supreme Court rejected his appeal in January this year. So, the decision is final.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan decided to impeach Lin, and the case was sent to the Disciplinary Court. The Disciplinary Court recently decided not to give him another punishment, but this can still be appealed.</p>
            <p>The Disciplinary Court believes that because Lin was found guilty of corruption and lost his public office rights, he cannot be a public servant anymore, according to the Public Officials Appointment Act. If he were appointed, he would be fired. This result is similar to the most serious punishment under the Public Officials Disciplinary Act, which is "removal from office."</p>
            <p>The Disciplinary Court carefully considered his bad actions. They said his actions seriously hurt the values of public servants. He did not seem sorry for what he did, and his actions deserve strong criticism. However, because of the laws mentioned above, the court decided that giving him another punishment would not be useful. They said there is no need for another disciplinary action, and so they decided not to punish him further. This decision can still be appealed.</p>

            <h1>Police Officer Not Charged After Mother and Daughter Likely Die by Suicide Due to Scam</h1>
            <p>A mother and daughter in Neihu, Taipei, likely died by suicide because they were cheated out of money. The police officer, Mr. Liu, who was handling their scam case, was accused of helping them commit suicide. However, the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office decided today not to charge him with a crime.</p>
            <p>According to the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office, the family of the victims said that on December 4, 2024, Mr. Liu took the victims' report. They said they were cheated out of over 12 million NT dollars. The case needed more information. On December 6, Mr. Liu called them three times but got no answer. The fourth time he called, before someone picked up, he said to himself, "They didn't kill themselves, did they?" When the call connected, he said, "Oh, you're still alive."</p>
            <p>Mr. Liu also said on the phone things like, "That person cheated you. You borrowed 170 and have to pay back 250, wow!" and "You burned the original document, right? No way!" The victims' family believes that the victims decided to commit suicide after hearing Mr. Liu's words. Mr. Liu called a fifth time that afternoon but got no answer. The victims died by suicide in the evening.</p>
            <p>The victims' family reported the case to the police and accused Mr. Liu of helping with suicide. When Mr. Liu was questioned, he said that the victims were sad when he took their statement, but they never said they wanted to commit suicide. He also said that when he called, he was just talking to himself and did not mean to encourage them to commit suicide.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors listened to the call recording and read the written record. They also looked at the victims' suicide note and other evidence. They decided that even though Mr. Liu's words to the victims were not serious, he did not mean to make them commit suicide. The suicide note said that the victims were unhappy with Mr. Liu's attitude. But the whole note showed that they were sad because they lost a lot of money in the scam. After reporting to the police, Mr. Liu's bad attitude made them feel like committing suicide. The prosecutors decided there was not enough proof to charge Mr. Liu with a crime.</p>
            <p>Also, the prosecutors said that the victims' family and Mr. Liu have agreed. The family accepted Mr. Liu's apology and took back their accusation. So, he will not be charged today.</p>
            <p>Separately, for his work behavior, the Taipei City Police Department decided that Mr. Liu used bad words when handling the case. He was given a big punishment and moved to a different job. He was also sent to the Disciplinary Court. The Disciplinary Court first decided to suspend him from work for 6 months.</p>

            <h1>Fire at Closed Hot Spring Hotel in Miaoli Burns Outdoor Pool Cover; No One Hurt</h1>
            <p>A hot spring hotel in Miaoli County, called Jinshui Hot Spring Hotel, has been closed since July last year because of money problems. Early this morning, there was a fire at the hotel. Firefighters arrived quickly and put out the fire. Luckily, no one was trapped or hurt. However, the cover over the outdoor public hot spring pool and the pavilions were completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli County Fire Department said that at about 5 AM, they received a report that there was fire coming from the Jinshui Hot Spring Hotel in Tai'an Township. Fire trucks and people from the Tai'an and Dahu fire stations quickly went to the place. They found that the fire was in the cover over the outdoor public hot spring pool and the open-air pavilions. The fire also damaged the roof of a building nearby.</p>
            <p>Firefighters used water hoses to put out the fire. It took about 2 hours to stop the fire. After a first check of the fire area, they confirmed that no one was hurt. However, the wooden building's second and third floors, the stairs leading to the outdoor hot spring area, the public pool's cover, and the pavilions were all burned down. The reason for the fire is still being looked into.</p>
            <p>Local people said that Jinshui Hot Spring Hotel was the first hotel in Taiwan to get a special hot spring quality mark. It is also a very old and famous hotel in Tai'an Township. It was known for its hot springs for families and for health. Last year, news came out that it stopped operating for one year because of money problems. Now, it has also had a fire, which makes things even worse.</p>
