            <h1>Trump Announces Meeting with Russian President Putin in Alaska on August 15</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced today that he and Russian President Putin will meet on August 15 in Alaska, USA. More details will come later. People are watching to see if this meeting can help stop the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump was unhappy that the war between Russia and Ukraine was taking so long. He told Putin that Russia must agree to a peace deal with Ukraine by August 8, or face stronger punishments.</p>
            <p>But today, Trump seemed more hopeful about a peace deal. In the afternoon, he told reporters at the White House, "European leaders want peace. I believe President Putin also wants peace, and President Zelenskyy of Ukraine wants it too."</p>
            <p>"My feeling tells me that we have a chance to make peace happen."</p>
            <p>Later, Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that his important meeting with Putin will be on August 15 in Alaska. More information will be available soon.</p>
            <p>On August 6, Trump said that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, had a good meeting with Putin about ending the Russia-Ukraine war. Trump also said he might meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy soon to talk about the war.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that officials from Europe and Ukraine said Putin offered a wide peace plan to the Trump government this week. This plan asks Kyiv to give up a lot of land and for the world to accept Russia's claims, in exchange for stopping the fighting.</p>
            <p>European officials were very worried about Putin's offer. This is because it would make Ukraine give up the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine, and Russia would promise almost nothing else except stopping the fighting.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has lasted more than three years. Since Trump returned to the White House, he has been trying to make Russia and Ukraine stop fighting forever. But so far, he has not gotten Russia to agree to any big changes.</p>

            <h1>Azerbaijan and Armenia Make Peace, Agree to Nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, said that after signing a deal with Armenia to end their long conflict, he suggested they both nominate US President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan were at the White House today for what Trump called a "historic peace summit."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Armenia and Azerbaijan have promised to stop all fighting forever. They will also start trade, tourism, and diplomatic talks. They will respect each other's independence and land."</p>
            <p>At the White House event, Aliyev said, "Perhaps Prime Minister Pashinyan of Armenia and I can agree to send a nomination to the Nobel Committee together, suggesting that President Trump receive the Peace Prize."</p>
            <p>Pashinyan also said, "I think President Trump deserves the Nobel Prize, and we will support this and help it happen."</p>
