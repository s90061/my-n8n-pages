The rising cost of living is making many people change their daily spending habits. Families are trying to save money in various ways as prices for food, energy, and other necessities continue to increase.

One major change is how people shop for groceries. Many are now buying cheaper store brands instead of well-known ones. They are also looking more carefully for special offers and discounts. Eating out at restaurants is becoming less common, with more people choosing to cook at home to save money. Some are even cancelling subscriptions to streaming services or gyms that they don't use often. Driving less is another way people are cutting costs, especially with higher fuel prices. When it comes to holidays, people are looking for cheaper destinations or choosing to stay closer to home. Finally, buying second-hand items, like clothes or furniture, is becoming more popular as a way to get what you need without spending too much. These changes show how families are adapting their daily routines to deal with higher prices.

**AI as a Co-Worker: How Technology is Changing Jobs**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing the world of work, but experts believe it will mostly become a "co-worker" for many people rather than completely replacing them. A recent report suggests that AI will transform jobs by helping employees do their tasks better and faster.

Instead of taking jobs away, AI tools are expected to work alongside human workers. This means that people will need to learn new skills to use these technologies effectively. For example, AI might help write reports, analyze large amounts of data, or even manage customer interactions. This frees up human workers to focus on more creative, complex, or strategic tasks that require human judgment and empathy. The report highlights that companies and employees should focus on learning and adapting to these new AI tools. This shift could lead to more interesting and productive jobs, as AI takes over repetitive tasks, allowing people to concentrate on higher-value work.

**Dealing with Too Many Tourists: The Challenge of Overtourism**

After the pandemic, travel has returned strongly, but some popular destinations are now facing a new problem: "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors arrive at a place, causing damage to the environment, disturbing local life, and making the experience less enjoyable for everyone.

Many famous places, from historic cities to beautiful islands, are struggling to manage the large numbers of tourists. For instance, cities like Amsterdam and Venice are introducing new rules to control tourist flow. This includes charging entry fees, limiting the number of daily visitors, or restricting short-term rentals. Locals often feel overwhelmed by the crowds, noise, and rising prices caused by tourism. Authorities are trying to find a balance â€“ welcoming visitors who bring money to the local economy, but also protecting the unique character and quality of life in these places. The goal is to encourage more sustainable tourism that benefits both visitors and residents.
