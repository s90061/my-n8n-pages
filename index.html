            <h1>After Kirk's Death, "South Park" Episode Stops Replaying</h1>
            <p>The American cartoon "South Park" recently had an episode where one of the main characters acted like Charlie Kirk, a conservative person from the USA. After Charlie Kirk was killed recently, the TV channel stopped showing this episode.</p>
            <p>ABC News said that Charlie Kirk was a right-wing political speaker. He started a group called "Turning Point USA" for young conservative people. He was shot and died on September 10th during an outdoor speech at Utah Valley University in Utah, USA.</p>
            <p>In early August, the American TV channel Comedy Central showed a "South Park" episode. In this episode, one of the main characters, Eric Cartman, acted like another Charlie Kirk. He copied Kirk's actions and his direct way of arguing.</p>
            <p>According to People magazine, Eric Cartman also had a right-wing podcast in the show, just like Kirk. On this podcast, he argued with people who had different ideas. Also, one character in the show received an award named after Kirk.</p>
            <p>After the episode was shown, Kirk said on his TikTok account on August 7th that it was "super funny." He said, "Part of it was just silly humor, but it was very funny." He also shared a part where Eric Cartman argued on a podcast. Kirk said this showed "our popular culture took over Comedy Central's best viewing time. 'South Park' shows how important and influential we are."</p>
            <p>Kirk had almost 8.5 million followers on TikTok. He changed his profile picture to Eric Cartman from that episode. He also said that he knew beforehand that his name would be in the show. He said, "Someone told me, 'Charlie, if they mention your name, it's a big win.' And there really was a 'Charlie Kirk Award' in the show."</p>
            <p>However, after Kirk was shot, many of his conservative supporters still criticized the people who make "South Park." They said the show made fun of him and attacked conservative people.</p>
            <p>This episode was supposed to be shown again on the evening of September 10th. But after the event, Comedy Central stopped all re-runs. You can still watch it on streaming services like Paramount+, though.</p>

            <h1>Japan Sends F-15 Fighter Jets to Europe and Canada for the First Time to Build Stronger Defense Ties</h1>
            <p>Today, Japan's Defense Minister, Gen Nakatani, said that Japan will send its Air Self-Defense Force F-15 fighter jets to countries like the UK, Germany, and Canada starting on the 14th. This is the first time Japan has sent its fighter jets to Europe and Canada. Japan hopes to work more closely with these countries through defense talks.</p>
            <p>NHK, a Japanese news organization, reported that Gen Nakatani made this announcement at a press conference after a cabinet meeting today.</p>
            <p>F-15 fighter jets from Japan's Chitose Air Base, along with air refueling planes and transport planes from Komaki and Iruma Air Bases, will go to the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Germany from the 14th of this month until October 1st.</p>
            <p>This will be the first time that Japan's Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets are sent to Europe and Canada. The goal is for military units to learn from each other by observing the fighter jets and for soldiers to share ideas. There are no plans for joint training exercises.</p>
            <p>About sending the F-15 fighter jets, Nakatani said, "Safety in the European Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific regions is connected and cannot be separated. Sending these fighter jets shows this agreement. We hope to make our cooperation with allied countries and countries that share our ideas even stronger."</p>
            <p>Regarding what European countries think, Nakatani pointed out that "fighter jets and ships are sent to areas around Japan regularly, which clearly shows more focus on the Indo-Pacific region." He added, "It is very important for Japan and other countries' air forces to make their defense cooperation and discussions stronger."</p>
            <p>John Healey, the UK's Secretary of State for Defence, spoke about Japan's Air Self-Defense Force fighter jets being sent to the UK and other European countries when he visited Japan in late August.</p>
