            <h1>Prolog Re-Cycle Technology Sees Good Market for Food-Grade Recycled Flat Containers; New Production Line Starts in November</h1>
            <p>Today, Lin Yu-chun, who is the chief financial officer for Prolog Re-Cycle Technology, said something important. Besides recycling plastic bottles, the company also sees good opportunities in recycling flat food containers. They have a new factory line in Pinghu, Zhejiang, China, which will start working in November. Prolog Re-Cycle Technology explained that their new system for cleaning and recycling flat containers (Trays) helps solve problems in washing these items. They will use their own cleaning lines to make this technology ready for sale.</p>
            <p>Prolog Re-Cycle Technology held a meeting with investors today. Lin Yu-chun said that their factory line for recycling plastic bottles can make 20,000 tons each year, and this is for the American market. The new factory line for recycling flat food containers can also make 20,000 tons each year. At first, this will be for the Chinese market. But in the future, the company wants to mainly sell the machines for recycling in places like China, India, Southeast Asia, Europe, and America.</p>
            <p>Ou Yifeng, the vice general manager of Zhejiang Prolog Re-Cycle Technology, explained that Europe and America already have machines to recycle flat food containers. However, these machines do not work as well as the machines made by Prolog Re-Cycle Technology. So, the new factory line in November for recycling flat food containers should really be a "showcase" line. Its main purpose is to let other recycling companies see how well it works and then buy machines from Prolog Re-Cycle Technology.</p>
            <p>Also, Prolog Re-Cycle Technology thinks the recycled plastic market in India will grow a lot. They have started a company there. This will help them make products in India, give better service, and build local supply chains. Prolog Re-Cycle Technology says that the recycled plastic market in India is expected to be worth 5.277 billion US dollars by 2028. It is expected to grow by 5.6% each year.</p>
            <p>Prolog Re-Cycle Technology also explained that the need for recycled plastic bottles is growing in India. Right now, India can recycle 400,000 tons of plastic bottles each year. They plan to increase this to 750,000 tons by 2027. By 2030, they expect it to be between 1 million and 1.2 million tons each year.</p>
            <p>Prolog Re-Cycle Technology's reports show that in the first half of this year, their total income was 2.45 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is about 6.5% more than the same time last year. Their profit per share was 2.28 New Taiwan Dollars, which is about 15.7% more than last year.</p>
            <p>About money exchange rates, Lin Yu-chun said that in the second quarter, rates changed a lot. But this mostly affected their income. This is because many payments they needed to get and pay were in the Chinese market. Even though the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger against the US Dollar in the second quarter, the Chinese Yuan stayed quite stable against the US Dollar. This helped the company avoid losing money from exchange rates. In fact, they even made some money from exchange rates in the second quarter.</p>

            <h1>TSMC: US Government Ends Exemption for Nanjing Factory; Company Evaluating Next Steps</h1>
            <p>Today, TSMC, a company that makes computer chips, announced something important. They received a message from the US government. The special permission called "Verified End-User" (VEU) for their factory in Nanjing, China, will end on December 31, 2025. TSMC is now looking at the situation and planning what to do. They want to make sure that their Nanjing factory can continue to work without problems.</p>
            <p>Recently, the US government announced that it would stop special permissions for American companies like Intel, and Korean companies like Samsung and SK Hynix. These permissions allowed them to get American chip-making equipment in China. Today, TSMC confirmed that they also received a notice from the US government. The special "Verified End-User" permission for their Nanjing factory will also end on December 31, 2025.</p>
            <p>TSMC said that they are looking at the situation carefully and preparing to take the right actions. This includes talking with the US government. They want to work hard to ensure that the operations of their Nanjing factory are not affected.</p>
            <p>In 2024, the US Department of Commerce gave the "Verified End-User" permission to TSMC's Nanjing factory. This official VEU permission took the place of a temporary written permission that the Department of Commerce had given since October 2022.</p>
            <p>This VEU permission from the Department of Commerce did not give new powers. It just confirmed that goods and services under US export laws could continue to be given to TSMC's Nanjing factory for a long time. Suppliers did not need to get separate licenses. This VEU permission kept things the same for TSMC's Nanjing factory to make computer chips. Now that the VEU permission will be stopped, there will be more uncertainties for the Nanjing factory's future work.</p>

            <h1>"The Devil Wears Prada" Inspiration Hands Over Role: New Leader for US Vogue Announced</h1>
            <p>Today, a very famous person announced something in New York. Anna Wintour, who was the main editor of American "Vogue" magazine, left her job in June this year. After many months of guesses, she finally said that Chloe Malle, who was the editor of the Vogue website, will now be the new editorial director for American Vogue.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Anna Wintour, who led American Vogue for almost 40 years, said in June that she would stop being the main editor. After that, this important job was advertised online on LinkedIn during the summer.</p>
            <p>Even though Anna Wintour is no longer the main editor of American Vogue, she still has big roles. She is the global editorial director for Vogue and the chief content officer for Conde Nast, a big media company. In these jobs, she will look after the editing of other magazines like GQ, Teen Vogue, and Vanity Fair.</p>
            <p>Chloe Malle, who is 39 years old, will now manage the daily work for American Vogue across all its platforms. She will report directly to Anna Wintour.</p>
            <p>The Vogue website also announced this new staff news today. In the news story, Chloe Malle said: "Fashion and media are changing very fast. I am very excited and feel great respect to be a part of it. I also feel very lucky that Anna (Wintour) will still be here to guide me."</p>
            <p>Chloe Malle first started working at Vogue in 2011 as a social editor. She wrote articles about weddings, parties, and other fun and easy topics.</p>
            <p>In 2016, she became a contributing editor. From 2023, she worked as the editor for the Vogue website, looking after all the digital content for the magazine. She has also interviewed famous people for cover stories, such as model Gigi Hadid and Greta Gerwig, the director of the movie "Barbie."</p>
            <p>Besides managing the website's editing, in 2022, Chloe Malle also became a "voice" for Vogue. She co-hosted "The Run-Through with Vogue," which is the magazine's only podcast at the moment, with Chioma Nnadi, the editorial director of British Vogue.</p>
            <p>Recently, Chloe Malle also released the second issue of "Dogue." This is a special digital magazine from Vogue made for famous people's pet dogs. Also, for Vogue's June cover story, she interviewed Lauren Sanchez, who is the wife of Jeff Bezos, the person who started Amazon. They had a big wedding at that time.</p>
