https://www.bbc.com/news/business-67756857

Many people are worried about paying their energy bills. The cost of living has risen, making it harder for households to afford necessities. If you are finding it difficult, there are steps you can take to get help.

First, contact your energy supplier immediately. They must offer you support. This could include a payment plan you can afford, or pausing your payments for a short time. They might also offer grants to help you clear debt. You should also check if you are eligible for any government schemes, such as the Winter Fuel Payment or the Warm Home Discount. These provide money to help with heating costs.

It's also a good idea to seek independent advice. Organizations like Citizens Advice or National Energy Action can provide free, confidential help. They can check if you are getting all the benefits you should be and help you understand your rights. They can also assist you in negotiating with your energy company. Taking action early can prevent problems from becoming worse.

**The Four-Day Week: Why More Companies Are Trying It**

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68551460

The idea of working four days a week instead of five is becoming more popular around the world. Companies are experimenting with this new model, where employees still work full-time hours but spread them over fewer days, often without losing pay. This change aims to improve the work-life balance for staff.

Supporters say a four-day week can make employees happier and more productive. When people have more time off, they feel less stressed and more motivated. This can lead to better quality work and fewer sick days. Some studies have shown that companies trying this model have seen increased profits and reduced staff turnover.

However, it's not suitable for all jobs or industries. For some businesses, like those that need to be open constantly, a four-day week can be difficult to manage. Critics also worry about the impact on customer service or if employees might feel pressured to do too much work in less time. Despite these challenges, interest continues to grow as companies look for new ways to support their workforce and attract talent.

**Travel Green: How to Be a Sustainable Tourist on a Budget**

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/sustainable-travel-tips-budget-friendly/index.html

More and more people want to travel in a way that helps the planet and local communities. This is called sustainable travel. Many believe it has to be expensive, but you can actually travel responsibly without spending a lot of money. Small changes can make a big difference.

One tip is to choose destinations that are not too crowded, especially during peak seasons. This helps to reduce the pressure on popular tourist spots. When you are there, try to support local businesses. Eat at local restaurants, buy souvenirs from local artists, and stay in small, locally-owned guesthouses. This puts money directly into the community.

Also, think about how you travel. Using public transport like trains and buses instead of taxis or rental cars reduces your carbon footprint. Try to fly less often, and if you do fly, choose direct flights. Finally, reduce your waste. Bring a reusable water bottle, avoid single-use plastics, and respect local customs and the environment you are visiting. Being a responsible traveler benefits everyone.`;
