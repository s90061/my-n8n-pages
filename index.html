            <h1>Chang Chun-hsiung Dies, Joseph Wu Remembers Him as a Calm and Steady Example</h1>
            <p>Former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung, who was also a senior advisor to the President, passed away today at the age of 87. Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said that he felt sad and missed Chang Chun-hsiung when he heard the news before his trip. Chang Chun-hsiung became Premier twice when things were difficult, but he always used his calm and steady nature to help make the political situation stable. He is a good example for younger people to learn from.</p>
            <p>Wu wrote on Facebook in the evening that he felt sad and missed Chang Chun-hsiung. Looking back at Chang Chun-hsiung's life, he graduated from National Taiwan University with a law degree and passed the lawyer's exam. He had a strong spirit and courage to fight for justice.</p>
            <p>Wu pointed out that the Kaohsiung Incident was a turning point in Chang Chun-hsiung's life. He was not afraid of the government's power at that time. He showed courage as a lawyer and bravely stood up to be part of the defense team for the Kaohsiung Incident. Their bravery encouraged many young students, including Wu himself, and started many democracy movements in Taiwan. It also reminds everyone that democracy and freedom are not easy to get.</p>
            <p>Wu remembered that when former President Chen Shui-bian was first elected president in 2000, Chang Chun-hsiung was the campaign manager. His calm, steady, and good communication skills helped Chen win the election. After that, he was the leader of the team that handled the transfer of power when the political party in charge changed for the first time. At that time, Wu first met and worked with Chang Chun-hsiung when he was helping to form a national policy advisory group.</p>
            <p>Wu said that Chang Chun-hsiung became Premier twice when things were difficult. But he always used his calm and steady nature to help make the political situation stable. He is a good example for younger people to learn from.</p>
            <p>Wu remembered that when he was an advisor to the National Security Council, he wanted to make relations better with Russia. So, he helped set up the Taiwan-Russia Association and asked Chang Chun-hsiung to be its first chairman. Now that he is the Foreign Minister, he feels very grateful for Chang Chun-hsiung's help in Taiwan's foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>Besides working together, Wu said that after Chang Chun-hsiung retired, they often met. Whether visiting him in Kaohsiung or meeting at gatherings, Chang Chun-hsiung and his wife were always kind like family elders. They always cared for and encouraged Wu and his wife Liao Wan-ju. Chang Chun-hsiung's advice was very helpful for Wu and his wife throughout their lives.</p>
            <p>Wu said that being a teacher in prison was the most important thing to Chang Chun-hsiung during his life. He hoped that those who made mistakes would change their ways. This showed his spirit of not caring about fame or money but standing up for justice when needed.</p>
            <p>"Wise men are long gone, but their example remains," Wu said. He felt grateful for Chang Chun-hsiung's life and believed that Chang Chun-hsiung has not really left everyone. Instead, he has become like many gentle breezes, staying with everyone to protect their beloved Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>German State Premier to Visit Taiwan on the 28th, Will Meet TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei</h1>
            <p>The German Institute Taipei announced today that Michael Kretschmer, the Premier of Saxony, Germany, will visit Taiwan tomorrow. During his visit, he will go to TSMC and talk with Chairman C.C. Wei. They will mainly discuss how the TSMC factory in Dresden, the capital of Saxony, is being built. This trip is also the first time a German federal state leader has visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The German Institute Taipei said today that Kretschmer will lead a delegation from Saxony to visit Taiwan from September 28 to October 1. This is part of his trip to Asia, and he will also visit Japan and Singapore. The delegation includes people from business and science, as well as Dirk Panter, the Minister of Economy for Saxony, Sebastian Gemkow, the Minister of Science, members of the Saxony state parliament, and mayors.</p>
            <p>The German Institute Taipei noted that Taiwan is a very good partner for Germany in many areas, and there is a lot of room to make their existing exchanges stronger, especially in science, economy, and culture. These are the main points of Kretschmer's trip.</p>
            <p>The German Institute Taipei stated that Kretschmer will attend the opening ceremony of the Saxony-Taiwan Science Conference in Taiwan. He will also give a speech at the Taiwan Sustainability Summit and talk with the National Palace Museum about possible cooperation. Another important part of his trip is to visit TSMC and meet with Chairman C.C. Wei. They will focus on the progress of building the TSMC factory in Dresden, the capital of Saxony.</p>
            <p>The German Institute Taipei explained that this is the first time a leader from a German federal state has visited Taiwan. In Germany's federal system, things like education, research, vocational training, culture, and helping the economy grow (for example, attracting foreign companies) are the responsibility of each state government. Therefore, the main points of this visit are within the state's power. Kretschmer will also be a special guest at the German National Day dinner organized by the German Institute Taipei on September 30.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen-Brunei Charter Flights Begin; Brunei Office: A New Start for Visa-Free Travel</h1>
            <p>Taiwan and Brunei now have visa-free travel for both sides. The Taiwan Representative Office in Brunei announced that on September 26, the first "Kinmen-Brunei" charter flights started. This is not only a big step forward in tourism cooperation but also connects the historical ties and family links between the two places that go back more than a hundred years.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the Taiwan Representative Office in Brunei, since Taiwan and Brunei started visa-free travel in June this year, exchanges between them have become more frequent, and their friendship has grown stronger. After the visa-free policy, the first "Kinmen-Brunei" charter flights started on September 26.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in Brunei said that this charter flight took more than 140 people from Kinmen to Brunei. At the same time, it also brought almost 100 Chinese people from Brunei to Kinmen to visit their ancestral home. This round trip is a new important step for tourism and cultural exchange since the visa-free policy started.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in Brunei noted that many descendants of Kinmen immigrants live in Brunei. Since the 19th century, many people from Kinmen bravely crossed the sea to live in Brunei. They helped build the economy there and played important roles in education, business, and culture. They grew together with the local society and became a key part of the Chinese community in Brunei. This history of immigration, lasting over a hundred years, has made the strong connection between Kinmen and Brunei even stronger, giving this charter flight a deeper historical meaning.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in Brunei said that Hsiao Sheng-chung, the representative in Brunei, went to Brunei International Airport to say hello to the people from Brunei leaving for Taiwan and to welcome the people from Kinmen. The Brunei Tourism Board also sent representatives to the event and arranged traditional cultural performances with local flavor. Hsiao Sheng-chung said that this charter flight is not just about tourism. It also connects the deep friendship between the people of both places. In the future, the office will continue to hold different cultural activities to help people from both sides understand each other better and strengthen their friendship.</p>
