            <h1>Referendum and Recall Votes Fail, Expert Says DPP's 10-Year Advantage Ends</h1>
            <p>The vote to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant did not pass because it did not reach the required number of votes. Also, the recall attempts against seven Kuomintang (KMT) legislators all failed. Professor Ogasawara Yoshiyuki from National Tsing Hua University, a Japanese scholar, said today that these results show that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s advantage over the past 10 years has finished. He believes that both the ruling and opposition parties are now equally strong.</p>
            <p>Professor Ogasawara wrote on Facebook that the referendum was about "restarting the Third Nuclear Power Plant, which stopped running in May this year." This was actually a public vote on the DPP government's goal to have a nuclear-free country. The smaller opposition party, the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), started this idea. The KMT supported it, and the DPP was against it. In the end, there were over 4.34 million "yes" votes (74.2%) and over 1.51 million "no" votes (25.8%). Although "yes" votes were much higher, the referendum did not pass because it did not meet the legal requirement of 25% of all eligible voters. Compared to the 2021 referendum, which had a 41.1% voter turnout, this time it was 29.5%, showing fewer people voted.</p>
            <p>The recall votes were for the remaining seven KMT legislators. None of these recall attempts passed. In total, 33.9% of votes were for recall, and 66.1% were against. This difference was even bigger than the first round in July, which involved 24 KMT legislators. The overall voter turnout for these seven areas was 49.3%, which is lower than the previous 56.1%. This suggests that fewer DPP supporters chose to vote.</p>
            <p>Professor Ogasawara pointed out that the results of the recall votes were clear by July 24th. So, these new recall attempts were just like a "game that doesn't matter much." The KMT felt very positive, while DPP supporters were not very interested. After both rounds of recall votes, all 31 KMT legislators kept their positions. He had already said in July that this would be "a big hit to President Lai Ching-te's government and the DPP," and he did not need to change his opinion now.</p>
            <p>He also stressed that the referendum clearly showed that most people in Taiwan want the government to change its nuclear-free policy. In the 2010s, more people supported a nuclear-free policy. However, in recent years, there has been a huge need for electricity because of the semiconductor and AI industries. Also, renewable energy projects have been slow, leading to more reliance on power plants that burn fossil fuels. This has made the "nuclear-free country" policy face problems. On top of this, solar panels have caused worries about the environment and corruption, which has made people concerned.</p>
            <p>He explained that because of these results, it is important to check if "nuclear-free country" has become just a slogan. He also thinks the arguments for it might need to be updated.</p>
            <p>Professor Ogasawara concluded that the "Summer Battle" of 2025 ended with a big loss for the DPP and a big win for the opposition parties. This again proves that the DPP's 10 years of being stronger, from 2014 to 2024, are over. Taiwan's politics has now entered a time where the ruling and opposition parties are equally strong. The DPP needs to rebuild its two main ideas: "resisting China and protecting Taiwan" and "a nuclear-free country." The opposition parties, however, cannot just rely on "being against the DPP." This alone might not be enough to change the ruling party. The party that learns from these events will have an advantage in the 2028 election.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Men's Volleyball Loses to South Korea in East Asia Championship, Finishes Second for 4th Time</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's volleyball team played against South Korea in the final match of the Asian Eastern Zone Volleyball Championship. Taiwan lost with scores of 22-25, 22-25, and 16-25. This means they have finished second for the fourth time in a row in the history of the event. Coach Huang Hung-yu said that their first goal was to reach the top four, so he is happy with getting second place.</p>
            <p>The Asian Eastern Zone Men's Volleyball Championship took place in Zhangjiagang, China. The Taiwan men's team was mostly made up of players who will play in the Rhein-Ruhr World University Games. They were missing their star player, Chang Yu-sheng, who plays in Japan. However, they still had young and talented players like Wen Yi-kai and Chang Yu-chen. Together, they managed to beat the home team, China, by 3 sets to 2 in the semi-finals. This helped the Taiwan men's team reach the final for the eighth time in a row.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's team faced their strong opponent, South Korea, again in the final. They hoped to get revenge for losing to them in five sets during the preliminary round. However, the Taiwan team could not handle the pressure. They made mistakes at important times, which led to them losing the first two sets with scores of 22-25 and 22-25.</p>
            <p>With no chance to turn back, the Taiwan men's team still could not stop South Korea's strong attacks in the third set, which was their last chance. They also could not control their mistakes, so the point difference kept growing. In the end, they lost again with a score of 16-25. This means they finished second in the Asian Eastern Zone Men's Volleyball Championship for the fourth time in a row. They also missed their chance to win the championship again after their last win in 2013.</p>
            <p>After the match, Coach Huang Hung-yu told reporters that their original goal was to reach the top four. So, getting second place was better than they expected. He also said that giving other training players a chance to play in international games will help Taiwan men's volleyball find new talented players in the future. He believes that the team's good mood is their biggest strength. They face wins or losses with a positive attitude, and "even if there are mistakes, they don't blame teammates right away."</p>
            <p>However, Coach Huang Hung-yu pointed out that he hopes the players will feel how strong foreign volleyball teams are. After this, he wants them to keep working on their power and serving ability, especially to make fewer mistakes. He said, "When we play against higher-level teams in the future, being stable is a sign of good performance. This will then show the team's true strength."</p>

            <h1>Recall Attempts Against Seven KMT Legislators All Fail; Foreign Media Says Political Stalemate May Worsen</h1>
            <p>Today, all recall attempts against seven Kuomintang (KMT) legislators in Taiwan failed. Foreign news agencies say that voters again rejected the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s efforts to get more seats in the Legislative Yuan. This could make the political situation more difficult and make it harder for Taiwan to increase its defense spending and stand against growing pressure from Beijing.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the DPP did not win more than half of the seats in the national election last year. This was the ruling party's second try in a month to regain control of the Legislative Yuan. However, the vote counting showed that the DPP had failed again and again.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that in the first round of recall votes on July 26th, all 24 KMT legislators also kept their jobs. The ruling DPP faced a big loss.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that these failures happened because President Lai Ching-te focused on the difficult relationship with China, instead of concentrating more on issues that affect people's daily lives. This made voters tired of voting. Most people expected the results of the second round of recall votes. All major political parties did not strongly encourage their supporters to vote this time.</p>
            <p>The failure of the recall attempts might make the political situation even harder. The opposition parties might continue to challenge President Lai's plans. Important issues include next year's government budget, defense spending, and the approval of new Grand Justices.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Lai spoke at the Presidential Office tonight about the voting results. He said that Premier Cho Jung-tai had offered to resign many times after the July 26th recall vote. But President Lai wants Premier Cho to stay in his position and continue with his important duties.</p>
            <p>President Lai stated that the cabinet will make necessary changes to its staff. This is to make the team work better and to make people feel the government's actions more.</p>
            <p>Also, the referendum to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant, which happened at the same time today, did not get enough votes to pass.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the DPP does not want to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant. They say it should only happen if safety can be guaranteed and a solution for nuclear waste can be found. The main opposition party, the KMT, supports restarting the Third Nuclear Power Plant. They believe nuclear power is needed for energy security.</p>
            <p>After the referendum results were announced, President Lai said he respects the results. He added, "I also fully understand society's hopes for different energy choices."</p>
            <p>President Lai said: "For decades, while people have discussed nuclear power, the biggest agreement in Taiwanese society has been 'safety'... Nuclear safety is a scientific problem. Scientific problems that need to be tested cannot be completely solved by just one referendum." A survey released earlier this month by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation showed that 66.4% of people agreed that the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue to operate after the relevant authority confirms there are no safety concerns.</p>
            <p>However, some people commented that this referendum was a waste of time. This is because restarting the Third Nuclear Power Plant depends on the "relevant authority" giving its approval first.</p>
            <p>Chen Fang-yu, an assistant professor in the Political Science Department at Soochow University, said: "It doesn't matter if it passes or not. The decision is in the government's hands, so it won't make any difference at all."</p>
