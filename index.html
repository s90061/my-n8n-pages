The BRICS summit is happening in Brazil from July 6-7. They will talk about the war in Gaza and artificial intelligence (AI). But they might not talk about using less US dollars. This is to avoid problems with the US, especially because of trade taxes.

China's leader, Xi Jinping, will not be there. Premier Li Qiang will go instead. Russia's leader, Putin, will join online. Iran's leader, Pezeshkian, will also not come because of the conflict between Iran and Israel. Experts say the countries will share their ideas on global problems. They will be careful not to upset the US President Trump.

Brazil's foreign minister said BRICS countries always try to agree on important global issues, like the Middle East. They will also discuss AI and how to improve global rules. A plan to use other currencies instead of the US dollar might be put on hold. An expert said the meeting will be very careful. They probably won't even mention the US in their final statement. Talking about other currencies is almost "not allowed" because Trump threatened to put high taxes on countries that try to use less US dollars.

**Former Hong Kong Judge Says National Security Law Is Above Basic Law**

Brenda Hale, a judge from the UK, used to work as a judge in Hong Kong's highest court. She left in 2021. She recently said that Hong Kong's National Security Law (NSL) is now more important than its Basic Law. She feels her choice to leave was correct. The Hong Kong government says her words are not true.

Ms. Hale said she was meant to work in Hong Kong before the NSL started. She thought Hong Kong had an independent legal system. She didn't hear cases for three years because of the pandemic. When she decided not to stay in 2021, she felt it was time to leave quietly because the NSL had started. Now, she is more certain her decision was right because the NSL has become stronger than the Basic Law.

She said that even if foreign judges don't work on security cases, they are still part of the system. She believes many lawyers in Hong Kong are trying their best, but it is difficult for them. She also mentioned the case of Jimmy Lai, who was not allowed to choose his own lawyer from the UK. She called this a clear example of Beijing's direct control over Hong Kong's courts. She said, "You don't want to be part of such a legal system." The Hong Kong government said on July 4 that Ms. Hale's comments about the NSL and Hong Kong's laws are wrong. They especially disagreed that the NSL is more important than the Basic Law. They stated that a decision by China's top lawmaking body in 2022 about the NSL did not harm Hong Kong courts' ability to make independent decisions.

**Typhoon Danas Nears: Taiwan Army Raises Alert Level for Disaster Response**

Typhoon Danas is now a medium-strength typhoon, and its strong winds are covering a wider area. Taiwan's army said today that they have raised their disaster response level to the highest alert (Level 1). They are working with the main government and Ministry of Defense disaster centers. The army has told all its areas to prepare soldiers and machines for helping with the disaster. They have also told all army areas to be more careful, watch the typhoon closely, and look for any damage in local areas.

The weather office said at 11 AM that Typhoon Danas has become stronger and covers a larger area. They have issued a warning for land areas in Taiwan and Penghu. There is also a warning for the sea around Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait. The army headquarters said they are now at Level 1 alert. They have sent officers to local governments to help share information and control the soldiers helping with the disaster.

The army said they are still doing their regular military duties and preparing for exercises. But they have also ordered all army areas to stay alert for the typhoon and any local damage. They are ready to help with disaster rescue when local governments ask them to, to keep people safe.
