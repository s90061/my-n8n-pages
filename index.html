            <h1>Kinmen Town Representative Indicted for Road Fight</h1>
            <p>Mr. Weng, a town representative in Kinmen, and Mr. Cai had a conflict. Mr. Weng is accused of crashing his car into Mr. Cai's car and then attacking him with weapons along with his friends. Later, Mr. Cai told the prosecutor it was only a verbal argument. But after investigation, the Kinmen District Prosecutor's Office today charged Mr. Weng with starting a public fight and other crimes. Mr. Cai was also charged with lying under oath.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen District Prosecutor's Office announced today that on the evening of October 30, 2024, Mr. Weng and his friends had a fight with Mr. Cai outside Mr. Cai's home. After that, Mr. Cai drove his car around his neighborhood while drunk. Mr. Weng, still angry from the earlier fight, drove with his friends to Mr. Cai's home to get revenge. Mr. Weng first crashed his car into Mr. Cai's car. Then, he and his friends used unknown weapons to attack Mr. Cai and his friends, who had come to help, on the public road. This caused several injuries to Mr. Cai and his friends.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they tested Mr. Cai's breath, and it showed 0.49 milligrams of alcohol per liter. He was then taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor said that Mr. Cai, after promising to tell the truth, falsely stated that it was only a verbal argument and denied that anyone used weapons or had a physical fight. He also said his injuries were from broken glass. He tried to hide the fact that Mr. Weng and others were involved in a group fight.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor explained that Mr. Weng and his friends are charged with crimes against public safety and with carrying weapons and causing danger by fighting in a public place with three or more people. Mr. Cai is charged with driving dangerously under the influence and with lying under oath. The case has been investigated and charges have been filed according to the law.</p>

            <h1>Ceramic Art Exhibition by Bali Charity Home Residents Shows Resilience</h1>
            <p>From today until September 7, the New Taipei City Bali Charity Home is holding a special exhibition called "Ceramics: The Art of Clay" at the Hurei Arts and Culture Leisure Park. The exhibition shows hundreds of ceramic artworks made by the residents of the home using their fingers to shape the clay and their feet to turn the potter's wheel. These works show their strong spirit and creativity.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Social Welfare Department said that the ceramic art exhibition opened today at the "Hurei Story House" in Hurei Arts and Culture Leisure Park. The opening event began with volunteers from the Yizhu Charity Association joining residents from the wheelchair ballroom dancing group, who performed graceful dances.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhang Yao-quan, the teacher of the ceramic art group, said that he teaches each resident how to make ceramics based on their own physical and mental abilities. For example, Chen Wei-ru, a resident with cerebral palsy, can only use her left thumb and index finger. In each class, she can only make four or five leaves at most. However, she still completed a four-stage "ceramic bamboo" artwork, which is very impressive.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei-ru shared that making the art was hard. Especially in summer, clay dries quickly, so she had to spray water on it often to keep it wet. But she kept working hard. Once, she made 50 ducks in three months. After they were baked, they became yellow small ducks and green-headed ducks. She said that seeing the finished products come out of the kiln is the happiest time.</p>
            <p>Ms. Lin Hsiu-sui, a specialist from the Social Welfare Department, said that the residents use their art to overcome their physical limits and leave their own special mark on life. She thanked Hurei Arts and Culture Leisure Park for giving them a free space to show their works, which helps society see the amazing talent of these artists.</p>
            <p>Ms. Ji Wei-qi, the general manager of the park, said that in the future, the residents' artworks will be turned into creative products, such as calla lily flowers, mushroom-shaped chopstick rests, and small plates. This will change the artworks into useful designs, encourage more creation, and help the residents earn money.</p>
            <p>The director of the home, Ms. Liu Wen-hsiang, said that residents will also plan regular times to offer eight "Penguin Clay DIY Experience Classes." They will personally lead people to experience the relaxing power of ceramic art.</p>

            <h1>Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival Starts September 26, Many Mazu Statues to Parade in Yilan</h1>
            <p>The annual religious event in Yilan County, the "Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival," will take place for three days starting on September 26. Besides the Coral Mazu from Su'ao Jin'an Temple parading around Yilan, 16 other Mazu statues from different parts of Taiwan will also gather to join the parade. This will allow believers to worship many Mazu statues at one time and sincerely pray.</p>
            <p>Today, the Yilan County Government held a press conference for the "2025 Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival" in the county hall lobby. The Coral Mazu from Yilan's Su'ao Jin'an Temple and the Taiping Mazu from Yunlin's Xiluo Fuxing Temple entered the venue one after another with loud gongs and drums, creating a very lively atmosphere.</p>
            <p>The County Government Civil Affairs Department stated that since the Lanyang Mazu Cultural Festival started in 2019, different temples, such as Su'ao Nantian Temple, have served as the main host temples. This year, Su'ao Jin'an Temple is the host. The event's main theme is "Sea and Land Parade, Blessing Lanyang." On September 26, the opening day of the event, a fleet of fishing boats will gather at Su'ao Fishing Port. They will respectfully welcome all the Mazu statues onto the boats to start their journey north. The procession will go around Guishan Island, which is a symbol of Yilan, and then enter Wushih Port in Toucheng Township for a ceremony. After that, a two-and-a-half-day land parade will begin.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Department pointed out that during the sea and land parade, in addition to the Coral Mazu from Jin'an Temple, there will be 16 other Mazu statues joining the parade. These include Mazu from Hualien Gangtian Temple, Pingtung Donggang Chaolong Temple, Kaohsiung Xiajiadian Jinluan Temple, Tainan Anping Kaitian Tianhou Temple, Chiayi Bengangkou Gangkou Temple, Chiayi Xingang Fengtian Temple, Yunlin Beigang Chaotian Temple, Yunlin Xiluo Fuxing Temple, Changhua Lugang Tianhou Temple, Changhua Nanyao Temple, Taichung Dazhuang Haotian Temple, Taichung Dajia Jenn Lann Temple, Miaoli Baishatun Gongtian Temple, Miaoli Shanbian Mazu Temple, Taoyuan Cihu Temple, and Beitou Guandu Temple.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Department stated that they hope this event will bring together the power of Mazu beliefs from all over Taiwan. They wish for Mazu's kind light to bless Lanyang, keep the four areas safe and healthy, and show the different ways faith and culture can mix. They also invite the public to join the Mazu parade then.</p>
