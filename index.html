The UK's inflation rate, which measures how quickly prices are rising, stayed at 3.4% in March. This was unexpected, as many experts thought it would drop slightly. This news means that the Bank of England might not lower interest rates as soon as some people hoped. High interest rates can make borrowing money more expensive for families and businesses. While the rate of price increases has slowed down a lot since its peak in 2022, prices for everyday goods like food are still much higher than they were a few years ago. Families continue to feel the pressure of the increased cost of living, even though the rate of new price rises has stabilised. The government and central bank are watching these numbers closely to see if they need to take action to help the economy.

**Companies Teach Workers AI Skills as Technology Changes Jobs**
Across many industries, companies are now actively training their employees in artificial intelligence (AI). This is happening because AI is quickly changing how work is done, from customer service to data analysis. Businesses want their staff to understand and use AI tools to improve efficiency and stay competitive. Instead of seeing AI as a threat, many companies are focusing on helping their workers adapt. They are running workshops, online courses, and offering new roles that involve working with AI. This effort aims to help employees gain new skills that will be important for the future of work. While there are some worries about AI replacing jobs, the current trend is to help people work alongside AI and use it to their advantage.

**Europe Expects Record Tourist Numbers This Summer**
Popular travel destinations across Europe are getting ready for a huge increase in tourists this summer. After a few years of lower visitor numbers due to the pandemic, places like Spain, Greece, and Italy are expecting record crowds. Airlines and hotels are seeing very high demand, and booking websites show that many people are planning trips to the continent. This is good news for local economies that rely on tourism, as it brings in a lot of money. However, there are also concerns about "over-tourism," which means too many visitors in one place. This can put a strain on local resources, lead to more pollution, and make popular sites very crowded. Authorities are trying to manage the flow of tourists to ensure a good experience for visitors and protect the environment and local communities.
