            <h1>Soldier in Taichung Becomes Fraud Group Member to Earn Extra Money, Charged by Law</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old man named Wu, who was a soldier, got caught. He was a "mule" for a fraud group. He had a steady job in the army and earned 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars each month. But he wanted to make more money. After he was caught, he was put in jail. Now, he has been charged with serious fraud and other crimes. Mr. Wu might even lose his job in the army.</p>
            <p>Today, the police in Taichung's Daya District shared some news. They had a case about a fake investment fraud. The person who lost money, Mr. Chang, tried to get his money back many times but could not. He then realized it was a scam and called the police. The police said that Mr. Chang, who is 40 years old, joined an investment group on LINE through Facebook. The group's name was "Wealth Plan." Someone from the group told him he could "definitely make money" and convinced him to buy gold to earn profit. Mr. Chang saw a fake website that showed high profits and guaranteed earnings. So, he put in 1.8 million New Taiwan Dollars by sending money or giving it in person. Later, when Mr. Chang wanted to get back his 28.78 million New Taiwan Dollars profit, the fraud group asked him for a "10% charity donation." That's when he realized he was tricked.</p>
            <p>The police and Mr. Chang worked together. They caught Mr. Wu, the "mule," when he came to collect the money. The police found out that Mr. Wu was a soldier who chose to join the army. He had a good job with a steady monthly salary of 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars and a good future in the military. But he wanted to earn extra money. So, he looked for "unusual jobs" online. Then, he followed the fraud group's orders to sign fake contracts and collect money from different people.</p>
            <p>On the day Mr. Wu was caught, a court in Taichung decided to keep him in jail. The Taichung District Prosecutors Office charged him with breaking laws against organized crime, serious fraud, and money laundering. They also asked for a 50% longer sentence under the law against fraud. His case is now in court. Mr. Wu might lose his job in the army, which means his bad choices did not help him at all.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan City Proposes Law to Charge for Demolishing Illegal Buildings, Hopes for Fair Costs</h1>
            <p>The city government of Taoyuan has approved a new proposed law. It is called the "Taoyuan City Regulations for Charging for Forced Demolition of Illegal Buildings." This proposal will now go to the city council for review. If the council agrees, the city government can charge the owner of the illegal building or other responsible people for the costs of tearing down the building. This will help create a fairer system for managing these buildings.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Taoyuan City Department of Building Management released a statement. They said that the "Building Act" already states that "the owner of a building must pay for its demolition if it is forcefully torn down." The city government had actually suggested a similar law to charge for demolishing illegal buildings in 2019. However, it was not approved then because there were concerns that it wasn't complete enough. This time, they have made changes and improvements to the law. They used their experience from real cases, looked at new central government laws, and learned from how Taipei City and New Taipei City handle similar situations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang Jing-quan, the head of the Department of Building Management, said that the city government currently pays for tearing down illegal buildings. This costs the public a lot of money and does not stop people from building illegally. The new proposed law clearly states how much to charge, how to do it, and how to protect people's rights. This will make the demolition work more official and legal. In the future, the cost will be based on the type of building materials used. It will be from 200 to 1,700 New Taiwan Dollars per square meter. They hope this will stop people who try to build illegally and get away with it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang said that if the law is passed, the city will focus on tearing down important cases first. These include "large illegal buildings that are still being built" and "illegal buildings that are dangerous to public safety." The city will also collect the demolition costs as stated in the law. This is to make sure that the city's rule about land use is followed, and that public safety is always the most important thing.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Coach Banned for 1 Game After U12 World Cup Pitcher Breaks Rule</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's baseball team won against South Korea yesterday in the U12 World Cup. The game went to an extra ninth inning. However, the last pitcher, Huang Yu-chien, did not follow the rules about how many days a pitcher must rest. Because of this, Taiwan's head coach, Chang Tzu-chien, has been banned for one game. So, he could not lead his team in today's third-place game against South Korea.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, in the U12 World Cup, the Taiwan team played their last game in the Super Round against South Korea. Both teams played very hard until the ninth inning, which was a tie-break inning. Taiwan scored many runs and won the game 11 to 5. Today, they played South Korea again for third place.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's pitcher, Huang Yu-chien, who played in the ninth inning yesterday, had pitched 53 balls on July 31. The rules say that if a pitcher throws between 46 and 60 balls, they must rest for two days before playing again. But Huang Yu-chien played yesterday, which was too soon. So, the Taiwan team was fined, and head coach Chang Tzu-chien was banned for one game.</p>
