            <h1>Wu Chih-chung Attends Korean National Day Event, Hopes for Lasting Taiwan-Korea Friendship</h1>
            <p>On October 2nd, Taiwan's Deputy Foreign Minister, Wu Chih-chung, went to the "2025 Republic of Korea National Day Celebration" hosted by the Korean Representative Office in Taipei.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that Wu Chih-chung gave a speech. He said that the world is changing very quickly. The current international rules are being challenged. Taiwan and Korea both believe in democracy. They are also close to each other and their industries help each other. Taiwan wants to use its advantages in "global democratic values," "the first island chain in the Indo-Pacific," and "non-red supply chains" to make its partnership with Korea stronger.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung also thanked the foreign ministers of Korea, the US, and Japan. In their meeting in September, they again said they support peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He also said that Taiwan always supports peace, stability, and no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Taiwan is against any military actions or threats that could harm peace. He added that the relationship between Taiwan and Korea is based on friendly interactions between their people. In 2024, 2.5 million people visited between Taiwan and Korea. Both countries are the third largest source of tourists for each other. People from both countries often share their cultures, even with different languages.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung finished his speech in Korean. He said he hopes that the friendship between Taiwan and Korea will last a long time and that both countries will do well.</p>
            <p>Koh Sang-wook, the acting representative of the Korean Representative Office in Taipei, first offered his sadness and sympathy to the victims and families affected by Typhoon Hagupit in Taiwan. He said that Taiwan and Korea are not only close neighbors with similar ideas but also good friends who often interact in culture and business. He noted that many people travel between Taiwan and Korea. Recently, the term "Taiwanese feeling," which describes the warm and kind atmosphere of Taiwan, has become popular in Korea.</p>
            <p>Koh Sang-wook pointed out that Taiwan and Korea are strong in the semiconductor industry. They help each other in the global supply chain. This year, for the first time, a Korea-Taiwan Semiconductor Supply Chain Forum was held at SEMICON TAIWAN, a big semiconductor exhibition. This helped to increase exchanges between the two countries' semiconductor industries. He also hoped that the APEC meeting in Gyeongju, Korea, later this year will be an important step for international cooperation.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the friendship between Taiwan and Korea has a long history. Both countries keep in close contact and work together in many areas. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will follow Minister Jaushieh Joseph Wu's "total diplomacy" idea. They hope to use the wide and deep existing connections to make their cooperation even bigger. They will work together to make the Indo-Pacific region strong and peaceful.</p>

            <h1>Random Stabbing in Miaoli: Two Children and One Adult Injured, Receiving Hospital Care</h1>
            <p>In Miaoli City, a man named Chiu attacked people randomly with a knife. Out of the three people hurt, an 11-year-old girl named Ding and a 50-year-old man named Lin are in intensive care in hospitals in Taichung and Miaoli. They are in stable condition. Another girl, Ms. Hsu, is still in the hospital for observation. She has also been offered psychological help.</p>
            <p>The incident happened yesterday afternoon at about 3:40 PM. A 48-year-old man named Chiu, the attacker, used a knife to hurt three people for no clear reason. These included one adult man and two 11-year-old girls. The Miaoli County Fire Department received a call and sent the injured people to the hospital. About an hour after the incident, the police surrounded and caught Mr. Chiu at his home on Sheliao Street in Miaoli City.</p>
            <p>Pictures from surveillance cameras near the incident showed that yesterday afternoon, Mr. Chiu rode his motorcycle around Sheliao Street in Miaoli City. He saw Ms. Hsu, a girl, standing alone by the road. He stopped, grabbed her hair, and took out a sharp knife to attack her. The girl was very scared and screamed. She managed to escape and run away.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsu had cuts on her chest and elbow. She ran all the way to a convenience store at the corner of Jianzhong Street and Zhongzheng Road to ask for help. But then, Mr. Chiu appeared again outside the convenience store. He used his knife to stab Mr. Lin and then Ms. Ding.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin was taken to Tachien Hospital. When he arrived, he was awake. He had stab wounds on his upper right stomach and back. Mr. Lin's wife said that her husband was going to pay a bill at the convenience store. He saw the girl asking for help on the street. He bravely tried to call the police, but then he was also stabbed.</p>
            <p>She said her husband had to run away while hurt, along with other people. But when he reached a clinic nearby, he might have lost too much blood and fell to the ground.</p>
            <p>The head of the intensive care unit at Tachien General Hospital, Dr. Yuan Kuo-ching, said today that Mr. Lin had a cut of 8 to 9 centimeters where his chest and stomach meet, and a 6-centimeter cut on his back. In an urgent surgery, doctors found that his diaphragm and liver were cut. He had a lot of bleeding in his chest. His condition is stable now, and he is still being watched closely and treated in the intensive care unit.</p>
            <p>The two girls were first taken to Miaoli Hospital. One of them, Ms. Ding, was stabbed in her left chest by the attacker. After doctors put a breathing tube in her, her condition became stable. She was then moved to China Medical University Hospital in Taichung City for more treatment.</p>
            <p>As for Ms. Hsu, she had a cut of 0.5 to 1 centimeter on her chest and a 3-centimeter tear on her right elbow. After her wounds were sewn up, she stayed in the hospital for observation. She is expected to rest for a while and might leave the hospital tomorrow. Her family did not want to talk to reporters. Miaoli Hospital said that they will continue to give her the medical care she needs. They have also arranged psychological counseling to help her get better both physically and mentally. They want to give the patient and her family time and space to rest and feel better.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan-US Tariff Talks: Premier Cho Jung-tai Hopes for Real Progress This Month</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that he hopes to see good progress this month in the talks between Taiwan and the United States about equal tariffs. Members of parliament were worried that the US federal government being shut down might delay when an agreement could be reached. Premier Cho said that the US has some internal problems now, but these problems should not last too long. "I hope we can see real progress in the Taiwan-US equal tariff talks this month," he said.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai was at a meeting in the Legislative Yuan. He, along with other ministers, gave a report about the "Special Budget for the Central Government to Improve Economic, Social, and People's Security in Response to International Situations." They also answered questions.</p>
            <p>Wang Ting-yu, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party, asked if the US government shutdown, caused by not enough money, would delay the signing of a tariff agreement with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that Taiwan and the US have finished the last technical discussions. However, the final meeting to reach an agreement has not happened yet. The US has a set way of doing final meetings with other countries, but this way cannot be predicted right now. The US situation has changed because of internal issues, but Premier Cho believes that a government will not stay stopped for a long time.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho stated that Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun's most recent discussion with the US did not set a final deadline. But both sides agree that they want to reach an agreement quickly. If we imagine the end of October as a goal, it would give both governments enough time to prepare more for the final steps and reach an agreement. The government is working towards this goal.</p>
            <p>Wang Ting-yu then asked if there was a chance to finish the talks by the end of October. He said he did not want unrelated issues to cause delays.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said he hopes so and wished the US could return to normal soon.</p>
            <p>Later,翁曉玲 (Weng Hsiao-ling), a lawmaker from the Kuomintang party, asked what specific agreements had been made in the current equal tariff talks.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun reported the results of the last physical talks to the public yesterday. The final meeting and agreement are still happening. The US still has some internal problems that are causing delays, but these problems should not last too long. He hopes to see real progress this month. Industries and people in Taiwan are very much looking forward to this agreement being finalized soon.</p>
            <p>Weng Hsiao-ling questioned why the US public information did not mention "temporary tariffs." She thought the government was being secretive about the details of the talks, which made people confused.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that the US mentioned during the talks that the final tariff rates might change when an agreement is reached. Taiwan will try to get the best deal. But getting a better deal does not mean paying a very unfair price. Instead, it means both sides work together, hoping that equal tariffs will be a way for them to cooperate.</p>
