            <h1>Zhang Lishan Hopes to Negotiate with US for Fair Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Today, Yunlin County Governor Zhang Lishan said that the central government should talk with the United States. They should try to get lower tariffs, like the European Union, which has "non-stacked tariffs." This would protect farmers, workers, and industries, so they don't get hurt in global trade.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan's Office of Trade Negotiations said that according to a US order, only the European Union's tariffs are not calculated by stacking. For all other countries, tariffs are based on the original MFN (Most Favored Nation) tariff rate, plus an additional reciprocal tariff rate. For Taiwan, the original tariffs have an extra 20% temporary reciprocal tariff added.</p>
            <p>Zhang Lishan said that the US is asking the world to pay for its economic plans. This goes against the long-standing free and fair trade system around the world. It could cause economic problems globally. Many workers might face unpaid leave or lose their jobs, and social support systems will be tested. Both the central and local governments should have plans. Taiwan should work more with other countries in trade to reduce these problems.</p>

            <h1>Kao Cheng-jui Loses at WTT Yokohama Champions, Out of Top 8</h1>
            <p>In the WTT Yokohama Champions competition in Japan today, Taiwan's good table tennis player Kao Cheng-jui played against Kanak Jha from the US in the Last 16 round. Kao surprisingly lost 7-11, 11-6, 9-11, 5-11. He will not be in the Top 8.</p>
            <p>Kao Cheng-jui is 20 years old and ranked 27th in the world. This was the first time he played against Kanak Jha, who is 25 years old and ranked 31st. Before the game, the World Table Tennis (WTT) allowed fans to vote, and more than 90% of fans thought Kao would win.</p>
            <p>In the first game, Kao Cheng-jui and Jha played very close. When the score was 6-6, Jha scored many points by playing well from the middle and far part of the table. He also got two lucky net balls. So, Kao lost the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Kao Cheng-jui purposely changed how he served. He quickly got 5 points in a row and had a good start. He kept a lead of at least 3 points for the whole game and won it.</p>
            <p>In the third game, both players had trouble scoring. Kao Cheng-jui was behind most of the time. Even though he caught up to 9-9 at the end, Jha still got 2 more points and won the game.</p>
            <p>In the important fourth game, Jha was still playing better. When Kao Cheng-jui was behind 2-4, he called a time-out. But after the break, the game did not change. Instead, Jha scored 5 points to 1, which helped him win the game.</p>
            <p>In the WTT Yokohama Champions, four players from Taiwan took part: Lin Yun-ju and Kao Cheng-jui in men's singles, and Cheng I-ching and Huang Yi-hua in women's singles. But all of them were out before the Last 16 round.</p>
            <p>Last year, Jha raised over 30,000 US dollars (about 900,000 New Taiwan Dollars) on the GoFundMe website to help him go to the Paris Olympics. Getting to the Top 8 in this Yokohama Champions event is his best result this season in the WTT Tour.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Water Department: No 7-Day Water Outage for 4 Districts</h1>
            <p>Reports said that four areas in Taipei City would have water outages, with the longest lasting for seven days in a row. This made people worried. The Taipei Water Department has explained that water will only be off for construction from 11 AM to 4 PM every day. This will not affect people's normal daily routines before or after work. And there will definitely not be a 7-day water outage.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei Water Department released a message to explain. They said that many news reports stated that four areas in Taipei would have water outages, and the longest would be seven days. So, the department wanted to make things clear.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Water Department's information said that to make sure people get the best water quality, they keep replacing old water pipes in Taipei City. These pipe replacement projects are small, and they don't affect a large area for water outages.</p>
            <p>The department said that to make sure the work affects users as little as possible, water will be off for construction from 11 AM to 4 PM every day. This will not affect people's normal daily lives before or after work. And there will definitely not be a continuous 7-day water outage.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Water Department said that most buildings in Taipei City have water tanks. So, during the 5 to 6 hours of daily water outage for construction, people can still use the water from their tanks. However, a small number of users who do not have water tanks will have short water outages every day. These users should store water before the construction if they need it.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Water Department stressed that when they replace water pipes, they do it in small areas for short times. This causes the least trouble for users. Information about the areas and times for these projects is on the "Water Outage Inquiry" page on their official website.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Water Department said they will regularly put out news about water outages and put up notices in affected areas. This is to let people know and remind them to store water before the work. This will help to keep the problems as small as possible.</p>
