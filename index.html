            <h1>Trump May Visit Japan in Late October, U.S. State Department Says He Really Wants To</h1>
            <p>Today, the Nikkei newspaper reported that the governments of the United States and Japan are working together for U.S. President Trump to visit Japan at the end of October. This visit might happen before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea.</p>
            <p>South Korea will host the APEC summit from October 31st to November 1st in Gyeongju.</p>
            <p>If Trump visits Japan, he might meet the person who will take over from Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Shigeru Ishiba, who is also the leader of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has said he will leave his position. The Japanese Parliament will choose a new Prime Minister after the LDP election on October 4th.</p>
            <p>When Shigeru Ishiba visited the U.S. in February this year, he invited Donald Trump to visit Japan officially. If this trip happens, it will be Trump's first visit to Japan since he started his second term as president.</p>
            <p>Regarding this, U.S. State Department Deputy Spokesperson Mignon Houston told the Nikkei on October 24th (U.S. East Coast time) that "we hear that Trump strongly wants to visit Japan. This shows the long friendship between the U.S. and Japan."</p>
            <p>She also said, "This also shows that our relationship and plans with Japan in the Indo-Pacific region are very important."</p>
            <p>When asked if Trump would visit Japan before the APEC summit, Houston only said, "We don't guess... No matter if he visits or not, Japan is key for safety, stability, and growth in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>
            <p>Trump is expected to attend the APEC events. It will be his first time meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a meeting in South Korea after starting his second term. The Nikkei newspaper said that from Japan's point of view, if Trump visits Japan before the APEC summit, Japan can talk about its policies towards China with the U.S. beforehand.</p>
            <p>Also, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in late July this year that Trump would attend the ASEAN-related leaders' meeting in Kuala Lumpur in late October. Malaysia is currently the leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>

            <h1>TSMC Drops NT$20, Taiwan Stock Market Falls 172 Points to End at 26023 Points</h1>
            <p>The U.S. stock market has fallen for two days in a row. This happened after Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. central bank (Federal Reserve), warned that U.S. stock prices might be too high. Today, TSMC, a big company, dropped by 20 New Taiwan Dollars. The Taiwan stock market also went down. The main index lost 172.88 points and closed at its lowest point for the day, 26023.85 points. It just managed to stay above 26000 points. The total money traded was 488.827 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Important stocks had mixed results. TSMC dropped by 20 New Taiwan Dollars, or 1.49%, closing at 1320 New Taiwan Dollars. Hon Hai (Foxconn) went up by 7 New Taiwan Dollars, or 3.14%, closing at 230 New Taiwan Dollars. This is because foreign investors have been buying a lot of its shares recently. Delta Electronics moved up and down a lot, but finally dropped by 7 New Taiwan Dollars, or 0.79%, closing at 884 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
