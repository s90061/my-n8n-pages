            <h1>Kenting National Park Administration Works with Companies to Promote Eco-Tourism, Hoping to Overcome Difficulties in Domestic Tourism in Kenting</h1>
            <p>To help Kenting's tourism, which has been struggling, the Kenting National Park Administration is now working with businesses and hotels. They want to promote eco-tourism. Today, at Dawen Lawn, they signed an agreement with private companies. They also showed special products from local communities. They hope this will bring new energy to local development.</p>
            <p>Chen Chien-lung, the head of Kenting National Park Administration, said at the meeting that the administration has been doing community eco-tourism for 20 years. The results have been very clear. But after the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic travel was hit hard. So, they decided to work with companies and hotels. They hope more people can enjoy the beauty of nature.</p>
            <p>Huang Chin-fei, the head of the Institute of Science and Environmental Education at National Kaohsiung Normal University, said that around the world, people are focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and green management. This agreement between communities and companies means that people who join these tours can get a certificate for low-carbon travel. This shows that travel can also be low in carbon.</p>
            <p>Today's event by the Kenting National Park Administration focused on promoting community eco-tourism. It showed how public and private groups can work together. They signed the agreement, showed community products, had market activities, games, and a coloring contest. All these activities help to achieve friendly, low-carbon, and lasting tourism.</p>
            <p>At the meeting, they showed new things from communities helped by the Kenting National Park Administration. They held a "Community Product Launch Forum." The Longshui and Houwan communities both showed new products. The Longshui community made "puffed rice snacks" that mix old and new ideas. They added a special local flavor, dried radish. The Houwan community made "cashew" products. They got the idea from Houwan, which looks like a cashew nut. Their flavors include local fermented tofu.</p>
            <p>There was also a "Local Community Market" with 10 groups from communities and eco-friendly farms. They sold products and talked about their tours. Visitors could experience the local culture, buy eco-friendly products, and take home useful souvenirs with stories.</p>
            <p>According to the Kenting National Park Administration, the agreement signing ceremony was a joint effort between the Kenting National Park Administration and National Kaohsiung Normal University. They worked with many different private companies. These included Huiying Biomedical Co., Ltd., Brain Future Development Co., Ltd., Chumen Zouzou International Travel Agency, Grand Pacific Petrochemical Corp., Tainan City Structural Engineers Association, Taichung City Structural Engineers Association, and Taiwan Provincial Structural Engineers Association.</p>

            <h1>Azerbaijan and Armenia Make Peace; EU Praises and Calls for Quick Implementation of Agreement</h1>
            <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have signed an agreement. The United States helped them make this agreement. This agreement ends many decades of fighting. The heads of the European Union, Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, praised this agreement. They also asked for the agreement to be put into action quickly.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Armenia, where most people are Christian, and Azerbaijan, where most people are Muslim, have had problems for a long time. These problems were about their borders and special areas inside their countries where certain ethnic groups live.</p>
            <p>The two sides fought wars twice over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is in Azerbaijan and caused many arguments. In 2023, Azerbaijan quickly attacked and took back this area from Armenian forces. This made over 100,000 Armenian people leave their homes.</p>
            <p>Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa released a joint statement late yesterday. They said that the agreement signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House is "a big step forward." They added that it "makes a path for lasting and steady peace for both countries and the whole region."</p>
            <p>They also said, "Now it is important to make sure that the agreed plans are followed quickly. This will help to make sure there is steady and continuous progress towards full normal relations."</p>
            <p>The US President Donald Trump helped with the agreement. He said that Armenia and Azerbaijan promised "to stop all fighting forever. They will start business, tourism, and diplomatic relationships. They will also respect each other's independence and borders."</p>

            <h1>Volcanic Ash from Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula Causes Two China Airlines New York Flights to Detour</h1>
            <p>China Airlines said today that volcanic ash from Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula is causing problems. Because of this, two flights need to change their path to fly safely. These flights are CI011 from New York to Taoyuan on August 8th and CI012 from Taoyuan to New York today. This means the flights will take longer, and there will be limits on how much they can carry.</p>
            <p>For travelers who are affected, China Airlines said they will try their best to arrange other flights or transfer tickets. Also, any luggage that is delayed will be sent to the travelers' chosen address later. China Airlines apologized for the trouble and thanked travelers for their help and understanding.</p>
            <p>China Airlines said they will keep watching for changes in this flight route. They will change flight plans when needed. They suggest that travelers use the China Airlines website, download their mobile app, or use the text message alert service to check for the latest flight changes.</p>
