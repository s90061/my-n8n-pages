            <h1>Air Force: Brave Eagle Jet Lands Safely on Wet Taitung Runway Using Arresting Hook</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 26. Some news said today that a Brave Eagle advanced jet trainer might have had brake problems and almost went off the runway. The Air Force Command Headquarters said in the evening that one Brave Eagle jet from the Flight Training Department was returning to Taitung Air Base for training this afternoon. Because the runway was wet, the pilot used the arresting hook, as planned, to slow down and land safely.</p>
            <p>News reports said that there was heavy rain in Taitung today. One Brave Eagle jet reportedly had brake problems and almost went off the runway, while its partner plane landed at Tainan Air Base instead. The Air Force Command Headquarters gave the above answer in a press release this evening.</p>
            <p>The Air Force Command Headquarters stated that during the flight training, there were no "brake problems" or "almost went off the runway" situations as reported by the media. They also added that flight training always follows strict rules and steps to ensure flight safety.</p>

            <h1>India Plans to Release Dam Water, Pakistan Evacuates 150,000 People</h1>
            <p>Lahore, Pakistan, August 26. Today, officials in Pakistan said that their country has moved at least 150,000 people away from three rivers in its main farming area. This happened after India, a country next door, warned that it plans to release water from a dam.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Pakistani officials said they got a sudden warning from India yesterday. India plans to release water from the Madhopur Dam on its side of Punjab province because the water level in the dam is rising quickly.</p>
            <p>India regularly releases water from its dams when the water level is too high. This extra water flows into Pakistan. On August 24, officials in New Delhi said that due to heavy rain, they had warned Pakistan that a lot of water would flow into its rivers.</p>
            <p>Three rivers, the Ravi River, the Sutlej River, and the Chenab River, flow from India into Pakistan.</p>
            <p>Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said today that these rivers currently have medium to high flood levels.</p>
