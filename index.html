            <h1>Trump: US and Philippines Finish Trade Deal, Philippines to Pay 19% Tax on Goods</h1>
            <p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, met with the President of the Philippines, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., today. After their meeting, Trump said that the US and the Philippines have "finished a trade deal." This means the Philippines will open its markets to American goods and will not charge any taxes on them. On the other hand, the US will charge a 19% tax on goods coming from the Philippines. This 19% is 1% less than the 20% tax Trump had warned about earlier.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. is the first leader from Southeast Asia to meet Trump since Trump became president again. Since early April, when Trump started using special taxes on goods, the US has made trade deals with other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Trump told reporters in the White House that he and Marcos Jr. would talk about trade. He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal," but he did not give more details.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Trump quickly posted on his social media platform, Truth Social. He wrote that the meeting was good, and "We finished the trade deal." According to the deal, the Philippines will open its markets to the US and have zero taxes on goods. The Philippines will pay a 19% tax to the US for their goods. Also, both countries will work together on military matters.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that Marcos Jr. is "a very good and tough negotiator."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an important friend to the United States in Asia. News reports say that last year, the US bought 5 billion dollars more goods from the Philippines than the Philippines bought from the US. The total trade between the two countries was 23.5 billion dollars.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Trump sent letters about taxes to more than 20 countries. One letter was to Marcos Jr., saying that from August 1st, the tax on Philippine goods sent to the US would go up from 17% (which was suggested in April) to 20%. The Philippines wanted a better trade deal before the August 1st deadline.</p>

            <h1>White House to Announce New AI Plan, Wants US Technology to Spread and Grow</h1>
            <p>A document seen by Reuters shows that the White House in the United States plans to announce a new plan tomorrow. This plan will encourage sending American Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology to other countries. It will also try to stop state laws that are thought to limit AI too much and keep it from growing well.</p>
            <p>According to a summary of the plan draft that Reuters saw, the White House will stop giving federal money for AI to states that have very strict rules about AI. It will also ask the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to check if state laws go against federal rules.</p>
            <p>This plan will also support the growth of "open source" and "open weight" AI. It will also "export American AI technology" by using "full-stack deployment methods" and a plan for data centers led by the Department of Commerce.</p>
            <p>The document says this plan will "focus on creating jobs and making big advances in industries through AI, giving American workers more power."</p>
            <p>Janet Egan, a researcher at "The Center for a New American Security," a US think tank, said that this plan, as described by Reuters, shows a change in market strategy. It moves from Joe Biden's earlier "AI-limiting policies" to focusing on "how to start spreading the basic tools and technology that support the world."</p>
            <p>The summary says that even though the plan focuses on growth, it also talks about how important it is to "stop misuse and be ready for future risks related to AI."</p>
            <p>In January this year, US President Donald Trump ordered his government to create a plan. This plan was to make "America the world's capital for artificial intelligence" and to remove rules that stop AI from growing quickly.</p>
            <p>This report, which includes ideas from the National Security Council (NSC), will be released tomorrow. Trump is also expected to give a big speech tomorrow at an event called "Winning the AI Race." This event is organized by AI and cryptocurrency experts David Sacks and the co-hosts of the All-In podcast, at the White House.</p>

            <h1>Trump Meets Marcos: US and Philippines Close to a Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump welcomed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to the White House today for a meeting. Trump said they would talk about trade and other important topics. He said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal." He also mentioned that Marcos Jr. is a very tough person to negotiate with.</p>
            <p>Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is the first leader from Southeast Asia to meet Trump since Trump returned to the White House. Since early April, when Trump started using taxes on goods from other countries, the US has already made trade deals with two other Southeast Asian countries, Vietnam and Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Today, in the Oval Office at the White House, Trump told reporters that he and Marcos Jr. would discuss trade, as well as topics like war and peace. He said that the Philippines is a very important country for military matters, and that the US and Philippines have recently had "some great military exercises."</p>
            <p>He also said, "We are very close to finishing a trade deal," but he did not share more details.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked how close they were to finishing the deal, Trump only replied that Marcos Jr. is "a very tough negotiator." He said they had not reached a deal yet "because he (Marcos Jr.) was too tough during the talks."</p>
            <p>However, Trump also said, "We might agree on something."</p>
            <p>The Philippines is an important friend to the US in Asia. Manila hopes to get a better trade deal before the August 1st deadline.</p>
            <p>News reports show that last year, the US bought 5 billion dollars more goods from the Philippines than the Philippines bought from the US. The total amount of goods traded between the two countries was 23.5 billion dollars. Earlier this month, Trump sent a letter about taxes to Marcos Jr. It said that starting August 1st, the tax on goods from the Philippines sent to the US would go up from 17% (which was suggested in April) to 20%.</p>
