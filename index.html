            <h1>The United States Will Sell Missiles to Finland to Help Against Russian Threats</h1>
            <p>The United States announced today that it has agreed to sell Finland advanced air-to-air missiles and related equipment. The deal is worth 1.07 billion US dollars. Finland shares a long border with Russia. The US Congress still needs to approve this arms sale before it can become official.</p>
            <p>The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement that "this planned sale will make Finland stronger against current and future dangers. It will also help Finland work better with the United States and other friendly countries."</p>
            <p>The DSCA also explained that this sale will "support America's foreign policy and national security goals by making Finland, a NATO ally, safer. Finland has always been important for political stability and economic growth in Europe."</p>
            <p>The US State Department approved this possible arms sale to Finland. The DSCA has also told the US Congress about it, as required. The sale needs Congress's approval to be final.</p>
            <p>After Russia fully invaded Ukraine in early 2022, Finland and Sweden stopped being militarily neutral. They officially joined NATO.</p>

            <h1>Highway Data Website Changes Search Function to Stop Fraud Groups</h1>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau announced today that they have changed their online service for checking vehicle information. Before, some fraud groups used this website to find out if cars nearby were police cars or government vehicles. This helped them avoid being caught by the police. Now, people cannot check if a car is a government car by its license plate number anymore.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau said in a press release that the website was made so people could check information about used cars before buying them. This helps stop people from being tricked. Also, car dealers, car loan banks, and car insurance companies need this information. So, the website offers vehicle information for a fee. It follows rules to protect private information and business secrets.</p>
            <p>On the website, you can enter a car's license plate number and the driver's ID number. For 2 New Taiwan Dollars, you can check information like vehicle registration, driver's license details, unpaid fees, and unresolved traffic violations.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau said that the website shows information in different levels. If you only type in the license plate number, you get basic car information. If you also type in the owner's ID number, you get more details. But all private information is removed or hidden to keep it safe.</p>
            <p>However, fraud groups used this feature to see if there were government cars nearby. This helped them avoid police who were waiting to catch them. The Freeway Bureau talked with police and other related groups. They have now changed the website. Now, you cannot use a car's license plate number to guess if it is a government car.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Acrobatic Troupe Gets Big Applause in Toronto</h1>
            <p>The "Taiwan Acrobatic Troupe" from the National Taiwan College of Performing Arts, sent by the Overseas Community Affairs Council (OCAC), performed in Toronto, Canada. They received much praise.</p>
            <p>The group, chosen by the OCAC for the National Day cultural visit, came to Toronto, Canada, on September 9th. They performed in a special theater prepared by the local Taiwanese community. The group showed amazing acrobatic skills and smart performance ideas. The show was exciting from beginning to end and received great applause.</p>
            <p>Wang Hsi-chung, the leader of the "Taiwan Acrobatic Troupe," said before the show that they spent three and a half months practicing a brand new program for this trip. The show includes many Taiwanese elements, from nature and modern technology to Taiwan's baseball culture.</p>
            <p>Toronto was the 6th stop for the "Taiwan Acrobatic Troupe" on their tour of America and Canada. 14 performers had 13 shows in major North American cities in 33 days. This was a very hard challenge for both their bodies and minds. Performers Lin Yuan-kai and Cho Chia-min said they were lucky. Taiwanese people living abroad welcomed them warmly everywhere, giving them good places to stay and good food. They only had to deal with time differences and stay healthy to perform their best and show the true spirit of their show.</p>
            <p>Lin Yuan-kai said that when he was a child, he watched his teachers perform overseas. Now, after finishing school, it was his turn to travel abroad and bring comfort to Taiwanese people living in other countries. He takes Taiwanese culture around the world and feels how much the overseas Taiwanese miss their homeland and how they support the group. After the shows, many overseas Taiwanese often come to shake hands with the performers. They praise the performances as wonderful and rare to see. Lin Yuan-kai said, "This is the biggest encouragement for us." They will keep working hard so that more young students can follow them and spread Taiwanese folk arts around the world.</p>
            <p>Chuang Po-hsiung, the head of the "Canada-Taiwan Economic and Cultural Exchange Association," which organized the National Day cultural visit in Toronto this year, said that the overseas Taiwanese community loves their country very much. Everyone is from Taiwan. Even if they have different political views, they share many common beliefs. The Toronto Taiwanese community has become closer and their friendships have grown stronger by supporting each other.</p>
            <p>Before the National Day cultural visit performance, the organizers held a "Formosa Night" reception outside the theater. They invited Canadian politicians and members of the Taiwanese community. Tom Vegh, the Deputy Mayor of Newmarket, spoke at the event. He celebrated Taiwan's Double Ten National Day. He praised Taiwan for helping shape the world's future with things like mobile phones, medicine, and clean energy. He also said, "Taiwan's influence is more than just technology. It is a trusted partner in the world community. It supports global health, helps people in need, and works to become stronger against climate change. Taiwan shows everyone that a small island can make a big difference."</p>
            <p>Liang Yi-peng, the Director-General of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Toronto, said that Taiwan (Republic of China) faces challenges. However, with help from countries like Canada that share similar ideas, and from enthusiastic overseas Taiwanese who have supported Taiwan for many years, Taiwan feels very confident. Taiwan will work even harder to achieve the values it believes in.</p>
