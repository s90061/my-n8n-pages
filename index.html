New research from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that many young adults are delaying important life steps. This includes buying a home, getting married, or starting a family. The main reasons are high housing costs and the rising cost of living.
The ONS report found that about two-thirds of young people aged 18 to 34 feel that current housing prices make it very hard to buy their own home. They also worry about renting, as prices are still going up. These financial worries are making them put off big decisions about their future.
Experts say that young people are finding it harder to save money. Their wages often don't keep up with rising prices for things like food, energy, and rent. This situation affects their plans and their ability to become independent adults.

**More Workers Are Going Back to the Office**

New information shows that more people are now working in offices than at any time since the pandemic started. This marks a big change from when most people worked from home. Companies are encouraging employees to return, especially for a few days a week, known as hybrid work.
Many businesses believe that working together in the office helps with teamwork and new ideas. Some managers also feel it is easier to train new staff and build company culture when people are together. However, some employees still prefer to work remotely full-time, or to have more flexible options.
This trend suggests a move towards a new balance between working at home and working in the office. Companies are still trying to find the best way to combine these two styles of work for their teams.

**European Cities Are Trying to Manage Too Many Tourists**

Many popular places in Europe are facing a problem called "overtourism." This means too many visitors are coming, which can damage local areas and annoy residents. Now, some famous destinations are taking steps to control the number of tourists and protect their cities.
For example, Venice has introduced a new fee for day-trippers, and other cities are considering similar ideas. Places like Amsterdam are trying to reduce the number of very noisy or disrespectful tourists. The goal is to make tourism more sustainable, meaning it benefits everyone without causing harm.
These destinations are asking visitors to help. They want tourists to travel more responsibly, respect local rules, and maybe visit during less busy times of the year. This way, travel can remain enjoyable for everyone and protect these beautiful places for the future.
