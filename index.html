            <h1>H20 Chip Approved: Barry Lam Says US and China Found a Way to Agree</h1>
            <p>The United States has allowed Nvidia's H20 chips, which are less powerful, to be sold to China. People are wondering how this will affect the market for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the companies in Taiwan. Barry Lam, who is the chairman of the company Pegatron, said today that the US and China have reached an agreement in the area of AI. This agreement helps them avoid a big conflict, like "two trains crashing." He said that Taiwan is in a very important position. "We are doing well, and other countries need us."</p>
            <p>Today, Barry Lam was at a meeting about personal data laws in Taiwan. Before the meeting, he talked to reporters about his thoughts on Nvidia's H20 chip getting approval.</p>
            <p>He said it seems that the United States and China have both made some compromises. This has created a balance in supply and demand. It has also stopped a direct and strong "train crash" between the two powerful countries. He said Taiwan is in a very sensitive role. "It's better if we don't say too much. We just work quietly. If we do our job well, then people will need us."</p>
            <p>Barry Lam explained that the H20 is a lower-performance chip from Nvidia. He said if even this less powerful chip was blocked, China might be forced to develop its own chips. This would make China's related industries stronger and cause Nvidia to lose a market.</p>
            <p>There are rumors that the United States will soon make trade agreements with Taiwan, India, and Switzerland. Barry Lam said that Taiwan continues to be a good partner for the technology industry around the world. He believes Taiwan can keep this role and greatly help the global tech industry, regardless of how high or low trade taxes are.</p>
            <p>He added that because Taiwan's technology exports have grown a lot, it has led to more exports than imports. This creates some pressure in the trade talks between the US and China. It might also affect other types of industries. For now, we can only wait for the results to be announced.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung City Offers "Little Vet" Camp: Learn Animal Language and Explore Animals</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Animal Protection Office and the National Science and Technology Museum have started a "Little Vet Experience Camp" this summer. In this camp, children can pretend to be animal doctors. This helps them understand what animals need and learn the secrets of animal health care and how animals behave.</p>
            <p>The "Little Vet Experience Camp" has two different sessions this summer. The main idea of the camp is "Seeing Animals from a Scientific Point of View." It has three main topics: watching how animals behave, looking at animal forensics (like crime scene investigation for animals), and taking care of special pets.</p>
            <p>During the activities, children can learn how to "understand what dogs and cats are telling us" and "see things from an animal's point of view when they look at humans." They can also do hands-on exercises to understand the science behind why animals act the way they do.</p>
            <p>Also, in the animal forensics part of the camp, where they act like animal doctors, children can practice using tools to collect samples. They will learn simple ways to understand clues from animal cells, blood cells, and growing bacteria. The camp also includes a section called "Caring for Special Pets," where experts will teach children about animals like reptiles.</p>
            <p>Yao Chih-wang, who is the head of Kaohsiung City's Agriculture Bureau, said in a news release today that he hopes this camp, which focuses on science, will help children learn from a young age about being responsible pet owners, treating animals well, and being kind to them. He also hopes that animal doctors will not just be seen as people in white coats, but as a way to truly understand and talk with animals.</p>

            <h1>Changes in Ministry of Health: New Leaders for Mental Health and Health Promotion</h1>
            <p>There are new changes in the staff at Taiwan's Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW). Today, Minister Chiu Tai-yuan confirmed that Dr. Chen Po-hsi will be the new head of the Department of Mental Health. Dr. Chen is currently the head of general psychiatry at National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Also, Dr. Shen Ching-fen, a children's doctor from the same hospital, will become the head of the Health Promotion Administration. These new leaders are expected to start their jobs in July and August.</p>
            <p>The position of head of the Department of Mental Health has been filled by Deputy Head Cheng Shu-hsin since the former head, Chen Liang-yu, moved to a different job in September last year. Today, Minister Chiu Tai-yuan was at a meeting of a special committee in the parliament. After the meeting, reporters asked him about the new leader for the mental health department.</p>
            <p>Minister Chiu said that Dr. Chen Po-hsi will officially start as the head of the Department of Mental Health on July 18. After the previous head moved to a new role, the Ministry of Health and Welfare worked hard to find the right person. During this time, the work of the mental health department became much busier, and they needed more skilled professionals. Minister Chiu believes that with Dr. Chen's rich experience, he is definitely able to do the job well.</p>
            <p>According to the official website of National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Dr. Chen Po-hsi has a PhD from the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences at Cheng Kung University. He is an expert in mental health, brain science, medicines for mental health, brain imaging, and how society affects the brain. He also worked as a researcher at Duke University Medical Center in the United States, studying mental health in older people. He also did research at the National Institutes of Health in the U.S.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Dr. Wu Chao-chun, the current head of the Health Promotion Administration, will leave his position at the end of July and become an advisor for the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Minister Chiu Tai-yuan said that Dr. Shen Ching-fen will take over as the new head starting August 1. He mentioned that Dr. Shen has been a very important person in pushing for the "Healthy Taiwan" plan over the past few years. He trusts her completely. She knows a lot about the ideas and plans of "Healthy Taiwan," so she is very suitable to be the head of the Health Promotion Administration.</p>
            <p>Minister Chiu said that the Health Promotion Administration handles many different and complete tasks. Their work covers all areas of public health, from helping people stay healthy to preventing cancer, so their work is very broad. Dr. Shen Ching-fen is a medical professional who truly believes in putting people first. She has full training and a lot of experience from both Taiwan and other countries. She has done research in Thailand and the United Kingdom, which means she has a good understanding of global health issues.</p>
            <p>Minister Chiu also said that it is important to point out that it takes great determination for doctors who work with patients to decide to work for the government. This is because their income might be much lower. He is very thankful to Dr. Chen Po-hsi and Dr. Shen Ching-fen for choosing to help the country and the health of its people.</p>
