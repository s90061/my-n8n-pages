            <h1>Nie Yun Lives Alone in Taiwan with a Turtle as His Wife and Children Study Abroad</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hong Su-chen, Taipei, July 22) Artist Nie Yun attended a press conference today for the National Health Agency's "Safe Guard, Accurate Measurement" campaign. He said his family has high blood pressure and blood sugar problems, so he checks his own health regularly. Speaking about his current situation, he shared that in recent years, his wife and children have gone abroad to study, leaving him to live alone in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>To make people more aware of blood pressure control, the National Health Agency and the Taiwan Hypertension Society suggest that people over 18 years old should measure their blood pressure at home once a year. The National Health Agency also helps companies and communities set up blood pressure measuring services. This makes it easy for people to check their blood pressure correctly and know their numbers.</p>
            <p>Nie Yun attended the press conference today to encourage people to check their blood pressure regularly. He pays special attention because his family members have high blood pressure and blood sugar problems. Luckily, their blood pressure is now stable.</p>
            <p>Talking about his recent life, Nie Yun shared that he has been living alone for the past few years, with only a turtle for company. He said, "My wife and three children have all gone abroad to study. First, my oldest child went to university, then the second child went. After that, my wife said she wanted to get her master's degree, so she went. Then, my youngest daughter wanted to follow. It took about three years for them to leave one by one, even our dog went too."</p>
            <p>Nie Yun laughed and said he is good at living alone. He exercises and eats regularly. However, being busy with the musicals "Three Idiots" and "The Wedding Banquet" has given him a lot of stress. He explained, "Performing a show takes about three hours. This forces me to keep my body in good shape because I have to sing, dance, and remember the lines. My mind needs to be clear."</p>
            <p>Recently, it's summer vacation, and Nie Yun's wife and children have returned to Taiwan. Currently, his two sons are working summer jobs, and his daughter is still in school. He added, "She was on the badminton team at her school abroad, so when she came back to Taiwan, her main goal was to arrange training with different coaches."

            <h1>Fantastic Four Movie Has a Retro-Future Style, Avatar 3 Trailer Shows in Cinemas for the First Time</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Wang Hsin-yu, Taipei, July 22) The movie "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" will be shown in Taiwan starting tomorrow, before it opens in the US. The film has a retro-future technology style. For this, the team redesigned Times Square in New York and went to Spain to film. Also, the trailer for "Avatar: Fire and Ash" will be shown in cinemas for the first time before the movie.</p>
            <p>In "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," the four main characters are very close, like family. The actors said they also became good friends when they were not filming.</p>
            <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays "Mister Fantastic," said, "This family has a lot of care and love, and we did it easily." Vanessa Kirby, who plays "Invisible Woman," said, "We are very lucky to get along so well." Joseph Quinn, who plays "Human Torch," said that the good chemistry among the four actors cannot be forced. Ebon Moss-Bachrach, who plays "The Thing," concluded: "The four of us worked hard to make this family feel more human."</p>
            <p>Matt Shakman, the director of "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," said in a behind-the-scenes video that the original comic books were set in the 1960s. That time was full of hope and dreams of space travel. So, the movie's style was set as retro-future technology. To show the movie's special feeling, Pedro Pascal also shared, "We carefully made outdoor places like Times Square and indoor sets. We even traveled far to Spain to film."

            <h1>Shohei Ohtani Pitches 3 Innings, Lets In 1 Run, and Hits a Home Run; Dodgers Stop 6-Game Losing Streak at Home</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Los Angeles, July 21, combined foreign wire report) Shohei Ohtani, the two-way player for the Los Angeles Dodgers in Major League Baseball (MLB), started on the mound today and pitched for 3 innings. The opposing team hit a home run in their very first at-bat. But Ohtani hit a 2-run home run in his first at-bat in the bottom of the first inning. In the end, the Dodgers won 5 to 2 against the Minnesota Twins, stopping their recent 6-game losing streak at home.</p>
            <p>In this game, Shohei Ohtani started as the pitcher for the Dodgers. The Twins, who batted first, got a 1-0 lead in the first inning when their star center fielder, Byron Buxton, hit a home run in the first at-bat.</p>
            <p>However, in the bottom of the first inning, after Mookie Betts got a walk, the Dodgers' second batter, Shohei Ohtani, hit a 441-foot home run. This made the score 2 to 1, putting the Dodgers in the lead. Ohtani has now hit a home run in three games in a row.</p>
            <p>Today, Shohei Ohtani gave up a home run in the first at-bat of the top of the first inning. But he quickly hit his own home run in the bottom of the first inning. This makes him the first pitcher since Randy Lerch of the Philadelphia Phillies on May 17, 1979, to give up a home run and then hit one himself in the same game's first inning. That game was a wild hitting battle, with the Phillies winning 23 to 22 against the Chicago Cubs.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers, who are first in the National League West, lost all three games last weekend to the Milwaukee Brewers. They have now lost 6 games in a row at their home stadium, Dodger Stadium. This is their longest losing streak at home since September 2017.</p>
            <p>Shohei Ohtani has hit home runs in three games in a row. He now has a total of 35 home runs, which is the second most in the National League.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers' Will Smith hit two solo home runs today against Twins pitcher David Festa. He hit them in the 4th and 6th innings, making the score 4 to 1.</p>
            <p>Today, Shohei Ohtani pitched 3 innings, gave up 4 hits, and 1 run. He also struck out 3 batters. Dustin May, who took over for him, pitched 4.2 innings, gave up 5 hits, and struck out 4 batters without giving up any runs. May got the win.
