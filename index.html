Taiwan's weather agency expects to issue warnings for Typhoon Dianmu soon. Because of this, the Alishan Forest Railway will stop running from July 5 to July 8. This is to keep everyone safe.

The railway office said that after the typhoon passes, they will check the tracks to make sure they are safe before trains start running again. They will announce the new start date later.

If you have a ticket, you can get all your money back. You can do this at any Alishan Forest Railway station or at a 7-Eleven store using their IBON machine within one year. Also, Hinoki Village and Alishan Forestry Village will close if the local government says people should not go to work or school.

**Taoyuan Environmental Bureau Works with Communities and Shops to Reduce Carbon by Almost 1500 kg**

The Environmental Protection Bureau in Taoyuan City started a program in April to help reduce carbon emissions. They worked with local communities and shops that are environmentally friendly. More than 5,000 people joined, and together they reduced carbon by about 1,467 kilograms. This program helped connect local people and businesses to live a 'net-zero' life every day.

The Taoyuan City Environmental Protection Bureau announced today that they held five "Taoyuan Net-Zero Living Promotion" events since April. These events are part of their plan to reach a net-zero emission goal by 2050. Many citizens came to these events.

The Bureau said that the activities covered five areas: food, clothing, home, travel, and shopping. They taught people how to make choices that produce less carbon in their daily lives, helping them get used to a 'net-zero' lifestyle. These events followed special guidelines for low-carbon activities and helped reduce a lot of carbon.
