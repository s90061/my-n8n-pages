            <h1>Pakistan and Afghanistan Border Fight Gets Worse, Both Sides Shoot at Each Other</h1>
            <p>On the night of October 11, there was a lot of shooting along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Afghan Taliban soldiers attacked Pakistani guard posts. Pakistani security officials said that Pakistan was fighting back with "full force."</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Pakistani security officials stated that Afghanistan started the attacks for no reason. Both sides were shooting at each other in more than six places along the border.</p>
            <p>Afghan Taliban forces said they had taken over three Pakistani border posts. But Pakistani security officials said that the Pakistani army had destroyed many Afghan posts.</p>
            <p>Videos from Pakistan's security forces showed soldiers shooting guns and cannons into Afghanistan. The lights from the firing lit up the night sky.</p>
            <p>Pakistan had recently attacked the Afghan capital, Kabul, from the air. Because of this, a spokesperson for the Afghan Defense Ministry said today's actions were a response to Pakistan flying its planes into Afghan airspace. The spokesperson also said the attacks stopped at midnight local time.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson warned, "If they fly into Afghan airspace again, our armed forces are ready to protect our airspace and will respond strongly."</p>
            <p>Pakistan has not yet said if the fighting has stopped. The border between the two countries is 2,600 kilometers long.</p>
            <p>Pakistan says that the Afghan Taliban government, with help from India, is hiding "Pakistani Taliban" fighters. Pakistan claims these fighters use Afghanistan to attack Pakistan. India denies these claims. The Afghan Taliban says they will not let anyone use their land to attack other countries.</p>
            <p>Earlier, a Pakistani security official told Reuters that Pakistan's air attacks were aimed at a Pakistani Taliban leader who was in a car in Kabul. But it is not clear if this person survived. Pakistan had already warned the Afghan Taliban government that it was losing its patience.</p>
