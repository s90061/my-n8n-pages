            <h1>Apple May Test Foldable iPhone in Taiwan, Make it in India by 2026</h1>
            <p>A Japanese newspaper, Nikkei Asia, reported today that Apple is talking with its suppliers. They are discussing making a new foldable iPhone for testing in Taiwan. Apple plans to make many of these new phones in India by 2026 and then sell them.</p>
            <p>People who know about this say that Apple wants to send out 10% more phones in total by 2026. They believe that launching the much-awaited foldable phone will help them reach this goal.</p>
            <p>Three people close to the matter said that the idea is to use the engineering skills and resources of Apple's suppliers in Taiwan. They want to set up a small trial factory there. This factory would help them test and make changes to the production machines, settings, and steps for making the foldable iPhone. Once they know the best way to make the phone, they will use the same method to make many phones in India.</p>
            <p>If this plan works, it will help Apple move its new product development away from China. This is important because of the ongoing problems between the United States and China.</p>
            <p>Two of the people said that Apple's suppliers have found a place in a city in northern Taiwan to build the trial production line. However, these plans are not yet final and could change.</p>
            <p>They also mentioned that finding enough land and workers in Taiwan is a challenge. Even a trial production line would need thousands of workers.</p>
            <p>People who know told Nikkei Asia that Apple has told many of its suppliers that the new foldable iPhone will also make more people want to buy other iPhones. So, it is very important for Apple to make sure this new phone starts production smoothly to reach its goals for next year.</p>
            <p>Sources say that Apple plans to launch a new generation of iPhones in 2026. They aim to make about 95 million units, which is more than a 10% increase from this year.</p>
            <p>Sources also said that Apple's plan to make phones in Taiwan and India will help reduce risks. These risks come from problems between the US and China, and between China and India.</p>

            <h1>Typhoons Mita and Huajiaza May Form Soon; Huajiaza Expected to Be Strong</h1>
            <p>The 20th and 21st tropical low-pressure systems might become typhoons today. Their names will be Mita and Huajiaza. Weather expert Wu De-rong said that weather models show Huajiaza will become a strong typhoon, like a medium typhoon or even stronger. It will bring strong winds and a lot of rain. People in eastern Taiwan should prepare for heavy rain on September 23rd and 24th.</p>
            <p>Wu De-rong, a professor at National Central University, wrote in his weather column that the latest weather map from the weather agency shows a tropical low-pressure system moving into the western part of the Bashi Channel today. It will soon become a weak typhoon named Mita. It will move towards the Pearl River mouth and then slowly turn to the west. Its clouds and rain will cause more rain from today until September 20th.</p>
            <p>Another tropical low-pressure system is also likely to become a typhoon today, named Huajiaza. Mr. Wu De-rong said that the latest European weather model for 8 PM on September 22nd shows Typhoon Huajiaza getting close to the Bashi Channel. It will continue to move west. The latest American weather model also shows a similar path now. Both models suggest it will get stronger, becoming a "medium" typhoon or more, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. However, he stressed that this is a computer prediction for about a week from now, so its exact path can still change. It's important to keep watching if it will bring a bigger threat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu De-rong pointed out that the European model shows from today until September 20th, there will be more clouds and rain from the large low-pressure system and the outer part of Typhoon Mita. Eastern Taiwan and the Gaoping area will start to have local rain. In the afternoons, there will be local short showers or thunderstorms, and these storms might spread further north each day. There is also a chance of heavy thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>He also said that today and tomorrow, northern Taiwan will still have very high temperatures, around 38 degrees Celsius. Other areas will see a small drop in temperature but will still be hot.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu De-rong said that the latest European model shows on September 21st, there will be less moisture in the air. Most places will be sunny and hot, with local short showers or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon. On September 22nd, the outer parts of Huajiaza will get closer. Taipei, Yilan, and Hualien will start to have rain. Even without cold air, temperatures will drop a little because of the rain. Other areas will still be hot.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu De-rong stated that on September 23rd and 24th, Typhoon Huajiaza will pass through the Bashi Channel and go into the South China Sea. Eastern Taiwan should prepare for a lot of rain. How much other areas are affected depends on how close they are to the typhoon, and this needs to be watched closely.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's NCSIST to Work with Six International Defense Companies</h1>
            <p>The National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) will sign agreements with six international defense companies today. This will happen at the Defense Exhibition. These companies are Anduril, Airshare, Leonardo DRS, Aero Vironment, MARTAC, and Northrop Grumman. The plans include making M60A3 tanks better, working on uncrewed vehicles, and improving the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS).</p>
            <p>The Taiwan International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition happens every two years. It is taking place from today until September 20th at the Taipei Nangang Exhibition Center. Its main ideas are "Advanced Defense, Sustainable Flight, Strong Supply Chain, Uncrewed Future." Over 400 companies from 14 countries are part of the exhibition, making it the biggest ever.</p>
            <p>NCSIST is showing many new pieces of equipment in the Defense Hall. These include low-cost cruise missiles (also called loitering munitions) made with the American company Anduril. They also have four types of "Jinfeng" drones, "Kuaqi" uncrewed boats, "Ruiyuan II" drones, and the "Qiangong" (Tienkung IV) missile system. This shows Taiwan's ability to make its own defense technology.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that NCSIST President Li Shih-chiang and other NCSIST groups will sign agreements with the six international companies later today.</p>
            <p>For Anduril, in addition to the low-cost cruise missiles they are already working on, they will also work with NCSIST's Shenlong Project team. They will develop Anduril's "Underwater Autonomous Multi-purpose Vehicle" (Dive-LD). This is the first time Taiwan will use an underwater autonomous vehicle for scouting. It can explore underwater for up to 10 days. It can do jobs like mapping the seabed, checking the environment, inspecting underwater structures, and stopping illegal activities.</p>
            <p>For Airshare, they will work with NCSIST's Electronics Research Institute. They will improve the Interceptor UX ribbon rockets, as well as radar, optical systems, and signal jamming devices. The goal is to combine the ribbon rockets with existing ways to stop threats. This will remove drone threats in the cheapest way, protecting fighting forces and important facilities.</p>
            <p>For Leonardo DRS, they will work with NCSIST's Materials and Electro-Optics Research Institute. They will sell upgrade kits for the M60A3 tank's "shooting, gun control, and viewing systems." The goal is for NCSIST to make the kits and DRS to sell them.</p>
            <p>For Aero Vironment, they will work with NCSIST's Aeronautical Systems Research Division. Their project is about drone systems that can be used by both the military and regular people. In the future, they will share technology and combine their strengths to develop drones together. Both sides plan to set up a long-term way of working together. This includes sharing technology and building maintenance abilities. These drones will be used by the Coast Guard's Jump-20X for field maintenance and by the Navy for scouting.</p>
            <p>For MARTAC, they will work with NCSIST's Shenlong Project team on uncrewed boats. They will develop technologies like AI for recognizing and tracking targets, automatic interception, setting up protective barriers, working with many boats, avoiding objects in the sea, stopping things with force, and making smart decisions during battles.</p>
            <p>For Northrop Grumman, they will work with NCSIST's Military Communications Center. Their project is the "Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS)." They will together look at how to combine NCSIST's anti-missile systems with US missiles within the IBCS system and plan for the future.</p>
