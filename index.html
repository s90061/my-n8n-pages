            <h1>India and China to Restart Direct Flights by End of October After More Than 5 Years</h1>
            <p>The Indian Embassy in China announced tonight that India and China's flight officials have agreed to restart direct flights between the two countries. This will happen by the end of October.</p>
            <p>Direct flights between India and China stopped in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. After that, serious fights happened at the border, which made it unclear when flights would start again. Both sides have been working hard to fix their relationship this year.</p>
            <p>The Indian Embassy in China said in a statement today that earlier this year, both countries' flight officials talked about restarting direct flights and changing the "Air Services Agreement." This was part of India's plan to slowly make its relationship with China normal again.</p>
            <p>The statement explained that after these talks, both sides have now agreed. Direct flights between India and China, connecting specific cities, can start again by the end of October. This will follow the flight schedule for the winter season of 2025. The actual start of flights depends on the business choices of the airlines in both countries. They must also meet all flight rules.</p>
            <p>Finally, the statement said that this agreement between the flight officials will help people from India and China visit each other more. It will also help the relationship between the two countries become normal again little by little.</p>
            <p>According to Xinhua News Agency, before this, on August 18, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi. They agreed on 10 things. These included: "Both sides agreed to restart direct flights between mainland China and India soon. They also agreed to change the civil aviation transport agreement. Both sides agreed to make it easier for people involved in tourism, business, and media in both countries to get visas."</p>
            <p>China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said on August 14 that China and India have been talking closely about this for some time. They have been trying to restart direct flights as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>News reports from other sources said that four Chinese airlines asked for landing and takeoff times at Delhi Airport (DEL) in August. This showed that direct flights between China and India would start soon. At the same time, India's IndiGo airline was also getting ready to restart flights to Chengdu and Guangzhou. This will help make up for the number of flights and rebuild the long-stopped flight connections between the two countries.</p>

            <h1>CTBC Brothers Win Second-Half Championship, Coach Hirano Keiichi Aims for Best Overall Season Record</h1>
            <p>The CTBC Brothers baseball team won the second-half championship today at their home field, Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. This is the team's 20th championship for a half-season in their history. After celebrating by throwing yellow ribbons, they are now very close to having the best winning record for the whole year. Head Coach Hirano Keiichi told fans that their next goal is to be the best team overall.</p>
            <p>Before the game, the Brothers needed to win just one more game to become second-half champions. Tonight, they won against the Wei Chuan Dragons with a score of 6-2. This made them champions for the 20th time in team history, making them the first team in the league to reach this number. They are also only one step away from having the best winning record for the whole year, which means they are almost in the Taiwan Series (the big championship games).</p>
            <p>After the game, Coach Hirano Keiichi told all the fans that not winning the first-half championship made him very sad. He said it also made the fans feel sad. So, the whole team decided to make all the fans happy in the second half of the season, and they have worked hard until now.</p>
            <p>He said that after winning the second-half championship, their next goal is to have the best winning record for the whole year. He hoped everyone would come to the stadium tomorrow to cheer for them.</p>
            <p>Lin Hui-sheng, the starting pitcher, played very well, allowing only 1 run in 7 innings. He said he was very excited when he learned he would start in this important game. He said he pitched as if it was his last game. He thanked the coaches for trusting him, and he showed what he could do.</p>
            <p>The Brothers will play the TSG Hawks again tomorrow at Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. If they get the best winning record for the whole year, they will go straight to the Taiwan Series without playing in the playoff challenge games. They will also have the advantage of playing 5 home games.</p>

            <h1>Wu Yi-nung Rumored to Run for Taipei Mayor: "Will Indeed Seek Opportunity to Serve Citizens"</h1>
            <p>Wu Yi-nung, the founder of the Forward Alliance, is rumored to be a strong contender for the Democratic Progressive Party's nomination for the next Taipei Mayor. Wu Yi-nung said today that he will indeed try to find a chance to serve the citizens. He believes that Taiwan's society needs to move past the unclear and bad politics. However, he also thinks that for Taipei, there is no need to start the election too soon. He suggests that the Election Strategy Committee should think more about this.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party's Election Strategy Committee met yesterday. In the meeting, they listed possible candidates for the heads of 22 cities and counties. They also decided that in areas where candidates are invited (like Taipei, New Taipei, and Taichung), there will be a "left-out clause." This means that people who want to be nominated can apply. CNA news agency reported that for the Taipei Mayor race, besides Taipei City Councilor Miao Po-ya, Wu Yi-nung, the founder of the Forward Alliance, is seen as a strong, unexpected candidate.</p>
            <p>Wu Yi-nung went to Kaohsiung to give a speech today. Through his assistant, he released a statement. He said that he will indeed look for a chance to serve the citizens. He also believes that society needs to move on from unclear and bad politics. But he still suggests that the Election Strategy Committee should think carefully about whether they need to finish the nominations by the end of the year. The election is still more than a year away. For Taipei, there is no need to start the election too quickly.</p>
            <p>He also said that Hualien is still recovering from the disaster. The Forward Alliance team and its volunteers are still helping with rebuilding and support. He hopes that society can pay more attention to fixing the basic structures in the disaster area, helping residents feel calm, and preparing better for future disasters. This is to stop similar bad events from happening again. He believes these are the most important things everyone cares about right now.</p>
