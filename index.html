The first Taiwan Rocket Competition will have its finals in Xuhai Village, Pingtung County, at the end of July. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi said that this is the first competition of its kind in Asia and Taiwan. On July 26, the event will be broadcast live at the Pingtung County Stadium and the Xuhai Community Activity Center.

The Pingtung County Government and the TASA National Space Center are organizing the "2025 Taiwan Rocket Competition Finals" from July 25 to 27. The Pingtung local team, Pingke Experimental High School, has made it to the finals. Chou Chun-mi said that Pingtung is a good place for space technology because it has large open areas, stable weather, and is near the sea.

Chou also mentioned that the national launch site is now in Jiupeng Village, Manzhou Township. The rocket competition and stargazing events will help teach young people about technology and space. Zheng Cong-sheng from the National Space Center said that the competition helps Taiwan take part in space launches and trains students to solve problems by working together.

The Pingtung County Government also noted that from July 27 to 28, there will be a "Peninsula Youth Creation Forum" for two days and one night. This event will bring 100 young people to different places to see the rocket launch and the final exhibition, helping them learn about Taiwan's space development.

**Premier Su Tseng-chang Criticizes Blue and White Parties' Proposal to Distribute Cash**

Premier Su Tseng-chang said today that the government only has a budget surplus of a little over NT$30 billion, which is much less than the NT$230 billion needed to give money to everyone. He also said that giving cash to everyone cannot really solve Taiwan's problems. He hopes that lawmakers who are not good at reviewing and calculating budgets will not have the chance to mess up the budget again, so the country can get better.

Premier Su visited the Ministry of Agriculture's Renwu warehouse in Kaohsiung. He mentioned that NT$800 million from a special law will be used to build new cold storage and fix old grain storage facilities. He believes that storing food in old ways is a big problem for the country's strength.

Premier Su also set three goals for food safety: better quality of stored food, more stored food, and longer storage time. This will ensure basic protection when challenges arise. He also said that some lawmakers want to use NT$230 billion to give cash to everyone. However, according to the constitution and budget laws, the Legislative Yuan needs to ask the Executive Yuan for its opinion before increasing spending, but they have not done this in over a year. He called this unconstitutional and illegal, so the government must act.

Premier Su stated that he would rather borrow money to fix damaged homes and help with disaster relief than borrow money to give it to lawmakers or the public. He believes that giving money to everyone does not focus efforts on solving Taiwan's problems. He also noted that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has calculated that only a little over NT$30 billion in budget surplus is left, which is not enough for the NT$230 billion needed for giving cash to everyone. He thanked the Green Camp lawmakers present who are good at reviewing and calculating budgets, hoping that others who are not good at it will not have the chance to mess things up, so the country can move forward.

**US Defense Department Expands AI Use, Google and xAI Get Contracts**

The U.S. Department of Defense announced today that OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's AI company xAI have each received contracts worth up to $200 million. These contracts aim to improve the Defense Department's ability to use artificial intelligence (AI).

Reuters reported that the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) of the U.S. Department of Defense stated that these contracts will help the department create AI systems that can work on their own. These systems will be used to solve important national security problems.

Doug Matty, the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Officer, said that using AI is changing how the Defense Department supports soldiers and keeps a strategic advantage over enemies.

The contracts announced today strengthen the cooperation between leading AI companies and the U.S. government. They also respond to concerns that federal agencies should have fair competition for AI contracts.

Elon Musk's xAI confirmed today that it has signed a contract to provide services to the U.S. Department of Defense. Agence France-Presse reported that xAI also said that because the company is now on the official list of suppliers, "every federal government department, agency, or office can now buy xAI products" in addition to the Defense Department contract.

However, xAI's chatbot Grok caused problems after a system update on July 7. In some of its responses on the social media platform X, it praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, criticized "anti-white hatred," and said that Jewish characters in Hollywood were "out of proportion" to reality. xAI has apologized for the extreme and offensive messages and said it has fixed the instructions that caused these issues.
