<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8836895">https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8836895</a>

The Ministry of Education officially announced a change yesterday. It changed the rules for hiring substitute teachers in schools from primary to high school. Now, qualified substitute teachers' work experience can be counted for salary raises, just like full-time teachers. This change comes after the Constitutional Court said last July that not counting past work experience for substitute teachers was against the law.

Before this, the rules for substitute teachers' pay were different in various places. Some areas did not count their work experience at all. A substitute teacher named Chang Kai-hsiang was unhappy that Zhonghe High School did not count his two years of teaching experience there. So, he asked the Constitutional Court to review the law. The court decided that while the Teachers' Act was legal, the part about not counting past work experience for substitute teachers was not. The Ministry of Education was told to change the law within one year to make the rules the same across the country.

The National Substitute and Adjunct Teachers' Union said today that the Ministry of Education officially announced the change to the substitute teacher hiring rules yesterday. A new rule, Article 16, Section 3, has been added. It says that if a qualified substitute teacher works for more than three months at a time and has a total of one year of experience, their salary can be raised by one level, similar to full-time teachers.

The union said that this change means substitute teachers are now included in the salary system for the first time. This ends the long-standing unfairness where they "worked longer but didn't get pay raises." This gives all substitute teachers in Taiwan the respect and protection they have been waiting for.

The union also noted that this change took eight years of hard work. Chang Kai-hsiang started a legal case in 2017. The union helped him appeal, and in 2019, he officially asked the Constitutional Court for a review. In January 2023, the court accepted the case. In March 2024, there was a public hearing, and in August 2024, the court said the rule was illegal. The court gave one year to change the law, and now the system has finally been corrected. This is a response to past unfairness and a big step to improve the working conditions in education.

The union asked for proper pay for substitute teachers. They said it is important for keeping the education system stable and for keeping good teachers, especially with fewer children being born and more teachers moving jobs. Having a system that counts work experience will help build a stable group of teachers and stop unfair treatment and good teachers from leaving.

**Taichung KMT Branch Faked Signatures for Recall, Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng Released on NT$1 Million Bail Early This Morning**

<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8836795">https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8836795</a>

To fight back against many recall efforts, the Taichung City branch of the Kuomintang (KMT) had 33 staff members and party workers, including the head of the first group, Wu Kang-lung, and Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng, fake signatures. They copied names from party lists to propose recalling Green Party lawmakers Tsai Chi-chang and Ho Hsin-chun. They even told party members to use blue and black pens in turns to fake 4,258 lists of names. Prosecutors charged 34 party members yesterday. Wu and Chen were already in jail and were released on bail early this morning for NT$800,000 and NT$1 million, respectively, after appearing in court.

Prosecutors said yesterday that they charged 34 party members, including Wu Kang-lung and Chen Jian-feng, with faking documents and breaking election laws. Wu and Chen were arrested in early May and have been in jail since then. Their case was sent to court yesterday, and the Taichung District Court decided late last night that they could be released on bail. The two raised the money in about an hour and were successfully released early this morning.

Prosecutors stated that in mid-to-late January this year, the KMT Taichung City branch held a meeting. They decided to act against the recall attempts targeting KMT lawmakers in various parts of Taichung. They also decided to start recall efforts against Green Party lawmakers Tsai Chi-chang (in the first district) and Ho Hsin-chun (in the seventh district). Wu Kang-lung, the general manager of the KMT Taichung City branch's first group, was put in charge of the recall work, and Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng was to help him.

According to the Public Officials Election And Recall Act, the recall proposals for Taichung City's first and seventh districts needed 2,235 and 3,297 signatures, respectively. To quickly get enough signatures, Wu decided to copy from the KMT party member lists to fake many signatures.

Prosecutors found that on January 22, Wu Kang-lung sent a message in a party LINE group. He asked the executive and deputy executive to come to the party office the next day for a "special meeting." He also told them to bring one blue pen and one black pen each and to download the party member lists for the first and seventh districts to use for copying.

Prosecutors said that on January 23, the day of the "special meeting," 34 people, including Wu Kang-lung and Chen Jian-feng, were there. Wu explained to them that the recall targets were Tsai Chi-chang and Ho Hsin-chun. He asked them to copy many names from the party lists. He also reminded them: "Do not copy names of party members over 80 years old, do not write simplified Chinese characters, mark names that have been copied on the party list to avoid copying them again, and you must use black and blue pens alternately."

In total, those 34 people copied and faked 1,710 recall proposals for Tsai Chi-chang and 2,502 for Ho Hsin-chun that day, totaling 4,212 proposals. In late January and early February, Wu and Chen told party members to sort and arrange the papers. If they saw the same handwriting too many times in a row, they would change the order to avoid being caught. These fake signature lists were then sent to the Central Election Commission, with a total of 6,350 submitted.

However, after the Election Commission checked and removed the invalid ones, they needed 61 more for Tsai and 445 more for Ho. Wu and Chen then told party members to copy and fake 10 more for Tsai and 36 more for Ho. Finally, the Election Commission checked again. They found 2,360 valid proposals for Tsai (the minimum was 2,235) and 3,513 valid proposals for Ho (the minimum was 3,297). But after removing the fake ones (1,720 for Tsai and 2,538 for Ho), it was clear that neither recall attempt had enough valid signatures.

Prosecutors said that Wu Kang-lung and Chen Jian-feng were high-ranking officials at the KMT Taichung City branch. They deleted chat records later to hide evidence. At first, they did not admit their guilt but finally did. Other executive and deputy executive staff did what they did because of pressure. In the end, 34 people were charged with breaking election laws and faking documents.

**China's "22 Anti-Independence Rules" One Year On: Chinese Ministry of State Security Claims Repeatedly Foiling Taiwan Spy Cases**

<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7333/8836796">https://udn.com/news/story/7333/8836796</a>

It has been more than a year since China released the "Opinions on Punishing Stubborn 'Taiwan Independence' Separatists According to Law for Crimes of Splitting the Country and Inciting Splitting the Country" (also known as the "22 Anti-Independence Rules") last June. This morning, China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) said that these rules show a strong desire and power to protect national unity through law. They also claimed that Chinese security agencies have "repeatedly broken up Taiwan spy cases" and destroyed many spy networks.

The article also criticized the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities. It said that the DPP acts for its own party's gain, creates "green terror" among the people in Taiwan, and suppresses those who disagree without caring about the people's well-being. It also said that the DPP relies on Western countries, ignores what is best for the nation, and acts as a "pawn" for anti-China forces. The article added that the DPP refuses to accept the "1992 Consensus," twists the meaning of "One Country, Two Systems," treats peace across the Taiwan Strait as a joke, and keeps provoking for independence. The MSS stated that the DPP's bad actions will only turn Taiwan into a "powder keg" and "ammunition depot," putting the people of Taiwan in a dangerous situation of war. It warned that following the path of Taiwan independence will only make people tools for the DPP's private use, make them "cannon fodder" for Taiwan independence forces trying to gain independence by force, and make them historical criminals against the Chinese nation.

On June 28, the Chinese MSS stated that the "Opinions" provide strong legal tools to protect China's sovereignty and land. They send a clear and strong warning to Taiwan independence forces, showing a firm commitment and strong action to maintain national unity through law.

The article said that in the year since the "Opinions" were issued, relevant departments have used their powers fully. For example, in August 2024, the Wenzhou Intermediate People's Court in Zhejiang Province sentenced Yang Zhiyuan to nine years in prison for "splitting the country" and took away his political rights for three years. In February this year, the Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate People's Court sentenced Li Yan-he, the chief editor of Taiwan's Bashi Culture, to three years in prison for "inciting splitting the country," took away his political rights for one year, and made him pay 50,000 Chinese yuan.

Additionally, China's Ministry of State Security and other departments have named and released information about several members of Taiwan's cyber army who were involved in planning, leading, and carrying out cyberattacks, stealing secrets, and trying to influence people in mainland China. This strongly stops their attempts to gain independence through cyber means and has a powerful effect.

The article also mentioned that Chinese national security agencies have continued to take strong action. They have repeatedly found and broken up Taiwan spy cases, destroying many spy networks set up in mainland China. They have strictly punished intelligence infiltration and splitting activities according to law, effectively protecting national security.

The Chinese MSS said that after the special operations "2018 - Thunder" and "Thunder - 2020," national security agencies will continue to strongly follow the requirements of the "Opinions." They will do their duties fully, strictly punish illegal and criminal actions by "Taiwan independence" separatists according to law, and strongly fight back against the arrogance of "Taiwan independence" separatist forces and outside interference.

Last August, the Chinese MSS also published an article claiming it had "repeatedly broken up over a thousand Taiwan spy and secret-stealing cases and destroyed a large number of spy networks set up in mainland China." At that time, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded that if these "over a thousand Taiwan spy and secret-stealing cases" were not meant to exaggerate their achievements or boast, then it was another open declaration that China's state security departments use vague and unclear laws to illegally detain Taiwanese people who do not agree with China's political ideas and who support democracy and freedom, treating them as "Taiwan independence" separatists or spies.
