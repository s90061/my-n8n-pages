            <h1>Chinese Scientists Leave the US, Top Statistician Liu Jun Joins Beijing Tsinghua</h1>
            <p>Recent reports show that many famous Chinese scientists are leaving the United States and returning to work in China. This is happening because of tensions between the US and China. The two newest scientists to return are Liu Jun, an expert in statistics, and Wang Leyao, a microbiologist.</p>
            <p>A report from Beijing states that Chinese scientists are going back to China because of the difficult relationship between the US and China. Also, the US government under Trump cut a lot of money for science research. After Wang Leyao, a microbiologist from the US National Institutes of Health, Liu Jun, a world-famous statistician, officially started working full-time at Tsinghua University in Beijing two days ago.</p>
            <p>The report says that Tsinghua University held a welcome ceremony for him. Important people from the university, like the Party Committee Secretary Qiu Yong and President Li Luming, were there.</p>
            <p>Liu Jun was a professor of statistics at Harvard University. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Statistical Association. He did very important work in areas like Bayesian inference, computational biology, and bioinformatics. He also won the "COPSS Presidents' Award," which is a very high honor in statistics.</p>
            <p>He finished his studies in mathematics at Peking University in 1985 and received his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1991.</p>
            <p>During the ceremony, Tsinghua President Li Luming said he hopes that after Liu Jun joins Tsinghua, he will use his wide influence in academics. He hopes Liu Jun will take advantage of the fourth industrial revolution, which is led by artificial intelligence. This will help Tsinghua's statistics and data science programs get even better and train more highly skilled and innovative young people.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Shenzhen Medical Academy announced last week that Wang Leyao joined them full-time in July.</p>
            <p>Wang Leyao studied at Nankai University and earned his PhD in microbiology from Fudan University. He did research after his PhD at Johns Hopkins University and Yale University in the US. Before this, he was an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts School of Public Health and Health Sciences and a climate and health scholar at the US National Institutes of Health.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Wang Leyao's team focuses on human microbiology. They work to understand how microbes, hosts, and pathogens interact.</p>
            <p>The report also points out that in recent years, many Chinese scientists have left the US and returned to China. These include Chen Min, a mathematics professor from Purdue University; Liu Chang, a nuclear physicist from Princeton University; Lin Huaxin, a mathematics professor from the University of Oregon; and Zhan Hanyu, an optics researcher from Corning Inc.</p>
            <p>Also, Zhang Yitang, a top mathematician in the world, returned to China in June. He started working full-time at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou. Zhang Yitang said that he returned to China because of how Chinese-American scientists have been treated in the US recently.</p>

Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan held a dinner last night to welcome international guests. Xi Jinping said that there are many more unstable things happening in the world now. Because of this, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has a bigger duty to keep peace and stability in the region.</p>
            <p>The SCO summit (Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit) is taking place in Tianjin from August 31 to September 1. China's state media, CCTV News, reported yesterday that Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan held a dinner yesterday evening at the Tianjin Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center.

            <p>Xi Jinping spoke at the meeting. He said that since the Shanghai Cooperation Organization started, it has made its members more united and trusting. It has also improved practical cooperation and taken part in international and regional events. He said it has become "an important force for building new types of international relations and a shared future for humanity." Now, he added, the world is changing very quickly, and there are more unclear and unexpected problems.
