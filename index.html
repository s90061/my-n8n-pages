    US President Trump announced today that the 90-day pause for special taxes on goods from many countries will not be extended. This pause ends on July 9. After this date, Washington will start charging these taxes unless a country has made a deal with the United States.
</p>
<p>
    Trump said that letters about this will be sent out "soon." He mentioned on Fox News that the US will look at how each country treats the US. Some countries might have to pay 25%, 35%, 50%, or even 10% more in taxes on their goods.
</p>
<p>
    Trump had previously said that it is hard to make deals with 200 countries, even though his government first aimed for "90 trade deals in 90 days." He said negotiations are still happening, but it's impossible to talk with every country.

<p>
    According to ESPN, Malik Beasley, a basketball player for the Detroit Pistons in the NBA, is being investigated by federal lawyers. The investigation is about claims that he was involved in gambling related to NBA games and betting.
</p>
<p>
    ESPN said that these claims are about the time Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023-24 season. During that season, Beasley played in 79 games, starting 77 of them. He scored about 11.3 points, got 3.7 rebounds, and made 1.4 assists per game.
</p>
<p>
    Beasley's lawyer, Steve Haney, told ESPN that being investigated does not mean someone is guilty. He also said that Beasley, like everyone else, is considered innocent until proven guilty, and he has not been charged with any crime yet. Beasley, who is 28 years old, is about to become a free player and was talking with the Pistons about a new contract for three years worth $42 million. However, these talks have now stopped.

    <strong>news_title 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Japan's Kyodo News reported that China plans to invite former US President Donald Trump to a celebration on September 3 in Beijing. This event will include a military parade in Tiananmen Square to mark 80 years since the end of World War II.
</p>
<p>
    Sources said that the US has also suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the US in September, which is when the United Nations General Assembly will be held in New York. If either of these visits happens, it would be the first time the leaders of the world's two biggest economies meet in person during Trump's possible second term.
</p>
<p>
    Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to be at the Beijing parade. China's Foreign Ministry stated that Xi invited Trump to visit China again during a phone call on June 5, and Trump thanked him and also invited Xi to visit the US. However, sources say that many high-ranking US officials, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, might not want Trump to go to the parade. Also, the Chinese government is worried about Xi visiting the US because they fear a difficult meeting with Trump, similar to one with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy in February. Instead, China might send Premier Li Qiang to the UN meeting.
