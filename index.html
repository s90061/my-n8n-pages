Last week, fewer people in the United States applied for unemployment benefits for the first time. The number went down to 227,000, which was less than experts thought. This number shows that the job market is still quite good.

The government said that 5,000 fewer people applied for help in the first week of July, making the total 227,000. This is lower than the 238,000 experts predicted.

In June, the US economy also added 147,000 new jobs. This was a surprise and showed that the job market is strong, even with some unsure economic policies from the president. The unemployment rate also went down a little, from 4.2% to 4.1%. Even though there are some small problems because of new trade rules, the job market is generally healthy.

**UK and France to Work Together on New Weapons and Nuclear Defense**

The UK and France are planning to create new types of missiles and advanced weapons that use Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is to make their defenses stronger. These new weapons will include advanced air-to-air missiles and special devices that can stop drones and other missiles.

Both countries have agreed to study how to use AI to make unmanned systems and missiles attack together, which would make them more effective. They will also work more closely on nuclear research, following international rules to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading.

For the first time, the UK and France have said that they will plan together how to use their nuclear weapons. This is to protect Europe from very serious threats. This could mean that France's nuclear weapons will work more closely with NATO's plans, offering more protection to other European countries in NATO.

The UK and France are the only countries in Europe with nuclear weapons that are part of NATO. They will also buy more "Storm Shadow" missiles, which they built together, and develop even newer, better missiles. Their armies will also work together more closely, and they will use technology from space and the internet to improve their fighting abilities.

**Saudi Arabia Executes Two Ethiopians for Drug Crimes; More Than 100 Foreigners Executed This Year**

Saudi Arabia has executed two people from Ethiopia for drug-related crimes. The government announced this today. This means that at least 101 foreigners have been executed in Saudi Arabia this year, according to news reports.

The two people were found guilty of bringing marijuana into the country and were sentenced to death by the courts. So far this year, Saudi Arabia has executed a total of 189 people, including 88 of its own citizens.

Last year, the number of foreigners executed in Saudi Arabia did not reach 100 until November. Saudi Arabia is one of the countries that carries out the most death sentences in the world. In 2024, Saudi Arabia executed at least 338 people, which is much more than in 2023 (170) and 2022 (196).
