            <h1>Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng Beat Chinese Team, Reach Men's Doubles Quarterfinals at Japan Badminton Open</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 17) The BWF Japan Open (Super 750) is still happening. Today, Taiwan's men's doubles team, "Cold Flow Pair" Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng, won their Round of 16 match. They beat the Chinese team Chen Bo-Yang and Liu Yi in two straight games, 21-19 and 21-18. They are the only Taiwanese men's doubles team to reach the quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Four Taiwanese men's doubles teams played in the Japan Badminton Open, organized by the Badminton World Federation (BWF). But after three days of matches, only Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng made it to the quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng are ranked 24th in the world. Today was their first time playing against Chen Bo-Yang and Liu Yi, who are ranked 11th in the world.</p>
            <p>The first game was very close. Both sides scored points back and forth. Taiwan's team was behind 11-14 in the middle of the game. But Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng made fewer mistakes and caught up. When the score was 19-19, they scored two more points to win the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, both teams still played very hard. The Chinese team was ahead, but only by one or two points. When Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng were behind 12-14, they used fast movements and flat shots to score 8 points to 2, giving them 4 match points at 20-16.</p>
            <p>Even though the Chinese team scored two more points, Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng still won the match.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-Han told Central News Agency that playing against this Chinese team for the first time was difficult. He said, "But we stayed patient. We used our strong points and made fewer mistakes. We fought for every point with them."</p>
            <p>This is the fourth time Yang Po-Han and Liu Kuang-Heng have reached the quarterfinals in a tournament this year. Before this, they made it to the quarterfinals at the All England Open, the Asian Championships, and the Thailand Open. Their next opponents will be the Malaysian team, Tan Wee Kiong and Nur Mohd Azriyn Ayub.</p>

            <h1>Pusihng for Asia Asset Management Hub: FSC Says 22 Companies Approved for Kaohsiung Zone</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 17) Taiwan wants to become an important place for managing money in Asia. The Kaohsiung Asset Management Zone started in July. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that it has approved 22 companies to join the Kaohsiung Zone. These include 14 banks, 3 life insurance companies, and 5 investment trust and consulting firms. Another 6 companies are still waiting for approval.</p>
            <p>Gao Jing-ping, Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said at a regular press conference that they received applications from 8 investment trust and consulting firms to join the Kaohsiung Zone. In the past two weeks, they approved 5 of them: AllianceBernstein Investment Trust, Fidelity Investment Trust, Prudential Investment Trust, Franklin Templeton Investment Consulting, and Baring Investment Consulting. These companies mainly want to try new business methods, such as multi-channel sales and EAM (External Asset Management). The other 3 investment trust and consulting firms are still being reviewed.</p>
            <p>In addition, Gao Jing-ping said that two securities firms have also applied to try new services in the zone and are still being reviewed. Their main requests are to work together with international securities business units (OSU) and international banking units (OBU) for marketing. They also want to be able to use trusts to buy financial products that are not usually available.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jia-kui, Chief Secretary of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said that 14 banks are still approved to try new businesses. Taishin Bank has applied and is being reviewed. Also, three banks that are approved to handle high-value assets have said they want to join the Kaohsiung Zone. Companies have applied for all 22 types of new businesses that banks can try. Most of these applications are for lending services (like personal loans with collateral, insurance financing, loans secured by asset portfolios) and family offices.</p>
            <p>According to FSC data, the 14 banks approved are: Land Bank of Taiwan, First Commercial Bank, Hua Nan Commercial Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Taipei Fubon Bank, Cathay United Bank, Mega International Commercial Bank, HSBC (Taiwan) Commercial Bank, Yuanta Bank, E.SUN Commercial Bank, DBS Bank (Taiwan), CTBC Bank, UBS AG Taiwan Branch, and Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
            <p>Regarding insurance companies, Chen Ching-yuan, Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said that Nanshan Life and Cathay Life were approved on July 1st, and Fubon Life was approved on July 3rd to join the Kaohsiung Zone. The number of approved insurance companies is the same as before. Also, three other companies have shown interest but have not yet applied.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan pointed out that the three approved life insurance companies have all applied for wealth management services. They want to create special insurance products that do not follow the rule about the minimum ratio of death benefits to policy value reserves for life insurance products. Two of these companies have also applied for International Insurance Business Units (OIU). In the future, they might work with OBU and OSU for joint marketing.</p>
