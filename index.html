            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu Approaches, Kinmen to Xiamen, Quanzhou 'Mini Three Links' to Suspend on 13th</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu is getting closer. Today, August 12, at 2:30 PM, the Central Weather Administration gave a land warning for the typhoon. The Kinmen County Port Authority said that on August 13, all ferry services from Kinmen to Xiamen and Quanzhou will stop. Passengers should check with the ferry companies before traveling.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration is still giving sea warnings for Typhoon Yangliu. At 11 AM today, the warning area for the sea included the southern part of the Taiwan Strait. At 2:30 PM today, the Central Weather Administration also gave a land warning for Typhoon Yangliu. The first areas under this land warning are Hualien, Taitung, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen County Port Authority announced earlier today, August 12, that some ferry services would stop. This was because the Ba Fang ferry needed to get ready for the typhoon. So, ferry services from Kinmen to Quanzhou stopped this afternoon. Later in the afternoon, they announced again that because of Typhoon Yangliu, all 'Mini Three Links' ferry services from Kinmen's Shuitou to Xiamen's Wutong and Quanzhou's Shijing will be stopped all day on August 13.</p>
            <p>The Port Authority reminds all passengers to check with their ferry company about their trip before they go. If you have any questions, you can call the Kinmen County Port Authority at 082-324280.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kinmen County Fire Department said that because Typhoon Yangliu is coming, the county government's emergency center will open at level three tonight, August 12, at 10 PM. They plan to open the emergency center at level one tomorrow, August 13, at 10 AM, and hold a meeting about typhoon prevention work at the same time.</p>

            <h1>Large Vehicles, Micro Electric Two-Wheelers: License Plate Scraping Now Available Online</h1>
            <p>To make it easier for people to cancel or give back vehicle license plates, the Freeway Bureau said today, August 12, that starting now, more types of vehicles can use the online service on the "Motor Vehicle Services Network." This service for canceling or giving back license plates now includes large private cars, business vehicles, and small electric two-wheelers.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation already had online services called "License Plate Cancellation and Return Online Application Service" and "Vehicle Recycling Service One-Stop Shop." Owners of motorcycles and small private cars could use these services anytime, anywhere, without limits on place or time, to cancel or return their license plates. Since these services started at the end of 2020, about 600,000 requests have been completed.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau announced that starting today, August 12, more people can use these services. Now, owners of large private cars and small electric two-wheelers can use them. Also, certain vehicle transport businesses can use them, such as tour bus companies, car rental companies, small truck rental companies, car transport companies, car route transport companies, and car container transport companies. These businesses need to log in as members on the Motor Vehicle Services Network.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau said that you only need to apply online to cancel or return your license plate. At the same time, you must pay all fuel fees and traffic fines. Then, within 10 days, you need to mail the license plate back to a motor vehicle office. After that, the process is finished. The system will also send a proof of cancellation for the owner to keep.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau reminds people that after applying online, they must mail the license plate back to a motor vehicle office within 10 days. If you do not send it back on time, your request will be canceled. You will then need to apply online again and send the license plate again to finish the process.</p>
            <p>For vehicles whose license plates have been canceled or returned, the Freeway Bureau says that these vehicles cannot be driven or parked on the road. If a vehicle breaks this rule and is driven on the road, the owner will have to pay a fine between NT$3,600 and NT$10,800, according to Article 12 of the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act. The vehicle will also be taken away right away.</p>
            <p>Also, the Freeway Bureau stated that owners of large private cars and certain vehicle transport businesses (like tour bus companies, car rental companies, small truck rental companies, car transport companies, car route transport companies, and car container transport companies) who want to recycle their vehicle and cancel its registration at the same time can apply through the Ministry of Environment's Resource Circulation Administration's "Vehicle Recycling Service One-Stop Shop" (https://recyclecar.moenv.gov.tw/). This way, they can complete both the vehicle recycling and registration cancellation in one go.</p>

            <h1>Gaza Situation Worsens, Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund to Sell Israeli Investments</h1>
            <p>Norway's state-owned investment fund announced today, August 11, that it will sell its investments in 11 Israeli companies. This news comes after reports that the fund was still investing in an Israeli company that makes engines for warplanes, even while the war in Gaza continued.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Nicolai Tangen, the CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, which runs the state fund, said this decision was made "because of special circumstances."</p>
            <p>Tangen said in a statement: "The situation in Gaza is a serious human crisis. We invest in companies that work in countries where there is war. Recently, the situation in the West Bank and Gaza has become worse."</p>
            <p>He added that this step will reduce the number of Israeli companies that Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund's Council of Ethics needs to watch.</p>
            <p>Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund is also called the Oil Fund. It gets its money from selling a lot of energy. It is the biggest state investment fund in the world, worth about 1.9 trillion US dollars (about 57 trillion New Taiwan dollars). It invests in more than 8,600 companies worldwide.</p>
            <p>Last week, the Norwegian newspaper "Aftenposten" reported that Norway's Sovereign Wealth Fund had invested in Israeli Bet Shemesh Engines Holdings. This company makes parts for engines used in Israeli fighter jets.</p>
            <p>Tangen later confirmed this report and said that the fund had even bought more shares in the company after Israel started its attacks on Gaza.</p>
            <p>After this news came out, Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store asked Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg to check the investments. Stoltenberg used to be the head of NATO.</p>
            <p>Norges Bank Investment Management said that by the middle of this year, the fund had invested in 61 Israeli companies. 11 of these companies were not part of the "stock benchmark index." The Norwegian stock benchmark index is set by the Ministry of Finance. It is used to see how well the state fund is doing.</p>
            <p>Norges Bank Investment Management also said that last week, they decided to "sell all investments in Israeli companies that are not on the stock benchmark index as soon as possible."</p>
