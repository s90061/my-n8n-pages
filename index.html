            <h1>Vice President: Taiwan-US Talks Continue, Hope for Trade Balance and Industry Benefits</h1>
            <p>Taiwan and the US started new talks this week. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said that the team for the talks is still in Washington D.C. They are working hard and feel very responsible. They are always trying to find a good balance in trade and help Taiwan's industries. They also want to make sure Taiwan and the US can work more closely in technology and other industries.</p>
            <p>Today, Vice President Hsiao spoke at a meeting for the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce. She said that Taiwanese businesses have always done well when facing problems. This includes the oil crisis in the past, joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), and big changes in world politics.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Bi-khim said that the world is still not calm now. Taiwan is facing trade wars and technology wars from outside. Taiwan is in the middle of a very strong global competition in politics and industry. But Taiwan has strong industries that have been built for many years. This helps Taiwan be a very important part of the world during this tough time.</p>
            <p>As the world changes quickly, Hsiao Bi-khim hopes Taiwan can be a stable partner. In the past, Taiwan often just reacted to things. Now, Taiwan actively looks at its strengths and plans. It also finds ways to work with other countries. In recent years, as businesses spread globally and reduce risks, Taiwan has also made new friendships in different parts of the world.</p>
            <p>About the talks with the US on taxes for goods, Hsiao Bi-khim said the team is still in Washington D.C. The people doing the talks are very hardworking and responsible. They are working almost 24 hours a day. They are trying to achieve fair trade and help Taiwan's industries. They also want to find chances for Taiwan and the US to work more closely in technology, money, and other industries in the future.</p>
            <p>Besides the US, Hsiao Bi-khim said that Taiwan has been working on its New Southbound Policy in recent years. At the same time, it has signed trade agreements with countries like the UK and Canada. As the world changes, more international friends are visiting Taiwan. They want to work more closely with Taiwan. Even though there are problems in the world, Taiwan is finding new chances.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Bi-khim said that the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce has always helped the government and businesses talk to each other. It is also an important group that connects Taiwan's strong industries. She hopes that bigger companies can help smaller ones in the future. She wants Taiwan's industries to grow equally. This means not only high-tech companies but also many small and medium-sized businesses and all types of jobs. She hopes everyone can find new chances during these changing times.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Bi-khim said that the government is also working with different departments. They are looking at new chances with AI (Artificial Intelligence). They are also making plans for AI and digital changes, and for reducing carbon. This is to make sure small and medium-sized businesses are not left out in the changing world. Instead, they can grow with new technology companies. Together, they can make Taiwan's economy stronger.</p>

            <h1>Two Youth Orchestras from Kaohsiung Go to Japan to Perform in Tokyo Concert Hall</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung Symphony Orchestra Youth Orchestra (KSO Youth Orchestra) and the Kaohsiung Chinese Orchestra Youth Chinese Orchestra (KCO Youth Chinese Orchestra) were asked to perform in Japan. They will play on July 29th at a new concert hall in Setagaya, Tokyo. This shows the good results of their music exchange.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Bureau of Cultural Affairs said today in a press release that the KSO Youth Orchestra visited Setagaya Youth Orchestra in 2018 and 2019. Now, this year, they will go to Japan again with some of the best members from the KCO Youth Chinese Orchestra. Young musicians from Taiwan and Japan will come together. They will start a new part of their cultural exchange. The Setagaya Youth Orchestra also plans to visit Kaohsiung in the summer of 2026. Music will connect them and continue this international friendship.</p>
            <p>Wang Wen-tsui, the Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, said that in 2016, a member of the Setagaya City Council came to Taiwan. They wanted to find a city to be friends with for cultural exchange. Both sides signed an agreement for the first time. In 2019, after both cities signed another agreement, the Setagaya Youth Orchestra and the KSO Youth Orchestra started to work together. Their exchange began with music and became very close. Later, it grew to include culture, art, tourism, sports, and other areas.</p>
            <p>The KSO Youth Orchestra has almost 100 members. It is the biggest youth orchestra in southern Taiwan. The members come from Kaohsiung and other cities in the south. They practice every week. Every year, they perform twice at the Weiwuying Concert Hall and the Dadong Arts Center. This trip to Setagaya will help the members see more of the world and gain stage experience. It will also help with cultural exchange between the cities.</p>
            <p>For this performance, the KSO Youth Orchestra will be led by the famous young conductor from Taiwan, Pao Heng-yi. They will play "Angel from Formosa" by Tyzen Hsiao and "The Moldau" by Smetana. The KCO Youth Chinese Orchestra's string and wind group will play "Under the Bald Cypress" by Yang Chieh-ju and "Yangmingshan in Spring Morning" by Tung Jung-sen. Also, Chen Yi-jou and Ruan Hsin-yu will play "Song of Chu" a double erhu concerto by Li Bo-chan.</p>
            <p>For the final performance, 100 musicians from the KSO Youth Orchestra and the Setagaya Youth Orchestra will play together. They will perform the classic movie music "Cinema Paradiso" by the Italian composer Ennio Morricone.</p>
