            <h1>Greenland's "Arctic Light 2025" Military Exercise: Denmark Did Not Invite US Army</h1>
            <p>NATO countries are working more closely to protect the Arctic. However, Denmark did not ask the US military to join "Arctic Light 2025." This is the biggest military exercise in Greenland's modern history. This happened while the US showed interest in Greenland, which is a part of Denmark but has some self-rule.</p>
            <p>The "Arctic Light 2025" exercise started on September 9th and will end on September 19th. More than 550 soldiers are taking part. They are from Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway. Special forces are also included.</p>
            <p>Soren Andersen, who leads the Danish Arctic Command, said that the US military was not asked to join the exercise. This is true even though Pete Hegseth, the US Secretary of Defense, was invited.</p>
            <p>Andersen told Reuters: "We work with our friends at the US Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. But they were not asked to send their soldiers to this exercise."</p>
            <p>In the past, the US has joined military exercises led by Denmark in Greenland. A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Copenhagen said: "We did not join this exercise. But we continue to work closely with Denmark and other friendly countries in the Arctic on military matters."</p>
            <p>Hans Peter Michaelsen, an independent military expert, told Reuters that this exercise "sends a strong political message." He added that it "is mainly to show the US that Greenland is controlled by Denmark. And Denmark gets help from other important NATO countries."</p>
            <p>But Andersen said the exercise was not meant to send a message to the US government. He explained that the exercise is preparation for possible future situations. These situations include Russia and China becoming more active in the Arctic.</p>

            <h1>Chen Chih-han Says Ko Wen-je's Use of Political Donations for Salaries is Legal; Taipei Prosecutors' Office Says It's Against the Law</h1>
            <p>Chen Chih-han, who leads the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) group in the parliament, said today that the Investigation Bureau sent a letter. This letter said that Ko Wen-je using leftover money from political donations to pay some staff at foundations and companies was not against the law. But the Taipei Prosecutors' Office said that this letter was a report from the Investigation Bureau about their findings. The prosecutor decided that it does not follow the law.</p>
            <p>Chen Chih-han spoke on an online show hosted by a media person named Huang Kuang-chin today. She said that yesterday, Ko Wen-je's lawyer showed a letter in court. The letter said that during the investigation, the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice had replied to the Taipei District Prosecutors' Office. It said that using a candidate's leftover political donations to pay for staff costs and public relations costs during elections is allowed. This is part of what the Political Donations Act covers, so it was not illegal.</p>
            <p>Late tonight, the Taipei Prosecutors' Office released a press statement. It said that the letter Chen Chih-han talked about was sent by a prosecutor to the Northern Mobile Station of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. This was to investigate cases about Ko Wen-je's political donations, which might have been reported wrongly. The Northern Mobile Station then sent its findings to the Taipei Prosecutors' Office. It was not a "reply from the Ministry of Justice."</p>
            <p>The press statement also said that after investigating, the prosecutor found that Ko Wen-je's leftover political donations were not paid directly to TPP staff. Instead, they were paid to "Muko Company" and "Zhongwang Foundation." Then, these two organizations used the money to pay their own staff.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office said that "Muko Company" is a business, and "Zhongwang Foundation" is a charity. Neither of them has anything to do with public elections. So, using leftover political donations to pay staff at "Muko Company" and "Zhongwang Foundation" does not fit the purpose of "use for public elections."</p>
            <p>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office further explained that the presidential election ended in January last year. After that, there were no public elections for a short time. Also, the money was not used to pay staff for someone planning to run in an election. Because of this, there is a suspicion of misusing public funds, which is a crime. So, a lawsuit was filed. As for the findings from the Northern Mobile Station, the prosecutor decided that they do not follow the law based on the investigation results. The prosecutor has the power to decide the facts and apply the law, and is not bound by the Investigation Bureau's findings.</p>
            <p>Separately, the Taipei District Court heard the Jinghua City case and Ko Wen-je's political donation case again yesterday. The court called Ko Wen-je, the former TPP chairman and defendant, along with Li Wen-juan, the chairwoman of Muko Company, and accountant Duanmu Zheng. Li Wen-tsung, the former finance chief of Ko Wen-je's campaign, was called as a witness. Both the prosecution and defense asked them questions.</p>
            <p>Tonight, the TPP posted on Facebook. They said, "Yesterday, during the Jinghua City case hearing at the Taipei District Court, the prosecutor read out Ko Wen-je's LINE messages. Many messages had nothing to do with the case." They also asked, "Are these questions meant to strengthen the evidence in the indictment, or are they politically motivated to ruin someone's reputation and attack their character?"</p>
            <p>In response, the Taipei Prosecutors' Office also explained that the LINE chat records between Ko Wen-je and Li Wen-tsung are important evidence. They show that Ko Wen-je had control over the finances of the TPP, Zhongwang Foundation, Xingu Xiang Association, and Muko Company. This evidence is valid. The prosecutor using this as material for questioning is a necessary way to prove Ko Wen-je's criminal acts.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Prosecutors' Office said that Ko Wen-je's lawyer had also argued that the prosecutor's questions were political surveillance. But the presiding judge rejected this in court. The judge ruled that the prosecutor's questions were related to the facts of this case. This shows that the TPP's Facebook post gives wrong information and causes confusion. It should be clarified.</p>
