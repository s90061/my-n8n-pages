            <h1>US Commerce Secretary: If China Does Not Approve TikTok Sale, US Will Ban It</h1>
            <p>The US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, said today that the video app TikTok must stop working in the United States if China does not allow its sale. About 170 million people in the US use this app.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lutnick also said on CNBC news that the US needs to control the special computer code, called an algorithm, that makes TikTok work.</p>
            <p>In June, former President Trump gave ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, 90 more days to sell TikTok's American parts. The new deadline is September 17. This was the third time he delayed banning the popular app.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lutnick said, "China can own a small part, or ByteDance, the current owner, can keep a small part. But mainly, Americans will have control. They will own the technology and control the algorithm."</p>
            <p>"If China approves the deal, it will happen. If they do not approve it, TikTok will be blocked. These decisions will be made soon."</p>
            <p>TikTok did not say anything right away.</p>

            <h1>Macron: France Will Recognize Palestinian State, Announce at UN General Assembly in September</h1>
            <p>Today, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France will officially say it recognizes Palestine as a state. This will happen at the United Nations General Assembly in September. With this, France will be the most important European country to recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>Macron wrote on social media platforms X and Instagram: "I have decided that France will recognize the Palestinian state. This keeps our promise to work for a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East. I will officially announce this at the UN General Assembly in September."</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, 142 countries, including France now, have recognized Palestine as a state. This is true even though Israel and the United States strongly disagree.</p>
            <p>Macron also wrote: "It is most important to stop the war in Gaza and save the people there."</p>
            <p>Hussein al-Sheikh, who works with Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, thanked Macron.</p>
            <p>Al-Sheikh said: "This decision shows that France respects international law. It also shows support for the Palestinian people's right to decide their future and have their own country."</p>
            <p>However, Yariv Levin, Israel's Deputy Prime Minister, strongly criticized France's action. He called it "a stain on France's history and direct help to terrorism."</p>

            <h1>US Crude Oil Stocks Fall and Supply Concerns Rise, International Oil Prices Up About 1%</h1>
            <p>Today, world oil prices went up by about 1%. This happened because the amount of crude oil stored in the United States went down. Also, Russia is expected to send out less gasoline. These two things were more important than the news that the big oil company Chevron will be allowed to start producing oil again in Venezuela.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures closed up 67 cents, or 0.98%, at $69.18 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures closed up 78 cents, or 1.20%, at $66.03 per barrel.</p>
