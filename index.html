            <h1>Federal Reserve Governor Kugler resigns as Trump pushes for lower interest rates</h1>
            <p>(Washington, August 1st, Reuters) The US central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed), said today that Governor Adriana Kugler will leave her job next week. This gives President Trump a chance to choose a new person for the Fed's board. This happens while Trump is pushing the Fed to lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Kugler was chosen by former President Biden to be a Fed Governor in 2023. She did not say why she is leaving now.</p>
            <p>Kugler was supposed to stay in her job until January 2026. But she is leaving early, next week. This means Trump can choose someone for the Fed's leadership sooner than expected.</p>
            <p>This change in staff comes as the Fed is getting more pressure from Trump. He keeps saying that Jerome Powell, the head of the Fed, is too slow to lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>The Fed said that Kugler plans to go back to being a professor at Georgetown University this year.</p>
