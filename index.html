            <h1>Canadian Government Steps In to Stop Air Canada Cabin Crew Strike</h1>
            <p>The Canadian government stopped a strike by Air Canada cabin crew today. This strike caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled. It also ruined summer travel plans for about 130,000 passengers who fly with Air Canada every day.</p>
            <p>About 10,000 cabin crew members at Air Canada started their strike at midnight today. They were protesting about their pay. Air Canada is the biggest airline in Canada. It flies to 180 cities around the world.</p>
            <p>A few hours later, Canada's Labour Minister, Patty Hajdu, used a special law. This law stopped the strike. It also made both the company and the workers go into a process called "binding arbitration." This means an independent person will make a decision that both sides must follow.</p>
            <p>However, the minister said that Air Canada might still need 5 to 10 days to get back to normal service.</p>
            <p>The union that represents the cabin crew, CUPE, said its members will keep striking. They will only stop when the government officially tells them to go back to work.</p>
            <p>The Air Canada part of the union posted on Facebook. They asked everyone to remember that the strike is "currently only in the arbitration process." They added, "We still have the right to strike by law, and we will continue to do so. We must show the company that we are in charge."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the main problem was pay for time spent working on the ground. But both sides also disagreed about overall wages. Air Canada offered to raise cabin crew pay by 38% over 4 years. The first year's raise would be 25%. However, the union thought this was not enough.</p>
            <p>The union said Air Canada also offered to pay cabin crew for some work they did without pay before. But the amount offered was only half of their normal hourly wage.</p>
            <p>A person close to the talks said the union wants their pay to be the same as cabin crew at Air Transat. Air Transat cabin crew agreed to a new contract last year. Their pay will go up by 30% over 5 years. They are now the highest paid cabin crew in Canada.</p>
            <p>Air Canada did not say if the union asked for this kind of pay raise.</p>

            <h1>US Stops Giving Visas to People from Gaza</h1>
            <p>The US State Department said today it will stop giving US visas to all people from the Gaza Strip. This pause is for a "full and complete" check by the government. Groups that support Palestine said this decision is bad.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the US State Department said it had recently given out "a small number" of temporary visas for medical reasons. But it did not say the exact number.</p>
            <p>Looking at the US State Department's website data each month, the US has given more than 3,800 B1/B2 visas this year. These visas were given to people who have travel papers from the Palestinian Authority. These visas let people from other countries come to the US for medical treatment.</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority gives these travel papers to people living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which are areas controlled by Israel. The US State Department's website does not show detailed numbers for these two areas.</p>
            <p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations said this action is wrong. They called it the newest sign of "planned harshness" from the Donald Trump government.</p>
            <p>The Palestine Children's Relief Fund said that stopping the visas will mean sick and hurt children in the Gaza Strip cannot get medical help.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the US government made this choice after a far-right online personality, Laura Loomer, complained on social media. She has influence with Donald Trump. She was upset that injured Palestinians were allowed to get medical care in the US.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Laura Loomer wrote many posts on X (formerly Twitter). She asked the State Department to stop giving visas to Palestinians from the Gaza Strip. She said they "support Hamas" and "are connected to the Muslim Brotherhood and get money from Qatar." But she did not show any proof for these claims.</p>

            <h1>Hurricane Erin Becomes Category 5, Moving Towards Caribbean</h1>
            <p>Hurricane Erin is moving towards the Caribbean Sea. Today, it became a very dangerous "Category 5" hurricane. Weather experts have warned that it could cause sudden floods, landslides, and mudslides.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave new information. They said that by 11:20 AM today (3:20 PM GMT), Erin's strongest winds became 255 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Erin is the first hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season this year. Right now, it is about 170 kilometers northeast of Anguilla. This is in the northern part of the Leeward Islands in the Caribbean. This area includes the US and British Virgin Islands.</p>
            <p>The middle of the hurricane is expected to pass north of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico during the weekend.</p>
            <p>The National Hurricane Center said that Hurricane Erin could bring up to 150 millimeters of rain to these islands.</p>
            <p>The NHC also warned that some local areas might have very bad sudden floods and city floods. It could also cause landslides or mudslides.</p>
            <p>Very big waves from the hurricane will hit parts of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands during the weekend.</p>
            <p>The National Hurricane Center said that these big, long waves from the hurricane will also reach the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the east coast of the United States early next week. This might cause "very dangerous big waves and strong currents that pull you out to sea."</p>
