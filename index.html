            <h1>Central and Local Governments Work Together to Protect Penghu's Ocean Resources</h1>
            <p>Today, the head of the Ocean Affairs Council, Kuan Bi-ling, said in Penghu that the lives of people in Penghu are very closely connected to the ocean. The ocean gives a lot to us, and its importance is huge. The central government and the local government are working together. This shows their strong decision to protect the ocean's resources.</p>
            <p>Kuan Bi-ling arrived in Penghu today. In the afternoon, she met with County Magistrate Chen Kuang-fu. They had a deep talk about protecting the ocean, keeping the ocean environment clean, making sure the ocean is safe, and keeping the natural balance of the sea. This meeting showed that the central government and local government are joining forces to protect the ocean's resources.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu said that Penghu is surrounded by the sea and has many special ocean resources. For example, the Taiwan Shoal area is about 8800 square kilometers. The ocean is not just where people in Penghu live; it is also very important for tourism and for using resources wisely over a long time. He thanked the Ocean Affairs Council for always supporting Penghu. This support includes checking water quality, protecting sea turtles, helping habitats and corals grow back, planting seagrass, and teaching people about the ocean. All these efforts have greatly improved Penghu's ability to take care of its ocean.</p>
            <p>Kuan Bi-ling pointed out that the ocean's help is very important and cannot be ignored. The lives of people in Penghu depend on the ocean. She praised Penghu for its hard work and good results in cleaning beaches, removing trash from the ocean, and protecting nature. However, because of new rules about how money is shared next year, the central government's budget will change. She hopes that local governments will keep putting more effort into ocean matters. The central government will also continue to provide the help and resources needed so that everyone can work together for a healthy ocean that lasts a long time.</p>

            <h1>Sung Sheng-jui "Pre-warns" Before Hitting a Home Run, Thanks Coach for the Chance</h1>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui from the CTBC Brothers baseball team hit a home run when he played as a substitute on August 3rd. He said that before that game, he told his teammates a "warning." He said that if he went in and didn't hit a home run, it was because he had done weight training. He has been hitting very well lately, with 4 home runs in his last 6 games. He thanked the head coach for giving him chances, even when he was not playing well. This helped him learn from his mistakes and get better.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui of the CTBC Brothers baseball team has been performing very well recently. From July 27th to 30th, he hit home runs in three games in a row. On August 3rd, in a game against the Rakuten Monkeys team, he did not start the game. He came in to play defense in the 6th inning and hit a home run by himself in the 7th inning. This was his 8th home run this season.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Sung Sheng-jui shared a "funny" story. He said that before the August 3rd game, he knew he would not start, so he went to the weight training room. The coach even asked him, "You have a game, why are you training with weights?" Sung Sheng-jui said it was like a warm-up. He also "warned" his teammates before the game. He told them that if he came into the game later and did not hit a home run, he would have an excuse: it was because of the weight training.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui also said that at the start of July, he was not playing well and didn't know why. Wang Wei-chen and Chiang Kun-yu helped him by watching and seeing if anything was different from before. He kept trying, and now he is playing better and better.</p>
            <p>Counting today's game, Sung Sheng-jui has played in all 77 games this season. He said that adjusting to playing every day is still a bit hard for him. But he told himself to keep going. He also thanked head coach Hiraoka Keiichi. The coach still gave him chances to start games even when he was not playing well before. By going through difficulties and learning from them, he now knows how to play better.</p>
            <p>Talking about what is different this season, Sung Sheng-jui said that he planned to gain weight during the time when there were no games. He also got a trainer and learned many things at a training center in the United States. He said that understanding and using these things helped him a lot. His way of thinking has also changed. He thinks in a good way to find problems and does not worry too much after a few mistakes. He faces every time he goes up to bat with a calm mind.</p>
            <p>Hiraoka Keiichi once said that Sung Sheng-jui was his first choice to be the first batter in the game. Sung Sheng-jui also said that he really hopes he can do this job well. But this year, he is not very good at choosing which pitches to hit. He hopes to quickly get better at his "plate discipline."</p>

            <h1>Foreign Investors Buy Net NT$11.4 Billion for 2nd Straight Day, Focusing on Server Stocks</h1>
            <p>Taiwan stocks went up by 281.65 points today, closing at 23660.59 points. Foreign investors bought more stocks than they sold, with a net buy of NT$11.488 billion. This is the second trading day in a row that they have bought more than they sold. They mostly bought stocks of companies that make servers. Wistron was the most bought, with 20,800 shares. Inventec and Hon Hai were also bought a lot, with 19,200 shares and 13,300 shares, respectively.</p>
            <p>Taiwan stocks had a strong rebound today, going up by over 200 points. Electronic stocks led the increase. Companies that make cooling parts for computers and robots, as well as smaller and medium-sized companies, were popular with investors. The Taiex index ended the day at 23660.59 points, up 281.65 points, which is a 1.2% increase. It stayed above its average prices. The total value of shares traded was NT$367.844 billion.</p>
            <p>Self-operated brokers bought a net NT$4.525 billion today. Investment trusts bought a net NT$3.982 billion. Foreign investors bought a net NT$11.488 billion. In total, the three main types of big investors bought a net NT$19.995 billion.</p>
            <p>If we look at the top 10 stocks that foreign investors bought, they were: Wistron (20,800 shares), Taiwan Cooperative Bank (20,400 shares), Inventec (19,200 shares), Hon Hai (13,300 shares), Innolux (13,300 shares), Yuanta Taiwan High Dividend ETF (0056) (12,300 shares), Quanta (12,100 shares), Asia Aviation (8,058 shares), Fuh Hwa Taiwan Equity ETF (00919) (7,914 shares), and AUO (7,740 shares).</p>
            <p>Investment trusts bought a large amount of financial stocks. The top 10 they bought included: CTBC Financial Holding, First Financial Holding, Taishin Financial Holding, Mega Financial Holding, Cathay Financial Holding, Yongfeng Financial Holding, Fubon Financial Holding, Inventec, Yuanta Financial Holding, and E.SUN Financial Holding.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-han, an assistant manager at Cathay Securities Investment Consulting, said that last Friday, bad economic information from the United States caused US stock prices to fall a lot. But after thinking about it, the market saw the weaker economic information as a good thing. This is because it meant there was a higher chance that interest rates would be cut. This made US stocks go up, and Taiwan stocks also went up at the same time.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-han explained that today, electronic stocks were the main reason for the rebound in Taiwan stocks. Also, because the risk in the market became lower, smaller and medium-sized stocks and the over-the-counter market index also went up. This shows that the current trend of increasing prices has not changed. Even though the results of the MSCI index change will be announced next week, the changes will not start until the end of the month. So, the effect on the index in the short term is quite small.</p>
