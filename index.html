A 38-year-old man, surnamed Chen, imported many fake tablet computers from China. He changed their specifications to make them look like powerful "no-brand" tablets. He then sold them cheaply on online shopping sites using fake accounts. The police started an investigation after people reported being scammed. They arrested Chen and another suspect.

The police found that Chen, who had a history of fraud and drug offenses, worked with a Chinese manufacturer. They made tablets that looked like Apple iPads but had cheap parts and old Android systems inside. They then used software to make the tablets show fake high-performance specifications. They promoted these tablets as "high-performance, low-price" products.

The police seized 518 fake tablets, valued at about NT$1.65 million, and 39 empty boxes. So far, over 500 orders have been made, and two victims have reported the scam. The case has been sent to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office. Police advise people to be careful when buying tablets online, especially if the prices are very low and reviews are either all 5-star or all 1-star, with comments about slow performance or overheating.

**Australian Prime Minister Visits Beijing to Meet Xi Jinping, Seeks Dialogue and Cooperation**

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Albanese said that the relationship between Canberra and Beijing must be based on "dialogue." Xi Jinping also stated that China is ready to work with Australia to improve their relationship.

This is Albanese's second visit to China since becoming Prime Minister. He aims to improve trade relations between the two countries, which have been getting better recently, despite ongoing international tensions. In the past ten years, China and Australia have often disagreed on national security issues and interests, especially in the Pacific region.

In December last year, China lifted its ban on Australian rock lobster imports. This was the last big step in ending a trade conflict that started in 2017. Albanese said he was happy that Australia could clearly state its views and interests during the meeting.

He added that Australia values its relationship with China and will continue to work with China in a calm and consistent way, guided by its national interests. He emphasized that direct discussions on important issues for both countries and regional stability are crucial, and that dialogue must be at the center of their relationship.

Xi Jinping praised the improved relationship, saying it has "come out of a low point and achieved a turnaround." He stressed that both countries should stick to this direction, no matter how international events change. Before Albanese's visit, China had hinted that it was open to more cooperation. However, Australia remains concerned about China's military expansion and the detention of Australian-Chinese writer Yang Hengjun. China is also unhappy with Australia's stricter review of foreign investment in key minerals and its plan to take back control of an Australian port from a Chinese company.
