            <h1>Delta Electronics' July Revenue Reaches Over NT$45.3 Billion, Hits New High. Stock Price Rises to NT$637.</h1>
            <p>The strong growth in AI continues. Delta Electronics announced today that its revenue for July was NT$45.397 billion. This is a 21.6% increase compared to last year and a 7.6% increase compared to June. This new number is higher than the previous record of NT$43.443 billion set in March. It is a new record for monthly revenue.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics' stock price also went up today. It closed at NT$637, which is an increase of NT$14 or 2.25%. This is a new record high for the stock. In just two months, Delta Electronics' stock price has gone up by 60%, from less than NT$400.</p>
            <p>According to Delta Electronics' numbers, the power and parts department's revenue made up 53% of the total in July. This is more than half. This growth was because of the sales of power supplies for AI servers. Also, Delta Electronics shipped liquid cooling solutions for AI data centers. Because of this, the infrastructure department's revenue made up 31% in July. The total revenue for Delta Electronics from January to July reached NT$288.352 billion, which is a 24.2% increase from last year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zheng Ping, the chairman of Delta Electronics, said at a recent meeting for investors that "only AI has been good this year." However, the strong demand for AI has helped the company's business grow in the first half of the year. Looking to the second half of the year, he believes that large cloud service providers in the US will continue to spend money. So, Delta Electronics' business should continue to grow well.</p>

            <p>Kao Cheng-jui is only 20 years old and is ranked 27th in the world. This week, he is playing in the WTT Yokohama Champions tournament in Japan. In his first match, he played against Darko Jorgic, who was the 6th seeded player from Slovenia. They had played before in April this year at the Macao Table Tennis World Cup. At that time, Kao Cheng-jui lost after a difficult four-game match. This time, he hoped to get "sweet revenge."</p>
            <p>In the first game, Kao Cheng-jui started behind, but he quickly scored 7 points to 1. This changed the score and gave him a lead. He had 3 chances to win the game.

            <p>In the second game, Kao Cheng-jui was also behind at the start. He tried to come back like in the first game, but he could not catch up. He lost the game 8 to 11, and the score became 1-1. However, Kao Cheng-jui was not affected. He played very well in the third game. He changed the speed of his shots, which made it hard for his opponent to play. Especially at the end, he scored 6 points in a row. He won the game 11 to 7, putting him one game away from winning the match.</p>
            <p>After a slow start to the match, Kao Cheng-jui scored several points in a row again in the middle of the fourth game. This made his opponent call a timeout. But after the timeout, Kao Cheng-jui kept his strong lead. He used his backhand shots to stop his opponent's attacks. In the end, Kao Cheng-jui made his opponent hit the ball out of bounds. He won the game 11 to 8 and moved on to the men's singles top 16. In the next round, he will play against Kanak Jha from the US to try to get into the top 8.</p>
            <p>As for Taiwan's top female player, Cheng I-ching, who is ranked 12th in the world, she played against Honoka Hashimoto from Japan in her first singles match today. Cheng could not stop her opponent well, and she was not playing her best. She lost 2-11, 4-11, and 8-11. She did not make it to the women's singles top 16.</p>
