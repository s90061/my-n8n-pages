        const text = `**The Four-Day Work Week: A Growing Trend for Businesses**

The idea of working just four days a week is becoming more popular around the world. Companies are trying out this new schedule, hoping to improve life for their employees and even make their businesses more productive. Studies in countries like the UK, Iceland, and Portugal have shown promising results.

Workers on a four-day week often report feeling less stressed and having a better balance between their work and personal lives. This extra day off allows them more time for family, hobbies, or simply relaxing. Surprisingly, many companies running these trials have found that productivity either stayed the same or even went up. Employees tend to be more focused and efficient during their four working days, knowing they have a longer break coming. While it's not suitable for every industry, particularly those needing constant staffing like hospitals, the four-day week is being seriously considered as a potential future for work in many sectors. It suggests a shift in how we think about work hours and employee well-being.

**Global Heatwaves Change Travel and Daily Routines**

Extreme heatwaves are becoming a common feature of summers in many parts of the world, especially in Europe and North America. These record-breaking temperatures are not only uncomfortable but are also changing how people travel and go about their daily lives. Popular tourist destinations, such as those around the Mediterranean, are seeing tourists adjust their plans, sometimes choosing to visit during cooler months or changing their activities to avoid the hottest parts of the day.

Locals are also adapting. Many are shifting their routines, taking afternoon siestas or starting work earlier to avoid the midday sun. The intense heat can pose serious health risks, especially for older people and children, leading to warnings from health authorities. Infrastructure, like train tracks and power grids, can also struggle under the strain. This growing problem means that both individuals and governments are looking for ways to adapt to a hotter planet, from updating building codes to changing public event timings.

**The Rise of 'Workcations': Combining Work and Travel**

The way we work is changing, and it's also changing the way we travel. With more companies allowing remote work, a new trend called "workcations" or "bleisure" (business and leisure) is becoming popular. Instead of just taking short holidays, people are now combining their jobs with longer trips, working from different locations for weeks or even months at a time.

This trend allows people to experience new cultures and places while still earning a living. Itâ€™s different from being a full-time digital nomad, as a workcation often means spending extended periods in one place before moving on. However, it comes with its own challenges, such as ensuring reliable internet access and finding suitable accommodation that works for both living and working. Many cities and countries are now trying to attract these remote workers, offering special visas or creating co-working spaces. This shift is not only changing the travel industry but also impacting local economies as these "worker-tourists" spend money over a longer period in new places.`;
