During this time, many film and TV workers made wonderful works that cannot be replaced. When these great moments are shown again, everyone remembers how important these people are. They are not just a part of the past, but they also represent the kind and gentle spirit of the industry.</p>

            <h1>Cheng Li-wen Becomes New KMT Leader, Affecting Lu Shiow-yen's 2028 Plans</h1>
            <p>Former lawmaker Cheng Li-wen has been chosen as the new leader of the KMT party. Her main goal is to help the party win the local elections in 2026. At the same time, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, whose term ends next year, is expected to start planning for the 2028 presidential election. People within the party believe that Lu and Cheng have the same goals. They talk often and have a close relationship, so they will likely share many ideas when making decisions.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen will officially become the new party leader on November 1. People are watching to see how she will lead the KMT in the parliament and in different cities and counties. Someone from the party who helped Cheng Li-wen in her election said that she will make the KMT a platform to support the parliament and the cities and counties led by the party. She will give her full help.</p>
            <p>Regarding how Cheng Li-wen will work with Lu Shiow-yen, who many in the party think could run for president in 2028, a party helper said that Cheng Li-wen won with more than half of the votes, which makes her a strong leader. People expect her to lead the KMT to win the 2026 local elections. Lu Shiow-yen's term as Taichung Mayor finishes next year, and she wants to pass her job on smoothly. So, Lu and Cheng have the same goals and pressures for the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>This party helper added that Cheng Li-wen is flexible. Since they have the same goals, and Lu and Cheng can talk easily in private, they will likely communicate a lot and share strategies for future decisions and elections.</p>
            <p>Some people in the party describe Cheng Li-wen as brave and direct in her speeches. She will represent the "strong" side of the party. Lu Shiow-yen, known as the "Mom Mayor," represents the "gentle" side. How the KMT combines these strong and gentle qualities and works together at both national and local levels will be important to watch.</p>
            <p>However, some local people worry that Cheng Li-wen's political energy and her views on relations with China might cause concerns among local voters for next year's local elections. If the KMT moves away from a middle-ground approach, and this affects the election results, Lu Shiow-yen, who did not run for party leader, might also face criticism.</p>
            <p>This person said that how to bring different parts of the party together and decide on a clear direction will be a test for Lu Shiow-yen.</p>
