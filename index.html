            <h1>Matsu's "Tieban Burning Pagoda Festival" Attracts Thousands</h1>
            <p>Matsu had a big folk festival today called the "Tieban Burning Pagoda Festival." It happened in Ren'ai Village, Nangan Township. A lot of people, about a thousand, came to the village, and it was very crowded. There was a fun parade where elementary school students dressed up as "Frogmen" (special soldiers). Their cute show made everyone clap loudly.</p>
            <p>Lienchiang County is having money problems because of a law. The county leader, Wang Zhong-ming, spoke at the pagoda burning party in the evening. He said that "burning the pagoda" is a special old tradition in Taiwan. A long time ago, people burned trash in a brick tower. This showed that they wanted to get rid of bad luck. Now, people use "bad luck removal cards" instead. This year, the leader wrote "financial problems" on his card. He hopes that burning it will bring more money to the county.</p>
            <p>The festival activities started in the afternoon on the main street of Ren'ai Village. First, the villagers gathered at the village entrance. They made a traditional snack called "white balls" by hand using sticky rice. They also cooked special food to welcome visitors. Over time, "white balls" are not seen often on Matsu tables anymore. Ms. Wang, who came from Beigan, said she was surprised and happy to eat this tasty snack from her childhood memories at Tieban.</p>
            <p>After that, there was a creative parade with 10 groups. One group was the Philharmonia Theatre Factory, which also took part in the 3rd Matsu International Art Island. The Tieban Community Development Association was the host. They welcomed visitors with traditional Tieban drum music, which is a special part of Lienchiang County's culture. They also showed a old custom where people carry things on a pole to go home.</p>
            <p>The Frogmen soldiers usually stay in Ren'ai Village for many years. But this year, they could not join the parade because they moved to a new place. However, some elementary school students and their parents decided to join. They made their own "muscle suits" and copied the soldiers' moves. Their cute actions and faces made the people watching clap and cheer. A parent, Ms. Cao, said they wanted to make the visitors happy.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the most exciting part of the festival happened: "burning the pagoda." Almost a thousand people went to Tieban Beach. The brick pagoda, which means bad luck goes away, burned with a big fire. Everyone danced the "wata" dance together. Local art groups also performed songs and a play called "Walking on the Sea." This allowed visitors to enjoy many cultural shows on the island in the cool night sea air.</p>

            <h1>Manager Lin Yueh-ping Explains Bullpen Choices After Lions' Loss</h1>
            <p>In the second game of the baseball playoffs, the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions team hit the ball well. But the Rakuten Monkeys came back and won, so the Lions lost. The Lions' manager, Lin Yueh-ping, talked about why he chose certain relief pitchers. He said that baseball games can change very fast. If a team is winning but cannot keep their lead, things can go wrong.</p>
            <p>The Lions team won the first half of the season. In the playoff series, which is best of four, they already had one win. They won their first game yesterday, so they were close to winning the series. Today, they played the Monkeys at the Rakuten Taoyuan baseball field. At one point, the Lions were ahead by 4 runs. But they could not keep their lead. The Monkeys played better and won the game 7-6. So, the Lions lost.</p>
            <p>The Lions' manager, Lin Yueh-ping, said that his team's batters played well today. They played against the Monkeys' best pitcher, Pedro Fernandez, who won many games and struck out many players this year. Lin did not change their plan much. He told his players not to swing at pitches that were not good. He told them to hit the ball hard if it was a good pitch.</p>
            <p>Lin An-ko from the Lions hit two home runs in the game today. Manager Lin Yueh-ping said that Lin An-ko is a very important player for the Lions when they attack. He can hit the ball far and strongly. The manager said, "Our team played very well when we were hitting today. But the other team hit even better when they worked together."</p>
            <p>The manager also talked about how he used pitchers. He let Hsin Chun-sheng pitch for more than one part of the game. In the 9th part of the game, when the score was tied, he used two young pitchers. Their names were Chung Yun-hua and Li Chun. Both of them were pitching in the playoffs for the first time. Li Chun was only 19 years and 197 days old. This made him the youngest pitcher in the team's history to play in the playoffs.</p>
            <p>Lin Yueh-ping said that he wanted all his pitchers to get batters out. He usually doesn't change pitchers for very special reasons. In the 9th inning, when the score was tied, he thought about who to use. If he used the main closing pitcher right away, that pitcher would also need to play in the next part of the game. Chung Yun-hua was a good relief pitcher for the team during the regular season. Lin hoped Chung Yun-hua could stop the other team. But Chung Yun-hua walked some batters. Lin said, "Today, many of the points we lost started when our pitchers walked batters."</p>
            <p>Lin Yueh-ping also said that even though they were winning by 4 runs at one point, games can change very fast. The team that bats first needs to score many runs. If they don't keep their lead and don't get the players out that they should, the other team can hit the ball and tie the score, or even win.</p>

            <h1>Japan Monitors 111 Active Volcanoes, Five Are Key</h1>
            <p>The Japanese government has a group that studies volcanoes. Yesterday, this group looked at 111 active volcanoes in Japan. They chose 5 of them to watch very carefully in the future. These include Mount Meakan in Hokkaido and Mount Kirishima, which is between Miyazaki and Kagoshima areas.</p>
            <p>Kyodo News said that the volcanoes chosen for close watch are those that have erupted in the last year. They also include volcanoes that are acting differently and need to be checked all the time. Mount Meakan erupted in September. Shinmoedake, a part of Mount Kirishima, has been erupting since June.</p>
            <p>The other three volcanoes they will watch closely are Mount Towada, which is in Aomori and Akita. It has changed, but they did not watch it enough before. Also, Mount Kusatsu-Shirane in Gunma is becoming more active. And Miyakejima Island, which is an island near Tokyo.</p>
            <p>Hiroshi Shimizu, the head of the government's volcano group, spoke to reporters. He said, "This work is just to study the volcanoes. It does not mean that we need to worry about a disaster right now."</p>
            <p>The volcano group will meet again early next year. They will get more information and data. Then, they will study in detail how big future eruptions might be and how the volcanoes might act.</p>
