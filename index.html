            <h1>Study: Semiconductor Industry Moves Towards Vertical Integration and Chiplets; Governments Are Getting Involved</h1>
            <p>The SEMICON Taiwan International Semiconductor Exhibition will open on September 10. According to Huang Yi-ping, Vice President of DIGITIMES, a research company, this year's exhibition will be the biggest ever. He observed three main trends in the semiconductor industry: governments getting involved, leading companies combining different parts of their businesses, and small chips (chiplets) becoming an important market.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping said that both the United States and China are moving in similar ways; their governments are getting involved in the industry. After 2010, especially after the trade war between the US and China, both countries started to see semiconductors as a very important industry for their strategies. After ChatGPT was released in November 2022, both countries realized that semiconductors combined with artificial intelligence (AI) are key to national strength.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping stated that both the United States and China are working to strengthen their national power and important industries. This includes national security, the safety of supply chains, and overall industry competition. China is focusing on building a complete semiconductor industry chain and slowly increasing how much it makes itself. China's most important method is to use government money to help the industry grow.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the United States passed the CHIPS Act. This law uses money to help the industry grow and offers a 25% tax break for investments. Huang Yi-ping said that it is important to note that in August, the US government bought 9.9% of Intel's non-voting shares for about 8.9 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping explained that the United States is using a strategy similar to China's, where the government uses its money to buy shares in certain important semiconductor companies. While the US government's involvement is not as high as China's right now, it is expected that the US government will continue to use government money to influence the industry's growth in the future.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping said that China's policy thinking is that if companies want to work in the Chinese market, they must invest and build factories there. They also need to buy various parts and other products or services from local Chinese suppliers.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Huang Yi-ping said that the United States is a strategic rival for China. China wants its supply chain to be able to control itself. First, it wants to remove US influence. Then, it wants to make more products domestically. The long-term goal is to be fully independent. This means that important companies and important technologies in the supply chain should be controlled by Chinese companies themselves. This includes advanced manufacturing for chips, high-bandwidth memory, and other key equipment and materials.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping said that the current focus of US policy is to make its own industries stronger. It wants semiconductor companies like TSMC and Samsung, whose main customers are US companies and whose focus is the US market, to build factories in the United States to serve US customers. Manufacturing investments must be made within the United States.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping stated that the United States is actively removing Chinese influence and also working to produce more goods domestically. The long-term goal for the United States is to keep improving its lead in technology and industry for US companies. Therefore, there is still a difference in how Intel and foreign companies invest in the US.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping said that for the past few decades, the semiconductor industry has been divided into different specialized areas, such as IC design, chip manufacturing, and professional packaging and testing. However, now, leading companies in the industry are moving towards combining these different parts into one business.</p>
            <p>For example, Huang Yi-ping mentioned NVIDIA, a top company for AI chips. He said that NVIDIA used to be an IC design company. Now, NVIDIA designs its own server racks, leaving very little room for contract manufacturers to change parts. It also sells the racks directly to large companies and provides cloud services. NVIDIA is no longer just an IC design company.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping pointed out that TSMC started by making chips, and now it is moving into CoWoS packaging and 3D packaging. Advanced packaging business is becoming more and more important for TSMC's income. Its business model is slowly moving towards a vertical integration model.</p>
            <p>As advanced packaging becomes popular, Huang Yi-ping said that chiplets are becoming a new area of specialized work in the industry. On an advanced packaging platform, several different chiplets can be stacked together either flat or vertically. It is expected that in the future, more and more chiplets might be added to the packaging platform, like stacking building blocks.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi-ping said that once chiplets become standardized, they might become a market where different kinds of chiplets can be bought and sold. This will further help advanced packaging grow and push the semiconductor industry forward.</p>

            <h1>Northern Taiwan to Guard Against 38-Degree Heat; Expert Predicts Tropical Storm Tapah to Form Today</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that it will be sunny everywhere today, and northern Taiwan will be very hot. The highest temperature is expected to reach 38 degrees Celsius. A low-pressure system south of Dongsha Island is moving northwest. It is expected to become Tropical Storm Tapah today. On September 8, it will hit the west side of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong, China, and will not affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration said that it will be hot everywhere today. Taipei City and New Taipei City are under an orange alert, meaning there is a chance of extreme high temperatures reaching 38 degrees Celsius. Tainan City is also under an orange alert, meaning there is a chance of continuous high temperatures of 36 degrees Celsius. Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Changhua County, and Yunlin County are under a yellow alert, meaning people should be aware of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote in the "Tian Ji Classroom" column of the Weather Application Promotion Foundation that the latest path prediction map from the Central Weather Administration shows the tropical low-pressure system south of Dongsha Island is moving northwest. It is expected to become Tropical Storm Tapah today and hit the west side of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong, China, on September 8. It will not affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the latest predictions from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) also show that the average path of many possible outcomes goes through the west side of the Pearl River Estuary in Guangdong. The different paths shown in individual predictions mean there is some uncertainty, so we need to keep watching.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the latest European weather model shows it will be sunny everywhere today, and northern Taiwan will be very hot, with temperatures reaching 38 degrees Celsius. The UV index will be dangerous around noon. He reminded everyone to protect themselves from the sun and heat stroke. He also said that in the afternoon, there might be some scattered showers or thunderstorms in the mountains and southern areas. As more moisture comes from the south, Hengchun Peninsula and the east coast also have a chance of some rain.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, Wu Der-rong said that for today, northern Taiwan is expected to be 23 to 38 degrees Celsius, central Taiwan 24 to 36 degrees Celsius, southern Taiwan 25 to 37 degrees Celsius, and eastern Taiwan 22 to 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that from September 7 to 9, Tropical Storm Tapah will be active in the South China Sea. The amount of clouds will slightly increase in all areas. Temperatures will drop a little, but northern Taiwan will still be warm. Because of the moisture from the storm, there will be some local rain in Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula. The air will be unstable, and strong storms will develop in the mountains in the afternoon, possibly moving to some flat areas. People should be careful of severe thunderstorms, which can bring lightning, strong winds, sudden heavy rain, and hail.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that there is still a chance of severe thunderstorms in the afternoon of September 10. On September 11 and 12, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger. It will be sunny and hot everywhere, with a chance of some scattered short showers or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon. These will be weaker and cover a much smaller area.</p>

            <h1>Semiconductor Exhibition Opens on September 10; SEMI Says Increased International Participation is Like the Industry's Olympics</h1>
            <p>The SEMICON Taiwan International Semiconductor Exhibition will start on September 10. The organizer, the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI), said that this year, more countries are joining, and there are more types of activities. It feels like the "Olympics" of the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>SEMI pointed out that this year's international semiconductor exhibition will focus on artificial intelligence (AI), cars, and robots. It will cover topics such as AI chips, advanced packaging, 3DIC, small chips (chiplets), fan-out panel-level packaging, heterogeneous integration, silicon photonics, quantum computing, high-bandwidth memory, geopolitical strategies, sustainable manufacturing, talent development, and cybersecurity. It is expected that over 1,200 companies from 56 countries will use more than 4,100 booths, attracting 100,000 visitors. The size of the event will be the largest ever.</p>
            <p>SEMI said that this year, more countries are participating in the semiconductor exhibition than last year. New country areas have been added for Canada, Costa Rica, Lithuania, Sweden, and Vietnam, setting a new record of 17 country pavilions. Many foreign groups will also attend, such as the US-Taiwan Business Council, the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology, a delegation of Italian Members of Parliament, and visiting groups from Chile and Guatemala.</p>
            <p>During the international semiconductor exhibition, there will also be many exchange events, such as the Taiwan-Poland Business Forum, the Korea-Taiwan Semiconductor Supply Chain Economic Cooperation Forum, the Taiwan-Japan Technology Summit, and the Taiwan-India Semiconductor Forum. SEMI pointed out that this shows that countries around the world are increasingly interested in being part of the semiconductor industry, and they all want more help and communication with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>SEMI stated that this year's semiconductor exhibition has a wider variety of activities. Besides the usual exhibitions, technical forums, and matchmaking events, there are also many other activities this year. For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, and the Center for Science, Democracy, and Society (DSET) are holding a forum on semiconductors and geopolitics.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and SEMI are jointly holding the Chip Chain Summit Forum. This forum will bring together representatives from companies in Japan, Europe, and the United States to discuss how to work together as global supply chains are changing.</p>
            <p>SEMI has invited Dr. Chintay Shih, former president of ITRI, who was involved in the development of Taiwan's semiconductor industry, to speak at the SEMI Aspire Award Ceremony and Technology Master Forum. He will share his experiences and wisdom.</p>
            <p>Hou Yung-ching, chairman of the Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association, and Tien Wu, CEO of ASE Technology Holding, will together host a fireside chat. They will talk with Jim Keller, known as the "Chip Guru" of Silicon Valley, and Jochen Hanebeck, CEO of Infineon. They will discuss how Taiwan can keep its leading position in the semiconductor industry from both Taiwanese and international points of view.</p>
            <p>Jim Keller is currently the CEO of Tenstorrent. He used to be the Senior Vice President of Intel's Silicon Engineering Group, Vice President of Autopilot at Tesla, and Chief Core Architect at AMD. He led the design of many chips that changed the world.</p>
            <p>After Jung-Bae Lee, president of Samsung's memory business, and Justin Kim, president of SK Hynix, two leading Korean memory companies, visited Taiwan last year, Micron, an American memory manufacturer, is also joining in this year. For the first time, high-level executives from the three major memory companiesâ€”Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micronâ€”will appear together.</p>
            <p>SEMI stated that at a time when geopolitics is very important and supply chains are changing, global competition and cooperation are taking on a new look. SEMICON Taiwan is a big event that brings together the best of the semiconductor industry, like the Olympics for the industry.</p>
