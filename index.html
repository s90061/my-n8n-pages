            <h1>Dog Badly Hurt After Being Dragged by Car; Owner Fined and Blacklisted by New Taipei Animal Protection Office</h1>
            <p>Recently, in the Xinzhuang area of New Taipei City, people saw a dog being dragged by a car that was moving. The owner later said it was an accident. Today, the New Taipei Animal Protection Office said they will fine the owner NT$75,000. They will also take the dog away and put the owner on a blacklist, meaning they can never own a cat or dog again.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Government Animal Protection and Health Inspection Office sent out a press release. It said that around 4:10 PM on July 27, in Xinzhuang, New Taipei City, a car was moving with "a dog tied to the back." The dog was being dragged on the road. People who saw this quickly stopped the car. The owner then found out the dog was being dragged and got out to check.</p>
            <p>The Animal Protection Office said that after they heard about the event, they quickly checked the car's information. They worked with the police to find out what happened. After talking to the owner, they confirmed that the dog received medicine that day. The dog was then taken to an animal hospital that is open 24 hours for care.</p>
            <p>A veterinarian checked the dog. The dog's four legs and stomach were badly hurt from rubbing on the ground. Some of the wounds were deep, reaching the muscles, and even showing bones. The dog still needs to stay in the hospital for more medicine and to be watched. If the wounds are not cared for well, the dog could get a serious infection. This might mean the dog needs to lose a leg.</p>
            <p>The owner explained that when they left home, they did not see that a family member had tied the dog to the back of the car. They said it was a complete mistake. They also said, "I usually treat it very well, I really didn't do it on purpose."</p>
            <p>The Animal Protection Office said that according to Animal Protection Law, owners must give their animals good, clean, safe food and a safe place to live. Also, people are not allowed to pull pets with cars or motorcycles. If an animal gets hurt because an owner was careless, and the animal gets a very bad injury, loses important body parts, or dies, the owner can be fined from NT$15,000 to NT$75,000.</p>
            <p>The Animal Protection Office said this case is a very serious offense. So, they will give the highest fine of NT$75,000 based on the Animal Protection Law. They will also take the dog away from the owner. The owner will be put on a blacklist, meaning they can never own a cat or dog again. The owner must also attend classes about animal protection.</p>
