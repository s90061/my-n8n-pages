            <h1>Cambodia Stops Scam Operations, Over A Thousand People Arrested, Including 75 from Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(Phnom Penh, July 16, Central News Agency) Police in Cambodia today raided online scam centers. They arrested over a thousand people who are suspected of crimes. Most of the arrested people are foreigners. Among them, there are at least 271 people from Indonesia, 213 from Vietnam, and 75 from Taiwan.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet ordered a crackdown on "online crime factories." Yesterday, he gave a command for police and the army to "stop and fight online scams." He also warned that officers who do not act might lose their jobs.</p>
            <p>The United Nations says Southeast Asia is a "hotspot" for scam centers. Scam groups often use love scams or business scams. They trick people on social media platforms and steal about 40 billion US dollars (about 1.17 trillion New Taiwan dollars) each year.</p>
            <p>In the last three days, Cambodia has raided scam centers across the country. These places include the capital city Phnom Penh, Poipet (a city near the Thai border), and Sihanoukville (a city by the sea).</p>
            <p>Many people who were freed from these scam centers in Cambodia said they were kidnapped or tricked into going there.</p>
            <p>Amnesty International released a report last month. It said that there is "widespread" abuse happening in Cambodian scam centers.</p>
            <p>The report said that crime groups run at least 53 scam centers in Cambodia. These centers involve human trafficking, forced labor, child labor, torture, illegal imprisonment, and slavery.</p>
            <p>In March this year, Cambodia raided an online scam center in Poipet. They held 230 foreigners there. Among them, 119 Thai people were sent back to their country.</p>
            <p>The UN Office on Drugs and Crime warned in April that the scam business has spread from Southeast Asia to other parts of the world. Crime groups are making their networks bigger internationally. They now reach South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and some Pacific islands.</p>

            <h1>7.3 Earthquake Off Alaska, Tsunami Warning Lowered</h1>
            <p>(Los Angeles, July 16, Central News Agency) The US Geological Survey (USGS) said that a 7.3 magnitude earthquake happened today off the coast of Alaska. This caused a tsunami alert. The earthquake was not very deep, about 20 kilometers below the surface.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the USGS said the earthquake happened around 12:37 PM local time. Its center was about 87 kilometers south of the small town of Sand Point.</p>
            <p>After the earthquake, officials first issued a tsunami warning for Southern Alaska and the Alaska Peninsula. But later, they changed it to a tsunami advisory.</p>
            <p>The National Tsunami Warning Center said the tsunami advisory is for "Southern Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Pacific coast from Kennedy Entrance in Alaska to Unimak Pass in Alaska."</p>
            <p>The National Tsunami Warning Center advises people in this area to "stay away from the water, beaches, harbors, docks, breakwaters, bays, and inlets."</p>

            <h1>ASML Warning Causes Concern, Taiwan Stock Market Focuses on TSMC Conference</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 17, Central News Agency) On July 16, the three main US stock market indexes ended higher after some ups and downs. However, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index closed a little lower. ASML, a big Dutch company that makes equipment for semiconductors, released its latest financial report. It showed strong business results. But the company also warned about more uncertainty because of the world economy and political situations. ASML said it might not grow in 2026. On Wednesday, ASML's stock price dropped by more than 8%. Now, everyone is watching the TSMC investor conference that will happen this afternoon. The results of this conference will affect the future of Taiwan's stock market.</p>
            <p>Experts say that before the TSMC investor conference, TSMC's stock price on July 16 was 1130 New Taiwan dollars. This is close to its highest closing price ever, which was 1135 New Taiwan dollars in January this year. Because the stock price already went up, investors should be careful that there might not be more good news coming.</p>
            <p>News reports said that US President Trump plans to replace Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve. On July 16, US stocks went down for a while, but then went up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 231.49 points, or 0.53%, ending at 44254.78 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 19.94 points, or 0.32%, closing at 6263.70 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which has many technology stocks, went up by 52.69 points, or 0.25%, to 20730.49 points. But the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index ended a little lower, dropping 22.40 points, or 0.39%, to 5696.21 points.</p>
            <p>For individual stocks, Tesla went up by 10.89 US dollars, or 3.5%, closing at 321.67 US dollars. NVIDIA went up by 0.67 US dollars, or 0.39%, closing at 171.37 US dollars. TSMC's ADR (American Depositary Receipt) went up by 0.61 US dollars, or 0.26%, closing at 237.56 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Cathay Securities Investment Trust said that the US tariffs on Taiwan are still not decided. But tariffs are not only a problem for Taiwan. Investors do not need to worry too much about tariffs. Especially because Trump's policies often change, there is still room for talks even after announcements. As the bad effects of tariffs become less, the market will slowly go back to focusing on basic business conditions.</p>
            <p>Cathay Securities Investment Trust believes that NVIDIA's market value is now more than 4 trillion US dollars. This shows that AI (Artificial Intelligence) is growing strongly. Taiwan is a big country in semiconductors and plays an important role in the AI supply chain. Taiwan's industries have strong basic conditions. So, their positive view on Taiwan's stock market in the long term has not changed.</p>
