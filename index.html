Starting today, travelers at airports in the United States will not need to take off their shoes for security checks. The US Department of Homeland Security announced this change. This rule had been in place for almost 20 years. It was introduced after the "shoe bomber" incident, where a man tried to detonate a bomb hidden in his shoe on a plane.

Even with this new rule, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will continue with other security steps. If more checks are needed, some travelers might still be asked to remove their shoes. Before today, most travelers between 12 and 75 years old had to take off their shoes, which were then scanned with their luggage.

This change is expected to make airport security faster and easier for passengers. For a long time, travelers have said that security checks take too much time. Programs like TSA PreCheck already allowed some people to go through security without removing their shoes or other items, making the process quicker.
