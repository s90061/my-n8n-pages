            <h1>Hong Kong Man Gets 8 Years in Prison for Bringing 20 Bags of Marijuana into Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A man from Hong Kong, named Wu, brought 20 bags of marijuana from Thailand into Taiwan. He did this to earn 100,000 Hong Kong dollars to pay his debts. The drugs were worth about 14.35 million New Taiwan dollars. Mr. Wu was caught, and he told the police who gave him the drugs, hoping for a lighter sentence. However, the Kaohsiung District Court said that the amount of drugs he carried was very large. So, they sentenced him to 8 years in prison for drug trafficking. He can appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>During the court hearing in Kaohsiung, Mr. Wu admitted what he did. He also told the names of the people who gave him the drugs, "A-Wei" and "A-King," and gave information to help the police find them. He asked for a sentence of 3 years in prison. But the judge thought Mr. Wu was guilty of working with others to transport illegal drugs and secretly bringing controlled items into Taiwan. Because he confessed during the investigation and trial, the court made his sentence lighter based on Article 17, Section 2 of the Drug Hazard Control Act. This made the shortest possible sentence much lower.</p>
            <p>The judge considered that the amount and value of the drugs Mr. Wu carried were huge. This has a big negative effect on public safety. Therefore, the judge decided not to give him a light punishment. Based on this, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for transporting second-class drugs. He can appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>The court's decision stated that in March this year, Mr. Wu from Hong Kong owed a lot of money. Two men, known as "A-Wei" and "A-King," asked him for help. They told him that if he could successfully bring drugs into Taiwan, he would get 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (about 393,000 New Taiwan dollars). Mr. Wu agreed. First, he received 10,000 Hong Kong dollars from them to buy plane tickets and pay for a hotel. Then, on March 24, he flew from Hong Kong to Thailand and stayed at a hotel in Bangkok.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Wu arrived, "A-King" told him to go to the hotel lobby. There, he picked up a suitcase that had 20 bags of marijuana hidden inside. The marijuana weighed about 9957 grams. On March 26, at noon, Mr. Wu flew to Taiwan. But when he entered Taiwan at Kaohsiung International Airport, officers from the Customs Administration noticed something was wrong during the entry check. They worked with the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau. They searched his suitcase and found the marijuana, which was worth about 14.35 million New Taiwan dollars.</p>

            <h1>Jeffrey Epstein's Victims Ask Congress to Pass Law to Release Documents</h1>
            <p>Today, people who were hurt by Jeffrey Epstein, a person found guilty of sex crimes, asked the U.S. Congress to make a law. This law would force the government to show all related documents from the Trump administration that are not secret.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Anouska De Georgiou, a former model and actress, said, "This is to stop the secret culture that grows when power is used in a wrong way." She was one of about 10 women who said they were Epstein's victims. They spoke at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol building.</p>
            <p>Marina Lacerda, an immigrant from Brazil, said, "I am here today because I feel that important people in this country are finally ready to listen to us." She remembered meeting Epstein when she was 14. A friend told her she could earn hundreds of dollars by giving massages to an older man.</p>
            <p>These women said they support a new law in the U.S. House of Representatives. It is called the "Epstein Files Transparency Bill." This bill asks for documents to be made public. These documents include those held by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Attorney's Office.</p>
            <p>De Georgiou spoke at a press conference with Republican Representative Thomas Massie from Kentucky and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna from California. She said, "Survivors need safety, help, and legal support. If this Congress truly cares about fairness, please show it by giving the victims the legal help they need." Both representatives are working hard to get this bill voted on.</p>
            <p>The Republican leaders in the House of Representatives tried to stop regular members from getting into a possibly difficult discussion. Donald Trump said that this bill would not find any important new information and was just a political trick.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said in the Oval Office at the White House, "Thousands of pages of documents are already public. This is completely a trick by the Democrats."</p>
            <p>The argument over the Justice Department not releasing Epstein's documents caused problems for Trump all summer. Some of his main supporters also asked for these documents to be made public.</p>
            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson suggested another idea. He proposed a symbolic vote to support the Epstein investigation that a House committee is already doing.</p>
            <p>Massie criticized this, saying it was "the oldest trick in the Washington swamp... When you want to stop an issue, you offer a comforting substitute bill, do nothing, and try to fool the American people... But it won't work this time."</p>
            <p>Late last night, a group in the House of Representatives, controlled by Republicans, made more than 33,000 pages of documents about Epstein public. Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while he was in prison. At that time, he had already been found guilty of sex crimes.</p>
            <p>However, Massie and Khanna want more information to be released.</p>
            <p>They are trying to make the House vote on this bill using a complicated process called a "discharge petition," which does not often succeed.</p>
            <p>To force a vote, at least 218 members of the House must sign the petition. If all 212 Democratic members support it, Massie would still need at least 5 Republican members. As of today, he has gotten support from 3 Republican members: Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, and Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p>
            <p>If Massie and Khanna's idea gets at least 218 supporters, it will test Speaker Johnson's leadership. It will also show how much influence Trump has within his party. It will show if enough Republicans are willing to vote against their party's normal position and pass this bill.</p>

            <h1>China Uses Universities and Companies to Help Military Develop AI</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that in recent years, China has worked with hundreds of private companies and civilian universities. These groups are helping to put Artificial Intelligence (AI) into military operations and weapons systems. China does this in a more organized way than the United States. This gives China a possible advantage in using AI for its defense.</p>
            <p>On September 4th, the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal reported on a study. The Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University in the U.S. looked at nearly 3,000 AI-related contracts from the Chinese military in 2023 and 2024. They studied information about the companies that won these contracts. They found that more than 300 companies won contracts many times.</p>
            <p>More than 85% of these companies that won contracts many times were private companies, non-military universities, and other groups. These groups are not usually seen as part of China's defense industry. They received most of the contracts. Also, most of these companies are not on the U.S. sanctions list.</p>
            <p>For example, the report mentioned that Shanghai Jiao Tong University published a study last year. This study showed how to use AI to put weapon systems into an automatic "kill web." This "kill web" can change in real-time during sea battles based on what is happening. Six days later, the Chinese military announced that the university had won a defense contract to make this idea real.</p>
            <p>This was the seventh public defense contract that Shanghai Jiao Tong University had signed since early 2023 to develop or maintain AI-related systems. Before the end of 2024, the university won another seven contracts. Besides the "kill web" project for the sea, the university was also asked to help the military. They needed to use AI models with different layers to track fast-moving targets, quickly design underwater drones, and make groups of drones more sensitive to changes in radio frequencies.</p>
            <p>The report said that in recent years, China has used a concept called "military-civilian fusion." This means they use the knowledge and new technology from universities and private companies. They do this to put AI into their military operations and weapon systems. Compared to the United States, the Chinese military can do this in a more organized way. Security experts say this gives China a possible advantage in using AI for its defense.</p>
            <p>Cole McFaul, a senior research analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said that these technologies are very wide-ranging. This shows that the United States has limited ability to effectively stop or slow down China's military from becoming more modern.</p>
            <p>In the recent military parade on September 3rd, China showed off its unmanned fighting units. These included attack drones, unmanned ships, and robot dogs. Military researchers believe that these types of equipment will be very important in future conflicts managed by AI.</p>
