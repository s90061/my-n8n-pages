            <h1>Traffic Jams in Northern Taiwan on National Day Holiday; Highway Bureau Shares Congested Roads for October 11</h1>
            <p>Today is the first day of the National Day holiday. The Highway Bureau said that many roads in northern Taiwan are busy with cars. They expect more tourists to drive to different places tomorrow. They suggest people take public transport or use an app to check traffic information.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Highway Bureau released a statement today. It said that by 3 PM today, most of the traffic jams were in northern Taiwan. These included parts of Provincial Highway 2 from Longmen to Fulong, Tamsui Zhuwei to Hongshulin, and Dawulun to Waiwushan. Also, Provincial Highway 15 from Longmi Road to Guandu Bridge and from Fengshan Creek Bridge to Zhugang Bridge. Provincial Highway 62 from Qidu to Anle, and Provincial Highway 65 from Tucheng to National Freeway 3 and from Xinzhuang to National Freeway 1.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow is the second day of the National Day holiday. The Highway Bureau thinks that many tourist spots will have a lot of cars. Some provincial roads that might be very busy are: Provincial Highway 2 from Guandu to Tamsui, Wanli to Dawulun, and Fulong. Provincial Highway 9A from Xindian to Wulai. Provincial Highway 3 from Daxi to Cihu and from Gukeng to Meishan. Provincial Highway 21 around Sun Moon Lake.</p>
            <p>Also, main roads might have short periods of heavy traffic. For example, Provincial Highway 61 around Zhongzhang Bridge and from Fengbi to Xiangshan. Also, Provincial Highway 88 from Wujia System to Fengshan.</p>

            <p>The Highway Bureau has talked with bus companies to make sure there are enough buses. They will add more buses if many people need them. By 12 PM today, Western National Highway buses had made 2244 trips and carried 41,915 people. Eastern National Highway buses had made 644 trips and carried 13,059 people.</p>
            <p>Based on current ticket sales, there are still 67.38% of seats empty for Western National Highway buses tomorrow. For Eastern National Highway buses, 83.82% of seats are empty. People who need tickets can check the bus companies' websites.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau has planned other routes for provincial roads. They suggest drivers use the "Happy Highway App" to get live traffic updates. This can help them avoid busy times and roads. They should also follow traffic news from Police Radio and "Variable Message Signs (CMS)" on the roadside. This way, they can plan ahead and avoid traffic jams.</p>

            <h1>Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council Has Lunch with President Lai, Stresses "No Taiwan Strait Incident"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 10th (CNA) â€“ A group of Japanese lawmakers visited Taiwan for the Double Ten National Day celebration. Mr. Sasaki Norihisa, acting secretary-general of the Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council, said today that they had lunch with President Lai Ching-te after the ceremony. They also gave a letter from Ms. Sanae Takaichi, who was chosen as the new head of the Liberal Democratic Party. During the meeting, they strongly said that "there must be no problems in the Taiwan Strait." They added that Japan's wish to keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is the same as Taiwan's.</p>
            <p>The "Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council" is a group of Japanese lawmakers from different parties who support Taiwan. Mr. Furuya Keiji, a member of the House of Representatives and head of the council, led a group of 28 lawmakers to Taiwan. They came to celebrate the Republic of China's National Day. They held a press conference in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kaneko Yasushi, the vice-head of the group and acting secretary-general of the council, said in his speech that Mr. Furuya Keiji went back to Japan after listening to President Lai's National Day speech and watching the performances. This was because of an urgent meeting of important members of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said in his speech that he was happy to lead the group of lawmakers from different parties to Taiwan. He said that the council had lunch with President Lai after the National Day ceremony. They also gave a letter from Ms. Sanae Takaichi to Mr. Lai Ching-te, the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said that during lunch, he told President Lai and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim that the council was very sorry about the damage caused by Typhoon Kagasa in Hualien. He also gave them a list of donations for disaster relief. Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism will send equipment to Taiwan on October 17th to check water levels in reservoirs. This shows their support for working together on disaster prevention.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sasaki Norihisa also said that this year is the 100th anniversary of the National Palace Museum. After the press conference, they would go to the museum to give a valuable pottery item from Japan for an exhibition.</p>
            <p>Talking about the situation in the region, Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said that China is putting more and more pressure on Taiwan. He stressed that "there must be no problems in the Taiwan Strait." He added that Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and Australia should work together even more closely. The Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council stated that their strong will to keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is the same as Taiwan's.</p>
            <p>When asked about the content of Ms. Sanae Takaichi's letter, Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said he was "not clear." He thought it was likely a reply to President Lai's congratulatory message. However, he emphasized that sending a personal letter to the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party is not new. Mr. Kishida Fumio, a former head of the Liberal Democratic Party, had also sent similar letters.</p>
            <p>News reports from Nikkei Asia asked why Mr. Kihara Minoru, a member of the House of Representatives and secretary-general of the Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council, was not part of the visiting group. He will soon become the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Mr. Sasaki Norihisa replied that Mr. Kihara Minoru could not visit Taiwan because a family member was ill. He added that there were "no political reasons."</p>
            <p>Ms. Komiyama Yasu, a member of the House of Representatives from the Constitutional Democratic Party and acting secretary-general of the council, added that the Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council has always included members from different parties. Mr. Furuya Keiji was also a minister two times. She said that all political parties think the relationship with Taiwan is very important, even when they hold important government positions.</p>

            <h1>China Says Taiwan Military is Training 'Taiwan Independence Internet Trolls'; Military Intelligence Bureau Calls it a Usual Trick to Slander the Military</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 10th (CNA) â€“ Today, China's Ministry of State Security said that a lieutenant colonel from Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense was leading a Taiwanese company. This company was supposedly carrying out anti-propaganda activities against China and training "Taiwan independence internet trolls." The Military Intelligence Bureau responded that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spreading such false information during the Republic of China's National Day is their usual way of slandering the military. They have been using various methods to do this for a long time.</p>
            <p>At 6 AM today, China's Ministry of State Security posted an article on its WeChat public account. The title was "Nowhere to Hide for 'Taiwan Independence Internet Trolls'." The article claimed that the DPP government secretly trained internet trolls to spread their "Taiwan independence" ideas. These trolls hid on various social media platforms in China, created fake information, and spread false ideas about Taiwan independence. It also claimed that a Taiwanese private company was working under the direction of the Military Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense to do anti-propaganda work against China.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of State Security even showed pictures of the faces, real names, and birth dates of three people they called "commanders" and "masterminds" of these activities. They said one woman was a lieutenant colonel in the Third Department of the Military Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The two men were said to be the head of a Taiwanese private company and the head of the company's Tainan office.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the Military Intelligence Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense replied with a press release. They said that the Chinese Communist Party spreading such false information during the Republic of China's National Day is their usual method. They have been using different ways for a long time to slander the military. They do this to win public support inside China and hide their own bad government actions. Outside China, they use their own laws to control what people think, trying to make their power seem to reach far and trying to lower the spirits of Taiwan's military and people.</p>
            <p>The Military Intelligence Bureau stated that it will continue to follow intelligence policy. It will carefully do its intelligence gathering and research work to protect the country.</p>
