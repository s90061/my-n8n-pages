            <h1>Israel Stops Aid Ships for Gaza, Arrests Reporters; Reporters Without Borders Speaks Out</h1>
            <p>On October 2nd, in Paris, many people around the world protested after Israel stopped a group of ships going to Gaza. These ships were carrying help for people there. Today, Reporters Without Borders said that Israel arrested more than 20 foreign journalists who were on these ships. They said this was a serious attack on the public's right to know what is happening.</p>
            <p>Activists, including Greta Thunberg, a young environmental activist from Sweden, recently tried again to get through Israel's sea blockade. They were on ships of the "Global Sumud Flotilla" and wanted to bring medical supplies and food to Gaza. But Israeli soldiers boarded and stopped their ships.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Reporters Without Borders released a statement tonight. They said that over 20 foreign journalists on the ships were arrested yesterday and today.</p>
            <p>Martin Roux, who leads the crisis team at Reporters Without Borders, said that arresting journalists and stopping them from doing their job is a big attack on the right to know. He added that these professional reporters were illegally arrested while covering a very big humanitarian aid mission on the ships. Reporters Without Borders said this was wrong.</p>

            <h1>Altman's Asia Trip: Experts Say Working with Korea Helps Taiwan and Japan's AI Supply Chain</h1>
            <p>On October 3rd, in Hsinchu, reporter Chang Chien-chung reported that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, visited Asia quickly this week. He went to Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan. Experts who study politics and technology for a long time said that South Korea was probably the main focus of Altman's trip. This is likely connected to South Korea's plans for AI development. His visits to Taiwan and Japan were to make the AI supply chain stronger.</p>
            <p>The expert said that there is a lot of work happening to build AI infrastructure. This is because there will be a big need for AI computing power in the future for things like understanding information and making smart programs. For example, SoftBank is working with OpenAI and Oracle on a project called "Stargate."</p>
            <p>SoftBank will likely bring all the resources together. OpenAI will focus on creating advanced AI models that can work with different types of information. Oracle will build the data centers, which will use AI chips from NVIDIA. The expert explained that building these data centers needs AI servers made by companies like Hon Hai (Foxconn) and Wistron, and cooling and power solutions from Delta Electronics. The AI chips themselves are made by TSMC.</p>
            <p>The expert pointed out that during this trip, Altman visited TSMC and Hon Hai in Taiwan. He also looked for important cooperation with Hitachi in Japan. This shows he wants to keep strong relationships with his suppliers.</p>
            <p>The expert mentioned that Samsung and SK Hynix in South Korea make special memory chips called HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), which are key parts for AI. When Altman went to South Korea, he likely arranged deals with Samsung and SK Hynix. They will supply memory to OpenAI. Also, they will work together to create a new company and build two data centers in South Korea.</p>
            <p>The expert said that OpenAI is a leader in making advanced AI models. This will help South Korea's plans for AI. Also, the Samsung group not only has a semiconductor business but also makes products like smartphones and TVs. It will be interesting to see if they work together more in the future on combining cloud computing and device computing.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's TSMC is the main company that makes AI chips for NVIDIA, a top AI chip maker. Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, has visited Taiwan many times in recent years, showing his close relationship with TSMC and other Taiwanese companies. The expert suggested that Taiwan could learn from South Korea's partnership with OpenAI. If the government leads the way in working with companies that develop AI models like OpenAI, it could help Taiwan's AI development for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Hsu Szu-chien at Warsaw Forum: Europe Helping Taiwan Also Helps Europe Stay Safe</h1>
            <p>On October 3rd, in Berlin, reporter Lin Shang-ying reported that Hsu Szu-chien, an advisor for Taiwan's National Security Council, recently attended the Warsaw Security Forum. He warned that Russia and China are using similar ways to bother their neighbors and are helping each other with military actions. Hsu Szu-chien asked European countries to support Taiwan. He said that working together between Taiwan and Europe will help Europe stay safe.</p>
            <p>Hsu Szu-chien was invited to the Warsaw Security Forum. While there, he spoke to Deutsche Welle and said that Russian drones and military planes have recently flown into the airspaces of NATO countries like Poland and Estonia many times. He said this is similar to how China puts military pressure on Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Last year, Chinese military planes bothered Taiwan about 3600 times, which is about 10 times every day. Hsu Szu-chien said these actions are part of "grey zone harassment." Their goal is to make the other side tired of defending themselves, test how fast they react, and then use false information to make it seem like the government cannot defend itself.</p>
            <p>When asked about the differences between Russia and China's actions, Hsu Szu-chien explained that Russia's actions are more serious. This is because their drones actually enter other countries' land. Chinese military planes mostly stay outside Taiwan's air defense area and do not officially enter its airspace or waters. But he warned that if Chinese planes do enter Taiwan's airspace, they could reach big cities like Taipei in minutes. If Taiwan doesn't react quickly, the results could be very bad.</p>
            <p>Hsu Szu-chien believes that the tactics used by China and Russia are basically the same. He said, "On one hand, they make the world get used to military threats, so people become less careful. On the other hand, they use military exercises to learn about the battlefield. They could change from bothering to a fast attack at any time." He warned that we should not take military plane disturbances lightly, because China and Russia are preparing for future wars.</p>
            <p>Hsu Szu-chien stressed that China and Russia are working closely together. China helps Russia's military industry by giving it machines, computer chips, and help with making things. In return, Russia helps China with things like flying together, training airborne troops, and even giving equipment. He believes their goal is clearly "a future attack on Taiwan." He thinks that if China attacks Taiwan, Russia will surely create another problem in Europe to make Western countries lose focus.</p>
            <p>Regarding "how Europe can support Taiwan," Hsu Szu-chien gave an example. China's military threats against Taiwan and the first island chain break the United Nations Charter's rule against using force. He said that German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said this many times, even directly to China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Taiwan is very thankful for this.</p>
            <p>Hsu Szu-chien asked Europe to speak out against China's wrong stories in international talks. For example, China tries to use the "Cairo Declaration," the "Potsdam Proclamation," and even the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" to say it owns Taiwan. But these documents do not have legal power.</p>
            <p>He said that Europe and Taiwan must help each other. "This is not just helping Taiwan; it is also helping Europe itself." Only by working together can they avoid being divided and isolated by China and Russia.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) recently said again that "Taiwan's status is undecided." This is very important for countering China's long-term wrong use of the "Cairo Declaration," the "Potsdam Proclamation," and UN Resolution 2758. It helps prevent Beijing from trying to find legal reasons under international law for a future attack on Taiwan.</p>
            <p>For military help, Hsu Szu-chien said that Taiwan does not expect Europe to send soldiers directly. Instead, Taiwan hopes Europe can provide defensive equipment and special ways to fight back. Taiwan also wants to develop supply chains together. He used drones as an example, noting that Poland is already Taiwan's biggest market for drone exports. In the future, they could work together on making drones and producing them together.</p>
            <p>Talking about Taiwan's preparations, Hsu Szu-chien explained that the government continues to prepare civilians for defense and make society stronger. This includes protecting communications, energy, and important buildings. They also do practice drills to make people feel more confident. He said, "Peace must be kept with strength. Everyone taking part is the best way to protect ourselves." He stressed that when society knows how to protect itself, people will not panic. This is the best defense.</p>
            <p>Finally, Hsu Szu-chien said during his interview in Warsaw that Taiwan is always careful about threats from China. But seeing how countries showed unity and bravery for Ukraine at the forum made him feel "hopeful and positive" as he returned to Taiwan. He stressed that Europe supporting Taiwan actually helps Europe itself, and only by working together can they avoid being "divided and ruled" by China and Russia.</p>
