            <h1>Incoming Economics Minister Kung Ming-hsin Talks About 3 Key Policies, Hopes to Make President's "Economy that Never Sets" Vision Real</h1>
            <p>Incoming Economics Minister Kung Ming-hsin said today that his main goals will be to strengthen the basic structures for national economic growth, help traditional and small businesses, and plan for technology industries. He said that small and medium-sized businesses and traditional industries are the foundation of Taiwan's industry. He also said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will always support industries. He added that how high-tech industries spread globally is important when facing new changes in trade. He hopes to make President Lai Ching-te's idea of an "economy that never sets" come true. The Executive Yuan held a press conference today to announce that Kung Ming-hsin, who is the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, will become the Minister of Economic Affairs. Kung Ming-hsin thanked Premier Cho Jung-tai and Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun for their trust and support, and for letting him return to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
            <p>Talking about future policies for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Kung Ming-hsin first said they will make the basic structures for national economic growth stronger. This includes work on energy and water management. He said that the budget for water management next year and in the future will be much bigger, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will make sure these plans are carried out.</p>
            <p>Second, Kung Ming-hsin stated that plans to help small and medium-sized businesses grow and water management are things that Premier Cho Jung-tai added to the budget himself. This makes them very important policies. Traditional and small businesses are the roots of Taiwan's industry, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will always stand with them. He remembered that they got through challenges like the US-China trade war and the pandemic. He believes they can also get through challenges now with traditional and small businesses.</p>
            <p>Third, for technology industries, Kung Ming-hsin said that over the past 9 years, with new technology and investment plans for Taiwan, Taiwan's industries have become very important in the world's supply chains. In the future, new plans for AI development, like silicon photonics, quantum computing, and robots, will continue. Also, President Lai hopes Taiwan will "stand in Taiwan, plan globally," and make Taiwan an "economy that never sets." This is a very important step, and Taiwan's industries need to think about the whole world.</p>
            <p>Kung Ming-hsin also said that the world's trade rules might change in the future. This could also greatly affect global orders. The government needs to be ready for this. From Trump's first term to his second, global supply chains and orders have changed. When facing new challenges, it is very important how high-tech industries plan globally and make the "economy that never sets" policy work.</p>
            <p>Finally, Kung Ming-hsin said that for the past year, he has been thinking about how to help industries plan, make their goals happen, and deal with challenges. He said he will share more details when he is at Fuzhou Street (the Ministry of Economic Affairs).</p>

            <h1>Offshore Wind Farm Haiding 1 Environmental Review Re-examined; Committee Asks for More Communication with Fishermen</h1>
            <p>The Haiding No. 1 offshore wind farm project was reviewed again today. The environmental committee suggested that the project should only be fully reviewed after it gets approval for its power capacity from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They also said that the project leaders should talk more with local fishermen. The project needs to make changes and then be reviewed again.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Environment held the third meeting for a special group. This group is looking at changes to the environmental report and review results for the "Haiding Offshore Wind Power Project No. 1 Wind Farm."</p>
            <p>The company in charge said that they changed the original plan. The wind farm area will be smaller, from 95 square kilometers to about 31.6 square kilometers. Each wind turbine can now be bigger, from 12 megawatts to 20 megawatts. This means fewer wind turbines will be needed, no more than 45, but the total power will be the same. Also, to connect to the power grid more easily, they added a new shared path for cables south of Changhua. This path will go through a self-built power station on land and connect to the Yongxing switching station.</p>
            <p>Because the plan is for the sea cables to come ashore south of Changhua, local fishermen came to protest. Hung Hsin-yu, the head of the Changhua Environmental Protection Alliance, said that offshore wind farms have caused problems in the last 3 to 4 years. He said that a lot of building makes the water dirty with mud and sand, which harms the fishermen's work. He also said the cable path cuts through wetlands like opening up a body.</p>
            <p>Local fisherman Hung Chiu-yue angrily said the company in charge was "terrible." He used to grow oysters and could harvest them in 1 to 1.5 years. But since the offshore wind turbines started being built, he hasn't been able to harvest for 3 years. Fisherman Li Kuo-chung plainly stated that the dust from the seabed and the ocean currents often make the water near the coast cloudy. He said oyster farmers lose at least NT$2 million a year.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced earlier that two wind farms, Coriolis Haiding 1 (360MW) and Wpd Group's Deshuai wind farm (240MW), did not sign their official agreements for the third phase of development.</p>
            <p>Both the Changhua County Government and the environmental review committee said that the company should get the capacity approval first before asking for a full review. The committee members felt that the current report was "not clear." They also said that the company should listen to the fishermen's concerns. If they build, they should talk with local fish farmers and offer them fair payment.</p>
            <p>The committee asked the company to add more details about the worst possible effects of the sea cables coming ashore. They need to study how it will affect water quality, the seabed, sea animals on the bottom, and the intertidal zone (the area between high and low tide). They also need to plan ways to reduce these effects. They also need to consider avoiding the intertidal zone and special fishing areas in Fangyuan Township for the onshore part of the cables.</p>
            <p>In addition, the committee also asked the company to show clear maps of the wind farm, where the cables come ashore, and how they relate to the intertidal zone and nearby fish farms. They also need to plan how to reduce the effects on fish farming. The project needs to be changed and reviewed again.</p>

            <h1>Meituan's Second Quarter Profit Falls 89% Due to Food Delivery "War"</h1>
            <p>The food delivery platforms in China started a "delivery war" in April this year. Meituan announced its financial report for the second quarter on August 27th. Its adjusted net profit went down by 89%. To deal with the tough competition, the company spent more money on promotions, advertisements, and giving rewards to users. Marketing costs went up by 51.8% compared to last year. CEO Wang Xing said this was because of "unreasonable competition."</p>
            <p>According to reports, Meituan, a big food delivery company in China, announced its second-quarter financial report on August 27th. Its income was 91.84 billion RMB (about 385.7 billion NT dollars), which is 11.7% more than last year, but less than the expected 93.724 billion RMB. Its adjusted net profit was 1.49 billion RMB, which is 89% less than last year. This was much lower than the expected 9.971 billion RMB.</p>
            <p>People were especially interested in how the "delivery war" affected Meituan. The profit from Meituan's main local business was only 3.721 billion RMB in the second quarter. This was 11.512 billion RMB less than last year, a drop of 75.6%. The profit rate went down from last year by 19.4% to 5.7%. During Meituan's financial call, CEO Wang Xing clearly stated that the second quarter's results were affected by "unreasonable competition that started this quarter."</p>
            <p>Reports say that Meituan's costs for selling things went up to 61.426 billion RMB, a 27.0% increase from last year. This was because more deliveries were made, delivery drivers received more money, and Meituan expanded its grocery and international businesses. Meituan's marketing and sales costs were 22.519 billion RMB in the second quarter, up 51.8% from last year. This was due to the company changing its business plans to deal with the strong competition in food delivery and instant retail.</p>
            <p>About the delivery war this year, Wang Xing said, "We are strongly against unfair competition." But he also said that the competition in the food delivery market is still growing, and Meituan will continue to protect its leading position. He added, "Meituan grew up through competition, and we have achieved our leading position today through continuous competition." He also pointed out that "after all the fancy things, it comes back to the basics: making sure deliveries are fast and reliable, and prices are affordable."</p>
            <p>However, the second quarter's financial report mainly showed the effects of the delivery competition between Meituan and JD. The competition with Taobao Flash Purchase has not clearly shown up in the report yet. This means that future losses might get bigger. It is expected that both the food delivery and the core local business parts of Meituan will have big losses in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>The day after the financial report was released, on August 28th, Meituan's stock in Hong Kong fell sharply by 9.72%, trading at 105 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
