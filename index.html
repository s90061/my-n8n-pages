            <h1>National Science and Technology Council to Get Back Funds for NTNU Women's Football Blood Case</h1>
            <p>The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) announced today that they will stop giving money to the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team's evaluation project. They will also ask for the money back. This includes over NT$2.46 million from NTNU and over NT$800,000 from National Central University. Also, NTNU's management fee rate will be cut by 2% for one year, which is about NT$9 million. Chen Chung-ching and Chou Tai-ying will not be allowed to apply for or work on NSTC projects for 5 and 4 years, respectively.</p>
            <p>The blood sampling case involving the NTNU women's football team has received a lot of attention. Chou Tai-ying, a coach involved in the case, had her coaching license taken away by the Chinese Taipei Football Association's Disciplinary Committee. She is also banned from football activities for life. Because this case is related to a project funded by the NSTC for advanced sports science, the NSTC held a press conference this afternoon. They shared their decision about the NTNU women's football blood sampling incident and how they will improve their management.</p>
            <p>The NSTC said that after a lawmaker shared information about the improper blood sampling of NTNU women's football team members on November 28 last year, they asked NTNU to investigate the next day. In December, a special team was formed. In July this year, the NSTC started an ethics investigation and review for Professors Chen Chung-ching and Chou Tai-ying because of their unethical academic actions. They looked at all sports science projects that involved human research. They also worked with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to form a special group. This group checked all projects where Chen and Chou used blood samples for sports science research.</p>
            <p>The NSTC explained that after reviewing the case, they made four decisions. First, they will stop funding the big project called "Building a Smart Sensing and Evaluation Platform for the Psychophysiology, Injuries, and Performance of New Generation Female Football Players." Second, they will get back the project funds: NT$2,460,900 from NTNU and NT$808,800 from National Central University. Third, NTNU's management fee rate will be cut by 2% for one year, which is about NT$9 million. Fourth, Chen Chung-ching and Chou Tai-ying will not be allowed to apply for or work on any NSTC funded or awarded projects for 5 and 4 years, respectively.</p>

            <p>In the Weather Bureau's "High Temperature Information," "high temperature" means when the highest ground temperature goes above 36 degrees Celsius. Based on how hot it is or is expected to be, and for how long, there are three levels: yellow, orange, and red lights.</p>
            <p>Taoyuan City, Taichung City, Changhua County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, and Hualien County have yellow high temperature warnings. This means people should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>

            <h1>Dementia-Friendly Picture Book "Light on the Path" Shows Grandpa's Fragmented World</h1>
            <p>"I don't know when my world started needing to be put together with effort," familiar things in a grandpa with dementia's mind are like missing puzzle pieces. This is the National Health Agency's (NHA) dementia-friendly picture book "Light on the Path." It will use gentle drawing and soft colors to show people what it's like to live with dementia.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is becoming a super-aged society, facing a "silver tsunami" as the number of people with dementia keeps growing each year. According to a study by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, almost 8% of people over 65 in Taiwan have dementia. This means about 1 in every 13 older adults has dementia, making the total number of people with dementia 380,000. This year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's National Health Agency created the dementia-friendly picture book "Light on the Path." They are asking everyone to help make a friendly environment for people with dementia.</p>
            <p>The dementia-friendly picture book "Light on the Path" tells the story from the perspective of a grandpa with dementia. It shows how his memories fade and how his family supports him. When the grandpa with dementia sees familiar things, sometimes his memories are clear, but sometimes they are blurry and broken, like a puzzle with missing pieces. Sticky notes and to-do lists become helpful tools in his daily life. They not only remind him what to do next but also teach his family how to support him just right.</p>
            <p>The picture book uses gentle drawing and soft colors. It explains that with the careful support of his family and the warm help from the community, the missing parts of the grandpa's memory are slowly filled with light and color. His life still continues at a normal pace. Even with many difficulties, the grandpa still tries to tie his own shoelaces and finish every small task in his daily life. He does this to keep his independence and dignity.</p>
            <p>The picture book goes from "I don't know when my world started needing to be put together with effort" to "I want everyone to know that the real me is still here." It shows that if people with dementia are understood and respected, they can live well. The idea is "I am still me." Shen Jing-fen, the head of the NHA, said in a press release today that dementia is not a normal part of getting old. It is an important health issue that everyone in society needs to understand and support.</p>
            <p>Shen Jing-fen said that people should live healthy lives. This means eating balanced meals, exercising, being active in the community, avoiding "three highs" (high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol), and not smoking. These actions can help lower the risk of getting dementia. She also hopes that by publishing the dementia-friendly picture book, more people will learn about dementia. This will help reduce negative ideas about it and create a friendly environment where people are understood and supported.</p>
            <p>The NHA's dementia-friendly picture book "Light on the Path" is expected to be finished printing by the end of October this year. The 2D digital animation will be completed by the end of November. After that, it will be put on the Health99 website, where people can download and use it for free. The NHA asks everyone to understand and be with people who have dementia, and to create a dementia-friendly environment.</p>
