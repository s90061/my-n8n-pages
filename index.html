            <h1>Russia Says Trump Helping Ukraine Fight More, Not Good for Peace</h1>
            <p>Russia's government, the Kremlin, warned today that US President Donald Trump's promise to give more weapons to Ukraine and his threats to put strict rules on Russia's trade partners could help Ukraine keep fighting. This might also make peace talks, which have stopped, last even longer.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Trump announced yesterday he would give Russia 50 days to agree to peace with Ukraine. He also talked about his disappointment with Moscow. In addition, he made a deal with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that the US will give new military help to Kyiv, paid for by NATO countries.</p>
            <p>Before this, Trump had pushed Russia and Ukraine to start peace talks to end the war, which has lasted more than three years. However, Russia has refused calls to stop fighting. In recent months, it has also attacked Ukraine with a very large number of drones and missiles.</p>
            <p>Moscow said it needs more time to fully respond to Trump's statements. But it also hinted that Trump's actions are not good for the peace talks to be successful.</p>
            <p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters, "This decision, made directly by Washington, NATO countries, and Brussels, does not seem to be seen as a sign of peace by Kyiv. Instead, it seems to be a way to continue the war."</p>
            <p>Peskov also said, "President Trump's statements are very serious. We truly need time to understand what Washington has said."</p>
            <p>Trump has warned that if Russia and Ukraine do not make a peace agreement, he will put high taxes on goods from Russia's remaining trade partners. This is to make it harder for Russia to pay for its military actions.</p>

            <h1>France's Report Cares About Taiwan Strait; Wu Chih-chung: Democracies Stand with Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The French government has released a new "National Strategic Review" report. It talks about the Taiwan Strait and China's military drills. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said today that it will work with other democratic countries to keep peace in the Taiwan Strait. Wu Chih-chung, a political vice minister of MOFA, wrote on social media that major democratic countries are with Taiwan, saying, "This is our shared future."</p>
            <p>MOFA announced tonight that France's updated "National Strategic Review 2025" was released on July 14. This report mentions the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan six times. It says that China is making its army stronger and doing more military drills around the Taiwan Strait. It also uses force and other ways to pressure Taiwan, which makes the area tense and not stable.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that the 2022 version of this report talked about China's military growth as a danger to the current situation in the Taiwan Strait. This year's report spends more time talking about China's threats to Taiwan and shows France's concern for Taiwan and its security. Foreign Minister Joseph Wu welcomed and thanked France for this.</p>
            <p>MOFA also mentioned that on July 10, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer made a statement together at the 37th UK-France Leaders' Summit in London. They said again that they support peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. After this, France again showed its concern for Taiwan Strait security and Taiwan's importance in its national strategic report.</p>
            <p>MOFA strongly said that Taiwan is an important part of the Indo-Pacific region. It will keep working with France and other democratic countries to protect freedom and democracy. It will also firmly keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung, the political vice minister of MOFA, also posted on Facebook tonight. He said that the main advanced democratic countries in the world are standing with Taiwan, and "This is our shared future."</p>

            <h1>US Ends Ban on EDA Sales; China Approves Synopsys Deal</h1>
            <p>The United States recently allowed the sale of chip design software (EDA) to China again. Yesterday, China approved a $35 billion takeover by the US EDA company Synopsys. But there are some rules, for example, Synopsys cannot refuse to renew contracts with its current Chinese customers.</p>
            <p>Synopsys plans to buy Ansys, a company that makes simulation software, for $35 billion (about NT$1.03 trillion). This is a big company merger in the tech industry recently. However, China's regulators took a long time to approve this deal.</p>
            <p>According to Chinese media, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced on July 14 that it approved the purchase of Ansys shares by Synopsys with some added rules.</p>
            <p>The reports said that China's approval of this deal is a big win for Synopsys. This company is seen as important for the US to stay strong in certain areas of semiconductor technology.</p>
            <p>Before this, on July 2, the US government told Synopsys that it had removed the need for an export license to sell EDA to China. Synopsys said that after the US relaxed its rules, the company is working to let its Chinese customers use its products again.</p>
            <p>China's SAMR listed eight extra rules. These include: not ending current customer contracts; not refusing requests from Chinese customers to renew current contracts; and providing Synopsys's EDA products and Ansys's EDA products to Chinese customers fairly, reasonably, and without discrimination. These products are mainly used for parasitic analysis, transistor-level power integrity analysis, and power device analysis.</p>
            <p>In May, it was reported that the US government was limiting Synopsys and its rivals from doing business with Chinese customers because of national security.</p>
            <p>The reports said that with China's decision, Synopsys has cleared the last major problem to make its market position stronger. This deal was announced in early 2024 and has already been approved by European and US regulators.</p>
            <p>On Monday, after the New York stock market opened, Synopsys's stock price went up by 3.5% at one point. Ansys's stock price went up by 5.6% at one point.</p>
