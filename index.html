            <h1>Kuo Li-yang Wins Gold at World Roller Skating Championships, First for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's good athlete, Kuo Li-yang, won a gold medal today at the World Roller Skating Championships in China. He got the gold in the men's 200-meter time trial for adults, finishing in 17.599 seconds. This is the first time a Taiwanese person has done this. After the race, he happily said, "It feels great!"</p>
            <p>The 2025 World Roller Skating Championships started today in Beidaihe, China. Kuo Li-yang is a new star from Taiwan, only 22 years old. Last month, he won a silver medal in the men's 200-meter pursuit race at the World Games in Chengdu. Now, at the World Championships, he beat everyone in the men's 200-meter time trial.</p>
            <p>Kuo Li-yang won the gold medal with a time of 17.599 seconds. Jhoan Guzman from Spain got the silver medal, and Vincenzo Maiorca from Italy got the bronze medal.</p>
            <p>Kuo Li-yang had always come close to winning a World Championship gold medal but never got it. After the race, he told a news agency that when he heard his time, he saw his coaches cheering. He then guessed that he had won the gold. "It feels really good," he said. "In the 200-meter race, how well your opponent performs is very important. A small mistake can make a big difference. Luckily, I did well this time."</p>
            <p>Kuo Li-yang started roller skating when he was in kindergarten. He officially became an athlete in elementary school. He loved the feeling of racing against others. Now, he has finally become a real "world champion." He smiled and said he is very thankful for his family's support. He also thanked his first coach, Lin Yong-xiang, for help with training and getting his body ready. "He calmed me down," Kuo Li-yang said. "I feel much more confident when he is there."</p>
            <p>The team coach, Liu Yu-shen, said that they expected Kuo Li-yang to at least get a medal. Today, he gave 120% of his effort and fought until the very end. He even made a rare move to cross the finish line, showing his strong desire to win. He also handled the turns very well. These things were key to winning the gold medal.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-shen also said, "When we tested the wheels, we found the right ones for him. This gave him more confidence, and we are very happy for him."</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian Immigrant Grows World's Tallest Sunflower, Shows Love for His Country</h1>
            <p>An immigrant from Ukraine in the United States, Alex Babich, grew a sunflower that is 35 feet (about 11 meters) tall. On the 10th, it was confirmed to be the tallest in the world, breaking a Guinness World Record. The sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine. So, this flower shows his origins and his future legacy.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Alex Babich, who is 47 years old, moved to the U.S. in 1991 after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. He was only 14 at that time. Seven years ago, he started growing sunflowers to show his love for his home country.</p>
            <p>The first sunflower Babich grew was 13 feet (about 4 meters) tall. After that, one grew to 15 feet (about 4.5 meters), and then another reached 19 feet (about 5.8 meters). Soon, he started to wonder, "How tall can this grow?"</p>
            <p>Finally, Babich grew this sunflower, as tall as a telephone pole, in his backyard in Indiana. He said he broke the world record after "many years of trying and making mistakes."</p>
            <p>Babich gave the world's tallest sunflower the nickname "Clover." This is because his 10-year-old son would climb a tall structure and put lucky four-leaf clovers on its leaves to bring it good luck.</p>
            <p>Babich described "Clover" as "one of my children." He said, "I take care of it outside every day."</p>
            <p>He also said, "One day I will die, but the story of this flower will continue. My children will tell this story to my grandchildren."</p>

            <h1>Cross-Strait Standard Dance Competition in Shanghai: Older Dancers Show Their Style</h1>
            <p>The second "Cross-Strait International Standard Dance Competition" was held today in Shanghai. Wang Hong-zhi, an expert in standard dance who brought it from Taiwan to China, said that most of the dancers in this competition were older adults. This is different from past competitions in mainland China, which mostly had children and teenagers. He thinks this makes the event very important.</p>
            <p>The 2025 "Cross-Strait International Standard Dance Competition" took place on September 13th at the Xiangyuan Hilton Hotel in Shanghai. There were 156 dancers from Taiwan, 266 dancers from mainland China, and 40 judges from both sides. The competition started at 8 AM and continued until the evening.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-zhi, who has been promoting standard dance in China for 35 years after bringing it from Taiwan, said this year's event is the second one. He noted that it was bigger than the last one, and the dancers performed very well. He believes this event connects dance lovers from both sides, helps share culture, and creates a good environment for interaction between the two sides.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-zhi also said that while standard dance in Taiwan started earlier, mainland China has developed quickly. Now, the dancers from both sides are at a similar skill level, making the competition very exciting.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-zhi also noticed that most dancers in this competition were older adults. He found this very interesting because past competitions in mainland China mainly focused on children and teenagers. He said that standard dance is for everyone, no matter their age or gender, and he feels this competition is very meaningful.</p>
            <p>The Yuanzu Group, which has been doing business in mainland China for 32 years, organized this standard dance competition. The founder, Zhang Xiu-wan, said that the event aims to help cross-strait exchanges and give a stage to older dancers. This year, the event was planned for Taipei. But it was hard for many dancers to travel to Taipei, so it was held in Shanghai again. She said, "We still hope it can be like the Twin City Forum, one year in Taiwan and one year in Shanghai."</p>
            <p>Talking about the Twin City Forum that will be held in Shanghai this year, Zhang Xiu-wan said that exchanges between people are still very important. She believes that cross-strait exchanges can become stronger and more real through the Twin City Forum. Also, informal exchanges like this event, where people have fun and learn about each other, should continue to grow.</p>
            <p>The competition had different groups, such as teacher-student, senior/elite, parent-child, and city exchange. It mainly focused on senior dancers aged 45 and above, even up to 60 and older. In the parent-child group, a mother and daughter team from Shanghai won first place.</p>
            <p>Zhang Sihan, an 11-year-old dancer from Shanghai, said she started learning Latin dance in kindergarten and has been doing it for six years. Her mother, Liu Yan, said she learned to dance just to join the competition with her daughter. She only learned for two weeks but competed with her daughter and won first place.</p>
            <p>When asked about the differences between the two sides in the competition, Zhang Sihan said that Taiwanese dancers also danced very well and were very friendly.</p>
