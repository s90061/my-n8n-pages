Many people today spend a lot of time looking at screens – phones, computers, and TVs. This can sometimes make us feel tired, stressed, or even lonely. Because of this, a new idea called "digital wellness" is becoming popular. It's about being more mindful of how we use technology and making sure it doesn't harm our mental health.
Digital wellness is similar to self-care, which is about taking care of your body and mind. But digital wellness focuses on our relationship with digital devices. It includes things like taking breaks from screens, setting limits on how much time we spend online, and choosing what kind of content we look at. For example, some people try not to use their phone in the bedroom, or they turn off notifications for certain apps. Others might spend time offline doing hobbies or spending time with friends in person. The goal is to feel better and have a healthier life, both online and offline.

**AI set to transform workplaces, says WEF report**

A new report from the World Economic Forum (WEF) says that artificial intelligence (AI) will change how we work in a big way. The report explains that AI will not just replace some jobs, but it will also create new jobs and change many existing ones. This means that workers will need new skills to do their jobs well.
The report suggests that companies should help their employees learn these new skills. For example, training programs can teach workers how to use AI tools or how to work alongside AI systems. Some jobs, like those needing creativity or social skills, might become even more important because AI is not as good at these things. The WEF believes that countries and businesses need to prepare for these changes now to make sure that the future of work is fair and that people have the right skills for new jobs.

**The rise of ‘slow tourism’**

In recent years, a new way of traveling called "slow tourism" has become popular. Unlike traditional holidays where people try to see many places quickly, slow tourism encourages travelers to stay longer in one place. The idea is to experience the local culture and way of life more deeply.
When you travel slowly, you might choose to live like a local. This could mean staying in an apartment instead of a hotel, shopping at local markets, and spending more time in parks or cafes. Instead of rushing from one famous attraction to another, slow tourists often prefer to explore quieter areas, learn a few words of the local language, or simply relax and enjoy the atmosphere. This type of travel is often seen as more sustainable because it supports local businesses and reduces the environmental impact of frequent travel. It also offers a richer, more personal travel experience.
