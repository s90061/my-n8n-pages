            <p>The U12 Baseball World Cup started today. Taiwan played its first game against Cuba. Taiwan's pitcher, Chung Ting-hsu, started the game. He pitched for 3 innings and got 7 strikeouts, giving up only 1 run. His pitching was very strong. Taiwan's hitters also played well together to score runs. In the end, Taiwan won the game 6 to 3 and got their first victory.</p>
            <p>The U12 Baseball World Cup began today at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center Youth Baseball Field. The Taiwan team started strong, trying to score runs. In the bottom of the first inning, Hu Cheng-en hit a base hit first. He moved to second base because of a pitcher's mistake. Then, he scored Taiwan's first run from a ground ball.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the second inning, the Taiwan team showed how confident and fast they were. With one player out, Huang Yu-chien walked to first base. Lin Kai-chen was hit by a pitch, so he also went to first base. With two players out, they used a special play to steal two bases at once, moving to second and third base. Li Chuan-en then hit a ball that stayed in the infield, and he got a base hit. The two players on base quickly ran home. Taiwan was now leading 3 to 0.</p>
            <p>In the top of the third inning, the Cuba team scored 1 run. But in the bottom of the third inning, Taiwan started scoring again. A player was hit by a pitch, which put him on base. Then, Li Ping-jung and Gu Meng-jie hit base hits one after another, filling all the bases. Hsieh Cheng-chun then hit an important base hit that brought 2 runs home. Another run was scored when players ran during a throw, making it the team's sixth run.</p>
            <p>In the top of the fifth inning, the first hitter for Cuba got a base hit. With one player out, the relief pitcher, Chen Chi-sheng, gave up a two-run home run. But he quickly got back to normal and did not let Cuba score more runs.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's starting pitcher, Chung Ting-hsu, pitched for 3 innings today. He allowed 4 base hits, but he also had 7 strikeouts. He gave up 1 earned run, showing he was a very strong pitcher. Chen Chi-sheng pitched for 2.1 innings and gave up 2 runs. Wu Shang-cheng then pitched for 0.7 innings without giving up any runs.

            <h1>24 KMT Lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an's Recall Vote Will Be Held on July 26th, From 8 AM to 4 PM</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 25th, CNA reporter Kao Hua-chien) The recall vote for 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an (who is currently suspended) will happen on July 26th. People can vote from 8 AM to 4 PM. Voters should bring their national ID card, personal seal (chop), and voting notice to their assigned polling station. Also, on July 26th, people are not allowed to campaign or help with the recall vote. If they do, they will have to pay a fine.</p>
            <p>The recall vote for the 11th-term lawmakers and the 11th-term Hsinchu Mayor will take place on July 26th. The people facing recall include 24 KMT lawmakers: Fu Kun-chi, Huang Chien-pin, Cheng Cheng-chien, Lin Pei-hsiang, Wan Mei-ling, Lu Ming-che, Tu Chuan-chi, Niu Hsu-ting, Liao Hsien-hsiang, Lo Ting-wei, Huang Chien-hao, Liao Wei-hsiang, Chiu Ruo-hua, Lu Yu-ling, Ting Hsueh-chung, Yeh Yuan-chih, Wang Hung-wei, Li Yen-hsiu, Hsu Chiao-hsin, Lai Shibao, Lo Chih-chiang, Hung Meng-kai, Chang Chih-lun, and Lin Te-fu. Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an is also on the list.</p>
            <p>When people go to vote, they should bring their national ID card, personal seal, and voting notice. If you don't have your seal, you can sign your name or use a thumbprint instead. If you don't have your voting notice, you can still vote. But if you remember your number on the voter list, like "page number X, line number X," telling the staff when you get your ballot will save time.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission (CEC) also listed 7 important things to remember for voting. First, starting from midnight on July 26th, people cannot do any campaigning or help with the recall vote on social media apps like LINE or Facebook, or any other media. If they do, they will be fined between 100,000 to 1,000,000 New Taiwan Dollars. If they don't stop after being told, they will be fined repeatedly. Political parties, candidates, and their employees, agents, or users will be fined even more, between 200,000 to 2,000,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Second, it is not allowed to make noise, disturb, or try to convince others to vote or not to vote within 30 meters of a polling station. If you continue after a security guard tells you to stop, you can go to prison for up to 1 year, or be detained, or pay a fine of up to 15,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Third, you cannot bring mobile phones or other cameras into the polling station. (But if your phone is turned off, this rule does not apply.) If you do, you will be fined between 30,000 to 300,000 New Taiwan Dollars. Fourth, you cannot put anything other than the recall ballot into the ballot box, or intentionally tear up the recall ballot. If you do, you will be fined between 5,000 to 50,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Fifth, you cannot use a camera to secretly look at what someone voted on their recall ballot. If you do, you can go to prison for up to 5 years and also pay a fine of up to 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars. Any cameras found will be taken away. Sixth, you cannot take the recall ballot out of the polling station. If you do, you can go to prison for up to 1 year, or be detained, or pay a fine of up to 15,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Seventh, if you vote on the recall ballot by using your personal seal or a thumbprint, your vote will not be counted. You also cannot use your own voting tools, ink pads, or ink pads. You must use the voting tools provided by the election commission to mark your vote.</p>
            <p>According to the Law on Recall of Public Officials, for a recall to pass, the number of "yes" votes must be more than the number of "no" votes. Also, the "yes" votes must be at least one-fourth (1/4) of all eligible voters in that election area. If this happens, the recall is successful. After the Central Election Commission reviews and announces the results on August 1st, the person who is recalled will lose their job legally. From August 1st, they will no longer be able to work as a lawmaker or use their power as a lawmaker.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if the number of "no" votes is more than the "yes" votes, or if the "yes" votes are less than one-fourth (1/4) of all eligible voters, then the recall is rejected. During the time the person is in office, no one can propose another recall for the same person.</p>

            <h1>Cambodia's Prime Minister Is Willing to Accept Malaysia's Ceasefire Idea, Says Thailand's Will Is Key</h1>
            <p>(Phnom Penh, July 25th, Combined Foreign News) Cambodia's Prime Minister, Hun Manet, said today that he supports the plan suggested by Malaysia's Prime Minister, Anwar. This plan is for Cambodia and Thailand to stop fighting. Thailand first supported this plan today, but then changed its mind.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Thailand and Cambodia, two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, are currently having their strongest fights in over 10 years. Anwar, who is the current leader of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), is trying to solve this conflict.</p>
            <p>Hun Manet wrote on Facebook that "If this armed conflict between Thailand and Cambodia is to be solved, the most important thing is whether Thailand truly wants to agree to a ceasefire."</p>
