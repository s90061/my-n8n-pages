            <h1>Donald Trump Opens New Golf Course in Scotland During His Trip</h1>
            <p>Today, July 29, in Balmedie, UK, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, opened his new golf course in Scotland. This event was the end of his five-day trip. During this trip, he also signed an important trade agreement with the European Union (EU). He also told Russia to stop the war in Ukraine in less than two weeks.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), this very large golf course is on the coast of Aberdeenshire. It has the world's biggest natural sand trap on a golf course. There are also sand dunes and plants looking out over the sea. Security staff and golfers were present, waiting for Mr. Trump to hit the first ball while Scottish bagpipes played.</p>
            <p>Before cutting the ribbon, Mr. Trump said, "We started with a beautiful piece of land, and we have made it much more beautiful. This place... truly welcomes us."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump also said, "We will play (the opening game) quickly. After that, I will go back to Washington D.C. We need to stop wars around the world. There are some conflicts in the world now, but we have stopped many of them. We will have a good and peaceful world."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump also added that this project will be very successful and that "people can come here and enjoy life."</p>
            <p>AFP pointed out that these words show how Mr. Trump's trip again mixed his job as president with his private business.</p>

            <h1>New Rules for High-Dividend ETFs? Financial Commission Says No, Just Guidelines</h1>
            <p>Today, July 29, in Taipei, Ms. Su Ssu-yun from Central News Agency reported: Taiwanese investors like investment products that pay high dividends. Recently, it was rumored online that the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) had released new guidelines. People worried that this would make high-dividend ETFs disappear from the market. Today, the FSC explained that they have not issued any new rules. The Securities Investment Trust & Consulting Association (SITCA) simply collected ideas from the industry and then made a set of guidelines. After the FSC approved it, SITCA announced the "Guidelines for ETFs Using Income Equalization Reserves as a Source of Income Distribution" in early July.</p>
            <p>Recently, posts online said that the FSC released the "Guidelines for ETFs Using Income Equalization Reserves as a Source of Income Distribution" in July this year. These posts mentioned that the real dividend rate for ETFs should generally not be more than the suggested dividend rate. This made the market worry that high-dividend ETFs would go away.</p>
            <p>Ms. Kao Ching-ping, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said at a regular press conference that the "Guidelines for ETFs Using Income Equalization Reserves as a Source of Income Distribution," which people are talking about online, are not new rules. She also said there is no issue of taking down any announcement.</p>
            <p>Ms. Kao explained that the FSC already set rules for using income equalization reserves in November 2023. These rules included when an income equalization reserve could be used for dividends. On November 13, 2023, the FSC issued an official letter about this. Since then, companies have had questions about how to follow these rules. So, SITCA collected feedback from companies and created an example guideline.</p>
            <p>Ms. Kao added that after SITCA gave the guidelines, the FSC approved them. SITCA then put the "Guidelines for ETFs Using Income Equalization Reserves as a Source of Income Distribution" on its website in early July. The main reason for this was to help companies follow the rules and understand the details of how to do it.</p>
