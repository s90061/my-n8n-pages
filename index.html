            <h1>PGA St. Jude Championship: Yu Chun-an is Tied for 30th and Tries to Keep Playing</h1>
            <p>The PGA FedEx Cup playoff tournament, the St. Jude Championship, had its third round today. Yu Chun-an, the only player from Taiwan, got 3 birdies and 2 bogeys, finishing with a score of 69. After three days, his total score is 207, which is 3 strokes under par. He is currently tied for 30th place and still has a chance to earn enough points to continue in the playoffs.</p>
            <p>According to the PGA Tour website, after three rounds, Yu Chun-an's predicted FedEx Cup points put him at 62nd place. He needs to move up to reach the top 50, which is needed to play in the second playoff tournament.</p>
            <p>The rules for the FedEx Cup playoffs say that only the top 70 players on the points list can play in the first tournament, the St. Jude Championship. For the second tournament, the BMW Championship, only the top 50 players can participate.</p>
            <p>Yu Chun-an started today from the first hole. On the second hole, his second shot landed in the sand trap next to the green, and he got a bogey. But on the third hole, he hit a very good iron shot and made a birdie from less than 3 feet, which helped him get back on track.</p>
            <p>However, on the par-3 fourth hole, Yu Chun-an hit his first shot too far. He had to chip the ball back from the edge of the green but missed a short putt for par, getting another bogey.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Yu Chun-an played better after that. He got birdies on the 11th and 12th holes and then finished the rest of the holes at par.</p>
            <p>Today, Yu Chun-an hit 78.5% of his tee shots onto the fairway, which was the third best among all players. His average driving distance was 307 yards. He also hit 66.67% of his shots onto the green in the correct number of strokes, which was the seventh best.</p>
            <p>The only thing that wasn't good was his putting. In the third round, he needed an average of 1.83 putts per green, which put him 59th out of 69 players.</p>
            <p>Yu Chun-an has one more day to play. To make it to the second FedEx Cup playoff tournament, he probably needs to finish in the top 15.</p>

            <h1>Greek Prime Minister Says Food Aid is Airdropped into Gaza</h1>
            <p>The Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, announced that Greece and other countries in the European Union (EU) dropped food aid from planes into the Gaza area today.</p>
            <p>Mitsotakis wrote on Facebook, "This morning, two planes from the Greek Air Force dropped 8.5 tons of basic food items into the Gaza area."</p>
            <p>"This action was planned together with the EU and countries in the Middle East. Its goal is to help meet the basic needs of the people in the affected area."</p>
            <p>Philippe Lazzarini, who is in charge of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), has warned that dropping aid from planes alone cannot stop the increasing hunger.</p>
            <p>The United Nations believes that Gaza needs at least 600 trucks of aid every day to provide for the basic needs of its people.</p>
