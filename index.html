            <h1>Israel Attacks Doha; UK, France, Germany Are Against It</h1>
            <p>On September 9, Britain, France, and Germany spoke out against Israel's attack in Doha. This attack was aimed at political leaders of Hamas, a Palestinian group. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded indirectly to their words.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse said that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the attack was against Qatar's right to control its own land. He also said it could make the difficult situation in the region much worse. French President Emmanuel Macron said that this kind of action is "not okay," no matter the reason.</p>
            <p>Starmer wrote on social media, "I am against Israel's attack on Doha... We must stop fighting now, free the people taken hostage, and send a lot of help to Gaza. This is the only way to have lasting peace."</p>
            <p>Macron also criticized the attack on the same social media platform. He said, "The fighting must not spread in the area."</p>
            <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said in a statement, "Israel's attack on Doha not only went against Qatar's national right, but it also put all our efforts to free the hostages in danger. This attack is not acceptable."</p>
            <p>This was the first time Israel attacked Doha, the capital city of Qatar. Qatar's Ministry of Interior said that a member of their national security forces died.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a Hamas official told Al Jazeera news that the son of Hamas's main negotiator died in the event. However, the top leaders were safe.</p>
            <p>Because of the criticism from European countries, Netanyahu said that those who criticized him forgot about Hamas's deadly attack on Israel in October 2023.</p>
            <p>He said, "Many countries in the world, including governments of many democratic countries, have sadly forgotten October 7. But I will not forget, and Israel will never forget."</p>

            <h1>US Job Numbers Go Down by 911,000; White House Wants Lower Interest Rates</h1>
            <p>The US government announced today that the number of new jobs created was much lower than first reported. This was for the year leading up to March. The US Federal Reserve will have a meeting about its money policies next week. The bad job numbers made the White House ask again for interest rates to be cut.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the US Labor Department shared early information. It said that the number of new jobs added in the US for the year ending in March might be reduced by 911,000.</p>
            <p>This means about 76,000 fewer jobs were added each month. This time period includes the last few months of former President Biden's term and the start of President Trump's second term. This kind of change is something the government does every year. The final numbers will be announced early next year.</p>
            <p>But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt used these numbers. She said the economy under the previous government was "a mess." She also told Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates right away.</p>
            <p>She also criticized the job numbers and changes from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. She said this shows that "new leaders" are needed.</p>
            <p>Before these new estimated numbers came out, US government information showed that employers had added almost 1.8 million jobs in the past year.</p>
            <p>This early reduction is bigger than the one last year, which was 818,000 jobs. At that time, before the presidential election in November, former President Trump was very angry. He said the Biden government changed the job numbers and called it "a big scandal."</p>

            <h1>Hsing-Ta Power Plant Fire: Yong'an Village Leaders Demand Shutdown and Check, May Protest</h1>
            <p>A fire happened at the Hsing-Ta Power Plant in Kaohsiung last night. The sound of explosions scared many local people. Six village chiefs from Yong'an district came to see what happened. They made a joint statement. They said Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) must explain the accident openly and stop the plant to check everything. If not, they might protest by blocking the plant.</p>
            <p>Ho Ying-cheng, the chief of Hsinkang Village, spoke to reporters. He said that the six village chiefs waited from 8 PM to 11 PM but Taipower did not talk to them. He said, "Taipower spoke to the media, but they did not answer the village chiefs. This is truly bad."</p>
            <p>The fire at Hsing-Ta Power Plant happened around 8 PM on September 9. The part of the plant that had the accident was a new one. It was being tested. The reason for the accident is still being looked into.</p>
            <p>After the accident, six village chiefs from Yong'an district came to care for their people. They were Ho Ying-cheng, Kuo Hsien-ming (Yong'an Village Chief), Lin Ming-chun (Yonghua Village Chief), Chen Wen-yin (Baoning Village Chief), Chiang Fu-shan (Weishin Village Chief), and Ko Nan-lieh (Yantian Village Chief). At about 11 PM, the six people made a public statement. They asked Taipower to explain the reason for the accident at the Yong'an District Office on the morning of September 10.</p>
            <p>"Even 5 kilometers away, doors were shaking," Ho Ying-cheng said. He stated that the accident has made people scared. He said the plant must stop working until the truth about the accident is found. He also said that the plant must be completely safe before it can run again. He asked the city government to be strong and not let the residents live in fear.</p>
            <p>Chiang Fu-shan said that Taipower did not tell the local area when they did the first test run. He added, "The first test had some strange smell. We told Taipower, and they said it was because of new paint."</p>
            <p>Chen Wen-yin said that the government's energy plans must keep the local villagers safe. He said local villagers should not be put in danger. He insisted that the plant must be checked for safety before it can operate. He said, "Yong'an district helps to make electricity, but local people want to feel safe, not just get money."</p>
