            <h1>Chinese Man Arrested for the Fifth Time in Japan for TOEIC Cheating; 14 Accomplices Made the Same Mistakes</h1>
            <p>Tokyo (CNA) â€“ Japan's Kyodo News reported today that the Tokyo police have arrested Wang Likun, a 27-year-old Chinese graduate student from Kyoto University, again. He is suspected of writing someone else's name on a TOEIC English test answer sheet. This is his fifth arrest.</p>
            <p>Japanese police said that Wang Likun did not speak. In the test room where he was, about 50 other Chinese students who registered with the same address also took the test. Of these, 14 students got the same high scores as Wang Likun, and they also answered the same questions incorrectly. This may mean it was a group cheating plan using communication devices.</p>
            <p>On April 20, Wang Likun had pretended to be someone else and used another person's name on an answer sheet at a test center in Toshima Ward, Tokyo. On May 18, he was also suspected of pretending to be someone else to take the TOEIC English test in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>On that day, he not only pretended to be another person, but he also hid a small microphone, about 3 to 4 centimeters long, inside his mask. Police arrested him on the spot. After his arrest, 30% of the test-takers in the same room did not show up.</p>
            <p>Tokyo police at that time thought that these missing test-takers might have been people who were supposed to receive answers from Wang Likun. They likely did not come to the test after realizing something was wrong.</p>
            <p>Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Wang Likun also took tests in June last year and March this year using names that seemed to be Chinese. (Edited by Chen Zhengjian) 1140904</p>

            <h1>Alphabet's Stock Jumps Over 9% as It Avoids Selling Chrome</h1>
            <p>San Francisco (CNA) â€“ Google's parent company, Alphabet, saw its stock price rise sharply by 9.14% today. This happened because investors believe that a US court's decision in an antitrust case against Google was good for the large technology company.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a US business news channel, reported that Alphabet's stock went up a lot today. Its market value increased by 234 billion US dollars (about 7 trillion New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>The US Department of Justice had asked the court in this antitrust case, which started in September 2023, to force Google to split off some of its businesses, including its web browser, Chrome.</p>
            <p>Even though the court made an important decision last year, saying that Google illegally controlled 90% of the US internet search market, US federal district judge Amit Mehta did not agree to the Justice Department's strongest suggested punishment.</p>
            <p>Google does not have to sell its Chrome browser. In the future, it can still pay device makers or browser companies to put its products on their devices. However, it cannot sign special agreements that stop other search engines from being used by default. This means Google can still pay Apple billions of dollars to make sure it is the default search engine on iPhones.</p>
            <p>Google's main search business is facing tough competition from new companies like Perplexity and OpenAI. But Google has managed these challenges well so far, and its advertising business continues to grow.</p>
            <p>Mehta also decided that Google can keep its Android operating system. This system, along with the Chrome browser, helps Google's strong internet advertising business.</p>
            <p>Mehta did ask Google to share data with its competitors. This will help strengthen competitors in its advertising business. However, Google does not have to sell Chrome or Android. This has removed big worries for investors, who see Chrome and Android as very important parts of Google's overall business. (Translated by Liu Wenyu) 1140904</p>

            <p>New York (CNA) â€“ International oil prices fell today because the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies (OPEC+) are reportedly planning to increase oil production again at their meeting this weekend.</p>
            <p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil for October delivery, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropped by 2.5%. It closed at 63.97 US dollars per barrel.</p>
