            <h1>Ministry of Health Says Social Welfare Budget for Local Areas Not Cut, Despite Online Rumors</h1>
            <p>Today, there were rumors on social media that the central government had cut NT$34.112 billion from local social welfare budgets. However, Deputy Minister Lu Jian-de of the Ministry of Health and Welfare clarified that the money was not cut. Instead, social welfare funds that were previously given as specific project subsidies are now part of general subsidies.</p>
            <p>Lu Jian-de explained in a written statement this evening that the social welfare budget for next year will stay steady. The central government will continue to give money to local areas through general subsidies. He said that after changes were made to the Law on the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, the money was not removed. General subsidies still include funds for social welfare. The money that used to be for specific social welfare projects is now included in these general subsidies. This is just a change in how the central government gives money to local areas.</p>
            <p>Lu Jian-de further explained that the way these subsidies are given follows the idea of "fair distribution, not exactly equal distribution" from the Law on the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures. This means the support will consider how many people live in an area, how much money the local government has, and how well its economy is doing. The Social and Family Affairs Administration will provide help based on the financial levels set by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, working together with local governments.</p>
            <p>Lu Jian-de also stated that the central government will continue to work closely with city and county governments. They will plan carefully how to use resources for social welfare spending to make sure that people who need help get the support they deserve.</p>
            <p>Zhou Dao-jun, the acting director of the Social and Family Affairs Administration, explained that central government subsidies can be divided into two types: general subsidies and project-based subsidies. Project-based subsidies are usually listed in each agency's budget. However, because of the changes to the Law on the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, project-based subsidies have now been moved into general subsidies. This is just a change in how the budget is organized, not a cut in funding.</p>
            <p>Zhou Dao-jun pointed out that plans like the "Childbirth Support Plan," which includes childcare allowances and daycare subsidies, are part of this change. Also, the amount of these subsidies changes a little each year because it depends on changes in the population. In recent years, the birth rate has decreased. So, besides moving the funds, the budget amount has also been adjusted down a bit.</p>
