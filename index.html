On Monday, shares of Palantir Technologies and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) rose sharply, leading a broad recovery in the tech sector. Investors largely ignored recent tensions in the Middle East after a top Iranian official indicated that Iran would not retaliate further against Israeli strikes.

This calming of geopolitical concerns allowed technology stocks, which are sensitive to market stability, to bounce back. Both Palantir, a company known for its data analytics software, and AMD, a semiconductor giant, saw significant gains. This rebound suggests that the marketâ€™s immediate worry about an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel has lessened.

The news about Iran's stance came after a period of heightened tensions that had caused jitters across global markets. The decision not to escalate further has provided a sense of relief, encouraging investors to re-enter the tech market.

**The $480 Million Scam Playbook: Chinese Microcap IPOs Are Bleeding U.S. Investors**

A growing number of American investors are falling victim to what appears to be a sophisticated fraud scheme involving small Chinese companies, such as Jayud Global Logistics and China Liberal Education. This scam is reportedly fueled by WhatsApp groups, Facebook advertisements, and a rapid succession of tiny initial public offerings (IPOs).

These companies, often referred to as microcaps due to their small market capitalization, are listing on U.S. exchanges, but their stock prices frequently plummet shortly after their IPOs. This pattern leaves American investors with significant losses. The scheme reportedly uses social media platforms to promote these stocks, drawing in unsuspecting individuals.

The playbook for this alleged fraud involves creating hype around these obscure Chinese companies, often with little to no real business activity or transparent financials. Once the stock is pumped up by artificial demand created through these promotional efforts, insiders allegedly sell their shares, causing the price to crash and leaving retail investors stranded. This highlights a concerning trend of manipulation within certain segments of the U.S. stock market that targets less experienced investors.

**Asian Value Stocks Priced Below Estimated Worth For June 2025**

As geopolitical tensions in the Middle East increase and trade discussions between the U.S. and China show some progress, Asian markets are experiencing a mixed set of outcomes. Despite these complexities, there are opportunities for investors to find "value stocks" â€” companies whose shares are trading below their estimated true worth.

Such stocks are often identified through careful financial analysis, looking at factors like earnings, assets, and growth potential compared to their current market price. The idea is that these companies are currently undervalued by the market and have the potential for price appreciation as their true worth becomes recognized.

Investors looking for these hidden gems in Asia are advised to focus on companies with strong fundamentals, a solid business model, and good management. While the broader market might be dealing with various global issues, specific companies can still offer attractive investment opportunities if they are trading at a discount. Identifying these undervalued assets requires thorough research to distinguish genuine value from potential risks in a fluctuating market.
