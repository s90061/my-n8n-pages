            <h1>Sanae Takaichi May Become Japan's "Iron Lady," Will Meet Trump in Tokyo Later This Month</h1>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi, who used to be Japan's Minister of Economic Security, won the election for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leader. Today, she became the first female leader of the LDP in its 70-year history. She might become Japan's first female prime minister in the middle of this month. The governments of Japan and the United States are discussing a visit by American President Donald Trump to Japan at the end of the month. It is possible that Takaichi, who some call Japan's "Iron Lady," will meet Trump in Tokyo.</p>
            <p>Takaichi's ideal leader is former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, known as the "Iron Lady." Takaichi has also said she admires former Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. The Japanese and American governments are talking about arranging for Trump to visit Japan at the end of the month for talks between the leaders of the two countries.</p>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi won the LDP leadership election today. She is expected to be named prime minister in a special meeting of the parliament on October 15th, making her the first female prime minister in Japan's history. If the discussions between Japan and the US go well, Trump would be the first foreign leader Takaichi meets after becoming prime minister.</p>
            <p>NHK, a Japanese TV channel, reported that sources from Japan and the US said Trump plans to visit the US Navy's Yokosuka Base in Kanagawa Prefecture on October 28th during his trip to Japan. This visit will show how important the alliance between Japan and the US is.</p>
            <p>Trump plans to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' meeting in South Korea, starting on October 31st. The Japanese and American governments are trying to arrange for Trump to visit Japan before he goes to South Korea. They are likely to arrange a three-day visit to Japan for Trump starting on October 27th.</p>
            <p>When Trump visited Japan in May 2019 during his first time as president, he also visited the US Navy's Yokosuka Base. He gave a speech on an amphibious assault ship that was docked there.</p>
            <p>Because China is increasing its activities in the ocean and due to the situation in North Korea, it is expected that Trump will visit the US Navy's Yokosuka Base again this time.</p>
            <p>Japanese media reported earlier that Trump wants to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his trip to South Korea for APEC. Because of this, Japan wants Trump to visit Japan before South Korea. Japan wants to agree with the US about how important their alliance is and discuss main plans for dealing with China and North Korea. Japan also hopes to make sure that Trump, who focuses on "America First," will pay more attention to East Asia.</p>

            <h1>Holiday Urgent Care Centers to Open in November; People with Mild Illnesses Can Save NT$600 by Not Going to Big Hospitals</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare plans to start a trial for holiday urgent care centers as early as November. People will pay NT$150, which is the same as at clinics and local hospitals. Local health authorities will decide the registration fee. These centers will first open in the six main cities, with at least two locations in each city. Guidelines for people seeking medical care are expected next week.</p>
            <p>Right now, the co-payment for emergency room visits is NT$150 at clinics and local hospitals. It is NT$400 at regional hospitals and NT$750 at large medical centers.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Taiwan's emergency rooms became very crowded, more than ever before. Many people and medical staff complained. The National Health Insurance Administration, under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, looked at Japan's system and will start "Urgent Care Centers" (UCC). These centers are mainly for people with mild illnesses, classified as level 4 or 5. They will be open from 8 AM to 12 AM on Sundays or long holidays.</p>
            <p>According to the Health Insurance Administration's plan, these centers will first be set up near big hospitals that have crowded emergency rooms. They want to guide people to these centers by offering lower co-payments and convenient locations. The centers will offer services in internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery, including simple wound stitches, X-rays, blood tests, and medicines.</p>
            <p>Liu Lin-yi, head of the Medical Administration Division at the Health Insurance Administration, spoke to the media today. He said that in the latest meeting, they agreed on the cost for people. It will generally be NT$150, like at local clinics and hospitals. The health authorities will work together to set the registration fee. In the same area, this fee will be the same and will not be too high.</p>
            <p>Also, the National Medical Association and the Emergency Medicine Association are writing guidelines for people seeking medical care. These guidelines are expected to be ready next week.</p>
            <p>Liu Lin-yi explained that doctors at UCCs will mainly be general practitioners. To ensure good medical care and a balance between work and rest, one doctor will not work all the day or night shifts during a long holiday. A doctor also cannot work a day shift and then a night shift on the same day. The Health Insurance Administration has asked the Emergency Medicine Association to give suggestions on current emergency room rules to set limits on work shifts.</p>
            <p>The Pharmacists' Association and the Laboratory Technicians' Association have both suggested medicines and equipment. Liu Lin-yi said that health authorities have been asked to check if chosen locations are suitable for medicines and equipment, and how far they are from crowded hospitals.</p>
            <p>Liu Lin-yi pointed out that they are trying to start the trial in all six major cities in November, with at least two locations in each city. For medical staff pay, doctors will get NT$15,000 for a day shift and NT$20,000 for a night shift. Pharmacists, nurses, and radiographers will get NT$4,000 for a day shift and NT$6,000 for a night shift. If a shift is during a long holiday of four days or more, staff will be paid double their usual amount. Medical centers can also ask for 30% more for their medical costs.</p>

            <h1>Soybeans Become New Focus in US-China Trade War; Analysis Says They Could Be a Bargaining Chip for Beijing</h1>
            <p>Because of the US-China trade war, China has not bought American soybeans since May this year. This has really hurt American farmers. Foreign news reports say that soybeans have become a new main issue in the US-China trade war. They might be the first thing discussed in the next round of talks. China could use soybeans to get the US to reduce limits on sending technology to China.</p>
            <p>China buys the most soybeans in the world. But because of the US-China trade war, China has not bought American soybeans since May. US President Trump recently said on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in four weeks, and soybeans will be the main topic to talk about.</p>
            <p>Trump had said before that he would meet Xi Jinping during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea at the end of October.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg reported on October 3rd that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other government officials said China is using soybeans to gain an advantage in wider trade talks. Earlier, the US and China agreed to a break in their tariff war, where the US lowered tariffs and made export rules less strict. This agreement will end in November. Trump had said that China was not buying American soybeans "only for reasons of negotiation."</p>
            <p>The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong reported on October 3rd, quoting James Downes, co-director of the Social Progress Research Centre in Italy. Downes said that Trump "has a strong reason" to make a soybean agreement with China.</p>
            <p>Downes explained that China's choice not to buy American soybeans has harmed American farmers. These farming communities in rural areas strongly support Trump in politics. However, during Trump's first term, buying farm products helped the US and China reach a full trade agreement. This time, because trade tensions between the US and China are worse, it seems difficult to reach a similar agreement soon.</p>
            <p>Downes also said that China has many strong points to use in talks with the US. It is expected that China will ask for real concessions from the US, such as greatly cutting tariffs.</p>
            <p>Economist Rajiv Biswas said that soybeans could also be a very strong card for China. China could use them to try to extend the tariff war pause, which ends on November 10th. China might also ask the US to make rules less strict for sending technology to Chinese companies and their branches around the world.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg's report said that even though China is now buying soybeans from Brazil and Argentina, this might have risks in the long term. Because there are fewer countries supplying soybeans, bad weather could cause prices to become very high.</p>
