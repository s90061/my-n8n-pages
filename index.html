            <h1>Low-Pressure Area Brings Heavy Rain to Hualien and Taitung</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau has given a special warning for heavy rain. A low-pressure area is causing strong, short bursts of rain. Today, Hualien County and Taitung County might have heavy rain or very heavy rain. Green Island, Orchid Island, and Hengchun Peninsula also have a chance of heavy rain.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau reminds people to be careful of lightning, strong winds, and rising river levels. Be careful of flooding in low-lying areas. Because it has been raining for many days, be careful of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides in mountain areas. Northern and northeastern parts of Taiwan might also get some heavy rain.</p>
