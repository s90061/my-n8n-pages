            <h1>Air France Cancels Flights Due to Concerns About Madagascar's Situation</h1>
            <p>Air France has announced today that it will stop all flights to Madagascar. This is because there might be a military takeover in the country. The flights will stop starting today and will not restart until at least October 14th.</p>
            <p>Air France released a statement. It said: "Because of the security situation there, Air France is stopping all flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. This is expected to continue until October 13, 2025."</p>
            <p>Today, the President's office in Madagascar said that there is "an attempt to take power illegally and by force" in the country. However, they did not give more details. Some soldiers joined protests yesterday. These protests started in September and were led by young people, also known as Generation Z.</p>
            <p>These protests were inspired by similar movements in Kenya and Nepal. They began because people did not have enough water and electricity. But then the protests grew bigger. People in Madagascar are asking for President Andry Rajoelina to leave his job. They also want him to say sorry for the violent actions against protesters. They are also asking for the Senate and the election committee to be closed.</p>
            <p>According to information from the United Nations, at least 22 people have died and 100 people have been hurt in the protests since September. The government in Madagascar does not agree with these numbers. President Rajoelina said this month that 12 people died.</p>

            <h1>Research: China's Rare Earth Controls Will Not Affect in Short Term, Observe Pre-execution Negotiations</h1>
            <p>Regarding China's new rules on rare earth exports, a research company called TrendForce said today that it will not cause problems in the short term. This is because companies that make raw materials and computer chips already have enough rare earth in stock. The company also said that we need to wait and see if there are more talks or changes before the rules start. This will tell us about how semiconductor products made with rare earth will be exported.</p>
            <p>On October 9th, China's government announced that it will control the export of rare earth materials and technology to other countries. At the same time, US President Trump said that new taxes of 100% will be added to goods from China starting in November.</p>
            <p>TrendForce explained that China's control over rare earth exports might affect how semiconductors are made. These new rules will start on December 1st. It's not a direct ban. Instead, companies will need to ask for permission to export. Also, advanced computer chips smaller than 14 nanometers will be checked one by one.</p>
            <p>TrendForce said there is still room for talks and changes regarding these controls. Also, rare earth is a raw material. It goes through many steps to become materials like targets or other mixes used in making semiconductors. Companies that make raw materials and computer chips have enough rare earth right now. So, the company thinks there will be no impact in the short term. We still need to see if there are more talks or changes before the rules start. This will show how semiconductor products made with rare earth will be exported.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Wingtech Starts Diplomatic Solution After Its Semiconductor Subsidiary Is Frozen by the Netherlands</h1>
            <p>Tonight, Wingtech Technology, a Chinese semiconductor company, made a statement. It was about the Netherlands freezing its control over its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia, for one year. The company said that the Dutch government stopped Nexperia's global operations because of "baseless national security" reasons. Wingtech stated that it will not give in to outside political pressure. It has started using all legal and diplomatic ways to ask the Dutch government to remove this "wrong order" right away.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology's statement also said that "some foreign managers" at Nexperia are trying to change Nexperia's ownership structure through legal steps. Their demands are "closely connected to the Dutch government's order."</p>
            <p>Jiemian News reported that Wingtech Technology said in its statement tonight that the Dutch government's decision to freeze Nexperia's global operations for "baseless national security" reasons is "too much interference based on geopolitical bias." It is not based on a real check of risks. This action strongly goes against what the European Union always supports: a market economy, fair competition, and international trade rules.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology also said in its statement that "some foreign managers" at Nexperia are trying to use legal steps to change Nexperia's ownership structure by force. Their demands are "closely connected to the Dutch government's order." The company believes this is really "taking away shareholder rights and overturning the company's legal management structure using political pressure." The company strongly criticizes these actions, which "claim to follow rules but are actually about taking power."</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology said that it will not give in to outside political pressure. It has started using all legal and diplomatic ways to ask the Dutch government to cancel the "wrong order" immediately. It also wants the Dutch government to stop treating Chinese companies unfairly and to protect open cooperation in the global semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology announced today that on September 30, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy issued a "Ministerial Order" to Nexperia. This order tells Nexperia and all its 30 global parts, including subsidiaries, branches, and offices, not to make any changes to their assets, intellectual property, business, or staff. This order is for one year.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in the Netherlands also decided something important. Wingtech Technology temporarily lost its shareholder rights (like management and voting rights) over 99 out of 100 shares of Nexperia. Wingtech only kept control of 1 share. This means Wingtech has temporarily lost control over Nexperia. Some reports say that Nexperia CEO Zhang Xuecheng's job and power were also paused because of this. However, Wingtech's right to Nexperia's profits is not affected.</p>
            <p>Chinese financial media quoted experts who said that the Netherlands' action might be because they are worried about semiconductor technology leaving the country. This is especially true since Nexperia is an important company in car semiconductors, and its technology is used in important infrastructure. In 2022, the UK also asked Wingtech Technology to give up its shares in a tech company it bought. The reason was national security.</p>
