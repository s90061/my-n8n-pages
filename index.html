Mexico's government has called former U.S. President Trump's threat of 30% tariffs on its goods "an unfair agreement." The U.S. informed Mexico that these tariffs would start on August 1st. Mexico's economic and foreign ministries stated they cannot accept this. Mexico exports 80% of its products to the U.S. Trump has used tariffs to pressure Mexico about illegal immigration and drug smuggling. Mexico is now trying to find ways to protect its businesses and jobs, hoping to be exempt from the tariffs.
