            <h1>US July CPI Stays at 2.7%; Core Inflation Reaches 5-Month High</h1>
            <p>On August 12, the US Department of Labor shared new information. It showed that consumer prices (CPI) in July went up by 2.7% compared to last year. This was a bit lower than experts thought. However, because President Trump's taxes on many goods are starting to affect the economy, core inflation reached its highest point in five months.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the US Department of Labor said today that the CPI for July increased by 2.7% compared to the same month last year. This is the same rate as in June. People are starting to question how accurate these numbers are. At the same time, officials from the Federal Reserve are looking at how the economy is reacting to the new taxes Trump put in place this year.</p>
            <p>Analysts paid close attention to this CPI report. They were looking for signs that the US economy was slowing down, especially after the July government report showed a weaker job market.</p>
            <p>The 2.7% increase in US CPI for July was a little less than the 2.8% that analysts expected. This was based on surveys by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
            <p>In July, prices for energy and gasoline went down. However, prices for housing went up.</p>
            <p>When you take out the prices of food and energy, which change a lot, the core CPI increased by 0.3% from June. This was faster than June's 0.2% increase. Trump's new taxes made imported goods more expensive, but grocery prices went down.</p>
            <p>Compared to last year, core inflation went up by 3.1%, which is also a larger increase than before.</p>
            <p>The CPI report showed that prices for healthcare, plane tickets, and home improvements all went up in July.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, high inflation makes things difficult for the Federal Reserve. After Trump announced new taxes in April, job growth in the US slowed down a lot in the spring. New job creation almost stopped, which made financial markets expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that if inflation gets worse, the Federal Reserve might not do anything. This has made Trump unhappy, as he wants interest rates to be lower and does not care about the Federal Reserve being independent.</p>

            <h1>North Korean Defectors Sending Money to Families Breaks Law, Causes Debate</h1>
            <p>A study found that about 40% of North Koreans who moved to South Korea (defectors) have sent money to their families back in North Korea in the past five years. They used people called brokers to do this. However, for the last two years, the South Korean government has been strictly checking this. This has caused a debate between following the law and helping people.</p>
            <p>The North Korean Human Rights Database (NKDB) asked 362 adult North Korean defectors between October 7 and November 6, 2024. The study found that 40.6% of them had sent money to their families in North Korea in the past five years. Out of these, 76.2% said their families asked for the money. The money sent back to North Korea was mostly used for daily living costs and medical bills.</p>
            <p>These defectors mostly sent money through Korean-Chinese people or other North Korean defectors living in South Korea. Sixty-one defectors who sent money in 2024 said they sent money about one to two times that year. Each time, they sent around 3.24 million Korean Won (about 70,000 New Taiwan Dollars). However, Joo Soo-yeon, a defector who was investigated by the South Korean government for being a broker, said that only about 40% of the money actually reaches the families it's meant for.</p>
            <p>Joo Soo-yeon started living in South Korea in 2010. She began by helping other defectors find their families in North Korea and slowly became a broker. Today, at a press conference for foreign media, she said that as the Chinese government has become stricter about North Korean defectors, more defectors have come to South Korea. Because of this, the amount of money sent from South Korea to North Korea has increased a lot.</p>
            <p>However, since 2023, the South Korean government has been strictly checking North Korean defectors sending money to North Korea. They are giving fines and other punishments for breaking laws like the Foreign Exchange Transaction Act. This has also caused the old broker system to break down. Joo Soo-yeon said that in the 15 months she has been under investigation, about 70% of the usual ways to send money have disappeared.</p>
            <p>Hwang In-hyeong, a lawyer who helps with these cases, said that current laws state only banks and registered businesses can exchange money or send it. But these defectors have no official ways to send money. They send money to North Koreans because they want to help, not to make a profit. So, there is still room to interpret the law differently.</p>
            <p>In fact, the Supreme Court of South Korea has ruled before that if there is no profit made, buying and selling foreign money or travel checks issued by foreign countries is not considered money exchange business.</p>
            <p>Hwang In-hyeong argued that North Korean defectors should not be punished for sending money to help people. She said that even if brokers in North Korea or China make money or take advantage of people, or if the money goes to North Korean officials, it might break national security rules. But the problem is not with the brokers in South Korea. It is because North Korea is a closed country, which makes its people isolated. This forces them to use North Korea's corrupt system just to help their families survive a little.</p>
            <p>What is even more unfair is that because the South Korean government is catching brokers, trusted brokers who have handled larger amounts of money for a long time are more likely to be caught. This means defectors now can only choose new ways to send money that have not been proven to be reliable. If this happens, it might be harder to know where the money goes, and the ability of North Korean people to survive might be at risk.</p>
            <p>Because the relationship between the two Koreas is tense, and because of punishments from the United Nations Security Council, North Korean defectors cannot easily help their families in North Korea through normal ways. So, they take risks. In the NKDB study, some defectors said they "will accept punishment and continue to send money." This shows how helpless they feel. There is still much to discuss about how to balance the law and helping people, and what solutions to find.</p>

            <h1>UK Aircraft Carrier Docks at US Base in Japan, Deepening UK-Japan Alliance</h1>
            <p>On August 12, the British Navy's newest aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, arrived at the US military base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. This is the second time a British aircraft carrier has docked in Yokosuka, with the first being HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2021. Before docking, British fighter jets landed on a Japanese warship for the first time. This shows that the "near alliance" between the UK and Japan is getting stronger.</p>
            <p>According to the Nikkei newspaper, HMS Prince of Wales docked at the US military's Yokosuka base this morning. The HMS Dauntless, a Type 45 air defense destroyer that is part of the carrier group, docked at the nearby Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Yokosuka base. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force held a welcome ceremony at their base.</p>
            <p>British Ambassador to Japan, Julia Longbottom, said at the ceremony that they "will improve how they work together and hope to quickly deal with different problems." She also mentioned that a Norwegian Navy ship joined the British carrier group. She said this "shows that cooperation among many countries in the Indo-Pacific region is becoming more important."</p>
            <p>After leaving Yokosuka, HMS Prince of Wales will stop at the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal (in Koto Ward, Tokyo). It is expected to leave Japan on September 2.</p>
            <p>The relationship between Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the British military has become stronger in recent years. In the 2010s, they signed an "Information Protection Agreement" to share secret information. After that, they signed an "Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement" (ACSA) to share military supplies like fuel. In 2023, the "Reciprocal Access Agreement" (RAA) became active. This agreement allows Japan and the UK to share military training and operations.</p>
            <p>The main reasons why Japan and the UK are working more closely on defense are that both Japan and Europe share similar security challenges. One important reason is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. North Korea is giving military support to Russia, and in return, Russia is helping North Korea with military technology. Also, both Japan and Europe are facing problems like China's growing military and too much steel production.</p>
            <p>For Japan, the UK was the first European country to work with Japan on defense. A new generation of fighter jets, expected to be ready in 2035, is being developed together by Japan, the UK, and Italy. These three countries hope that by developing and using these fighter jets, they can have long-term security cooperation.</p>
            <p>The report stated that this visit by the British carrier group to Japan is part of plans to strengthen UK-Japan cooperation. Before docking, British forces took part in a joint exercise with the Japan Self-Defense Forces in the Western Pacific. An F-35B stealth fighter landed on the Japanese destroyer "Kaga."</p>
            <p>The Kaga has a deck that allows F-35B stealth fighters to land and take off, acting like a small aircraft carrier. This helps improve Japan's ability to defend its distant islands.</p>
            <p>Before this, US fighter jets had landed on the Kaga. This time, it was the first time a British fighter jet landed on the Kaga. The British military showed this training on its social media account, X. They wanted to clearly show both at home and abroad that the cooperation between British and Japanese forces has become like a close alliance.</p>
            <p>The Japan Self-Defense Forces are also making stronger connections with other European militaries besides the British. The number of joint exercises carried out by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force with European NATO member countries was 18 in 2024, compared to 10 in 2023.</p>
            <p>Before, Japan mainly did joint exercises with its ally the US or with other Asian countries. Joint exercises with European countries were only with countries like France, which have land in the Pacific.</p>
            <p>In 2024, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force trained with navies from the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany, in addition to France. This year, joint training with European countries has become even more noticeable. In May, a Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer sailed together with British and Italian ships in the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force is also sending more ships to Europe. In August 2024, a training ship from the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force sailed to the Mediterranean Sea and trained with ships from Canada, Turkey, and Romania, which are part of NATO's standing forces.</p>
