<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E9%9F%93%E5%9C%8B%E7%91%9C%E7%8D%B2%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%A4%A7%E9%87%8F%E8%BE%B2%E7%94%A2%E8%A8%82%E5%96%AE%E6%98%AF-%E7%B6%93%E6%BF%9F%E7%B5%B1%E6%88%B0-%E8%98%87%E8%B2%9E%E6%98%8C-%E7%B8%BD%E9%AB%94%E7%9C%8B%E8%B5%B7%E4%BE%86%E5%B1%85%E5%BF%83%E5%8F%B5%E6%B8%AC-032831891.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan will combine two major exercises in July: the Han Kuang military exercise and the Urban Resilience exercise. In short, in times of crisis or war, when the military is focused on combat and unable to assist with major civilian disasters, local communities must be able to "save their own hometowns." National security officials stated that the goal for July is to inform the public that defense resilience is not solely the military's responsibility; every civilian partner, especially non-military departments, must also be involved. Officials noted that this year, by combining the Han Kuang and Urban Resilience exercises, they aim to link the military's response to enemy forces with non-military preparations.

During China's "Joint Combat Readiness Patrol," the Chinese tugboat "United Hai Gong 5001" circled Taiwan from June 18th to 22nd. Its intentions were unclear, raising questions from various sectors. The Coast Guard Administration stated that their radar monitored the vessel throughout its journey and Coast Guard ships broadcast warnings to drive it away, but no illegal activity was discovered. According to Taiwan ADIZ, the "United Hai Gong 5001" departed from the Jiulong River area in China on June 18th, sailing around the Penghu waters, then to southern Taiwan, and finally to the eastern waters off Hualien, circling the island.
