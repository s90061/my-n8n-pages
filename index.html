            <h1>Cultural Expo Indigenous Night: Paiwan Songs and Dances Meet New Zealand Dance Group</h1>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka, Kansai Expo" event is now happening in Osaka, Japan. Its goal is to show Taiwanese culture to the world. The Council of Indigenous Peoples is helping. This evening, a Paiwan performing group and a New Zealand dance group shared their cultures through songs and dances. They even greeted each other with the Maori nose press.</p>
            <p>This is the second weekend of the Cultural Expo. The "Indigenous Night" is a project between the Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Ministry of Culture. The Council of Indigenous Peoples is working with an international agreement called the "Indigenous Peoples Economic and Trade Cooperation Agreement" (IPETCA). Taiwan is one of the first members of this agreement. This evening, guests from New Zealand, Canada, and Australia, who are also members, came to the event.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze, Deputy Minister of Culture, said she was very happy about this cooperation. The Ministry of Culture has also been officially invited by the Expo to perform for three days, from August 26th to 28th, inside the Expo area. Nine groups will perform in five parts. They will show how Taiwanese people are thankful to nature and gods, and how much they love life.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze explained that indigenous culture is a very important part of these performances. The Ministry of Culture has invited Sangpuy, an indigenous singer from the Puyuma tribe in Taitung, and the Hope Children's Choir from the Paiwan tribe in Pingtung. They will sing "Blessings from Ancient Times: Dedicated to Heaven and Earth." This will let the world hear the beautiful voices of Taiwan's indigenous people. Also, in the "Magical Taiwan" exhibition, which features Taiwanese literature and picture books, readers can learn about the old and wise spiritual world of Taiwan's indigenous people.</p>
            <p>Chiu Huang Chao-chung, Director of the Indigenous Cultural Development Center, said that Taiwan's indigenous people have a very old history and culture. They are also closely connected to almost 400 million Austronesian people around the world. Experts believe Taiwan is where the Austronesian people first came from. He added, "Culture does not need translation. It can cross different languages and countries to connect people."</p>
            <p>The Kahurangi MƒÅori Dance Theatre from New Zealand also joined the event. This dance group works to show Maori performing arts in new ways. For example, this evening, 15 dancers performed an exciting show that mixed Maori songs, rap, and dance.</p>
            <p>The Nalwan Dance and Song Theatre sang a special Paiwan song that people sing when they are happy and together. This song celebrated everyone gathering in Osaka, Japan. They also sang a song called "Uniyu" to ask for good luck from above. Additionally, they performed a traditional dance called "Co-existence," which included a "Lady's Dance." They also did traditional warrior dances that copied clouded leopards and black bears jumping and running in the forest. This helped the audience feel the unique beauty and strong life of the Paiwan tribe.</p>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka, Kansai Expo" event will continue until August 20th. It is happening online and in various places in Osaka, Japan, including SPACE VS. (at GRAND GREEN OSAKA), Osaka Central Public Hall, and Nakanoshima.</p>

            <h1>Germany Establishes First National Security Council to Improve National Security Response</h1>
            <p>The German government announced today that it will create its first National Security Council (NSR) by the end of August. This council will work directly under the Chancellor's Office. Chancellor Friedrich Merz will lead it. The council's goal is to bring together security resources from different government departments. This will make the country better at reacting to security problems and planning strategies for national safety.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine is nearing its fourth year, and the security situation in Europe is still tense. The Chancellor's Office stated that Chancellor Merz sees the National Security Council as a crucial step. It will help to make former Chancellor Olaf Scholz's idea of a "turning point" (Zeitenwende), which he spoke about after the war started, a part of the government's daily work.</p>
            <p>The idea of having a National Security Council in Germany has been discussed for many decades but was never put into action. The main reason for this was a rule in the constitution called the "ministerial principle." This rule says that each government minister has a lot of power in their own area of work. This made it difficult for the Chancellor to get directly involved in what different departments were doing. In the past, the Federal Foreign Office was also against forming the National Security Council because they were worried it would make their job less important.</p>
            <p>However, this May, a new government led by the CDU party started. For the first time in many years, the Chancellor's Office and the Foreign Ministry are led by people from the same political party. This solved the old disagreement about who has power, and now the plan to create the National Security Council can finally happen.</p>
            <p>The first meeting of the National Security Council will be on August 27th at the Ministry of Defense building. This new council will take the place of the current Federal Security Council, which deals with selling military goods. It will also replace the security cabinet meetings that used to happen during big national security problems.</p>
            <p>The members of the National Security Council will include the Chancellor, the head of the Chancellor's Office, and ministers from several departments: Foreign Affairs, Defense, Interior, Finance, Economy, Justice, Economic Cooperation and Development, and Digital Affairs. If needed, officials from different German states, and representatives or experts from international security groups like NATO or the European Union, can also be invited to the meetings.</p>
            <p>The council's office will be inside the Chancellor's Office. Jacob Schrot, who is the head of Chancellor Merz's office, will lead it. The office will have 13 staff members. Their job is to make sure different government departments work together and to prepare for meetings.</p>
            <p>According to the Chancellor's Office, the main goal of the National Security Council is to stop "information silos." This means bringing together all the knowledge and information that different ministries and intelligence groups have. This way, decisions about national security will be made using all the available and up-to-date information. Also, the National Security Council will be responsible for identifying possible long-term security threats early on. It will create plans to deal with these threats and update the "National Security Strategy" that the previous government made.</p>
            <p>Another important job for the National Security Council is to make Germany's security system more professional. This includes building secure communication systems to prevent spying. It also means regularly practicing how to respond to major national security problems. For example, they will plan how different government departments and related groups should work together right away if a German passenger plane is hijacked.</p>
