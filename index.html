            <h1>Second Wave of Trump Tariffs Begins: India, Brazil, and Switzerland Face Very High Taxes</h1>
            <p>The government led by Donald Trump has started a second round of new taxes on goods. These taxes began at midnight on August 7th, Eastern US time. Many countries, like Taiwan, now have to pay new taxes between 10% and 41%. India will have to pay a very high tax of 50% by the end of this month. This is because India buys oil from Russia. For political reasons, Brazil also faces a 50% tax on some goods it sends to the US. Leaders from Switzerland went to Washington to talk, but they could not stop the 39% tax on their goods.</p>
            <p>On July 31st, the White House announced a new rule. This rule means that starting from August 7th, goods coming into the US from 69 countries and areas will have new taxes. These taxes will be from 10% to 41%. For example, Indonesia and Thailand will have a 19% tax, South Africa 30%, and Taiwan 20%.</p>
            <p>India keeps buying oil from Russia because its people need it. President Donald Trump signed a paper to add another 25% tax. This will make the tax go from 25% to 50%. This higher tax will start at the end of the month.</p>
            <p>The US is the biggest country that buys goods from India. A 25% tax on goods sent to the US has already made it very hard for businesses that need a lot of workers to make money. If India cannot make a deal before the new tax starts, it will badly hurt India's growing economy.</p>
            <p>Trump put a 50% tax on some goods from Brazil. This happened because his political friend, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, had legal problems. The current President of Brazil, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, believes that the two countries cannot talk about this anymore.</p>
            <p>The President of Switzerland, Karin Keller-Sutter, and other government officials went to Washington. But they could not change the high 39% tax. Companies in Switzerland that make expensive products and medicines are already feeling that their costs have gone up a lot.</p>
            <p>This week, Trump's economic helpers said they will make sure the current taxes are put into action. They are open to new ideas from other countries, but they will not discuss changing the tax rates very soon.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal newspaper wrote that Trump thinks these taxes are like a big earthquake that will change the world's economy. But for now, it's just small shakes.</p>
            <p>Trump has been president for more than six months. The new taxes, which are equal for both sides, have been in place for four months. Supermarkets and food stores in the US still have plenty of goods. The number of people without jobs and the rising prices have not gone up a lot. The government has collected hundreds of billions of dollars more in taxes. Also, in June, the amount of money the US spent on imports more than it earned from exports was 16% less than in May.</p>
            <p>Some experts on money believe that in the long run, even with high taxes, it will still be cheaper for companies to make things in other countries than in the US. So, making things might not come back to the US as people thought.</p>
            <p>Trump once said he wanted to use taxes on goods instead of income tax for people. But the US collects more than 2 trillion dollars each year from income tax and business tax. The money from taxes on goods is much less than this main tax money. Still, some members of the Republican party in government have suggested a law to give back 600 dollars in taxes.</p>

            <h1>US Imposes 50% Tariff, Brazilian Coffee Looks to China for New Opportunities</h1>
            <p>The United States has put a 50% tax on coffee from Brazil. This has made it hard for Brazil to sell its coffee to other countries. In recent years, people in China have started drinking much more coffee. But China still doesn't buy as much coffee as the US. However, China is now another choice for Brazil to sell its coffee.</p>
            <p>Today, a new tax rule from US President Donald Trump's government started. It puts a 50% tax on goods from Brazil. This new tax only affects about 36% of all the goods Brazil sells to the US. But it has a big effect on coffee, which is a very important product that Brazil sells to other countries.</p>
            <p>A Brazilian news website, g1, reported that people in China are drinking more coffee. In 2009, they drank 300,000 bags of coffee. Now, they drink 5.8 million bags. This makes China the 6th largest country to drink coffee in the world, after the EU, US, Brazil, Philippines, and Japan. This shows that coffee is getting popular quickly in China, a country famous for tea. Even though China could buy a lot of coffee, it is still not the main country that buys coffee from Brazil.</p>
            <p>Information from the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Council (CecafÃ©) shows that Brazil sold three times more coffee to China between 2022 and 2023. They sold 1.5 million bags. But in 2024, it went down to 988,000 bags. This means that the market in China is not yet steady, and the amount they buy changes a lot.</p>
            <p>But young people in China are becoming more and more interested in coffee. In big cities in China, coffee is becoming a popular and fashionable drink. This gives coffee brands from Brazil a chance to become famous and be successful early, especially with special, high-quality coffee.</p>
            <p>Because of the problems with the US taxes, companies in Brazil that sell goods are looking for new places to sell, like China. But they still want to talk with the US to make the taxes lower. This is because the US buys the most coffee from Brazil. In 2024, Brazil sold 8 million bags of coffee to the US, which was one-third of all the coffee sold in the US market.</p>
            <p>Starting from July 30th, China has said yes to 183 Brazilian companies that want to sell coffee to China for the next five years. Experts say that because the US taxes are now in place, China letting more Brazilian companies sell coffee helps the sellers. It stops them from having too much coffee that they cannot sell and also stops prices from falling a lot.</p>

            <h1>White House Official: Tariffs Fully Active, A Key Moment in Global Trade History</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States started putting new taxes on goods from many countries. These taxes are similar for both sides. Kevin Hassett, who leads the National Economic Council at the White House, said this is a very important time in the history of world trade. He also said that President Trump knows how to make good deals.</p>
            <p>Kevin Hassett, from the White House National Economic Council, spoke on Fox Business. He said that this is the most important time in the history of world trade. He explained that countries are now ready to open their markets to the US, so American farmers and small businesses can sell their products to other nations.</p>
            <p>He also said that countries agree to the US collecting taxes of 10%, 15%, or even more. He believes that over the next 10 years, this will bring in trillions of dollars in tax money from foreign countries and their companies, not from taxes on people inside the US.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hassett strongly said that Trump's new taxes are a huge success. He said that all these agreements were made between two countries, and countries will open their markets. People thought these things could not happen. But they happened without big trade fights or problems. He repeated that Trump knows how to make good deals.</p>
            <p>The Fox Business news channel reported that the US has not yet made deals with important trading partners like India, Canada, and Brazil. For these countries, the tax rates are 50% for India, 35% for Canada, and 50% for Brazil. High taxes on goods from China and Mexico have been stopped for now so that more talks can happen.</p>
