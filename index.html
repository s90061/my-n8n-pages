            <h1>Taiwanese Opera Troupe's "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall," Hsieh Wen-chi Challenges Herself with Two-Handed Calligraphy</h1>
            <p>The Taiwanè±«åŠ‡ (Yuju Opera) Troupe will present two special shows at the end of the year: "Please Lie to Me" and "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall." The main actors are Lin Wen-wei and Hsieh Wen-chi, who are third-generation Yuju Opera performers in Taiwan. Hsieh Wen-chi will even write Chinese characters with both hands at the same time during her performance, as the story needs it.</p>
            <p>Wang Hai-ling, the art director of the Taiwan Yuju Opera Troupe, said at a press conference today that the two shows are very different. "Please Lie to Me" is a funny, strange comedy. "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall" is about a smart woman arguing in court. These two plays show the many styles of the Taiwan Yuju Opera Troupe.</p>
            <p>Lin Wen-wei and Hsieh Wen-chi will play the main roles in these two plays. Wang Hai-ling said that they usually play smaller roles. This time, they will be the main actors. Older and more experienced performers from the troupe will also help them on stage. This shows how the Yuju Opera tradition is passed on and also made new.</p>
            <p>Wang Hai-ling explained that "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall" is a very strange and sad story. In the play, an older sister sacrifices herself to help her younger brother because her family is poor. She is sold into a bad house. Many years later, her brother becomes an official after taking an important test in the capital. By chance, he becomes the judge for his own sister. Wang Hai-ling said, "This play focuses a lot on singing and speaking. It also uses the beautiful singing style of Henan Qu Opera."</p>
            <p>Hsieh Wen-chi, who plays Chen Sanliang, will show her talent by writing special "plum blossom seal script" with both hands at the same time on stage. Hsieh Wen-chi said she needs to practice this a lot and will perform it live. This will be a very special part of the show.</p>
            <p>Lin Wen-wei said that in "Please Lie to Me," he plays Jin Deng-ke, who was very poor at first. But with his wife's plan, he accidentally becomes a "Golden Fortune Teller." "In the end, he is asked to go to the palace to find a national treasure. When he tells the truth to the emperor, the emperor does not believe him. It is both funny and makes you think."</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Yuju Opera Troupe's end-of-year performances for "Please Lie to Me" and "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall" will be on November 29th and 30th. They will be held at the Main Performance Hall of the Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Design Expo in Tianwei Kicks Off, Greenhouse Castle Shows Native Plants</h1>
            <p>The exciting parts of the "Tianwei Journey" section of the 2025 Taiwan Design Exhibition in Changhua County have been shown. The main area, called "Greenhouse Castle," uses four greenhouses together like a forest puzzle. It shows small versions of subtropical evergreen forests, fern forests, high-mountain pine and cypress trees, and coastal forests near the sea. This way, visitors can see many native plants.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Taiwan Design Exhibition will take place in Changhua County from October 10th to 26th. It has three main areas: the Changhua area, the Lugang area, and the Changnan area. Recently, some news reported that the main exhibition area in Changnan still had not started building the displays, even though the exhibition was coming soon.</p>
            <p>Today, the Changhua County Government explained that the area for the "Greenhouse Castle" in the "Tianwei Journey" exhibition had some delays. The county government and the Tianwei Township office worked together many times. The township office finished taking down the old buildings on September 11th and gave the land to the county government. After that, there were small delays because of leveling the ground and a typhoon. But the construction team officially started working on September 24th and is working hard. The exhibition planning team knows the progress well.</p>
            <p>The Changhua County Government said that the "Greenhouse Castle" in the Tianwei main exhibition area is made of four greenhouses linked together like a forest puzzle. It has special collections of subtropical evergreen broad-leaf forests, fern forests, high-mountain pine and cypress trees, and coastal forests from tidal zones. It brings the rich forest environments together like small models. This allows visitors in Tianwei to take a "green trip" across different types of nature.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Changhua County Government, the 2025 Taiwan Design Exhibition is called "Changhua Journey." It compares Changhua to a very old company with a long history. This "company" has 15 "branches," such as the Changhua Head Office, Champion Branch, and Dream Realization Branch. These branches show how industries in Changhua have grown at different times, how design works with many fields, and how shopping areas have changed.</p>
