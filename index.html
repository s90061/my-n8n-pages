            <h1>Taiwan's Friends Speak at UN: Taiwan's Role in World Affairs Is Practical, Not Taking Sides</h1>
            <p>The United Nations General Assembly finished its 80th meeting today. During the last two days, two of Taiwan's friends, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Lucia, asked the United Nations to let Taiwan join more world activities.</p>
            <p>Terrance Drew, the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, spoke on the fifth day of the meeting. He said that Taiwan can and should help United Nations groups, but it is not allowed. For example, Taiwan is kept out of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This makes it harder for the world to work together to solve problems.</p>
            <p>He added that Taiwan helping with public health, new technology, and emergency aid is not about choosing sides. It is about doing what is practical. When we stop working together on these things, the world faces risks that are too big to handle.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Drew also said that the Taiwan Strait is more than just a path on a map. It connects trade and supports people's lives. He asked for calm discussions and to use talking instead of fighting when there are strong disagreements. Working together, trading, and talking can protect the daily lives of regular people, whether in Taipei or in island countries like Saint Kitts and Nevis.</p>
            <p>On the last day of the meeting, Alva Baptiste, the Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia, also said that Saint Lucia wants Taiwan to be part of the United Nations system in a meaningful way. He clearly stated that a UN decision from 1971 (Resolution 2758) does not stop or remove Taiwan from being involved in the United Nations system.</p>
            <p>During the six-day meeting, leaders from countries like the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, and Palestine spoke about big world problems and trade.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's friendsâ€”Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Paraguay, Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Tuvalu, and Eswatiniâ€”asked the United Nations to accept Taiwan. They said that UN Resolution 2758 does not take away Taiwan's right to be part of the United Nations system.</p>

            <h1>North Korea Says It Will Never Give Up Nuclear Weapons at UN Meeting</h1>
            <p>Today, North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister, Kim Son-gyong, gave a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. He said that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons. However, he also said that North Korea is still open to talking to solve problems.</p>
            <p>Kim Son-gyong said that if people tell North Korea to get rid of its nuclear weapons, it means they are asking North Korea to give up its right to be a country and to live. He said this goes against their country's rules.</p>
            <p>He also stated, "We will never give up nuclear weapons. This is our country's law, policy, and right to be a country. It is also our right to live. We will not change this view under any conditions."</p>
            <p>Last week, North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un, said he would talk with the United States. He said he would do this if North Korea could keep its nuclear weapons. This was reported by North Korea's official news agency.</p>
            <p>North Korea did its first nuclear test in 2006. Since then, the United Nations Security Council has put many strict rules on North Korea. These rules are meant to stop North Korea from making more nuclear weapons and rockets that can carry them.</p>
            <p>Last week, the President of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, also spoke at the United Nations. He said he would work hard to end the growing tension between North and South Korea.</p>

            <h1>Madagascar President Ends Government After Protests Where 22 People Died</h1>
            <p>In Madagascar, the President, Andry Rajoelina, announced today that he is ending the government. This happened after many deadly protests because of ongoing problems with water and electricity cuts. The United Nations said that at least 22 people died and more than 100 people were hurt during these protests.</p>
            <p>President Rajoelina spoke on TV to the country. He said, "I have decided to remove the Prime Minister and the government. The current officials will be temporary ministers until a new government is created."</p>
            <p>Madagascar is an island country in the Indian Ocean, near Southeast Africa. The protests there have lasted for three days. They were started by young people, born between 1997 and the early 2010s, who were inspired by similar protests in Kenya and Nepal.</p>
            <p>These protests are the biggest ones Madagascar has seen in recent years. They are also the biggest challenge for President Rajoelina since he was chosen again as president in 2023.</p>
            <p>President Rajoelina also said in his speech, "If members of the government did not do their assigned jobs, we admit this and apologize."</p>
            <p>The United Nations human rights office said that the people who died or were hurt included protesters and innocent people who were shot by security forces. Also, some people were killed by others or by gangs during the widespread violence and stealing that happened after the protests.</p>
