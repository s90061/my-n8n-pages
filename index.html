Now, people do not have to worry about not getting a seat.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau reports that by May of this year, over 2.68 million Taiwanese tourists had visited Japan. As independent travel to Japan remains popular, the demand for Japanese railway tours is also growing.</p>

These routes include Kyushu sightseeing trains, Kyushu Odan Express, Narita Express, and selected JR Shinkansen lines. Also, choosing your preferred seat on these sightseeing trains is free.

            <h1>Many Bullying Cases in Schools; Minister Cheng Ying-yao Says Rules Will Be Stronger and Reviewed</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been reports of bullying and gender equality issues at several universities, including National Taiwan Normal University. Today, the Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said that he will make sure those responsible are strictly punished. He also said that the rules for handling such cases will be reviewed and improved.</p>
            <p>The case of the National Taiwan Normal University women's soccer team and blood tests has received a lot of attention. Changhua Normal University's counseling department has also had several reports of suspected sexual harassment and assault. At Taipei Ocean University, a teacher was accused of bullying a student with special needs. Today, Minister Cheng Ying-yao went to the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee. Before the meeting, he spoke to the media about the recent bullying and gender equality cases in schools.</p>
            <p>Minister Cheng repeated that "those responsible will be held strictly accountable." He added that the Ministry of Education will also review the rules for colleges, universities, and elementary and middle schools. They will check if the processes can be made better.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao also said that victims of these events, whether they have graduated or not, should receive mental health support and help from the education system and society. The Ministry of Education cares about students' right to education and must make sure it is protected. They will check that schools have systems for students to complain and report problems.</p>
            <p>Regarding the National Taiwan Normal University case, the Ministry of Education and the National Science and Technology Council are currently looking into 97 sports-related projects from 2022 to 2025 that involved blood samples. They will check these projects further. Cheng Ying-yao said they will look at how the schools' IRB (Institutional Review Board for human research) handles things and what harm it might cause to students.</p>
            <p>The media also asked how he felt about rumors of a government cabinet change. Cheng Ying-yao replied, "This is a hypothetical question, so it's not easy for me to answer." However, he then said that as a government official, he always hopes to "enter and leave gracefully" and "act with ease." He will keep this attitude.</p>

            <h1>India and US Relations Are Tense; Modi Will Visit China After 7 Years</h1>
            <p>People inside the Indian government said today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit China for the first time in seven years. This trip shows that diplomatic relations between India and China are getting better. This happens while relations between India and the United States are becoming more difficult.</p>
            <p>Sources in the government told Reuters that Modi will go to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, which starts on August 31. India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet given a comment.</p>
            <p>Modi's planned visit to China comes as India and the United States face their biggest problems in relations in many years. US President Trump has put the highest import taxes on India among Asian countries. He has also threatened to punish India further, in ways not yet specified, if it buys oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Modi will go to Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. This will be his first visit to China since June 2018. In 2020, India and China had a military fight at their border in the Himalayas. This made their relationship much worse.</p>
            <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization was started in 2001. It is a group for political, economic, and security cooperation across Europe and Asia. Its members include Russia, China, and countries in Central Asia. Later, India, Pakistan, Iran, and Belarus also joined.</p>
            <p>After Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met last October at the BRICS summit in Russia, the two countries are slowly trying to solve the problems that are stopping trade and tourism between them.</p>
            <p>Trump has already threatened to add an extra 10% tax on goods from BRICS countries, including India. He said this is because these countries "support policies against the United States."</p>
            <p>Trump's main helper, Steve Witkoff, is currently in Moscow. There are only two days left until the deadline Trump set for Russia to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine. If they do not, Russia will face new punishments.</p>
            <p>According to government sources who did not want to be named, India's National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, is also visiting Russia. This visit happens after Trump pressured India to stop buying oil from Russia. Doval is expected to talk about buying Russian oil.</p>
            <p>Doval will likely also discuss defense cooperation between India and Russia. This includes making the delivery of Russia's S400 air defense system to India faster. They might also discuss the chance of Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting India.</p>
            <p>India's Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, will also visit Russia in a few weeks.</p>
