        const text = `**AI Could Change Many Jobs, Says New Report**

A recent report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) might change about 40% of jobs worldwide. While AI could help businesses produce more and grow, the report also warns that it could make the gap between rich and poor bigger. Richer countries are more likely to be affected by this, as around 60% of jobs there could be impacted.

The IMF believes that AI could replace some tasks currently done by people, but it could also create new jobs or change existing ones. For example, AI might help workers be more efficient in their roles. However, the report stresses the importance of governments making sure the benefits of AI are shared fairly. They should provide support systems for people who lose their jobs due to AI and offer training for new skills. This would help prevent a large increase in inequality and ensure that everyone can benefit from these technological changes.

**More Companies Asking Staff Back to Office, But It's Not Easy**

Many companies are asking their employees to come back to the office after a long period of remote work. However, this "return to office" plan is not working well for everyone. While some leaders want to bring back old ways of working, many employees want to work from different places and value the flexibility they gained during the pandemic.

This desire for flexibility is causing problems for companies. When employers force staff to return, it can lead to more people leaving their jobs and employees feeling less happy or motivated. Some studies show that forcing a return to the office might not even make companies more productive. Experts suggest that a better approach might be a "hybrid" model, where employees work some days in the office and some days from home. This way, companies can find a balance that works for both the business and its staff, making it more likely that employees will stay and be productive.

**Popular Tourist Spots Struggle with Too Many Visitors**

More and more popular tourist destinations are facing a big problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many visitors arrive at a place, putting pressure on local resources and changing local ways of life. Cities like Venice and Barcelona, and even natural wonders, are struggling to deal with the large numbers of tourists, especially during peak seasons.

Overtourism can lead to crowded streets, higher prices for locals, and damage to historical sites or natural environments. It also raises a difficult question: who decides when there are too many visitors? There is no single answer, as the impact of tourism varies greatly from one place to another. Solutions often include controlling the number of visitors, promoting tourism in less crowded areas, encouraging longer stays, and managing things like cruise ships and short-term rentals. The aim is to find a balance between the money tourism brings and keeping local people happy and healthy.`;
