            <h1>Trump Threatens to Use 'Department of War' in Chicago, Hints at More Deportations</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump today said he would use his newly named "Department of War" in Chicago. This makes the situation more tense. He wants to send soldiers to cities led by the Democratic Party.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump is trying to do what he did in Washington D.C. This included sending the National Guard and more federal agents to arrest and send away immigrants. But people in the area strongly disagreed with this.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump posted on his social media site, "Truth Social." He wrote, "Chicago will soon know why this group is called the Department of War."</p>
            <p>The post also said, "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." It included a picture of Trump that looked like it was made by AI. Both these things referred to the 1979 movie "Apocalypse Now."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump signed an order to change the name of the Department of Defense to the "Department of War." He said this was to send a "message of victory" to the whole world.</p>
            <p>Chicago is in Illinois. The state's governor, JB Pritzker, is a Democrat. He was very angry about Trump's post.</p>
            <p>Pritzker wrote on social media platform X, "The U.S. President is threatening to declare war on American cities. This is not a joke, this is not normal."</p>
            <p>Besides Chicago, Trump has also said he would send soldiers to other cities led by Democrats, like Baltimore and New Orleans.</p>

            <h1>Salvadoran Immigrant in U.S. Worries About Being Sent to Uganda, Authorities Plan to Send Him to Eswatini</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sent a letter. It said that a man from El Salvador, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was worried he might be sent to Uganda. After this, ICE decided to send him to another African country, the Kingdom of Eswatini.</p>
            <p>Fox News had reported earlier about the letter ICE gave to Abrego Garcia's lawyers.</p>
            <p>The letter said that Abrego Garcia's worry about being harmed or tortured in Uganda "is hard to take seriously." This is because he (through his lawyers) had said he worried about being harmed or tortured in at least 22 different countries. The letter added, "...Even so, we are telling you now that your new country for deportation is the Kingdom of Eswatini."</p>
            <p>Today, a spokesperson for the Eswatini government told the Associated Press that they have not received any notice about Abrego Garcia being sent there.</p>
            <p>Abrego Garcia has lived in Maryland, USA, for over ten years. In March this year, he was wrongly sent to El Salvador. In June, he was sent back to the U.S.</p>
            <p>He was arrested again at the end of August when he reported to ICE. At that time, there were rumors he might be sent to Uganda.</p>
            <p>Abrego Garcia's case is a main part of the arguments about U.S. President Donald Trump's actions against immigrants. His case has started a big legal fight. It shows how far Trump's tough immigration rules might go.</p>

            <h1>U.S. Senator: Taiwan is Important to the U.S., Pacific Defense Line Will Break If China Takes It</h1>
            <p>U.S. Senator Roger Wicker, who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently visited Taiwan. After returning to the U.S., he said that Taiwan is very important for the U.S.'s safety and the world's economy. If China takes over Taiwan, the defense line in the Pacific that protects the U.S. from China's military will disappear. He also said again that he believes the U.S. and Taiwan will make more weapons together.</p>
            <p>Important U.S. lawmakers Roger Wicker and Senator Deb Fischer visited Taiwan at the end of August. This was Wicker's first time leading a group to Taiwan as the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was also the first visit by a head of this committee in nine years. When Wicker was in Taiwan, he said he thought the U.S. and Taiwan would make weapons together in the future.</p>
            <p>After Wicker came back to the U.S., he wrote about his trip to Taiwan in his latest weekly report on his official website. In the report, he stressed that Taiwan is strongly against China and that Taiwan is very important for the U.S.'s safety.</p>
            <p>Wicker said that Taiwan is "a country that is very important for U.S. safety and the global economy." The 23 million people in Taiwan, who love freedom, are facing growing threats from China. China's President Xi Jinping most wants to take this island, which is only about 90 miles from China's coast.</p>
            <p>He warned that if China takes over Taiwan, many Taiwanese people will die, and they will lose their freedom. Also, the world economy will suffer, and the defense line in the Pacific that protects the U.S. from China's military will break. His visit to Taiwan was part of a larger international effort "to help stop this terrible situation."</p>
            <p>During his visit, Wicker met with Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, and Defense Minister Wellington Koo. He told them that the U.S. Congress promises its long-time friendship with Taiwan. Wicker said that the people of Taiwan are determined to live freely. He called "their determination a lighthouse of hope for the world." He was happy to support Taiwan's right to decide its own future, saying, "This is a value that Americans care about."</p>
            <p>Also, Wicker visited Taiwan as the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During his trip to the Indo-Pacific region, he also visited Hawaii, Guam, Palau, and the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In his weekly report, he noted that during his trip, he visited many U.S. military bases in the Pacific area. Democratic countries in that area have spent a lot of money over the past decades to support U.S. soldiers stationed there. He said, "Our network of bases makes it harder for enemies to reach the U.S. west coast. It also keeps the countries where our troops are safe."</p>
            <p>Wicker believes that if China attacks Taiwan and the U.S. cannot protect Taiwan, these countries might be less happy to have U.S. troops. In the end, U.S. forces might have to move back to Hawaii or Guam. This would make the U.S. mainland more open to attack. He said, "A free Taiwan helps free countries in the Pacific feel safe. It also helps support U.S. defense forces stationed there."</p>
            <p>The U.S. Congress passed the "Taiwan Relations Act" in the late 1970s. This law includes that the U.S. agrees to help Taiwan get the defense supplies it needs to stay safe. Wicker said, "We should continue this tradition." He also said again that he is positive about the U.S. and Taiwan making more weapons together. He believes "this will help both countries' economies and also protect the idea of freedom."</p>
