**China Plans to Show Off New Equipment at Parade Marking 80th Anniversary of Japan's WWII Surrender**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-plans-show-off-equipment-061320143.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (AP) ‚Äî China plans to hold a military parade on September 3, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan‚Äôs World War II surrender. The parade will feature the People's Liberation Army's newest weaponry.

President and head of the military, Xi Jinping, will deliver a speech on the occasion, which will showcase ‚Äúnew-type combat capabilities,‚Äù including hypersonic weapons and various electronic gear, according to Wu Zeke, a senior officer of the PLA, the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs military wing.

The force is the world‚Äôs largest standing military with over 2 million members and an increasingly advanced arsenal of missiles, aircraft carriers, and fighter aircraft.

Military parades are a favorite of Xi‚Äôs, held primarily to mark the anniversary of the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic in 1949, Japan‚Äôs surrender, and the anniversary of the PLA's founding. These events feature relentlessly drilled marching units, armored columns, and aerial units.

Wu said the inclusion of the latest generation weaponry demonstrates the PLA‚Äôs ‚Äústrong ability to adapt to technological trends and evolving warfare, and to prevail in future wars," the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Japan launched an invasion of China in 1937, seizing much of eastern China. Most of the fighting against Japan was carried out by the Nationalists, who later withdrew to the island of Taiwan after being driven out of the mainland by the Communists.

Much of China's massive military upgrading has been aimed at conquering Taiwan, which China still considers part of its territory, as well as replacing the United States as the main military power in the Asia-Pacific.

**US House Unanimously Passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," Urges Trump to Back Taiwan in IMF; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Central News Agency) - The U.S. House of Representatives on June 23 unanimously passed by voice vote the "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," a bipartisan bill. This act instructs the U.S. to use its voice and vote to strongly support Taiwan's participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its involvement in economic oversight, technical assistance, and the eligibility of Taiwanese personnel to serve in the IMF. In response, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today, June 24, that this bill has positive implications for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan, and it will closely monitor the bill's further development.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which calls for the U.S. executive branch to assist Taiwan's participation in the IMF, was introduced and passed by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in March this year, and then passed by the full House on June 23 by voice vote. The bill was co-sponsored by Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Representative Al Green.

Congresswoman Kim stated that China continues to block Taiwan's participation in international forums like the IMF because it understands that financial security is as important as military security. China might try to disrupt Taiwan's financial system through measures such as increasing tariffs, shorting stock markets, or freezing bank transfers. Joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources to strengthen its financial resilience and resist China's economic coercion.

In response, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hsiao Kuang-wei said at a regular press conference this morning that the bill has positive significance for supporting Taiwan's broader international involvement and countering China's pressure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for unanimously passing this bill, which not only fully demonstrates the strong bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and expansion of its global presence, but also further highlights the importance of strengthening Taiwan's economic resilience and global partnerships.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it will closely monitor the bill's subsequent developments and will maintain close coordination and communication with its congressional friends and the executive branch in the U.S. to continuously build positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act, after its passage in the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, it must be passed by the U.S. Senate with identical wording and then sent to the White House for the President's signature to officially become law. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee already passed a similar bill in early June, awaiting a full Senate vote.
