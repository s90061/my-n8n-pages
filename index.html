            <h1>Before UN Summit, UK, Australia, and Canada Officially Recognize Palestine</h1>
            <p>London (Central News Agency) â€” A summit about the "two-state solution" for Israel and Palestine will soon happen at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Today, the UK, Australia, and Canada officially recognized Palestine. They did this despite objections from Israel and the US. Portugal is also expected to do the same later today.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer posted on social media platform X, "Today, the UK officially recognizes the State of Palestine. This is to bring back hope for peace for Palestinians and Israelis and to help achieve the two-state solution."</p>
            <p>Also, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement that Australia "officially recognizes an independent and sovereign State of Palestine."</p>
            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney also released a statement saying, "Canada recognizes the State of Palestine. We want to work together to make a peaceful future for both Palestine and Israel."</p>
            <p>Among the G7 countries, the UK and Canada are the first to recognize Palestine. France and other countries are also expected to recognize Palestine at the UN summit.</p>
            <p>However, Israel and the US do not support recognizing Palestine. They believe this action will make extremist groups stronger and reward Hamas, a Palestinian armed group.</p>
            <p>Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023. They killed over a thousand people and took Israelis as hostages. This started the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

            <h1>Sixth-Grader Liu Xin-yu Wins Two Titles in Yu Ba Cup National Badminton Competition, Playing Against Older Kids</h1>
            <p>Taipei (Central News Agency) â€” The 4th Yu Ba Cup National Badminton Championship is happening this year for the first time at the Taipei City Stadium. Nearly 2,000 players are taking part. Liu Xin-yu, a sixth-grader from Minquan Elementary School in Kaohsiung, "played above her level." She won two titles: the boys' singles in the sixth-grade group and the girls' singles in the junior high school group.</p>
            <p>Dai Tzu-ying, a famous Taiwanese badminton player and former world number one, also went to Minquan Elementary School in Kaohsiung. Because of this, Liu Xin-yu's great skills have earned her the nickname "Dai Tzu-ying's junior schoolmate."</p>
            <p>Liu Xin-yu, a sixth-grader, is shy and quiet off the court. But when she plays, she is very strong. She shows a maturity and calmness beyond her age. In this competition, she played in the boys' singles for sixth grade and also in the girls' singles for junior high school. She won both titles, becoming the star of the event.</p>
            <p>When asked about his daughter's daily training, Liu Xin-yu's father told the media, "We train for 5 days every week. This helps our child stay excited about badminton and also teaches her to aim high and keep getting better."</p>
            <p>Mr. Liu stressed that even though they train a lot each week, "our first goal is to protect our child from getting hurt. Only with good health can she go further."</p>
            <p>Since it started, the Yu Ba Cup has always worked to create a top competition for young badminton players. It encourages players from different areas and age groups to compete and grow together.</p>
            <p>The winners and second-place players from each group in this competition will be invited to a "Sheng Li Badminton for All Elementary School and Family Age Group Competition" in Taichung Chaoma Sports Center. This will give the young players another chance to compete and feel the atmosphere of different types of competitions.</p>

            <h1>Gong Ming-hsin Announces 4 Main Policy Goals, Estimates Over 60 Billion NTD Budget in 2 Years to Support Traditional Industries</h1>
            <p>Taipei (Central News Agency) â€” Minister of Economic Affairs Gong Ming-hsin explained his four main policy goals for the future. First, he wants to make energy and water supply more stable. Second, he wants to boost and support small and medium-sized businesses and traditional industries. He expects more than 60 billion New Taiwan Dollars to be used for this in the next two years. Third, he plans to develop special industries like defense. Fourth, he aims to make Taiwan an "economic country with no sunset" by helping the semiconductor industry spread globally.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin was interviewed on the TV show "Digital Taiwan," which aired tonight. When talking about future policy goals, Gong Ming-hsin said that the first goal is to make energy and water supply more stable. He explained that while the government cannot stop natural disasters, it can reduce their damage and help things recover quickly.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin stated that the second goal, helping small and medium-sized businesses and supporting traditional industries, is very important. He stressed that while semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) are definitely important, Taiwan's foundation is its traditional industries and small businesses.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin mentioned that the "Central Government Special Budget for Strengthening Economic, Social, and People's Livelihood National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations" has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. This budget includes 46 billion NTD to support industries. Additionally, in the yearly budget, the "Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Diversified Development Plan" for this year has about 10.9 billion NTD. Next year, it might also be over 10 billion NTD. In total, over 60 billion NTD will be used in the next two years to support traditional industries and small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin said he has told everyone that "money flow and orders must not stop." He wants to help traditional industries and small and medium-sized businesses as much as possible to improve their workers' skills and technology. He also wants all types of businesses to use AI to reduce the need for human workers in things like production and customer service. He hopes to train 200,000 AI professionals in two years.</p>
            <p>Regarding other future policy goals, Gong Ming-hsin said that the third goal involves industries that are special to Taiwan, like developing the defense industry. He will ask official groups to work together to do this well. He gave an example: drones can be used for both military and civilian purposes, giving Taiwan a big chance. Currently, the Ministry of National Defense plans to buy up to 100,000 drones. This gives Taiwanese companies a chance to gain experience. Once the supply chain is complete, they will be able to handle large international orders.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin said that the fourth goal is about semiconductors and AI. He will follow President Lai Ching-te's idea of "based in Taiwan, expanding globally, selling to the whole world." By helping the semiconductor industry grow worldwide, Taiwan will become an "economic country with no sunset."</p>
            <p>In addition, the host Hsieh Chin-ho asked how the Ministry of Economic Affairs would help TSMC invest in the US, since US President Trump is making things difficult for them. Gong Ming-hsin said directly that Taiwan is very advanced in semiconductors and other related industries, including TSMC. At this stage, and for the near future, there is no replacement for them. However, Taiwan needs to deal with many things it cannot control. For the things it can control, as long as it always stays ahead in advanced technology, there will be less worry. This is why the government wants to plan ahead for things like silicon photonics, quantum computing, and robots.</p>
