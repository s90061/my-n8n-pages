            <h1>Bao Green Tech Sees Growth in Food-Grade Recycled Containers; New Line Starts in November</h1>
            <p>Pan Yu-chun, the chief financial officer of Bao Green Tech-KY, said today that the company is looking beyond just recycling plastic bottles. They are also very positive about the market for food-grade recycled flat containers. A new production line that the company has built in Pinghu, Zhejiang, China, is expected to start working in November.</p>
            <p>Bao Green Tech explained that their special technology for recycling and cleaning flat containers (Trays) has overcome problems in washing these items. With their own cleaning line, they plan to make this technology available for sale.</p>
            <p>At a meeting for investors today, Pan Yu-chun shared that the company's line for making recycled plastic bottles can produce 20,000 tons each year, which goes to the American market. The new line for recycling and cleaning food-grade flat containers will also produce 20,000 tons each year. This will first serve the Chinese market. However, in the future, the company hopes to focus on selling its equipment in places like China, India, Southeast Asia, and also in Europe and America.</p>
            <p>Ou Yi-feng, the vice general manager of Zhejiang Bao Green Tech, said that while Europe and America already have equipment for recycling food-grade flat containers, Bao Green Tech's equipment is much more efficient. So, the new production line starting in November will be like a "showcase" line. Its main purpose is to let other companies that recycle see its good results and then buy equipment from Bao Green Tech.</p>
            <p>Also, Bao Green Tech sees good potential in the recycled plastic market in India. They have started a company there to produce locally, offer better service, and build a local supply chain. Bao Green Tech stated that the recycled plastic market in India is expected to grow to 5.277 billion US dollars by 2028, increasing by 5.6% each year.</p>
            <p>Bao Green Tech explained that the need for recycled plastic bottles is growing in India. Currently, India recycles 400,000 tons of plastic bottles per year. They plan to increase this to 750,000 tons by 2027 and to 1 to 1.2 million tons per year by 2030.</p>
            <p>Bao Green Tech reported that its total revenue for the first half of this year was 2.45 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is about 6.5% more than the same time last year. The company's earnings per share were 2.28 New Taiwan Dollars, which is about 15.7% more than last year.</p>
            <p>Regarding currency exchange rates, Pan Yu-chun noted that rates changed a lot in the second quarter. This affected the company's revenue. However, many payments and receipts were in the Chinese market. Even though the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger against the US Dollar in the second quarter, the Chinese Yuan stayed steady against the US Dollar. This helped balance things out, so the company did not lose money due to exchange rates; instead, they made money from it.</p>

            <h1>TSMC: US Government Will Remove Special Permission for Nanjing Factory; Company Is Evaluating Solutions</h1>
            <p>TSMC, a company that makes computer chips, announced today that it has received news from the US government. The special permission called "Validated End-User" (VEU) for its factory in Nanjing will end on December 31, 2025. TSMC is now looking at the situation and deciding what steps to take to make sure its operations in Nanjing are not affected.</p>
            <p>Recently, the US government announced that it would remove similar special permissions for Intel, Samsung, and SK Hynix for their factories in China. TSMC today confirmed that it also received this notice about its Nanjing factory's "Validated End-User" permission.</p>
            <p>TSMC stated that the company is currently looking at what this means and planning suitable actions. This includes talking with the US government to ensure that the Nanjing factory can continue its work without problems.</p>
            <p>In 2024, the US Department of Commerce gave TSMC (Nanjing) the "Certified End-User" permission. This official VEU permission replaced a temporary written permission that the Department of Commerce had given since October 2022.</p>
            <p>This VEU permission from the Commerce Department did not give new powers. It simply confirmed that TSMC (Nanjing) could continue to receive certain items and services related to US export control laws for a long time. This meant suppliers did not need to get separate licenses. The VEU helped TSMC (Nanjing) keep its current way of making semiconductors. However, with the VEU permission being removed, the future operations of TSMC (Nanjing) will become less certain.</p>

            <h1>The Person Who Inspired "The Devil Wears Prada" Passes On the Role; New Leader for US Vogue Announced</h1>
            <p>After many months of guesses, Anna Wintour, who used to be the main editor of the American fashion magazine "Vogue," has finally named her replacement. In June of this year, Wintour stepped down from her role. Today, she announced that Chloe Malle, who was the editor of the Vogue website, will now be the Editorial Director for US Vogue.</p>
            <p>According to CNN, Anna Wintour led US Vogue for almost 40 years. When she announced in June that she was leaving her editor-in-chief position, the important job was even advertised on LinkedIn, a website for finding jobs.</p>
            <p>Even though Wintour is no longer the main editor for US Vogue, she still holds big roles. She is the Global Editorial Director for all Vogue magazines around the world and the Chief Content Officer for the Conde Nast Group. In these roles, she oversees the editorial work for other magazines like GQ, Teen Vogue, and Vanity Fair.</p>
            <p>Chloe Malle, who is 39 years old, will now be in charge of the daily work of US Vogue across all its platforms, like the website and print magazine. She will report directly to Anna Wintour.</p>
            <p>The Vogue website also announced this new appointment today. In a related news story, Malle said, "Fashion and media are changing very quickly, and I am extremely excited and also deeply honored to be a part of this. I also feel very lucky that Anna (Wintour) is still here as my guide."</p>
            <p>Malle first started working at Vogue in 2011 as a social editor. She wrote articles about weddings, parties, and other light and fun topics.</p>
            <p>In 2016, she became a contributing editor, which means she wrote articles for the magazine. Since 2023, she has been the editor of the Vogue website, managing all the digital content. She has also interviewed famous people for cover stories, such as the model Gigi Hadid and Greta Gerwig, the director of the movie "Barbie."</p>
            <p>Besides managing the website's editorial direction, Malle also became a "voice" for Vogue in 2022. She co-hosts "The Run-Through with Vogue," which is currently the magazine's only podcast, with Chioma Nnadi, the Editorial Director of British Vogue.</p>
            <p>Malle also recently launched the second issue of "Dogue." This is a special digital-only magazine from Vogue that is made for the pets of famous people. In addition, she interviewed Lauren Sanchez, who is the wife of Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. This interview was for Vogue's June cover story, and it discussed their big wedding.</p>
