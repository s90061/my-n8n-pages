            <h1>Chinese Scientists Are Leaving the US, Statistics Expert Jun Liu Joins Tsinghua University Beijing</h1>
            <p>Reports say that because of things like tense relations between the US and China, many well-known Chinese scientists are leaving the US and returning to work in China. The two newest people are statistics expert Liu Jun and microbiologist Wang Leyao.</p>
            <p>A report from Beijing by Sing Tao Daily today said that because of tense US-China relations and the Trump government greatly cutting research money, Chinese scientists are going back to China. After Wang Leyao, a microbiologist from the US National Institutes of Health, the famous international statistician Liu Jun officially joined Tsinghua University Beijing full-time two days ago.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Tsinghua held a ceremony for him two days ago. People like Qiu Yong, the Party Secretary of the university, and Li Luming, the President, were there.</p>
            <p>According to the report, Liu Jun was a professor in the Statistics Department at Harvard University. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the American Statistical Association. He has done important work in areas like Bayesian inference, computational biology, and bioinformatics. He also won the "COPSS Presidents' Award," which is the highest honor in international statistics.</p>
            <p>He finished his math degree at Peking University in 1985 and got his PhD from the University of Chicago in 1991.</p>
            <p>Tsinghua President Li Luming said at the ceremony that he hopes Liu Jun will use his wide academic influence after joining Tsinghua. He hopes Liu Jun will take the chance of the fourth industrial revolution, led by artificial intelligence. This will help Tsinghua's statistics and data science departments improve and train more smart and new talents.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Shenzhen Medical Academy announced last week that Wang Leyao joined the academy full-time in July.</p>
            <p>Wang Leyao studied at Nankai University and got her PhD in microbiology from Fudan University. She did research after her PhD at Johns Hopkins University and Yale University in the US. Before this, she was an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts School of Public Health and Health Sciences and a climate and health scholar at the US National Institutes of Health.</p>
            <p>The report says that Wang Leyao's team works on human microbiology. They try to understand how microbes, hosts, and pathogens interact.</p>
            <p>The report also said that in recent years, many Chinese-American scientists have left the US and returned to China. This includes Chen Min, a math professor at Purdue University, Liu Chang, a nuclear physicist at Princeton University, Lin Huaxin, a math professor at the University of Oregon, and Zhan Hanyu, an optical researcher at Corning Inc.</p>
            <p>Also, Zhang Yitang, a top mathematician in the world, returned to China in June. He joined Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou full-time. It was said that Zhang Yitang mentioned that the reason he came back to China was because of how Chinese-American scientists have been treated in the US recently.</p>

            <h1>Xi Jinping: SCO's Responsibility to Maintain Regional Peace and Stability Increases</h1>
            <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit started yesterday in Tianjin. China's President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan held a dinner last night to welcome international guests. Xi Jinping said that there are now many more problems and uncertainties. Because of this, the SCO has an even bigger job to keep peace and stability in the region.</p>
            <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit took place in Tianjin from August 31st to September 1st. China's official TV news, CCTV News, reported yesterday that Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan held a dinner at the Meijiang Convention and Exhibition Center in Tianjin last night. They welcomed special international guests who came for the SCO summit.</p>
            <p>The report said that more than 20 foreign leaders, including heads of state and government, and their partners, were at the summit. These were from SCO member countries, observer countries, dialogue partner countries, and guest countries. Also, 10 leaders of international organizations, including the UN Secretary-General, were there.</p>
            <p>In his speech at the meeting, Xi Jinping said that since the SCO started, it has made trust stronger, worked more closely together, and taken part in international and regional issues. It has become an "important power to build new international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind." Now, the world is changing very fast. There are many more things that are not stable, not certain, and hard to predict. This means the SCO has an even bigger job to keep peace and stability in the region and help all countries grow and do well.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping also said that this summit has an important goal: to bring everyone's ideas together, make cooperation happen, and plan for the future. The SCO will surely do more and grow more. It will help member countries work together, bring together the power of the Global South, and help human civilization move forward.</p>
            <p>Cai Qi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, Wang Yi, Foreign Minister, Chen Min'er, Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the CPC, and Wang Xiaohong, Minister of Public Security, also attended the event.</p>
