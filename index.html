Taiwan's weather agency has issued a heavy rain warning. Strong storm clouds are forming, which means there will be heavy rain for short periods. Today, areas in the mountains of Pingtung County may have heavy rain or downpours. Also, areas south of Taichung and Changhua could experience heavy rain.

The weather agency also advises people to be careful of lightning and strong winds. In mountain areas, there is a risk of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. In low-lying areas, people should be careful of flooding.

**Trump Announces New Tariffs: Indonesia 32%, Bangladesh 35%, Thailand and Cambodia 36%**

US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on 14 countries today. According to his latest posts, Indonesia will face a 32% tariff. Thailand and Cambodia will both have a 36% tariff, and Bangladesh will have a 35% tariff. Overall, these new rates are either lower than or the same as the tariffs announced in April.

Trump also signed an order to extend the 90-day pause for these tariffs until August 1st. In April, Trump had announced a general 10% import tariff on most trading partners and even higher "Liberation Day" tariffs on some countries. He then paused these tariffs to allow for talks.

This afternoon, he started sharing the tariff notices he sent to other countries on his "Truth Social" platform. The countries include Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Laos, Myanmar, Indonesia, Thailand, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Serbia, Bosnia, and Tunisia. Laos and Myanmar have the highest tariffs at 40%.

Trump also announced a 35% tariff on Serbia and a 25% tariff on Tunisia today. In his letters to foreign leaders, Trump warned that if these countries raise their tariffs in response, the US will add the same percentage to the tariffs announced today.

He also said that if goods are sent through a third country to avoid higher tariffs, they will still be charged the higher rate. If companies choose to build factories or produce goods in the US, they will not have to pay these tariffs.

Taiwan is not on Trump's list of countries for tariffs yet. However, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC today that the US will make more trade announcements in the next 48 hours. He also said that these tariff notices are not necessarily the final decision.

Bessent stated, "This is just to say: 'Thank you for wanting to trade with the United States, we welcome you as a trading partner, and this is the tariff rate [on your products entering the US], unless you want to come back and negotiate again.'"

The 90-day pause for these tariffs was supposed to end on July 9th, but Trump signed an order today to extend it to August 1st, giving other countries more time to talk.
