            <h1>Germany Puts Former Lawmaker's Helper in Prison for Spying for China for 4 Years and 9 Months</h1>
            <p>A former helper to a German lawmaker has been put in prison for 4 years and 9 months. He was working as a spy for China. This case makes people worried about China's spying in Europe.</p>
            <p>According to French news, a court in Dresden said that a German man, Jian Guo, who is of Chinese origin, collected information for a Chinese spy agency. He did this while he was working for Maximilian Krah. Krah is an important politician from the far-right party called "Alternative for Germany" (AfD). At that time, Krah was a member of the European Parliament. Jian Guo collected documents and files from the European Parliament and information about the AfD between 2019 and 2024, when he worked for Krah in Brussels.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor wanted to put Jian Guo in prison for 7 and a half years. The prosecutor said that Jian Guo started working for Chinese spy agencies in 2002. His work included watching Chinese people in Europe who did not agree with the Chinese government.</p>
            <p>A Chinese woman, known only as Yaqi X., also helped Jian Guo. She was put in prison for 1 year and 9 months, but she will not have to serve the time now.</p>
            <p>Jian Guo was also accused of being the person who gave orders to Yaqi X. At the start of the trial, Yaqi X. said she gave Jian Guo information about flight times and cargo movements. She worked for a company that helped with logistics at Leipzig Airport. The prosecutor said that she gave information about military planes, soldiers, and drones, even equipment sent to Israel.</p>
            <p>Krah is now a member of the German Parliament. He said in court this month that he did not know Jian Guo was spying. He only hired him because he was good at languages and had experience with import and export companies.</p>
            <p>Krah himself is also being investigated. He is suspected of money laundering and taking bribes from China while he was a member of the European Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in Germany has not said anything to the media about this. In the past, China has said that claims of spying in Europe are not true.</p>

            <h1>Trump Suggests Gaza Peace Plan; Russia and China Show Support</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump has suggested a 20-point peace plan for Gaza. Both Russia and China have said they support this plan. This happened after Trump talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House about the situation in Gaza, and Israel agreed to the plan. This plan aims to stop the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>French news reported that Dmitry Peskov, who speaks for the Kremlin, told reporters during a daily phone conference that Russia "always supports and welcomes all of Donald Trump's efforts to end this ongoing sadness."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Of course, we hope that this plan can happen and help the situation in the Middle East become peaceful."</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular press conference, "China welcomes and supports all efforts that can help reduce the tension between Palestine and Israel."</p>
            <p>Also, Friedrich Merz, the German Chancellor, met with the families of people held by the Palestinian group Hamas today. He said that Trump's peace plan is the "best chance" to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the German Chancellor said in a statement that Merz said, "Israel's support for this plan is a big step forward. Now Hamas must also agree to it to make way for peace."</p>

            <h1>Hungary Blocks 12 Ukrainian News Outlets, Increasing Tension Between the Two Countries</h1>
            <p>The government of Hungary said on September 29 that it would limit the use of at least 12 Ukrainian news organizations in Hungary. On the first day of this rule, some of the blocked Ukrainian news could still be used in Hungary. This action is seen as Hungary's response to Ukraine blocking Hungarian news earlier. This has made the bad relationship between the two countries even worse.</p>
            <p>According to a report from "Ukrayinska Pravda," Gergely Gulyás, who is the head of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's office, said that Hungary has started a "response system" to block some Ukrainian news in Hungary. This is because Ukraine blocked Hungarian news.</p>
            <p>Gulyás wrote on social media, "It is necessary for an independent country to respond strongly to such an unfair attack."</p>
            <p>The news organizations that were blocked include TSN.ua, which is part of the "1+1" TV station and supports Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and is owned by a rich businessman. Other blocked organizations are "Ukrayinska Pravda," which supports Western democratic values, "European Pravda," which focuses on Ukraine joining the European Union, and Hromadske, which was started by independent journalists. In total, 12 news organizations were blocked.</p>
            <p>In mid-September this year, President Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine was blocking 8 Hungarian news organizations, including Origo.hu, which supports the Hungarian government. This was because Ukraine's security service said these Hungarian news organizations were spreading pro-Russia ideas. This caused problems between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Gulyás said that Ukraine blocked the Hungarian news organizations because these news organizations criticized the sanctions against Russia, sending military aid to Ukraine, and how the European Union and NATO handled things.</p>
            <p>In response to this, Heorhii Tykhyi, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that Ukraine blocked websites that spread pro-Russian ideas. He said that Hungary's actions take away Hungarian people's right to get true news.</p>
            <p>Also, recently, the two countries had a disagreement about drones crossing borders. On September 26, Zelenskyy said that Hungarian spy drones had entered Ukrainian airspace. But Hungary said this was not true and was fake news. On September 27, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that Ukraine had proof.</p>
            <p>On September 29, Orbán responded by saying that even if a few drones crossed the border, it was not a problem. He also said, "Ukraine is not a truly independent, sovereign country. We (Hungary) are always helping them, and they should not think they are sovereign."</p>
            <p>Hungary's position in the war between Russia and Ukraine is unclear. Orbán's government has voted against Ukraine joining the European Union many times at EU meetings. It also disagreed with the EU using frozen Russian money to help Ukraine. This means Ukraine faces problems from Hungary.</p>
