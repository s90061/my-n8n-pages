            <h1>Hualien Council Member's Idea to Give Everyone NT$50,000 Causes Talk; Hu Jen-shun Says It Was Irony</h1>
            <p>Hualien County Council member Hu Jen-shun from the Democratic Progressive Party suggested in February that every citizen in the county should get NT$50,000. This idea has recently been talked about a lot. Today, Hu Jen-shun explained that he made the suggestion to make fun of Kuomintang legislator Fu Kun-chi, who wanted to give NT$10,000 to everyone. So, he changed Fu Kun-chi's Facebook posts to create his proposal.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government replied yesterday about the NT$50,000 idea. They said that the central government has not yet met with local governments about changes to the law that decides how money is shared. Because of this, they don't know where the money would come from. Also, they said that any plan to spend money must follow a set order of importance and go through proper budget steps and legal rules. So, the council member's idea cannot be commented on at this time.</p>
            <p>Hu Jen-shun wrote on Facebook that the main reason for his proposal was that Fu Kun-chi forced through the idea of giving NT$10,000 to everyone in January. This would hurt financial discipline and the country's overall development. At that time, to make Fu's wife (Hualien County Magistrate Hsu Chen-wei) and everyone else understand how silly this idea was, he used irony to remind everyone. He never thought that a council proposal, which usually no one reads, would become very popular six months later.</p>
            <p>Hu Jen-shun said, "The proposal does look a bit strange; normally, proposals are not written this way." He explained that his assistant rewrote two of Fu Kun-chi's Facebook posts about giving NT$10,000 to people. This was done to share Fu Kun-chi's ideas.</p>
            <p>Hu Jen-shun stated that this suggestion is a proposal. For the NT$50,000 to be given out, first, the attempt to remove him from office (anti-recall) must fail. This would give Hualien an extra NT$16.1 billion each year. Also, County Magistrate Hsu Chen-wei would need to support giving NT$50,000 to everyone.</p>
            <p>Hu Jen-shun mentioned that now the goal of stopping the recall has been met. Will Hsu Chen-wei now help all people in Hualien? Last year, the Hualien County Government gave out NT$3,000 in shopping vouchers to help the economy. Xiulin Township and Shoufeng Township also have a history of giving out cash.</p>
            <p>Hu Jen-shun said that now, Fu Kun-chi and Hsu Chen-wei only say they want to use the NT$16.1 billion for help, not for building things. If the money is given to people, they can decide to use it for things like false teeth or school fees, and all shops in Hualien would benefit.</p>

            <h1>U12 Player from Japan, Toyama Taiki, Hits Home Runs with Both Left and Right Hands; Says He Decides Based on Pitcher's Throws</h1>
            <p>In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Toyama Taiki from Japan can hit with both his left and right hands. So far in the competition, he has hit one home run as a left-handed batter and one as a right-handed batter. In today's game against Korea, he also switched between hitting left and right. Even his coach openly said he wanted to know why. Toyama Taiki shared his secret: he decides based on the rhythm and the type of pitches the pitcher throws.</p>
            <p>Toyama Taiki, an infielder for the Japanese team in the U12 Baseball World Cup, has hit two home runs so far. In the first round, he hit a home run using his right hand against Taiwan. Yesterday, he hit a home run using his left hand against Mexico. In today's Super Round game against Korea, he kept switching between hitting right-handed and left-handed. Today, he had 3 chances to hit and got 1 hit.</p>
            <p>When asked why Toyama Taiki kept changing his hitting side, the Japanese team's coach, Hideaki Okubo, laughed and said, "I also really want to know." He thought it might be because the player was adjusting based on how he felt. The coach also said he didn't know if this was good or bad, so he just let the player do what he wanted.</p>
            <p>Toyama Taiki explained that he was struck out in his first turn at bat and felt he couldn't get the right timing, missing high pitches. In his second turn, the pitcher threw high pitches, so he switched to hitting left-handed. In his third turn, he faced a right-handed pitcher and felt he could control his timing well, so he switched back to hitting right-handed. He said he decides whether to hit right or left based on whether the pitcher's throws are high or low, and on how well he can time his swing.</p>
            <p>Toyama Taiki shared that he started as a right-handed hitter. But his father also hits with both hands. Plus, he runs fast. If he practiced hitting left-handed, he could get more hits that stay in the infield. That's why he started practicing hitting with both hands. He once took part in a 400-meter relay race in track and field, running the last part, and his team finished 3rd in the country.</p>
