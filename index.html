            <h1>China Encourages Spending with Loan Subsidies</h1>
            <p>The Chinese government has announced a new plan to help people spend more money. The Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and the financial regulator said today that they will offer money back on the interest people pay for personal loans. This money back can be up to 3,000 Chinese Yuan (about 14,100 New Taiwan Dollars). Experts say this plan is meant to make people buy more big items.</p>
            <p>The plan, called "Personal Consumption Loan Financial Subsidy Policy," will run from September 1, 2025, to August 31, 2026. If people use loans for certain types of spending, they can get this interest money back.</p>
            <p>The plan covers small purchases under 50,000 Yuan. It also covers larger purchases over 50,000 Yuan in important areas like buying cars, paying for elderly care, education, travel, home decoration, electronic goods, and health care. For purchases over 50,000 Yuan, the subsidy is based on up to 50,000 Yuan of the loan amount.</p>
            <p>The subsidy is 1% of the loan interest each year. The central government will pay 90% of this money, and local governments will pay 10%.</p>
            <p>Each person can get a total of 3,000 Yuan back on their loans from one bank. This means they can spend up to 300,000 Yuan in total and get a subsidy. For small loans under 50,000 Yuan, the total money back is limited to 1,000 Yuan, for a total spending of 100,000 Yuan.</p>
            <p>Experts explained the new policy. Wu Chaoming, a chief economist, said that giving money directly back on loan interest will make it cheaper for people to buy big things and improve their lives. This will help people spend more.</p>
            <p>Luo Zhiheng, another chief economist, believes that these financial subsidies are a good way for the government's money to encourage more spending. Simple government payments do not help as much as giving money back on interest, which can make a bigger amount of money move in the economy. This makes the government's money more effective.</p>
            <p>The official document lists specific areas for purchases over 50,000 Yuan that can get the subsidy. These include buying cars, car insurance and repairs, childcare, home renovations, home appliances, mobile phones, computers, teeth straightening, eye correction, and many other things.</p>

            <h1>EU Leaders Support Ukraine Before Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>Leaders from 26 countries in the European Union (EU) made a statement today. They said that Ukraine must be free to decide its own future. They also stated that any plan to end the war must protect the interests of Ukraine and Europe.</p>
            <p>According to news agencies, the statement said, "We, the EU leaders, are happy that President Trump is working to end Russia's war against Ukraine and to bring fairness, lasting peace, and safety to Ukraine."</p>
            <p>The statement continued, "A fair and lasting peace that brings stability and safety must follow international law. This includes principles like independence, countries having power over their own land, not breaking up countries, and not changing international borders by force."</p>
            <p>This statement was agreed upon last night and announced today. All EU leaders supported it, except for Hungary's leader.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders are expected to talk with Mr. Trump tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on August 15 in Alaska, USA. Mr. Trump called this a "test meeting" to find out what Mr. Putin thinks about ending the war.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zelenskyy has said he will not give up any land that Russia has taken. Mr. Trump, however, said that Mr. Zelenskyy's position makes him worried. Mr. Trump still believes that some land must be exchanged. But Mr. Trump also said he would tell Mr. Putin, "You must end the war."</p>

            <h1>Google and IBM Race to Build Quantum Computers</h1>
            <p>Since the 1980s, people have dreamed of building a working quantum computer. This dream belongs to experts in advanced physics and computer science. After many years, it now seems possible that this dream could come true.</p>
            <p>According to the Financial Times, quantum computers could solve problems that today's computers cannot. These problems are in areas like understanding new materials and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Recently, there have been many new discoveries in technology. This shows that the biggest tech companies are trying hard to be the first to turn their lab experiments into real, large-scale quantum computers.</p>
            <p>IBM, a large American computer company, announced its newest plan for quantum computers in June. They fixed important missing parts in their older designs. IBM is now the latest company to say it hopes to release a large-scale quantum computer by the year 2030.</p>
            <p>Jay Gambetta, who leads IBM's quantum project, said, "It no longer feels like just a dream. I truly feel that we have found the secret code and can build this machine before 2030."</p>
            <p>This makes the competition harder for Google, a big internet search company. Google solved one of the biggest problems in making quantum computers at the end of last year. Google also says it plans to build a quantum computer for industrial use by 2030.</p>
            <p>Julian Kelly, who leads the hardware part of Google's Quantum AI project, said, "All the remaining engineering and science problems can definitely be solved."</p>
            <p>However, even though these companies have solved some of the hardest science problems, they still face many difficult engineering challenges to make quantum computers ready for widespread use. These challenges might sound normal but are still hard to overcome.</p>
            <p>Oskar Painter, who leads quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services (AWS), said that the current problems "do not seem as hard technically as the basic physics, but we should not forget how much engineering work is needed to make them ready for industry." He thinks it will take another 15 to 30 years to have useful quantum computers.</p>
            <p>To reach "industrial scale" means making a computer system with less than 200 "qubits" (quantum bits) grow to 1 million qubits or more. One of the biggest difficulties is that qubits are naturally unstable. They can only stay in their special quantum state for a very short time, and they can only do useful calculations in this state. As more qubits are added, there is more "noise" or errors.</p>
            <p>Both IBM and Google say their systems will use a method called "error correction." This method will allow the qubits to have some small flaws.</p>
            <p>Right now, only Google has shown a quantum chip that can fix errors as it gets bigger. According to Mr. Kelly, any company that tries to make their system bigger without doing this first will only get "a very expensive machine that makes noise, uses a lot of power, and takes a lot of people's time and engineering work, but does nothing helpful."</p>
            <p>Other companies have not yet caught up to Google, but they are still trying to make their quantum computers bigger. IBM says that while they are focusing on their main challengeâ€”showing that their system can work at a very large sizeâ€”they also question if Google's error correction method can be used for very large systems.</p>
            <p>Governments are also becoming more interested in who will win this race. For example, the US military's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a big study last year of different quantum companies. They want to find out who can reach a useful size first.</p>
