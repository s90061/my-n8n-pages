A White House official said that President Trump has the power to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. This is because of concerns about how Powell is managing a very expensive building project at the Federal Reserve. The project is costing much more than planned.

Kevin Hassett, who might take Powell's place, stated that if there is a good reason, Trump can fire Powell. He highlighted that the building project is the most expensive one in Washington D.C.'s history.

Chairman Powell believes the Federal Reserve should be separate from politics and not change interest rates for political reasons. However, President Trump has often criticized the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates to help the economy grow.
