US President Donald Trump announced today that he will put a 30% tax on goods from the European Union and Mexico starting August 1. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, said this will hurt important trade between the two areas and cause problems for businesses, customers, and patients.

However, she also said that the EU still wants to reach a trade agreement with the US before August 1. She added that the EU will do whatever is needed to protect its interests, including taking action in return if necessary. Trump sent letters to the leaders of Mexico and the EU about these new taxes. He mentioned that the US might change the tariffs if the EU removes its trade barriers. He also said that if Mexico or the EU raise their tariffs on US goods, the US will add the same amount to their tariffs.

**Recall Supporters and Opponents Clash in Taichung; Large Rallies Compete**

The first vote to recall a legislator will happen on July 26. Today, groups supporting and opposing the recall held big events in Taichung. The recall supporters called on people to bravely show their support and make a miracle happen. On the other side, the KMT party held a rally against the recall, with important figures like Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu and Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen speaking.

At the "Anti-Communist, Protect Taiwan General Mobilization" event, people shouted "Big Recall, Big Success." Speakers said that the recall is about fixing the parliament and helping Taiwan. They asked people to volunteer and vote. Former United Microelectronics Corp. Chairman Robert Tsao also spoke, saying that some legislators are weakening Taiwan's defense and making Taiwan more like Hong Kong. He urged people to vote "yes" to the recall to protect Taiwan.

At the "Anti-Bad Recall, Boost Economy" event organized by the KMT, speakers included Han Kuo-yu and Lu Shiow-yen. Han Kuo-yu talked about how important it is to listen to the people. Lu Shiow-yen said that during the recent floods in the south, the main job of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party should be to help with disaster relief, not to focus on recalls. She stressed that the President should stand with disaster victims and work on the economy and peace.

**Firefighters Die in Xindian Rescue; Weige Foundation to Help Families with Education**

Two firefighters died when their boat overturned during a rescue mission in Xindian, New Taipei City. To help the families of the two deceased firefighters, the Weige Culture and Education Public Welfare Foundation has promised to give NT$40,000 (about US$1,230) each month to help their children with their education.

The accident happened on July 8 at the Cukeng Dam in Xindian, when people went into a forbidden area for paddleboarding and one person drowned. The fire department sent a boat to rescue them, but it overturned. This resulted in the deaths of 37-year-old firefighter Wu En-shuo and 36-year-old firefighter Chang Ching-chien. A 34-year-old volunteer firefighter is still in intensive care.

Li Chuan-hung, the chairman of the Weige Foundation, visited the New Taipei City Fire Department to offer his condolences and gave NT$300,000 (about US$9,200) to each family. He also promised to provide NT$40,000 per month for Wu En-shuo's two children until they finish university. The Fire Department thanked the foundation for its help, saying it supports the families and boosts the morale of all firefighters. Li Chuan-hung believes it is important to support the families of those who serve the country, so that others will also be willing to contribute to society.
