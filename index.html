            <h1>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Expectations Rise, European Stocks Close Higher</h1>
            <p>London (CNA) - Europe's main stock markets closed higher today. This happened because new information about inflation in the United States, released yesterday, showed stable prices. This made investors believe that the U.S. central bank (Federal Reserve) will lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 17.42 points, or 0.19%, ending the day at 9165.23 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt rose by 160.81 points, or 0.67%, to reach 24185.59 points.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Star Kenshin Kamimura Found Guilty of Assaulting Hong Kong Female Translator, Fined Nearly NT$60,000</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong (CNA) - Kenshin Kamimura, a 26-year-old former member of a Japanese idol group, has been found guilty. In March, he was at a party in Hong Kong after an event. He was accused of touching a female translator's leg. Today, a judge in Hong Kong's West Kowloon Court said he was guilty of indecent assault. He has to pay a fine of 15,000 Hong Kong dollars, which is about 57,200 New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Kenshin Kamimura used to be in the boy band ONE Nâ€™ONLY. He became very popular because of his role in the BL drama "Minors." His career was doing very well. But in early March, after he went to Hong Kong with another actor from the show, Junsei Motoshima, for their first international fan meeting, news came out that he was arrested for assaulting a female translator in a restaurant.</p>
            <p>His management company then announced that they ended his contract and removed him from the group. They said he "seriously broke his contract." His Instagram account was also deleted, and all his future events were cancelled. This surprised his fans.</p>
            <p>Before today's court session, many fans waited for several hours in line to enter and watch.</p>
            <p>According to reports from AFP, Ming Pao, and Hong Kong 01, Kamimura was accused of touching the female translator's leg many times. He did not listen when she said no. He also asked her to go to the toilet with him.</p>
            <p>Judge Yu Chun-heung decided that Kamimura had a bad intention. He also said that Kamimura's actions clearly showed he did not respect women.</p>
            <p>When Kamimura learned that he only had to pay a fine and not go to prison, he hugged the male court interpreter. Some fans cried when they heard that Kamimura was found guilty.</p>

            <p>Taipei (CNA) - Typhoon Yangliu is moving away. The weather agency says that Yangliu has become weaker. At 11 PM, it became a light typhoon. The main island of Taiwan is now out of the storm's danger area. The land warning is now only for Penghu and Kinmen. Especially for Kinmen, there might still be strong winds and rain until early tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Administration, at 11 PM today, Typhoon Yangliu was at 23.7 degrees North latitude and 118.0 degrees East longitude. This is about 90 kilometers southwest of Kinmen. It is moving northwest at a speed of 30 to 33 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The weather agency said that Yangliu has become weaker in the last 3 hours. Its center is now near the sea southwest of Kinmen. It will continue to move northwest. The main island of Taiwan is now out of its storm circle. But it still threatens Penghu and Kinmen, where winds and rain are continuing. The typhoon is expected to get weaker and its storm circle will get smaller.</p>
            <p>Forecaster Chu Mei-lin said in a press conference that Yangliu is moving northwest quickly. It is expected to land in China late tonight. It will also get weaker. Taiwan's main island is now out of the storm's circle. The land warning is only for Penghu and Kinmen. Kinmen should especially watch out for strong winds and rain from tonight until early tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin also said that the wind in eastern Taiwan is from the south-southeast. So, Hualien and Taitung will still have a lot of rain until tomorrow morning. The cloud systems on the east and south sides of Yangliu are strong. So, the southwest coast and Penghu will still have rain on and off.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin noted that after tomorrow morning, the rain will become less, and the weather will get better. Most places will be cloudy to sunny. Western Taiwan should watch out for thunderstorms in the afternoon, especially in the central mountains where there might be heavy rain. Eastern Taiwan will have rain on and off.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin said that the weather will be quite stable until August 17th. Starting from the evening of August 16th, there will be more rain due to moisture from the south. On August 19th and 20th, the weather will return to being cloudy to sunny.</p>
