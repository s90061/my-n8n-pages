            <h1>Trump and Putin Meet: Red Carpet and Military Planes Seen</h1>
            <p>The presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, and Russia, Vladimir Putin, met today in Alaska. They might decide if the war between Russia and Ukraine can stop. When they walked on the red carpet, American military planes flew loudly above them.</p>
            <p>Reuters and The New York Times reported that before the meeting, Trump shook hands and smiled with Putin. They walked on a red carpet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. During this time, several American military planes, like a B2 stealth bomber, flew in a group over them.</p>
            <p>This was the first time these two leaders met since 2019. They sat with their teams for media photos and did not speak. Behind them, there was a blue sign that said "Pursuing Peace."</p>
            <p>BBC News said that in the private meeting, talks happened in a "three-on-three" way. This means each president from Russia and Ukraine had two helpers with them.</p>
            <p>With President Trump were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff.</p>
            <p>With President Putin were Russian official Yury Ushakov, who advises on foreign policy, and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.</p>
            <p>A European official told CNN that it was "a relief" that Trump and Putin did not meet alone anymore. This official said it was "perhaps a good step forward."</p>
            <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that in bigger talks later, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles would also join.</p>
