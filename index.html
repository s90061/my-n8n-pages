            <h1>Trump to Meet Zelenskyy; White House Confirms Meeting on August 19, Taiwan Time</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and several European leaders will meet with U.S. President Trump in Washington D.C. today. The White House said that Trump will talk with Zelenskyy at 1:15 PM local time (1:15 AM on August 19, Taiwan time). After that, he will meet with all the European leaders.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that leaders from the UK, Germany, France, Italy, and Finland, along with the NATO Secretary General, want to support Volodymyr Zelenskyy during this important time in the Russia-Ukraine war. They also want to stop any arguments like the one Donald Trump and Zelenskyy had in February in the Oval Office from happening again.</p>
            <p>The White House stated that Trump will first meet Zelenskyy in the Oval Office at 1:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time (1:15 AM on August 19, Taiwan time). Then, at 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time (3:00 AM on August 19, Taiwan time), he will meet all European leaders in the White House East Room.</p>
            <p>On August 15, after welcoming Russian President Vladimir Putin at the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska, Trump said that an agreement should be made to end the war that has lasted for three and a half years.</p>
            <p>However, Zelenskyy has almost said no to Putin's ideas from the U.S.-Russia summit. These ideas included asking Ukraine to give up the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine. Ukraine still controls one-fourth of this area, but Russian forces control the rest.</p>
            <p>After arriving in Washington D.C. late yesterday, Zelenskyy wrote on the Telegram app: "I thank the U.S. President for his invitation. We all hope for a quick and sure end to this war. Russia must stop the war it started. I hope our combined strength with the U.S. and our European friends will help Russia make real peace."</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan City Forms Low-Carbon Transport Alliance to Become a Leading City</h1>
            <p>Taoyuan City started a "Low-Carbon Transport Alliance" today to encourage the use of vehicles that produce less carbon. The city will work with private companies to slowly improve rules, make technology better, promote eco-friendly ways, and offer help to buy vehicles. This will create a complete system to make Taoyuan a top low-carbon city in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, Taoyuan City's Environmental Protection Department held a press conference for the "Low-Carbon Transport Alliance" at the Guishan Diesel Vehicle Emissions Testing Station. Many electric car makers and transport companies came together to show electric vehicles and charging equipment. This showed how they are changing to low-carbon transport.</p>
            <p>Su Jun-bin, the Deputy Mayor of Taoyuan City, told reporters that Taoyuan has an international airport and is close to Taipei Port, making it a main logistics center for Taiwan. Because of this, making transport low-carbon is very important for Taoyuan. The city government brought together the Environmental Protection Department, the Transportation Department, and the Economic Development Department. They also asked government bodies, electric vehicle companies, and transport companies to help form the alliance. They will work together to improve rules, make technology better, promote eco-friendly ways, and offer help to buy vehicles. This will build a full set of policies for low-carbon transport in Taoyuan.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsin-chieh, the business manager for Taoyuan Bus, said that Taoyuan Bus has replaced 85 diesel buses with electric ones this year. They plan to buy 90 more next year. They hope that by next year, 35% of their buses will be electric. From a driver's point of view, electric buses are easier to control than old diesel buses. They also have many more safety features, both active and passive, than diesel buses.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that by 2030, the city plans to help replace 100 large trucks and 229 small trucks. This is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 38,000 tons each year. The "Low-Carbon Transport Alliance" also connects electric car makers with transport companies to offer special deals. This helps companies lower the cost of buying new vehicles and change faster. In the future, the city will continue to look at what industries need. They will use many plans to make low-carbon transport grow in Taoyuan and create a leading low-carbon city in Taiwan.</p>
