Typhoon DANAAS hit southern Taiwan, causing more than 820,000 homes to lose electricity. A team of power company workers from Hualien went to Chiayi to help fix the power lines in areas like Xingang and Zhongyang. Many trees had fallen, and high-voltage lines were broken.

The team worked until late at night. They successfully brought power back at 11:40 PM yesterday. While they were working, it was one of the worker's birthdays. After finishing the repairs, his colleagues prepared a simple cake and candles. They celebrated his birthday in the dark under the night sky.

The birthday worker wished for everyone to be safe at work and to return to Hualien soon to rest. The power company said that for their workers, fixing the electricity quickly is their most important job. This birthday celebration was more special than any gift.

**Zuckerberg Takes Top Apple Expert, Meta Builds Strong AI Team**

Mark Zuckerberg, the head of Meta, has hired a very important AI expert, Ruoming Pang, from Apple. This move is part of Meta's plan to create a top team for its new "Meta Superintelligence Labs." It is a big challenge for Apple, which is also trying to make its own AI products better.

Sources say that Ruoming Pang, who used to lead Apple's main AI model team, will get a lot of money from Meta. Mr. Zuckerberg is spending a lot to get the best people for Meta's new AI department. This makes the competition for AI talent very strong. Last week, he announced that 11 experts from companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic will join the new lab. Some of these experts will earn up to 100 million US dollars.

The new Meta Superintelligence Labs will be led by Alexandr Wang, who used to be the CEO of Scale AI. Ruoming Pang, from Shanghai, studied computer science at Princeton University. At Apple, he managed a team of about 100 people who made the important language models for Apple Intelligence and other AI features on devices. This change is considered one of the biggest losses for Apple's AI team. It shows how much companies are competing for AI experts. Meta offers much higher salaries than Apple for similar jobs.
