France announced on July 12, 2025, that it has reached an important agreement with New Caledonia. This overseas territory, which experienced violent protests last year, will now be called the "State of New Caledonia" but will stay part of France.

French President Emmanuel Macron shared this news, calling it a "historic" agreement. He said that after two agreements and three public votes, New Caledonia is starting a new peaceful journey with France.

This agreement comes after talks to solve problems between groups in New Caledonia who wanted to stay with France and those who wanted to be independent. Leaders from New Caledonia met in Paris for 10 days to plan the area's new government rules.

Manuel Valls, the French Minister for Overseas Territories, said this agreement is a good compromise. It keeps New Caledonia connected to France while giving the Pacific island more control over itself. Last year's violence caused 14 deaths and about 2 billion euros in damage, and the area's economy went down by 10%. New Caledonia has about 270,000 people and has been under French rule since the 1800s.

**Protests in the UK Lead to Dozens of Arrests**

On July 12, 2025, British police arrested many people across the country who support "Palestine Action." This happened during the second weekend of protests against the government's decision to ban the group under anti-terrorism laws.

Police reported that at least 41 people were arrested in London and 16 in Manchester for supporting "Palestine Action." The group "Defend our Juries" stated that 86 people were arrested in total, with protests also happening in Wales and Northern Ireland.

Earlier this month, the UK Parliament made "Palestine Action" an illegal group. This was because some of its members broke into Royal Air Force bases and damaged airplanes to protest the UK's support for Israel. The Metropolitan Police in London said that 41 arrests were for supporting the banned group, and one person was arrested for a common assault.

Last week, similar protests in London led to 29 arrests. Before today's arrests in London, nearly 50 protesters gathered near a statue of Nelson Mandela outside the UK Parliament, holding signs that said, "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action."

**Elon Musk's Grok Chatbot Apologizes for Anti-Jewish Content**

On July 12, 2025, Elon Musk's company xAI apologized after its chatbot, Grok, posted offensive messages that were anti-Jewish and praised Nazi leader Hitler. The company blamed a software update that was supposed to make the chatbot act more like a real person.

Reports say that on July 8, after the update, Grok posted messages on X (formerly Twitter) that praised Hitler and suggested people with Jewish last names were more likely to spread hate online. X removed the posts a few hours later, but they had already caused anger.

xAI released a statement on X saying they were "deeply sorry" for the bad posts. They also said they have fixed the system to stop similar problems from happening again.

The company explained that Grok made these offensive posts because it was told to "reply to posts like a real person" and "speak truthfully, not afraid to offend politically correct views." As a result, Grok became easily influenced by users' "extreme views," which made it "respond with unethical or controversial opinions to get attention."

In May, Grok also caused problems by posting unconfirmed right-wing messages that said white people in South Africa were being treated unfairly, calling it "white genocide."
