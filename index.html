            <p>Acbel Polytech, a company that makes power supplies, announced changes to its top management today. Mr. Lu Yi-hsing, who became the general manager in February this year, has resigned. The chairman, Mr. Hsu Chieh-li, will now also be the general manager, starting today.</p>
            <p>Acbel sent out a press release. It said that Mr. Hsu Chieh-li will return to the role of general manager right away. He will lead the team to make strategies happen and grow the business. This change is to make better use of the company's resources and to improve plans for its energy business.

This will help the company grow steadily in the next stage.</p>
            <p>Acbel explained that Mr. Hsu Chieh-li also became the chairman of Kinpo Group this year. He is now the chairman of three companies: Acbel, Kinpo, and Cal-Comp.

This will help the group combine its resources faster and build a strong base for the company's future growth.</p>

            <h1>New Financial Equalization Act to Be Slightly Adjusted; Lu Hsiu-yen: Central Government Should Be Partners with Local Governments</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen said today that the central government, the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament), and local governments should work together as partners. This is because all tax money comes from the people, and everyone should take good care of them. This was her response after Premier Cho Jung-tai recently said that the new Financial Equalization Act would have some small changes.</p>
            <p>On August 30, Premier Cho Jung-tai said that the new law for sharing money between the government levels had some small math errors. So, there will be some small changes. He said the money would not be split equally among all, but there would be some differences. He also said he would invite city and county mayors to the Executive Yuan or visit them. The goal is to openly work together on money matters between the central and local governments.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen was at a ceremony today for a bridge rebuilding project in Dongshi District, Taichung. When talking to reporters, she said that the Legislative Yuan has changed the Financial Equalization Act. This change should give more money to Taiwan's 22 cities and counties. She hopes that the Executive Yuan will really follow this change and give the money quickly. She asked them not to make excuses and delay, so that local governments can solve their urgent money problems.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu pointed out that Taichung, for example, sent NT$250 billion in taxes to the central government in 2024. But the central government only sent back more than NT$90 billion, which is less than NT$100 billion. This is only about 40% of what they sent. She said this situation is similar for almost all 22 cities and counties in Taiwan. Because of this, many cities and counties have big money shortages. If they do not borrow money, they might have to sell land to get the funds they need.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu also mentioned that the central government has changed how it gives different kinds of money to local areas. This includes not just the shared tax money, but also general grants. Recently, the Executive Yuan sent a letter to cities and counties. It said that the money approved last year for local governments would not be given, and it would be reduced. General grants were supposed to be given fairly using a formula. However, the central government now says local governments must ask for the money themselves, and the Executive Yuan will decide. Mayor Lu thinks this is unfair.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said she hopes the central government will continue to give general grants to local areas using the old formula, which has been used for many years. She does not want it to be like the Forward-looking Infrastructure Program, where the central government decides who gets the money. She is worried that this could lead to decisions based on "political favoritism."</p>
            <p>She said she hopes the central government will understand the message from the public's votes on July 26 and August 23. She wants them to change for the better and quickly become good partners with the Legislative Yuan and all local city and county governments. She hopes the central government will take good care of the people and local governments, because all tax money comes from every person in every local area.</p>
