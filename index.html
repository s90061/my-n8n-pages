The US House of Representatives has approved a big bill from the Senate. This bill includes large tax cuts and plans for government spending. The vote was 218 for and 214 against. Now, the bill will go to President Trump for him to sign it into law. He wants to sign it before July 4th, which is a special holiday in the US.

The Senate had already passed this bill on July 1st, with a close vote of 51 for and 50 against. President Trump calls it the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

President Trump said recently that this bill would help Americans with lower taxes, safer borders, and a stronger military. He believes it will make the US economy grow very fast.

However, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) says that the Senate's changes to the bill will add $3.3 trillion to the national debt. It will also reduce health insurance for many people. The CBO estimates that from 2025 to 2034, the bill will make the US deficit almost $3.3 trillion larger. This is nearly $1 trillion more than the version the House first made.

**Djokovic Wins 99th Match at Wimbledon, Defending Champion Krejcikova Also Advances**

The Wimbledon tennis tournament continued with its second round today. Novak Djokovic, a famous player from Serbia, easily won his match against Dan Evans from the UK. He is now in the third round of the men's competition. In the women's competition, Barbora Krejcikova, who won last year, had a difficult match against Caroline Dolehide from the US but managed to win after playing three sets.

Some high-ranked players have already lost early in Wimbledon this year. But Djokovic, at 38 years old, won his match quickly, in just under two hours. He was happy to hear it was his 99th win at Wimbledon. He said he still loves playing and that Wimbledon is very special to him.

Djokovic won his 24th Grand Slam title at the US Open in 2023, matching a record held by Margaret Court. Even though he lost the last two Wimbledon finals to Carlos Alcaraz, Djokovic feels that Wimbledon is still his best chance to win his 25th major title.

In the women's matches, Krejcikova, the 17th seed, won her tough match against Dolehide. She lost the second set but then played very well in the third set to secure the win. She also had a difficult three-set match in her first round.
