            <h1>Parties in Legislature Agree: Local Subsidies to Be Paid Immediately After Extra Budget Passes</h1>
            <p>This evening, different political parties in the Legislature met to discuss an extra budget for the central government. Fu Kun-chi, the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) party group, suggested a rule. He said that after the extra budget is passed, general subsidies should be given to local governments right away. Leaders from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) group, who usually argue, all signed and agreed today.</p>
            <p>Today, the Finance Committee of the Legislature held a joint meeting. They looked at the central government's extra budget for the year 2025. In the first round, they cut over 1.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars. At 8 PM, the President of the Legislature, Han Kuo-yu, called a meeting for all parties to discuss proposals from the committee and party groups.</p>
            <p>First, the parties talked about an extra 429.06 million dollars for media promotion. The KMT and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) wanted to cut all of it. However, DPP legislator Chung Chia-pin said that 102.28 million dollars of this money was for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for international promotion. This included National Day events and New Year's Eve fireworks. He hoped they could cut 50 million dollars from this.</p>
            <p>Even though officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained how the money would be used, KMT legislator Wang Hung-wei still had doubts. She questioned if it would be used for foreign media. Because they could not agree, Legislature President Han Kuo-yu decided to put it aside for now. He will call another meeting tomorrow after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs provides details about working with foreign media or channels.</p>
            <p>Then, Fu Kun-chi, the KMT party leader, changed the topic. He said they were discussing the extra budget today mainly because the government wrongly cut 63.6 billion dollars from general subsidies. Later, they also added other items, totaling 87.8 billion dollars. He said that after the big recall elections ended, parties should work together for the country. But the government still hinted that it would not give back the general subsidies, and might even make people apply for them. He asked, "Do we need to make things so difficult?"</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi also showed a written agreement. He said only Ker Chien-ming knew about working together, and Ker Chien-ming had already signed it. But other party leaders had not signed yet. If the DPP still held cities and counties hostage, the KMT party group would never stop fighting the government.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, the TPP party leader, used a story to explain. He compared the Premier to someone who kidnaps children and asks for money. He said they would pay the money to save the children, but it did not mean they would not make the kidnapper responsible in law and politics.</p>
            <p>Wu Sze-yao, the DPP party secretary, said that the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics has rules for how they work. She said they hoped the words in the agreement could be made more exact. She also told Fu Kun-chi that the DPP did not disagree. She said, "This accusation is too big; we cannot accept it." She hoped that the discussion would not become tense because of the general subsidies.</p>
            <p>After a short break, leaders from all party groups signed the agreement one by one. Fu Kun-chi said that even though Ker Chien-ming was willing to sign the agreement, he was worried that Ker Chien-ming might be recalled tomorrow, which would make the agreement invalid. So, he asked all three main leaders to sign to be sure. In the end, all party group leaders signed the agreement about general subsidies for local governments.</p>
            <p>The agreement stated that when President Lai Ching-te was the mayor of Tainan, he said that the central government should not keep all power and money. The Executive Yuan should not wrongly change the rules. Even though the total amount of money for local governments would not change, the Executive Yuan tried to decide how much each city and county government would get. It even wanted to change the general subsidies next year to a system where people have to apply for them. This goes against what Lai Ching-te said when he was mayor of Tainan.</p>
            <p>The agreement said that because of this, the general subsidies for local governments in the 2025 extra budget should not be less than last year's budget. The Executive Yuan should immediately give the extra general subsidies to local governments after the extra budget is passed. This is to avoid slowing down government work.</p>
            <p>Also, for the parts of the extra budget managed by the Executive Yuan, after many talks between parties, Han Kuo-yu decided to keep 2.368 billion New Taiwan Dollars and 400 million New Taiwan Dollars for compensation for not cutting trees. For the parts that were cut, the TPP's suggestions were all accepted. The KMT's suggestions to cut 1.879 million dollars for special expenses, 25.568 million dollars for joint service operations, and 1.5 billion dollars for the Central Election Commission were also included.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Hopes Parliament Supports Special Law to Make Science Parks' Power Supply Stronger</h1>
            <p>The government recently put 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars into a special law for "resilience." This money is to make the power supply in science parks and other industrial areas stronger. Taipower said this evening that because of changes like US tariff rules, they will work on making the power supply for important industrial areas like science parks more stable. They hope the Parliament will support this special law and the budget to make the power system stronger.</p>
            <p>The government set aside 10.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars for Taipower in a special law for "disaster recovery." This money is for fixing and rebuilding after typhoons, to make important power lines along the coast stronger. Another 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars was set aside in a special law for "economic, social, and national security resilience." This is to make sure the science and industrial parks in the north, middle, and south of Taiwan have stable power. It will also improve the power equipment needed in these parks. All these budgets are currently being checked by the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Taipower sent out a press release this evening. They said that to have a stable power supply, you need enough power sources and also the right power grid system. To deal with changes around the world, industries want to make sure their power supply is stable. So, the government changed the "Special Act on Strengthening Economic, Social, and National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations." They added a part about making the power system stronger. This will make the power supply in science and industrial parks more resilient and ensure these industries have stable power.</p>
            <p>Taipower stressed that having stable power should be something everyone agrees on. This budget is very important for stable power in all parks across Taiwan, including the Taipei Neihu Technology Park. They hope everyone and the Parliament will support this government budget. This will help Taipower continue to build a strong power system.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that to deal with changes in international situations, such as US tariff policies, they plan to make the "power transmission grid's quality and reliability" better to ensure industries have reliable power. They will focus on important industrial areas like science parks to make their overall power supply more resilient.</p>
            <p>Also, this includes projects like "improving the resilience of transmission and distribution lines against disasters." This means moving power lines in areas not affected by disasters. It also includes "improving transmission and distribution repair" and other projects. The total cost for these is about 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Taipower emphasized that in 2022, to stop big power outages from happening again and to get ready for zero carbon emissions, they planned the "Power Grid Resilience Construction Project." They plan to spend over 500 billion New Taiwan Dollars in 10 years. The goal is to spread out the power system, make it stronger, and protect it better. This will completely upgrade the current power grid.</p>
            <p>Taipower explained that the main goal is to strengthen the country's high-voltage power grid. They want to gradually make the power grid more spread out and make equipment more stable. This will improve how strong the power grid is and build a distributed power grid. This budget is set by Taipower itself. Its goals and work are different from the special laws mentioned earlier.</p>
            <p>Taipower said they will work faster to make the power grid stronger and more resilient. This will ensure stable power supply and help with the shift to zero carbon emissions. However, all these projects need money. Taipower has taken on 600 billion New Taiwan Dollars in extra electricity costs in the last three years because of the war between Russia and Ukraine. To continue building a strong power system and make the power grid healthy, they hope everyone will support the related budgets.</p>
