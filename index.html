            <h1>China Boosts Spending with Personal Consumer Loan Subsidies</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Finance, People's Bank, and Financial Regulatory Administration announced a new plan today. This plan offers a subsidy for personal consumer loans, up to 3000 Chinese Yuan (about 14,100 New Taiwan Dollars). Experts say this is to encourage people to buy more big items.</p>
            <p>On August 12, the three agencies released the "Personal Consumer Loan Financial Interest Subsidy Policy Plan." It says that from September 1 this year to August 31, 2026, people who use personal consumer loans for actual purchases can get the subsidy.</p>
            <p>The plan covers loans for single purchases under 50,000 Yuan. It also covers loans over 50,000 Yuan for important things like cars, elderly care, having babies, education, travel, home decor, electronics, and health care. For purchases over 50,000 Yuan, the subsidy is based on up to 50,000 Yuan of the loan.</p>
            <p>The subsidy rate is 1% per year. The central government will pay 90% of the subsidy money, and the provincial governments will pay 10%.</p>
            <p>Each person can get a total subsidy of up to 3000 Yuan from one bank. This means they can get subsidies for a total of 300,000 Yuan in purchases. For single purchases under 50,000 Yuan, the total subsidy limit from one bank is 1000 Yuan, for a total of 100,000 Yuan in eligible purchases.</p>
            <p>Jiemian News on August 12 quoted experts about this policy. Wu Chaoming, chief economist at Caixin Financial Holdings, said that giving money directly to lower loan interest will make it easier for people to buy expensive goods and improve their lives. This will help people spend more.</p>
            <p>Luo Zhiheng, chief economist and head of research at Yuekai Securities, believes that the interest subsidy helps the government's money work better. Simple government payments have a small effect. But using interest subsidies can bring in more money and use government funds more effectively.</p>
            <p>The official document says that important areas for single purchases over 50,000 Yuan that qualify for the personal consumer loan financial subsidy include buying cars, car insurance and repairs, childcare, home renovations, home appliances, mobile phones, computers, teeth straightening, vision correction, and other things.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin to Meet; EU Leaders Support Ukraine's Independence</h1>
            <p>Leaders from 26 countries in the European Union (EU) said today that Ukraine must be free to decide its own future. They also said that any peace talks to end the war must protect Ukraine's and Europe's interests.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that the statement said: "We, the leaders of the EU, are happy that President Trump is working to end Russia's war against Ukraine. We also want to see justice, lasting peace, and safety for Ukraine."</p>
            <p>"A fair and lasting peace that brings stability and safety must follow international law. This includes principles like independence, self-rule, keeping current borders, and not changing international borders by force."</p>
            <p>This statement was agreed upon last night and announced today. All EU country leaders, except Hungary, supported it.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders are expected to talk with Trump tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, USA, on August 15. Trump called this a "trial meeting" to see what Putin thinks about ending the war.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy has said he will not give up land that Russia has taken. Trump, however, said Zelenskyy's view worried him and insisted that land exchange must happen.</p>
            <p>But Trump also said he would tell Putin: "You (Putin) must end the war."</p>

            <h1>Google and IBM Make Progress, Competing to Achieve Quantum Computer Dream</h1>
            <p>Since the 1980s, building a working quantum computer has been a big dream for top scientists in physics and computer science. After many years, this dream might soon come true.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times from the UK reported that quantum computers could solve problems that today's computers cannot. This is true for areas like material science and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>Recently, there have been many new discoveries. This shows that leading tech companies are trying to be the first to turn their lab experiments into large-scale working systems.</p>
            <p>In June, IBM, a big American computer company, showed its newest plan for quantum computers. It filled in important missing parts from its old designs. This makes IBM the latest company to say it can build a large-scale quantum computer.</p>
            <p>Jay Gambetta, who leads IBM's quantum project, said, "It doesn't feel like just a dream anymore. I truly think we have found the secret and can build this machine before 2030."</p>
            <p>This means more competition for Google, the big American internet search company. Google solved one of its biggest problems in developing quantum computers late last year. It also said it plans to build an industrial-sized quantum computer by 2030.</p>
            <p>Julian Kelly, who leads the hardware part of Google's Quantum AI project, said, "All the remaining engineering and science problems can be solved."</p>
            <p>However, even though these companies have solved some of the hardest science problems and are close to finishing, they still face many engineering problems. These problems might seem normal but are still hard to fix to make quantum computers for industry.</p>
            <p>Oskar Painter, who leads quantum hardware at Amazon Web Services (AWS), a cloud computing company owned by Amazon, said that the problems now "don't seem as hard as basic physics, but we should not forget how much engineering work is needed for industrial use." He thinks it will take another 15 to 30 years to have useful quantum computers.</p>
            <p>To reach an industrial size, a computing system with fewer than 200 qubits needs to grow to 1 million qubits or more. One of the biggest problems is that qubits are not stable. They stay in a quantum state for only a very short time. They can only do useful calculations in this state. As more qubits are needed, "noise" appears.</p>
            <p>Both IBM and Google say their systems will use a method called "error correction." This method allows for some small problems with the qubits.</p>
            <p>So far, only Google has shown a quantum chip that can do error correction as it gets bigger. Kelly said that if a company tries to make a system bigger without first doing this, it will only create "a very expensive machine that makes noise, uses a lot of power, and takes a lot of people's time and engineering effort, but doesn't do anything useful."</p>
            <p>Other companies have not caught up to Google yet, but they are still trying to make their systems bigger. IBM said they are focusing on their most important goal: showing that their systems can work on a very large scale. They also question if Google's error correction method will work for large systems.</p>
            <p>Governments are also becoming more interested in who will win this race. For example, the US Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) started a big study last year. They want to find out which quantum company can grow to a useful size the fastest.</p>
