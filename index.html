            <h1>Man Posted About a World Masters Games Shirt with a Typo, Court Says No Punishment</h1>
            <p>A man named Mr. Huang posted a picture and text in May. It showed a World Masters Games T-shirt that had a mistake: it said "TAIPI" instead of "TAIPEI". The police thought this was false information. However, the Shilin District Court decided that the post did not make people afraid or scared. So, it did not break the law about spreading rumors that could cause public disorder. The court ruled that Mr. Huang should not be punished. This decision can be appealed.</p>
            <p>The 2025 World Masters Games in New Taipei and Taipei took place from May 17th to 30th. On May 21st, someone posted on social media platform Threads. They said, "First, Taipei was spelled 'TAIIPEI' in an advertisement. Now, my friend who works at a primary school got 'bad' World Masters Games shirts for all staff." The post also included a picture of the T-shirt with "TAIPI" on it.</p>
            <p>This post got a lot of attention. Both the Taipei City Department of Education and the New Taipei-Taipei World Masters Games Executive Committee said the post was not true. They asked the police to investigate. The Xizhi Branch of the New Taipei City Police Department found that Mr. Huang was the person who posted it. They sent the case to the Shilin District Court, saying he broke the law about "spreading rumors that affect public peace."</p>
            <p>According to the court's decision, Mr. Huang said he did post it. He explained that the picture came from a friend who worked at a school. He thought the clothing company might not want to throw away the imperfect shirts, so they gave them to the school staff. He thought it was a simple mistake and shared it online.</p>
            <p>The judge said that Mr. Huang's post was based on information from his friend. He used his own understanding and judgment to share his personal opinion and comments. This is part of free speech. Even if some people might not like what Mr. Huang said or felt upset, it does not change his right to express his opinion and comments.</p>
            <p>The court's decision also stated that based on the evidence from the police, it was not clear that Mr. Huang intended to create false information. Also, it was hard to say that the post would make people afraid or scared, or affect public peace. Therefore, it did not meet the conditions for "spreading rumors that affect public peace." So, the court ruled that Mr. Huang should not be punished. This decision can be appealed.</p>

            <h1>Russian Drone with Explosives Crosses Border, Lithuania Asks NATO to Strengthen Air Defense</h1>
            <p>After Lithuania found out that a Russian military drone with explosives flew into its sky last week, Lithuania today asked NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) for help. They want to make their air defense system stronger.</p>
            <p>According to news agencies AFP and Reuters, Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said this event is just one of many similar events recently. He called these situations a "warning that Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading to NATO countries."</p>
            <p>Mr. Budrys said he has sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. In the letter, he asked for "immediate action to make Lithuania's air defense stronger." This includes NATO countries flying planes to check the air.</p>
            <p>Lithuania's Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene said that Lithuania is forming special teams to deal with drone threats. They are also setting up "air defense groups with short-range weapons."</p>
            <p>NATO replied in an email that they are watching the situation closely. NATO said that General Alexus Grynkewich, who leads Allied Forces in Europe, can decide what actions are needed. NATO countries are also buying and making new ways to find and stop drones.</p>
            <p>The drone flew into Lithuania from Belarus on July 28th. Belarus is a country next to Lithuania and a friend of Russia. People saw the drone flying over parts of Lithuania's capital city, Vilnius, at that time.</p>
            <p>When Russia attacks Ukraine with missiles and drones, they often fly over Belarus. Belarus was also one of the places Russia started its full invasion in 2022.</p>
            <p>The drone was finally found on August 1st in a military training area. Lithuanian officials said they believe it was a drone called "Gerbera." This type of drone is mainly used for attacking and looking for information.</p>

            <h1>Equal Tariffs Start August 7th; Experts Say Chip Tariffs Will Affect Taiwan More</h1>
            <p>The United States plans to start its equal tariffs on August 7th. Also, former US President Trump has said that tariffs on medicines and computer chips will be announced soon. Because of this, people in the market are waiting to see what happens. On Tuesday, US stock prices went down. Experts warn that chip tariffs will affect Taiwan more than the equal tariffs, so investors should pay close attention.</p>
            <p>Investors are watching carefully how tariffs are changing and what effects they will have. On August 5th, all four main Wall Street stock indexes fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 61.90 points, or 0.14%, closing at 44111.74 points. The S&P 500 index dropped by 30.75 points, or 0.49%, closing at 6299.19 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, fell by 137.03 points, or 0.65%, closing at 20916.55 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went down by 62.72 points, or 1.12%, closing at 5561.69 points.</p>
            <p>Looking at individual companies, as Trump said chip tariffs would come soon, Intel's stock price went up by 0.69 US dollars, or 3.54%, closing at 20.19 US dollars. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went down by 6.53 US dollars, or 2.73%, closing at 232.47 US dollars. NVIDIA's stock also fell by 1.74 US dollars, or 0.97%, closing at 178.26 US dollars.</p>
            <p>The Cathay Securities Investment Trust ETF research team said that last week, the US announced an equal tariff rate of 20% on Taiwan. This will start on August 7th. Because this rate is higher than Japan's and South Korea's 15%, it caused some worries in the market.</p>
            <p>However, Cathay Securities Investment Trust explained that this 20% tariff does not apply to the list of goods that are not taxed (Annex II) or to new items added by the President's memo. Taiwan's main export products to the US, such as semiconductors, servers, raw materials for medicines, important parts, minerals, and chemical materials, make up almost 75% of Taiwan's exports. These will not be affected by this equal tariff. The real focus will be on the US Section 232 rule, which is expected to be announced in mid-August and might put taxes on semiconductors.</p>
