Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision is part of ongoing trade and technology tensions with China.

The move means that certain advanced technologies and products can no longer be sold to these Chinese companies without special permission from the Taiwanese government. This action by Taiwan aligns with similar measures taken by the United States, which has also imposed restrictions on Huawei and SMIC to limit China's access to critical technologies, especially those related to advanced semiconductors.

This new control measure is expected to impact the global technology supply chain, as Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors. The decision reflects Taiwan's efforts to protect its technological advantages and align with international partners on strategic trade policies.

Investors are now focusing on identifying these companies, often by analyzing their financial health, market position, and innovation potential. While the overall market might seem uncertain, carefully chosen investments in these overlooked areas could provide significant returns as their worth becomes clearer.
