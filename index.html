            <h1>A Female Officer in Xindian Is Detained for Sharing People's Private Information for Money</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 26 (CNA) â€“ The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office is looking into a fraud case. In this case, a female officer named Wang from the Xindian Household Registration Office is suspected of taking money from land businesses. She is believed to have helped these businesses find information about who owns properties and who will inherit them. The prosecutor talked to Ms. Wang and others yesterday. Early this morning, the prosecutor asked the court to keep Ms. Wang in custody without letting her see anyone.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that in a case called the "Taiwanese ground master case," a land business owner named Cai Shang-yue worked with a lawyer, a police officer, a court clerk, and a village leader. They tricked lonely older people to get their inheritances, totaling over NT$140 million. Mr. Cai was later sentenced to 14 years in prison, and the lawyer, Cai Hong-shen, to 25 years. The case is now being reviewed by the Taiwan High Court.</p>
            <p>During the investigation, the Taipei District Prosecutor's Office also found that Ms. Wang took millions of New Taiwan Dollars in bribes from several land development and urban renewal companies from 2014 to 2024. She used her job to help these companies find information about property owners and their heirs. She is suspected of breaking the Anti-Corruption Act (taking bribes for not doing her job) and the Personal Data Protection Act.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the prosecutor told the Taipei City Investigation Office to search 20 places, including Ms. Wang's office and construction companies. They also called 14 people, including Ms. Wang and the business owners, to answer questions.</p>
            <p>After questioning them all night, the prosecutor decided early this morning that Ms. Wang likely committed serious crimes. They believed she might try to escape, destroy evidence, or talk to other people involved. So, they asked the court to keep her in custody and not allow her to see anyone. The business owners involved were released after paying bail ranging from NT$60,000 to NT$500,000.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Farming Group Signs Agreement with Indiana for More US Farm Products</h1>
            <p>New York, September 25 (CNA) â€“ A group from Taiwan's farming industry signed an agreement today with Indiana, USA. They will buy soybeans and corn from the state. Deputy Minister Du Wen-chen from Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture said that this year's group is the biggest ever, and they plan to buy more goods. This shows that Taiwan needs more farm products from the United States. Indiana Governor Mike Braun said that signing this agreement is good for both sides.</p>
            <p>Deputy Minister Du Wen-chen, Director-General Lei Yen-feng from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago, and members of the Taiwanese farming group went to the Indiana State House for the signing. The head of Taiwan's Vegetable Oil Manufacturing Association, Hung Yao-kun, and a leader from the Feed Industry Association, Yang Chieh, signed the agreements. They signed with the heads of Indiana's Soybean Alliance and Corn Marketing Association. They agreed to buy American soybeans and corn.</p>
            <p>Many important people from Indiana were there, including Governor Mike Braun, Lieutenant Governor Micah Beckwith, U.S. Representative Jefferson Shreve, and many state officials and lawmakers. The Mayor of West Lafayette, Erin Easter, was also present.</p>
            <p>Governor Braun said that the business relationship between Taiwan and Indiana is strong and important. He thanked the group for making their friendship even better and for increasing trade. He also mentioned that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will open an office in Indiana, which shows how important Indiana is for American farming. He said the agreement between Taiwan and Indiana helps both.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant Governor Beckwith noted that Taiwan and Indiana are like sister states. They share similar values and interests. He said that farming trade between the two helps make America safer and protects American farmers from outside harm. This is very important.</p>
            <p>Deputy Minister Du Wen-chen explained that Taiwan has sent farming groups to the U.S. many times since 1998. This year's group is the largest, and they are buying more than before. This means Taiwan needs more farm products from the U.S. She said this visit shows the deep friendship with Indiana, which was Taiwan's first sister state. Both sides believe in farming that helps the environment, protecting nature, and growing good quality farm products.</p>
            <p>Director-General Lei Yen-feng said that this year is 46 years since the Taiwan Relations Act was passed. Taiwan and the U.S. have a strong partnership, helping each other and sharing values like freedom and success. In 2024, Taiwan invested almost 40% more in the U.S. They have strong trade, and also more school and science exchanges. He said that the relationship between Taiwan and Indiana is growing a lot in many ways.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago held a welcome party on September 24. Indiana officials were there, along with members of the state Senate and House who support Taiwan. They gave the Taiwanese group a special paper called House Resolution No. 40. This showed that politicians from different parties in Indiana support the farming trade and sister-state relationship, making the partnership between Taiwan and the U.S. even stronger in farming trade.</p>

            <h1>After the Disaster in Hualien, Take Photos Before Cleaning and Sort Your Trash</h1>
            <p>Hualien County, September 26 (CNA) â€“ The Matian Creek in Hualien had a landslide dam that overflowed. This caused a lot of damage to homes in the Guangfu area. Now that the water has gone down, people are cleaning their homes. The Hualien County Government wants to remind everyone to take pictures of any damage, how high the water or mud was, to help get money later. They also ask people to separate their trash well.</p>
            <p>Chen Chia-fu, the head of Hualien County's Social Affairs Department, said in an interview that before cleaning homes, people should save proof. They should measure how high the water or mud piled up with a tape measure and take photos. They should also take pictures of any damaged parts of their houses. If they have receipts for broken appliances or furniture, these can also help when asking for money from the government later.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government said that there isn't a clear system for giving money yet. However, different government groups like the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, the National Land Management Agency, foundations, or special loans might offer help. No matter which group helps, people will need to provide proof to get the money faster.</p>
            <p>Also, as people go back home to clean, the Hualien County Environmental Protection Bureau asks everyone to separate their trash. This is because the Guangfu landfill is closed due to the disaster. They have found a temporary place to put trash at Taiwan Sugar Corporation.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government also said that cars washed into the streets by the big flood will be moved to the parking lot at Danongdafu Forest Park. This is to keep traffic moving easily, as allowed by the "Disaster Relief Act."</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Environmental Protection Bureau said that people cleaning on their own can pile up big furniture and mud separately on the side of the road. They should also tell their village chief. The Environmental Protection Bureau will send trucks to pick up the trash. After the trash is collected, the military will come to clean and disinfect the areas.</p>
