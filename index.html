            <p>New York, August 26 (CNA) â€“ International oil prices dropped today. This ended four days of price increases. This happened because investors are waiting for clearer news about how much oil will be available.

            <h1>Taiwan's NDC Minister Liu Jing-ching Says US Chip Taxes Won't Greatly Affect TSMC</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, August 26 (CNA) â€“ On August 25th, Liu Jing-ching, who is the Minister of Taiwan's National Development Council (NDC), spoke with "Nikkei Asia." He said that even if the US government under President Donald Trump puts new, strong taxes on computer chips, TSMC will not be affected much.</p>
            <p>The report says that Liu Jing-ching, who is also a board member for TSMC, explained: "TSMC is directly investing in the United States. Because of this, only 1% of its chip parts are sold directly to the US."</p>
            <p>TSMC is the world's largest company for making computer chips. It has already built and started factories in the US. In March, TSMC announced they would invest an extra 100 billion US dollars (about 3 trillion 560 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in the US.</p>
            <p>When talking about how tariffs might affect all Taiwanese companies, Liu Jing-ching said that "75% of export products are not affected right now." The other 25% are mostly goods like steel and aluminum, which already have extra taxes on them.</p>
            <p>He also said that Taiwan is talking with the US states where Taiwanese companies have factories. They are trying to find ways to lower the tax burden for these companies, especially in states like Texas and Arizona, where a lot of computer chips are made. He hopes that when Taiwanese companies decide to build new facilities in the US, they will get tax benefits from the local governments.</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching also talked about a case where an employee of Tokyo Electron (TEL), a Japanese company that used to work with TSMC, was accused of sharing TSMC's business secrets. He said: "TSMC will decide what to do based on the results of the investigation."</p>
            <p>Liu Jing-ching stated that Taiwanese companies have a strong relationship with Japanese companies that make chip equipment. He added: "This event will not hurt this relationship."</p>
            <p>He also shared that he wants to bring more talented people from other countries to Taiwan. The NDC plans to make it easier to hire graduates from top universities around the world. They also plan to expand the current system this year.</p>
            <p>On August 25th, Liu Jing-ching attended the "Taiwan-Japan Innovation Summit" in Tokyo. In his opening speech, he said: "When new Taiwanese companies grow globally, Japan is often their first choice." He believes this is because Taiwan and Japan share many cultural similarities. He also hopes that new companies from both Taiwan and Japan will work together even more closely.</p>
