            <h1>India Sends Women to UN Peacekeeping Missions, a Key Highlight</h1>
            <p>India sends people to work for the United Nations (UN) in different missions. An Indian military leader, Kapoor, said that India was the first country in the world to send an all-female team. These women still play a very important part in different missions.</p>
            <p>A meeting for leaders of countries that send troops to the UN will happen in New Delhi, India, from October 14 to 16. Leaders and high-ranking officials from 30 countries will attend. These countries include France, Italy, Brazil, Ethiopia, Malaysia, and Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Since 1950, India has been a key country in UN peacekeeping work. For 75 years, India has sent more than 290,000 peacekeepers. They have taken part in 50 different missions.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant General Rakesh Kapoor, who is in charge of information systems and training for the Indian military, said this meeting is important. It will help countries talk, work together, and understand each other better. They will also discuss how countries can work to keep peace, following UN rules.</p>
            <p>Kapoor told the Central News Agency that in 2007, India sent a team made completely of women to Liberia. This was the first time in the world. Now, in different parts of the world, Indian teams have female members. This shows that India cares about women's rights in places where there is conflict.</p>
            <p>Kapoor said, "India started something new for UN peacekeeping. We sent an all-female team to Liberia. After that, all our teams have women members. They talk well with local women."</p>
            <p>Kapoor said that when conflict happens, women and children are often hurt the most and are the most vulnerable. So, it is very important to understand the problems women face and help them be more aware.</p>
            <p>Kapoor also told the Central News Agency that the Indian women peacekeepers are good examples for local women in conflict areas. This is because women are very important in shaping public opinion in all societies. "Our female peacekeepers can inspire local women. They show them that women are recognized and can take part in social activities. This helps the local society grow in a good way."</p>
            <p>Indian peacekeepers work with others around the world. They keep peace, safety, and human dignity in very difficult and unstable places. They do their jobs bravely and professionally. They earn the respect of the people in the countries where they serve. However, 182 Indian peacekeepers have also died while serving.</p>

            <h1>Volunteers and Repair Workers Help Hualien Flood Victims on Mid-Autumn Festival Holiday</h1>
            <p>Today is the first day of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Many volunteers came to Guangfu in Hualien. They changed their shovels for brooms and squeegees. Also, people who fix water and electricity systems appeared. Together, they helped people affected by the flood to clean their homes and fix water and electricity. The asphalt roads are now visible, and the floors in homes are no longer covered in mud.</p>
            <p>The Matianan Stream had a natural dam, which broke and caused a flood. More than 1,800 homes in Guangfu, Hualien, were damaged. "Shovel Supermen" have almost finished the first step of clearing mud from homes. The second step, which is cleaning inside the homes and fixing water and electricity, still needs help from many people.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways said that by noon today, more than 20,000 people had arrived at Guangfu Station. Volunteers wearing rain boots used brooms, mops, and hoses to clean homes. The floors and walls, which were dark and dirty, are now much cleaner.</p>
            <p>"Water and Electricity Supermen" also showed up with hoses and toolboxes. A plumber from Yilan said that light switches and power outlets were full of mud. They need to check all the wiring in a damaged home first. After checking how much mud there is, they can start fixing things.</p>
            <p>Workers from Kaohsiung came to Guangfu to help during the holiday. People affected by the flood stopped them on the street to ask for help when they saw them with hoses.</p>
            <p>A worker named Lin from Tainan said that if they only replace things like power outlets and light switches, it takes about half a day per house. But he is worried that mud might have gone into the pipes and damaged the materials. This could cause problems like short circuits later. So, he suggests changing all the wiring in the house, which would take at least one day.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsieh, who lives on Dunhou Road, stood at her door and thanked the volunteers. She said that she saw the large amount of mud that was there before. Now, her home is empty and clean. She thanked volunteers from everywhere for their help. She said that once the water and electricity are fixed, she will be one step closer to moving back home.</p>

            <h1>Shohei Ohtani to Pitch in MLB Playoffs for the First Time, Says He's Nervous and Thankful</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C., October 3 (AFP) â€“ The MLB National League Division Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Philadelphia Phillies starts tomorrow. Shohei Ohtani, the Japanese baseball star for the Dodgers, will pitch in the MLB playoffs for the first time. He said that staying calm will be very important.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Ohtani was a key player when the Dodgers won the World Series last year. But he had elbow surgery in 2023. So, last season he only focused on hitting and did not pitch and hit at the same time, which is called "two-way play."</p>
            <p>Shohei Ohtani, who is 31 years old, will make MLB history tomorrow in the first game of the National League Division Series against the Phillies. He will be the first player in the same playoffs to both start as a pitcher and play as a hitter in the starting lineup.</p>
            <p>Ohtani told reporters in Philadelphia today, "I am really looking forward to it. I think I will be nervous sometimes, but more importantly, I am thankful to be able to play at this time of year. For me, staying healthy is very important, so I value my current condition."</p>
            <p>When Shohei Ohtani pitches for the first time in the playoffs, he will need to control his feelings. He expects the atmosphere in the stadium to be very exciting.</p>
            <p>He said, "I know some pitchers get excited when they play, and their throwing speed gets faster. Others keep their normal speed. If I had to choose, I think I am the type whose speed will increase."</p>
            <p>He also added, "But still, it's important to stay calm and stable. The key is if I can control my emotions well."</p>
