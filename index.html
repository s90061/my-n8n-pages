<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te stated on Sunday that Taiwan is "of course" a country. He argued that China lacks both historical and legal evidence to support its claims of sovereignty over the island, strongly rejecting Beijing's increasing political and military pressure.

China views democratically-governed Taiwan as "sacred" Chinese territory, asserting it has belonged to China since ancient times and is merely one of its provinces, with no right to be called a state.

President Lai and his administration firmly reject this perspective and have repeatedly offered talks with China, which have been declined. China labels Lai a "separatist."

In the first of a series of ten speeches titled "uniting the country," Lai discussed Taiwan's history, including the ancient connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesian groups, such as native Hawaiians. He used this to illustrate what he believes is Taiwan's distinct development separate from China.

He added that the people of Taiwan have a history of resisting invasion, citing uprisings against Japan's colonial rule from 1895-1945. Furthermore, under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for a mere eight years.

"Of course, Taiwan is a country," Lai declared during a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, also highlighting its presidential elections. "But China insists that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. China maintains that the 1971 United Nations resolution, which removed Taipei's seat and gave it to Beijing, serves as one of the legal foundations for its claims.

Lai, who in March referred to China as a "hostile foreign force," asserted that Beijing's claim about the U.N. resolution being related to Taiwan's sovereignty was "totally wrong," as the resolution only addressed which government was represented at the organization.

Lai also emphasized that China's threat to Taiwan is real, pointing to Beijing's daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he asked, receiving applause.

The defeated Republic of China government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

**US added over 1,000 new millionaires a day last year, UBS report says**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-added-over-1-000-090239309.html">News Link</a>

ZURICH (Reuters) - Wealth grew at an exceptionally fast rate last year in the United States, where more than 379,000 individuals became new U.S. dollar millionaires. This amounts to over a thousand new millionaires every day, according to a report released on Tuesday.

This increase accounts for 60% of the worldwide growth in millionaires, showing the significant impact of the U.S. market. The annual "Global Wealth Report" by UBS, in collaboration with Credit Suisse, also revealed a surprising rise in average global wealth per adult. It recovered to record levels after experiencing a decline the previous year due to inflation and rising interest rates.

Global wealth reached $629 trillion by the end of 2024, showing a 3% increase. Switzerland and the Netherlands also saw strong growth in wealth. However, outside the U.S., millionaires increased most rapidly in Switzerland, with 103,400 new ones, and in Japan, with 94,600 new millionaires.

The report also noted a significant increase in the number of individuals with "ultra-high net worth" (UHNW), defined as those with assets exceeding $50 million. The U.S. gained 28,300 new UHNW individuals, followed by China with 10,700 and Germany with 6,800.

The authors expect global wealth to continue to grow, predicting an 18% rise over the next five years to reach $806 trillion by 2029. This growth is expected to be driven by falling interest rates and the expansion of the artificial intelligence sector, particularly in developed countries.

However, the wealth gap remains a concern. The richest 1% of the world's population now controls 45.8% of all personal wealth, an increase from 44.5% in 2023.

**Oil tankers near Iran appear to be in rural Russia as signals jammed**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/oil-tankers-near-iran-appear-165702726.html">News Link</a>

LONDON (Reuters) - On Sunday, the Front Tyne oil tanker was sailing through the Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Just after 9:40 a.m., ship-tracking data showed its location had changed dramatically, appearing to be in a rural area of Russia, near the town of Balakovo, over 2,000 km away.

This "spoofing" of signals, which manipulates a ship's Automatic Identification System (AIS) to show incorrect locations, has become more common, especially since the start of the war in Ukraine. It makes it difficult to track vessels and increases the risks of collisions at sea.

"It's like a video game where you're trying to dodge obstacles," said Lars Eirik Strand, a senior analyst at energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy. "It's a huge problem. You don't know where the ships are, and it just makes everything more complicated and dangerous."

On the same day, a supertanker named Coswisdom Lake, capable of carrying 2 million barrels of crude oil, also appeared to be located in Russia, instead of its actual position near the United Arab Emirates. This incident also occurred when the vessel was transiting the Strait of Hormuz, a key shipping lane for oil.

Both tankers later showed their correct positions, but the incidents highlight the growing challenge of maritime security and the potential for technological interference in global shipping.

"This is not just about sanctions evasion; it's about the safety of navigation," said Michelle Wiese Bockmann, a shipping analyst at Lloyd's List Intelligence. "If you can't trust the signals, you have a much higher risk of accidents."
