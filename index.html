            <h1>People from Pacific Island Countries Train in Taiwan, Inviting Young Indigenous People to Join and Help Diplomacy</h1>
            <p>Twenty-three people from different countries are in Taiwan for the "Pacific Island Countries Youth Leaders Training Program." This year, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) asked three young indigenous people from Taiwan to join the program in both the United States and Taiwan. This will help build new connections between Taiwan and countries in the Austronesian region. Ge Bao-xuan, a high-ranking official from MOFA, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said that Taiwan can help with safety in the region and will keep helping Pacific Island countries.</p>
            <p>MOFA announced today that the 10th "Pacific Island Countries Youth Leaders Training Program" (PILP) for 2025 started on August 25th at the Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs. MOFA and the East-West Center (EWC), a think tank in Hawaii, USA, are organizing the program together. The 23 people joining this year are from countries like the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, Tuvalu, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga, the Cook Islands, and French Polynesia.</p>
            <p>MOFA explained that this year, they are also working with the Council of Indigenous Peoples. They invited three young indigenous people from Taiwan to join the whole training program in Hawaii, USA, and Taiwan. This aims to create new energy for Taiwan's diplomatic and cultural ties with Austronesian countries. The program includes topics like international relations, regional safety, sustainable environment, health cooperation, and Austronesian studies. The participants will also stay overnight in an indigenous village in Majia Township, Pingtung County.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that Ge Bao-xuan, a high-ranking official, led the opening ceremony in place of Deputy Foreign Minister Wu Chih-chung, who is also the head of the Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs. Guests who spoke at the ceremony included Lily Tangisia Faavae, the Ambassador of Tuvalu to Taiwan; Cassailis Jarom, the Deputy Chief of Mission of the Republic of the Marshall Islands; Karin Lang, the Deputy Director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT/T) Taipei Office; and Mary Therese Perez Hattori, the Project Director of EWC's Pacific Islands Development Program. Officials from the Australian Office and the Hawaii State Government's Taipei Office also attended.</p>
            <p>Ge Bao-xuan said in his speech that Taiwan's indigenous people and people from Pacific Island countries share many similarities in weaving, tattoos, and food. This shows their strong connection. MOFA not only makes partnerships stronger through many kinds of cooperation but also encourages cultural exchange. Pacific Island countries and Taiwan both face regional tensions and climate change problems. Taiwan has the ability and the strong will to help with regional safety. It also wants to keep helping Pacific Island countries with building skills, keeping the environment healthy, and having democratic government.</p>
            <p>Lily Faavae said that Pacific countries are working together to deal with big problems like rising sea levels. They are also improving regional cooperation in today's political situation. Jarom said thank you to Taiwan for supporting development in the Pacific region. He stressed that this cooperation is important for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
            <p>Karin Lang highlighted that Taiwan is a world leader in democratic government, public health, and high-tech industries like semiconductors and AI. As a Pacific country, the United States always puts the Indo-Pacific region at the center of its foreign policy. It also continues to promote trade, investment, and business exchange. Especially, the "Global Cooperation and Training Framework" (GCTF) has shown its commitment to regional strength and cooperation in areas like disaster response, public health, and cybersecurity. She hoped that the connections made by the participants in Taiwan will strengthen cooperation between Pacific Island countries, Taiwan, and the United States, helping the region become more successful and safe.</p>
            <p>Mary said that the most valuable thing in society today is not money, but long-lasting relationships. The PILP, organized by EWC and MOFA, is an important platform to help leaders in the region connect and work together. It helps countries develop future leaders.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that the Institute of Diplomacy and International Affairs also invited students from Shulin High School's "Indigenous Class" in New Taipei City to perform indigenous songs at the ceremony. They sang and danced with the guests and made new friends, showing the idea that "everyone is a diplomat."</p>

            <h1>Chang Chao-yuan Hits a Home Run, Helping the Hawks Win; Stout Manages Tough Situations Well with No Big Problems</h1>
            <p>Chang Chao-yuan from the TSG Hawks baseball team hit his eighth home run this season. He got two hits and two RBIs in the game, helping his team beat the Fubon Guardians 4 to 1. This was the Hawks' second win in a row. The Hawks' starting foreign pitcher, Eric Stout, did not have perfect control of his pitches. However, head coach Hung I-chung said that Stout handled problems well and did not let the other team score many runs.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hawks played against the Guardians at Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium. In the first inning, the Hawks scored first. Tseng Tzu-yu walked, and Wu Nien-ting got a hit. With two outs, Wang Po-jung hit a single. In the bottom of the first inning, Fan Kuo-chen hit a double, which helped the Guardians tie the score.</p>
            <p>In the top of the second inning, with one out, Chang Chao-yuan hit a solo home run. This gave the Hawks the lead. In the top of the fifth inning, with two outs, the Hawks attacked again. Tseng Yu-ching and Lin Chia-hung both walked. Then, Chang Chao-yuan hit a single to left field, adding another important run for the team.</p>
            <p>In the top of the seventh inning, the Hawks started another attack. Wu Nien-ting walked to first base. With two outs, Tseng Yu-ching hit a double, bringing in the team's fourth run. Chang Chao-yuan got two hits and two RBIs today, and his hitting won the game. He was chosen as the MVP for the game.</p>
            <p>The Hawks' starting foreign pitcher, Eric Stout, threw 96 pitches in 5 innings today. He allowed 5 hits, struck out 3 batters, and walked 3 batters. He gave up only 1 earned run and got his seventh win of the season.</p>
            <p>Hawks' head coach Hung I-chung said that Stout's problem today was his control was not very accurate. But the most important thing for a pitcher is to handle tough situations well. It looked like he had some problems during the game, but he did not give up any long hits that would cause big damage. Giving up only 1 run in 5 innings was okay. But after 5 innings, he had thrown almost 100 pitches, so the coach decided to change pitchers.</p>
            <p>Hawks outfielder Wang Po-hsuan and foreign hitter Steven Moya did not play the whole game. Hung I-chung said that Wang Po-hsuan had a cold and had played many games this season. Moya was not feeling well. The coach will see if they will play tomorrow.</p>

            <h1>United Nations: One Quarter of the World's People Do Not Have Safe Drinking Water</h1>
            <p>Today, the United Nations said that more than 2 billion people around the world still do not have safe drinking water. They also warned that the world is very far behind in making sure everyone has safe water.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the UN's health and children's organizations said that last year, a whole quarter of the world's population could not get safely managed drinking water. Also, more than 100 million people still drink water from rivers, ponds, and canals.</p>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said that because water supply, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services are not good enough, billions of people are more likely to get sick.</p>
            <p>In a shared report, these two organizations said that the world is still very far from reaching the goal of providing these services to everyone by 2030.</p>
            <p>They warned that this goal is "getting further and further away."</p>
            <p>Ruediger Krech, who leads the environment department at the World Health Organization, said, "Water supply, sanitation, and hygiene are not special favors; they are basic human rights."</p>
            <p>"We must act faster, especially for the communities that are most left out."</p>
