<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - China Airlines, Taiwan's national airline, is delaying the removal of some of its older aircraft from service. This is happening because of delays in receiving Boeing 787-9 jets, which might lead to compensation payments from Boeing, according to the airline's new chairman.

China Airlines, established in 1959, is currently updating its fleet. Last year, it split an order for new long-haul aircraft, worth almost $12 billion at list prices, between Boeing and the European company Airbus.

China Airlines has also ordered 24 Boeing 787s for regional and some longer-distance flights. This includes 18 of the 787-9 model and six of the larger 787-10 version.

However, Chairman George Kao stated that China Airlines' plan to replace its older Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos is being affected by delays in new aircraft deliveries, especially for the 787-9s.

"We are currently facing a significant impact. Some aircraft that were supposed to be retired or returned at the end of their lease agreements will now stay in service, and their leases will be extended," he told Reuters in an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, where Taiwan's main international airport is located.

Boeing has not provided China Airlines with an exact schedule for the 787-9 delays, although it has said that deliveries will "basically" start by the end of 2025, added Kao, who is a trained pilot, started as a flight attendant, and became chairman in March.

"This is stated in the contract," he said, when asked if China Airlines would seek compensation.

"For example, if the delay is caused by issues in the supply chain, Boeing is responsible and must provide some compensation. But if it's not, then there is no compensation. It's all clearly written in the contract."

Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.

Other airlines are experiencing similar problems.

Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), a global airline organization, recently described predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade as "completely unacceptable."

Despite this, Kao expressed optimism about expansion plans. He mentioned the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year, which will allow for increased capacity on routes such as New York and London. He also noted a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport, with its first section expected to open later this year.

He also hinted at more aircraft for Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary that mainly operates domestic flights with ATR-72 turboprops. Mandarin Airlines is being reorganized to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan using new jet aircraft.

"I can discuss this with aircraft lessors," he said, without revealing the specific jet models that might be added. "We have this plan to help Mandarin Airlines grow."

China Airlines competes domestically with its long-time rival EVA Air and the fast-growing Starlux Airlines, which recently ordered 10 additional A350s.

Kao explained that while the Taiwanese market itself is small, transit traffic, a key focus for all three airlines, means that supporting three full-service airlines is not a problem.

He added that Seoul's Incheon airport is too large, making it easy for passengers to get lost, Tokyo's landing fees are too expensive, and Hong Kong has "political issues." In contrast, Taoyuan airport's new terminal will significantly improve the travel experience.

"Our passengers are not all Taiwanese; many are transit. Because Taiwan's location, connecting the Pacific to all of Asia, is truly very convenient."

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pitches-1-trillion-us-053937697.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is trying to work with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to achieve what could be his biggest project yet: a trillion-dollar industrial complex in the United States dedicated to artificial intelligence.

The Japanese billionaire, known for making bold and sometimes risky bets on technology, has been promoting his vision for "AI computing, robotics, and data centers" across the US. He has met with officials in Washington, including former President Donald Trump, and visited various potential locations for the project.

This ambitious plan follows SoftBank's earlier investment in the British chip designer Arm Holdings Plc, which has recently seen its shares surge due to strong demand for AI technology. Son believes that creating an AI manufacturing hub in the US, with TSMC's advanced chipmaking capabilities, is essential for the future of AI development and national security.

The proposed AI hub would include chip foundries, data centers, and robotics research facilities, aiming to create a comprehensive ecosystem for AI innovation and production. This initiative aligns with US efforts to bring more semiconductor manufacturing back to American soil, reducing reliance on overseas production, particularly from Taiwan and South Korea, in critical technology sectors.

While the exact details and funding mechanisms for the trillion-dollar project are still being worked out, Son's discussions with TSMC and the Trump team indicate a serious effort to secure both technological expertise and political support. TSMC, as the world's largest contract chipmaker, would be a crucial partner in providing the advanced chips needed for such a massive AI infrastructure.

The project faces significant challenges, including the immense capital required and the complex logistics of building such a large-scale industrial complex. However, if successful, it could reshape the global AI landscape and significantly boost US capabilities in artificial intelligence. Son's pursuit of this "AI revolution" reflects his long-held belief in the transformative power of AI and his willingness to invest heavily in its future.
