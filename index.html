            <h1>Trump: New Appointments for Fed Governor and Bureau of Labor Statistics Head Soon</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he will soon announce who will be the new governor for the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the new head for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These two appointments could influence his economic plans, especially when people are worried about the global economy growing slowly.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to reporters on his way back to the White House after spending the weekend in Bedminster, New Jersey. Recently, he has been criticized for often speaking against the Federal Reserve. He also fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after reports showed slow job growth. Critics say these actions hurt the trust in these organizations, which are usually seen as free from political influence.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump said he is "looking at several people" for the Fed position. This job became open after Adriana Kugler announced on August 1st that she would leave her role as governor. Her term was supposed to end in January next year. Her leaving gives Trump an earlier chance to choose someone who agrees more with him and might support lowering interest rates.</p>
            <p>Some people who might lead the Fed include Kevin Hassett, who is the chairman of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, Christopher Waller, a current Fed governor, and Scott Bessent, the Secretary of the Treasury. The new Fed governor chosen by Trump could also become the chairman when Jerome Powell's term ends in May next year.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Trump said he ordered McEntarfer to be fired. He accused her of changing job numbers for political reasons. Data from the US Labor Department showed that job growth in July this year was less than expected. Also, job hiring numbers from recent months, after corrections, were the worst since the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2019.</p>
            <p>After the report came out, Trump criticized McEntarfer. He said she had "made up" job numbers to help the Democratic Party win the last presidential election.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," about the latest July data: "McEntarfer said only 73,000 jobs were added (shocking), but more importantly, they made a big mistake, reducing 258,000 jobs in the two months before."</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Says Mercenaries from China and Other Countries are Fighting for Russia, Will Respond</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday that Ukrainian soldiers in the northeast of the country are fighting against foreign "mercenaries" from several countries, including China, Pakistan, and parts of Africa. He promised that Ukraine would take action.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy had earlier accused Moscow of getting Chinese people to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, but Beijing has said this is not true. North Korea has also sent thousands of soldiers to Russia's Kursk region to help with the fighting.</p>
            <p>After visiting a frontline area in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine, Zelenskyy wrote on X (formerly Twitter): "We talked with the commanders about the situation at the front, how we are defending Vovchansk, and how the battles are going."</p>
            <p>He also added: "Our soldiers in this area told us that mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries are taking part in this war. We will respond to this."</p>
            <p>Reuters has tried to contact the embassies of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan in Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, to ask for their comments on this matter.</p>
            <p>Russia has not yet made any public comments about Zelenskyy's statements.</p>
