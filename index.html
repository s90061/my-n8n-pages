            <h1>North Stream Pipeline Explosion Suspect Arrested</h1>
            <p>Polish police have arrested a person who they believe was involved in the 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Germany had issued an arrest warrant for this person.</p>
            <p>The suspect's lawyer, Tymoteusz Paprocki, told TVN24 television that his client was arrested. "He was taken into custody this morning in a town near Warsaw," the lawyer said. This information comes from reports by AFP and Reuters.</p>
            <p>Polish news outlets said the suspect's name is Volodymyr, and his last name starts with Z. Reuters reported that the suspect is a Ukrainian diver and was wanted by German authorities.</p>
            <p>Piotr Skiba, a spokesperson for the Warsaw Provincial Prosecutor's Office, confirmed the arrest to AFP. He said that the necessary legal steps are now taking place, but he did not give the suspect's full name.</p>
            <p>The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline explosion in 2022 was called an "act of sabotage" by both Moscow and Western countries. It greatly reduced the amount of gas Russia sent to Europe. This event showed a serious increase in the conflict in Ukraine and made Europe's energy supply much worse. No one has said they were responsible for the attack. Ukraine has said it was not involved.</p>

            <h1>Gongguan Roundabout Changed to Intersection, Traffic Jams During Rush Hour; Taipei City Proposes 4 Improvement Measures</h1>
            <p>Today was the first workday since Taipei's Gongguan roundabout was removed and changed into a normal intersection. In the morning and evening rush hours, some roads were very crowded. The Department of Transportation said that starting tomorrow, they will make four changes. One change is to remove the special bus lane where the Fuhe Bridge ends.</p>
            <p>The intersection of Keelung Road and Roosevelt Road, which used to be the Gongguan roundabout, was changed yesterday. Many people posted online today on Threads about the traffic on the first day. Some said their bus ride in the morning took twice as long as during the construction. Even bus drivers suggested taking the MRT. Some people also said that Roosevelt Road was backed up all the way to Jingmei, and traffic on Fuhe Bridge started backing up from the bridge itself.</p>
            <p>Also, many scooter riders, to avoid waiting at red lights when turning right from Roosevelt Road to Keelung Road during rush hour, would first enter Lane 119 of Roosevelt Road Section 4. Because they couldn't get onto Keelung Road from there, they would then ride to Lane 113 of Roosevelt Road Section 4 and make a U-turn. People online called this "Chiang's hairpin turn."</p>
            <p>Observations at the site also showed that in the past, if scooter riders wanted to turn left from Roosevelt Road to Keelung Road to go downtown, they would go around a bridge support and wait in a special waiting area. Now, the area under the bridge support is a crosswalk, and scooters do not need to make a two-stage left turn. In both morning and evening rush hours, many scooter riders were not used to the new road design and rode onto the crosswalk by mistake. They shared the path with pedestrians, which was dangerous.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, during the evening rush hour, Keelung Road towards New Taipei City was very crowded. Even from about 700 meters away, near the NTU Farm heading towards the city, the end of the traffic jam could not be seen. A Taipower rescue vehicle, even with its siren on, was stuck in traffic and could not move. Sometimes, scooter riders would turn off their engines and walk their scooters on the sidewalk.</p>
            <p>Taipei City's Department of Transportation Commissioner Hsieh Ming-hung and Traffic Control Engineering Office Director Chang Chien-hua went to the site to check the situation during the evening rush hour. After a meeting, Hsieh Ming-hung told CNA reporters that there was indeed heavy traffic in the morning. After meeting with other departments, they decided on four improvement measures, which will start tomorrow.</p>
            <p>First, for vehicles turning right from Roosevelt Road (south to east) onto Keelung Road to go downtown, because cars and pedestrians cross paths, the traffic lights will be changed. Pedestrians will cross the road in two stages, and more lanes for right-turning cars will be added. Also, the double white lines at the intersection will be changed to lane lines, allowing vehicles to change lanes.</p>
            <p>Third, the traffic light timing on Wansheng Street will be slightly adjusted to give cars more time to drive. Finally, at the end of Fuhe Bridge, because many cars need to turn left, workers will remove the special bus lane tonight. This will allow cars to use this lane to turn left.</p>
            <p>Regarding the traffic jam on Keelung Road in the evening, Hsieh Ming-hung said honestly that they first thought Roosevelt Road would be more backed up. But it turned out that Keelung Road had more traffic. So, they immediately changed the traffic light timings, and traffic has since returned to normal.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung said that changing the roundabout to a normal intersection is a big change, and it's normal to have some problems. The Department of Transportation will face these problems, keep watching, and make improvements based on what they see.</p>

            <h1>Gaza 20-Point Peace Plan; Trump Gives Hamas 3-4 Days to Respond</h1>
            <p>After talking about the situation in the Gaza Strip with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House yesterday, US President Trump announced a 20-point peace plan. Today, Trump said he will give the Palestinian group Hamas "three to four days" to reply to this plan.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, when Trump and Netanyahu held a press conference yesterday, Trump said that if Hamas does not accept the 20-point peace plan from the US, Israel will have his "full support."</p>
            <p>The plan says that Hamas must give up its weapons. Also, Hamas and other groups must agree not to be involved in leading Gaza, either directly or indirectly, or in any other way.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters today, "We will probably give Hamas three to four days. We are waiting for Hamas. Hamas must either do it or not. If they don't do it, the results will be very bad."</p>
