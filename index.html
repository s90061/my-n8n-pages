            <h1>Lin Yun-ju Gets Revenge on Korea's Lee Sang-su, Enters Top 32 at WTT Sweden Grand Slam</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's good male table tennis player Lin Yun-ju won his match today. He played against 35-year-old Lee Sang-su from Korea in the first round of 64 players at the WTT Sweden Grand Slam. Lin Yun-ju won with scores of 16-14, 11-7, and 11-8. This win was important because he had lost to Lee Sang-su before. Now, Lin Yun-ju has moved on to the top 32 players.</p>
            <p>Lin Yun-ju just turned 24. He is currently ranked 11th in the world for men's singles in the WTT. Before this match, he had played against Lee Sang-su, who is ranked 22nd, two times. Each player had won one match. Their last game was in April this year at the Incheon Champions tournament, where Lin Yun-ju lost 2-4.</p>
            <p>In today's match, Lee Sang-su played very strongly in the first game. Lin Yun-ju was ahead 9-6, but then his opponent scored 4 points in a row and was ahead by 1 point. After that, the score was tied 5 times. Lin Yun-ju then made two excellent attacks and won the first game. This game took almost 20 minutes for the two players to finish.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Lin Yun-ju started to control the match more. When the score was 4-4, he used his special backhand flick shot very well. He kept getting points and won the game 11-7.</p>
            <p>In the third game, Lin Yun-ju stayed ahead by 1 or 2 points at the start. But in the middle of the game, he was behind 5-6 for a short time. Then, Lin Yun-ju scored 4 points in a row. This made him get ahead and broke Lee Sang-su's good play. Lin Yun-ju won the match in 3 games.</p>
            <p>Now that Lin Yun-ju is in the top 32, his next opponent will be Shunsuke Togami from Japan. Lin Yun-ju has played against Togami two times before, and Lin Yun-ju won both times.</p>
            <p>Also, another Taiwanese player, Feng Yi-hsin, who won a gold medal in the men's team event at this year's World University Games in Germany, played today. He was injured but played in the first round against Darko Jorgic from Slovenia. Sadly, Feng Yi-hsin lost with scores of 11-9, 9-11, 6-11, and 13-15.</p>

            <h1>Ecuador Gang Violence Gets Worse: 7 People Shot and Killed in Billiard Hall</h1>
            <p>There has been another terrible killing due to gang violence in Ecuador. Today, the police said that several people with guns went into a billiard hall in Santo Domingo city. They shot and killed at least 7 people.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the national police of Ecuador told reporters on WhatsApp that a shooting happened in a billiard hall in the nightlife area of Santo Domingo. They said, "7 people were shot and died." Santo Domingo city is about 150 kilometers (about 93 miles) from the capital city, Quito.</p>
            <p>The police said they are looking into this event and trying to find the people who did it.</p>
            <p>A video on the internet, which is said to be from this killing, shows several people wearing black masks. They shot at two men who were standing at the entrance of the billiard hall. People walking by ran away in fear.</p>
            <p>The people with guns then went inside the billiard hall and kept shooting. They ran away before police cars arrived.</p>
            <p>AFP has not checked if the video is real by themselves.</p>
            <p>Local news reports say that early checks show this shooting might be connected to organized crime in that area.</p>
            <p>Last month, a similar terrible event happened in a billiard hall in Playas, a city in the southwest that many tourists visit. At least 9 people died there. Also, in April this year, a group of armed people killed 12 people at a cockfighting arena about 30 kilometers (about 18 miles) from Santo Domingo.</p>
            <p>Ecuador was once seen as a safe place in Latin America. But for many years, international drug groups have grown bigger. They use Ecuador's ports to send drugs to the United States and Europe. This has caused a big problem for the country.</p>
            <p>The number of drug groups in Ecuador is growing. The number of murders in the country has gone up a lot. In 2018, there were 6 murders for every 100,000 people. By 2024, this number went up to 38 murders for every 100,000 people.</p>
