Amazon has invested another $2.75 billion in Anthropic, an artificial intelligence (AI) company. This brings Amazon's total investment in Anthropic to $4 billion. This major investment shows that the partnership between the two companies is becoming much stronger.

Amazon wants its cloud customers, through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, to be able to use Anthropic's advanced AI technology. This move helps Amazon compete more effectively with other big tech companies like Microsoft and Google, who are also investing heavily in the rapidly growing field of generative AI â€“ AI that can create new content. Anthropic is well-known for developing its AI models, including Claude, which aims to be a strong competitor to other popular AI systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT.

**New 'Coffee Badging' Trend Emerges in Hybrid Workplaces**

A new trend called 'coffee badging' is becoming popular among people who work both from home and the office. This trend describes employees who go into the office just for a short time, perhaps to sign in, grab a coffee, or chat briefly with colleagues, and then leave to continue working remotely from home.

This practice often happens because companies want their employees to be in the office more often, but employees prefer to work from home for flexibility. Coffee badging allows workers to show they were present at the office without spending a full day there. However, this trend makes people wonder what the real reason for going to the office is and if time spent there is truly productive. Companies are trying to find a good balance between their needs for teamwork and company culture, and their employees' desire for flexible work arrangements.

**New Zealand to Introduce Carbon Tax for International Flights**

New Zealand plans to add a new tax on air travel for international tourists. This tax, called the 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy,' will be added to the price of all flights leaving New Zealand for international destinations. The main goal of this new tax is to help fund research and the creation of greener airplane fuels, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs).

This initiative is part of New Zealand's larger plan to cut down on carbon pollution and not add any more carbon to the atmosphere by 2050. The country relies heavily on tourism, so this new tax will impact its very important tourism industry. New Zealand hopes to find a good balance between protecting the environment and supporting its economy, as it works towards a more sustainable future for travel.`;
