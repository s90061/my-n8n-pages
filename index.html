Taiwan's exports grew by 25.9% in the first half of this year. This is the highest growth among the four main Asian economies, including South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It also shows better performance than the US and China.

In June, Taiwan's exports reached a new monthly record of 53.32 billion US dollars, which is 33.7% more than last year. This is the 20th month in a row that exports have increased. For the first six months of the year, total exports were 283.26 billion US dollars, also a new high for this period.

The Ministry of Finance says this strong growth is due to the high demand for AI technology. Taiwan's advanced semiconductor technology and strong manufacturing of high-end servers are a perfect match for this demand. Also, companies sent goods earlier because they expected new tariffs from the US, which also helped the export numbers.

The Ministry expects exports in July to continue growing, possibly by 15% to 20%. This would make it 21 months of continuous growth. However, they are also watching out for risks like US tariffs and global political problems.

**Wistron's Revenue Reaches New High, Overtakes Quanta for Second Month**

Wistron, a manufacturing company, announced its June revenue was about 209.182 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is a new record for a single month and is 136% higher than last year. For the second month in a row, Wistron's revenue was higher than Quanta, another big company in the same industry.

Quanta's revenue in June was about 189.868 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 70.6% higher than last year. This was its best June ever and its second-highest monthly revenue. Wistron said its sales grew because it shipped many AI servers and because of more laptop orders at the end of the quarter.

For the third quarter, Wistron expects sales of laptops, desktop computers, and screens to be similar to the second quarter. They believe AI server sales will increase, and they aim for a triple-digit growth in AI server revenue for the whole year. Wistron is also changing its production plans because of the new US tariffs.

**Ministry of Labor Expands Rules for Stopping Work After Accidents and Fires**

After recent serious accidents and fires at companies like Far Eastern New Century and Shin Kong Mitsukoshi in Taichung, Taiwan's Ministry of Labor is changing its rules. The goal is to prevent more accidents in workplaces.

The Ministry has updated how it defines "work stoppage." If a serious accident happens because safety equipment is not good, other areas in the same workplace that have similar dangers will also be stopped. For example, if a worker falls in an elevator shaft, all elevator shafts in that building will be stopped for safety checks. If a part of a building's outer wall scaffolding collapses, all other scaffolding on that building's outer walls will also be stopped.

Also, if a company has two workplace accidents within three years, the specific parts of their projects where the accidents happened will be stopped. The company will then need to review how they manage safety. If there is a fire or explosion, any related areas in that factory or site will be stopped, even if no workers were hurt. This is to find out why the accident happened.

The Ministry will also make sure that company leaders attend meetings to discuss how improvements will be made before work can start again. Work can only resume after all safety problems are fixed. If a company does not follow the work stoppage order, they could face legal action, including jail time or a fine of up to 150,000 New Taiwan Dollars.
