            <h1>Taiwan's Friends at UN Say Its International Role Is Practical, Not Taking Sides</h1>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly debate finished today. Taiwan's allies, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Saint Lucia, asked the United Nations to let Taiwan take part in important ways. The Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, Terrance Drew, said that letting Taiwan help with public health, technology, and emergency aid is a practical thing to do, and it does not mean taking one side over another.</p>
            <p>On the last day of the General Assembly debate, Saint Lucia's Foreign Minister, Alva Baptiste, said that Saint Lucia wants Taiwan to be part of the United Nations system in a meaningful way. He clearly stated that UN Resolution 2758 from 1971 does not stop or remove Taiwan from being involved in the UN.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Drew of Saint Kitts and Nevis spoke on the fifth day of the debate. He said that Taiwan has the ability to help United Nations groups, and it should, but it is not allowed. For example, Taiwan is kept out of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This makes it harder for the world to work together to solve problems.</p>
            <p>He also said that Taiwan helping with public health, technology, and emergency aid is not about favoring anyone. It is simply practical. If we close the door on working together on these important matters, the world will face risks that are too big to handle.</p>
            <p>Drew also explained that the Taiwan Strait is not just a path on a map. It is also a very important connection for business, trade, and people's lives. He said we must encourage calm talks and choose talking instead of fighting when there are disagreements. Having exchanges, trade, and discussions can protect the daily lives of regular people, whether in Taipei or in the two-island country of Saint Kitts and Nevis.</p>
            <p>Over the six days of the General Assembly debate, leaders from countries like the United States, China, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, and Palestine spoke about big international problems and economic issues.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's diplomatic allies, which include Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Paraguay, Marshall Islands, Palau, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Tuvalu, and Eswatini, called on the United Nations to accept Taiwan. They said that UN Resolution 2758 does not take away Taiwan's right to be involved in the UN system.</p>

            <h1>North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Says They Will Never Give Up Nuclear Weapons at UN Talk</h1>
            <p>Today, North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister, Kim Son Gyong, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly. He announced that North Korea will never stop having nuclear weapons. However, he also said that they are still open to solving problems through discussions and diplomacy.</p>
            <p>Kim Son Gyong stated that forcing North Korea to "denuclearize" means asking them to give up their right to govern themselves and their right to exist. He explained that this goes against their country's laws.</p>
            <p>He further added, "We will never give up our nuclear weapons. This is part of our country's laws, our policies, our right as a country, and our right to continue existing. We will not change this view under any circumstances."</p>
            <p>Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stated that he would be willing to talk with the United States if North Korea could keep its nuclear weapons. This information came from the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).</p>
            <p>North Korea first tested a nuclear weapon in 2006. Since then, the United Nations Security Council has put more and more strict punishments on North Korea. These punishments aim to stop North Korea from making nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p>
            <p>Last week at the United Nations, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said that he would work hard to end the ongoing tension and problems with North Korea.</p>

            <h1>Madagascar President Ends Government After Protests Where at Least 22 People Died</h1>
            <p>After many deadly protests about frequent water and power outages, Madagascar's President Rajoelina announced today that he is dissolving the government. The United Nations reported that at least 22 people died and more than 100 people were injured during these protests.</p>
            <p>President Andry Rajoelina said on national television, "I have decided to remove the Prime Minister and the government. The people currently in office will work as temporary ministers until a new government is created." Reuters and AFP news agencies reported this.</p>
            <p>Madagascar is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, off the southeast coast of Africa. The protests have been going on for three days. Young people, known as Generation Z (those born between 1997 and the early 2010s), started these protests, taking ideas from similar demonstrations in Kenya and Nepal.</p>
            <p>These protests are the largest ones in Madagascar in recent years. They also present the biggest problem for President Rajoelina since he was chosen for a second term in 2023.</p>
            <p>In his speech, President Rajoelina also said, "If members of the government did not do what they were supposed to, we accept this and apologize."</p>
            <p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights stated that the people who died or were hurt included protesters and innocent bystanders. They were killed by security forces. Also, some people were killed by other individuals or groups during the widespread violence and stealing that happened after the protests.</p>
