Police in western Germany arrested a 27-year-old man from Bosnia today. They also searched several houses in the area. This is part of an investigation into money for an "Islamist terror attack."

Police and prosecutors said special police arrested the man early this morning in Essen and Dortmund.

They did not share many details about the terror plan, like where or how the attack would happen. The investigation is still ongoing. A German newspaper reported that the man had military training.

Police also searched several homes. The people linked to these homes are currently seen as witnesses. Police first started investigating for fraud, but then found that the money collected was "to pay for an Islamist terror attack."

**Baseball Player's Important Mistake: Coach Says It Was Serious**

In a baseball game yesterday, Fubon Guardians first baseman Gao Jie made a big mistake. He dropped a ball at a key moment, and because of this, his team lost to the Wei Chuan Dragons. The team's coach, Chen Chin-feng, said today that it was a very serious and unnecessary mistake. He added that players need to find ways to deal with bad weather and talk to each other better.

The game was tied 1-1. In the 8th inning, the Guardians' pitcher had problems, allowing hits and walks, filling the bases. Another pitcher came in, and the opposing player hit a ball towards Gao Jie, but he dropped it. After that, the other player hit a hit that scored two runs, and the Guardians lost 1-4.

Coach Chen Chin-feng said it was a big and avoidable error. He explained that even if it was raining, players need to know how to cover the ball and talk to their teammates. He said it's noisy with many fans, but players must communicate clearly. Another player, Fan Guo-chen, was hit by a ball and had to leave the game. Coach Chen said his arm is a bit swollen but not too serious, and he should be fine after resting for one day.

**Taipei City Says Families Can Reapply for Childcare Help After Surprise Visits**

Taipei City has a plan to help families with childcare costs. This plan supports family members who act as caregivers for children. However, a city council member said that some families had their money stopped because city officials made three surprise visits and found no one at home. The Social Welfare Department said that there are rules about how long the money can be given, but families can apply again.

The city council member explained that the "Taipei City Cooperative Care Subsidy Program" has a system for family caregivers. This system wants to encourage older family members to help care for young children, which reduces the family's financial burden. Families can then apply for money from the Social Welfare Department, from NT$2,000 to NT$5,000 per month.

The rules say that if a family member (like a grandmother) finishes caregiver training and gets a certificate, they can apply. The Social Welfare Department visits homes to check that the care is happening. But these visits are sudden, and if no one is home after three tries, the money is stopped.

The city council member gave an example: a grandmother who cared for her 2-year-old granddaughter missed three visits because she was out with her granddaughter, visiting family in another town, or napping. The Social Welfare Department stopped her money. He said these surprise checks cause problems for people because these older family members are not professional caregivers. He asked the city to change the rules to be more flexible.

The Social Welfare Department said that the program started in August 2018. Each year, about 2,400 to 2,500 families apply, and only about 9 to 10 applications are denied because of missed visits. They also said they try to visit when it's good for the family. They plan three visits within one month, not just one. If three visits are missed, the application cannot be approved, but citizens can apply again. The department will then visit again to keep the policy flexible.
