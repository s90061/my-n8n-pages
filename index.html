The 90-day grace period for US tariffs is ending on July 9th. US President Donald Trump announced on July 3rd that he might start sending letters as early as tomorrow. These letters will tell countries that don't have trade deals with the US how much they will need to pay in tariffs.

In early April, Trump put high tariffs on many countries, from 11% to 50%, which caused problems in global markets. He then announced a 90-day pause, with only a 10% tariff. Countries used this time to talk with the US, hoping to get lower rates.

Trump has said many times recently that he will not extend this grace period. According to him, the US has already made deals with the UK, China, and Vietnam.

**US and Iran May Talk About Nuclear Program Next Week**

Reports say that the US plans to have talks with Iran next week in Oslo, Norway, about Iran's nuclear program. An Iranian official stated today that Iran is open to talks if the US promises not to use military force against them.

Axios, an American news website, reported this information, citing two sources. They said that Steve Witkoff, the White House special envoy for the Middle East, plans to meet with Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister and chief negotiator, in Oslo next week. The exact date for the talks is not yet set, and neither the Iranian nor the US government has confirmed the report.

Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, told NBC News today that "we support diplomatic solutions." He also added that the US needs to "make us believe that while we are negotiating, they will not use force."

**China Increases Military Activity Near Taiwan Before Drills; US Calls It 'Unreasonable'**

Before Taiwan's Han Kuang military exercises, China has increased its military actions near Taiwan. The US State Department said today that China's military pressure near Taiwan is "unreasonable" and only makes tensions worse, harming peace in the Taiwan Strait. The State Department asked Beijing to stop actions that could cause instability.

Taiwan's "Han Kuang No. 41" live-fire exercises will happen from July 9th to 18th. The Chinese military has been increasing its harassment of Taiwan. For example, from 6 AM on July 2nd to 6 AM on July 3rd, Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense detected 41 Chinese aircraft.

A US State Department spokesperson told CNA that the US always cares about peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. This is seen as very important for global safety and success.
