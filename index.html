            <h1>Shin-Shin Bus Chairman Quits and Apologizes After Bus Kills Doctor</h1>
            <p>A driver from Shin-Shin Bus company hit and killed a doctor from Taoyuan General Hospital yesterday in Taipei. Today, the chairman of Shin-Shin Bus, Mr. Fan Da-wei, held a meeting with reporters. He said he would leave his job and said sorry. He thinks the accident happened because the driver did not stop and look carefully before turning at the corner.</p>
            <p>Dr. Zhou Jia-zheng, a breast cancer doctor at Taoyuan General Hospital, was crossing the street in Taipei on the morning of July 19. A bus hit him, and he died. Shin-Shin Bus held a press conference today. Mr. Fan Da-wei said that the company will take responsibility for what happened. He also said sorry to everyone and offered to leave his job.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fan said that the driver's last name is Li. He is 63 years old and has been driving for almost 20 years. He has never broken any traffic rules. But he had 1 or 2 big mistakes when he did not stop at a bus stop.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fan said that after watching the video, it seems the driver was not tired. The driver was not driving too fast and did not turn wrongly. Mr. Fan believes the biggest and most serious mistake was not doing the "finger check." It might be that there were no other cars on the road at that time. So, the driver did not properly follow the rule to "stop, do a finger check, and then drive" when turning at a corner. He might have tried to do things quickly.</p>
            <p>He explained that the driver's view can be blocked by parts of the bus, like the A-pillar. This creates blind spots where the driver cannot see. Because of this, drivers must stop at places where people cross the street and at turning corners. They must use their fingers to check from left to right to make sure it is safe. This rule has been in place for a long time. It is sad that some drivers still do not follow it carefully.</p>
            <p>Shin-Shin Bus also said that they have about 485 drivers. Four of these drivers are over 65 years old. Forty-nine drivers are between 60 and 65 years old. The driver who caused the accident is 63 years old. He asked for his retirement money in March this year and started working for the company again in May.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Adds Special Lines and Sound Signals for Blind People to Cross Roads Safely</h1>
            <p>The government of Taichung City has drawn special lines for blind people near Huiming School. There are three white lines that help blind people use their white canes to find their way. The city also put in traffic lights that make sounds like crickets, birds, and cuckoos. These changes help children who cannot see well to walk home safely.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung City Traffic Bureau shared some news. Mr. Yeh Chao-fu, the head of the bureau, said that these special lines for blind people, sound signals, and Braille buttons on bus stop lights help blind people move around easily. These changes also teach drivers to slow down and let people cross when they see the special lines or hear the sounds from the traffic lights. The Traffic Bureau has made traffic better around schools, not just at Huiming School. They have also added signs that make drivers slow down and made sidewalks safer. They want to make sure all transport places are safe for everyone to use.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yeh said that traffic improvements around schools are now finished at 63 places where people often had accidents. Also, 140 places near schools have been made safer. To help blind people use public buses easily, there is a special app called "Taichung Go - Accessible Version." This app works with the bus stop system. When a blind person opens the app near a bus stop that has a special light, the app will speak to them. It will tell them to turn on the service light using their phone. This means they don't have to look for the button inside the bus stop.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tsai Min-ling, the principal of Huiming School, said that more than 60 students in the school have problems with their eyes or other health issues that affect their sight. With the children from the children's home and care home, there are almost 300 people. The school often helps blind students go to shops or parks to move by themselves and join in activities. Blind students in wheelchairs take more time to cross the road. So, the Traffic Bureau added a countdown timer at red lights. This helps them know how much time they have to cross. They also put up school area signs and lines that tell drivers to slow down. The special lines for blind people and sound signals help blind students know where they are, making it safer to cross the road.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fei Jun-hong, who manages things at Huiming School, said, "For blind students, it's like living in a world without lights. The special lines for blind people and sound signals are not just about fixing the roads." He said these changes also show that people in the city understand and respect blind people and people with disabilities.</p>

            <h1>"Push & Pull" Dance Show Amazes People at Avignon Festival</h1>
            <p>When two people are against each other, what do "pushing" and "pulling" mean? Is it love, hate, or giving up? Hung Dance company has won many awards for their dances. Now, they are in France for the Avignon Arts Festival for the third time. Their dance for two people, called "Push & Pull," makes everyday movements look like poetry. After some struggle, it helps to calm the very deep and close feelings between people.</p>
            <p>Hung Dance had 40 shows that were completely full at the Festival OFF Avignon in 2022 (with their show "See You") and in 2023 (with "BIRDY"). Now, in 2025, they are back for the third time, showing Taiwan's art. They brought their dance "Push & Pull," which recently won prizes in the Netherlands (RIDCC) and Germany (Hanover Choreography Competition). They will perform this show at the La Condition des Soies theater from July 5 to July 26.</p>
            <p>The description of "Push & Pull" in the show's book sounds very interesting: "Love does not always bring people closer, and hate does not always push them away." This dance, which lasts 45 minutes and is for two dancers, changes common actions of pushing and pulling. It gives them new meanings at surprising times. This makes the two dancers play with how they control each other, and it changes all the time.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lai Hung-chung, who is the director and dance creator for Hung Dance, said in an interview with CNA that movements can show very small changes in feeling. For example, when a dancer suddenly uses a lot of force, a "push" can feel like hitting someone. But if you make the action last longer, a "pull" can become a way of making someone feel better or giving a hug.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lai Hung-chung explained: "When one dancer pushes another dancer down, it doesn't mean they hate each other. My way of creating is not to have clear, hidden meanings that are just like real life. Instead, I want to show things in a way that is not always clear, like a poem. This keeps the feeling of the topic and lets the audience think about it for themselves."</p>
            <p>A person in the audience named BenoÃ®t thought that "Push & Pull" was very graceful and had many different strengths, sometimes quiet and sometimes strong. He told a CNA reporter that he saw "two lives, like animals, trying to understand each other and get to know each other."</p>
            <p>Another audience member, Roxane, loves to dance. She told CNA that modern dance often uses fewer movements to make things simple. But "Push & Pull" is different. "The two dancers use all their skills and try their hardest. They make 'push' and 'pull' create a feeling of being pulled towards something and pushed away from it. This feeling stays through the whole show."</p>
            <p>An audience member named Martine told reporters that she is not used to this kind of unusual dance for two people. But she still thought "Push & Pull" was very beautiful and even peaceful. Many everyday actions where two people are against each other made her feel a connection. She also saw feelings of accepting and being calm.</p>
            <p>MaÃ¯a, who works at the La Condition des Soies theater, specially thanked the Hung Dance team after the show. MaÃ¯a felt comfort and healing when watching "Push & Pull."</p>
            <p>Different people saw "Push & Pull" in different ways. But for Mr. Lai Hung-chung, the most important word for the dance is "giving in."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lai Hung-chung said, "In this dance, there is a part where the dancers measure distance. The two dancers keep measuring the space between them. They use their ears to hear heartbeats or rain sounds. In this part, both dancers must move back a bit to measure more clearly and see the whole picture."</p>
            <p>Mr. Lai Hung-chung said: "I believe that giving in is actually the main idea of 'Push & Pull.' This 'giving in' is not really stepping back. It's about both sides moving back and forth in their positions. Maybe this is like the way people from Taiwan behave."</p>
            <p>The big worldwide performing arts event called "Festival OFF Avignon" in France has 1347 groups from all over the world this year. This includes groups from Taiwan, such as Hung Dance, Melody Dance Company, Body Practice, FOCASA Circus, Ping-Ying Dance Company, and the Drama Department from Lunghwa University of Science and Technology.</p>
