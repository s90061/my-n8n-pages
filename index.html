A drunk passenger fell from the platform at Shicheng Station today. This happened before a local train arrived. The passenger rolled into a ditch next to the platform and was not hit by the train.

This incident caused trains between Fulong and Dali to use only one track for a while. Taiwan Railways reported that two trains were affected, causing a total delay of 52 minutes. Services are now back to normal.

The passenger was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Police finished their work, and both tracks were open again at 4:05 PM.
