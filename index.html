            <h1>Liwu River Landslide Lake Can Be Dug to Divert Water; Ministry of Agriculture Explains Differences with Matai'an River</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said today that the landslide dam lake in Hualien's Liwu River will be dug to let water flow out. This lake is different from the Matai'an River landslide dam lake. The Liwu River lake is smaller. People and vehicles can easily reach it. Construction machines can get to the dam quickly to help with disaster prevention. This means they can dig to lower the water level.</p>
            <p>A slope collapsed 950 meters along the Swallow Grotto Trail in Taroko National Park, creating the landslide lake. Early this morning, the lake water flowed over Provincial Highway 8's Jinheng Tunnel. Now, the water is flowing back into the main part of the Liwu River in a steady way.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture shared new photos on its Facebook page. They said that because the danger is less now, they plan to send excavators today. These machines will dig into the dam to let water out. This will keep the river flowing along its usual path in the Liwu River.</p>
            <p>People wondered why the Swallow Grotto landslide lake in the Liwu River could be dug to reduce water, but the Matai'an River landslide lake could not. The Ministry of Agriculture explained the reasons in a post. They showed three differences between the two lakes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture stated that the two landslide lakes are very different in size. The Matai'an River landslide lake dam is 200 meters high. It has 200 million cubic meters of earth and rocks. It can hold 91 million tons of water. The Swallow Grotto landslide lake dam is 54 meters high. It has 400,000 cubic meters of earth and sand. It can hold 2.7 million tons of water. If you compare them, the Swallow Grotto lake's dam is only 0.2% the size of the Matai'an River lake's dam.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture also said that the Matai'an River landslide lake is in the deep mountains, 1000 meters above sea level. There are no roads to it. It takes 5 days just to walk in and out. But the Swallow Grotto landslide lake is right next to Provincial Highway 8. People and vehicles can get there easily, and machines can start work quickly.</p>
            <p>Regarding how difficult it is to deal with, the Ministry of Agriculture explained that the Matai'an River landslide lake is over 13 kilometers from the river below. The river valley is narrow and steep, with big drops. Building a temporary road would take at least three months. Also, it is still rainy season before November. However, the Swallow Grotto landslide lake is small and close to Provincial Highway 8 at Swallow Grotto. Construction machines can get to the dam quickly to do work that reduces danger.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture reminded people that the road from Jinheng Tunnel to Swallow Grotto on Provincial Highway 8 is still a dangerous area. The highway authority has put traffic controls in place. People should not go into the area or get close to the river valley to watch, to avoid accidents.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Legislative Council Election at Year-End; Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Says No 'Blessed List'</h1>
            <p>The Hong Kong Legislative Council will hold its election at the end of this year. Recently, many current members have decided not to run again. The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China published an article on October 17. It said that it is normal for Legislative Council members to change in an election. All qualified candidates will start competing equally. There will be no "blessed list" or "special treatment" for anyone.</p>
            <p>On October 17, the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office published an article signed "Gang Ao Ping." It said that in past Legislative Council elections, "people who opposed China and caused trouble in Hong Kong, and agents of foreign enemy forces, used weaknesses in the old election system. They entered the Legislative Council and caused problems and destruction." The 7th Legislative Council election took place in December 2021. The rule of "patriots governing Hong Kong" was put into practice, and the Legislative Council returned to its proper way of working.</p>
            <p>The article also mentioned what Hong Kong media has reported. As the time for election nominations gets closer, some current members have said they will not run again for different reasons. At the same time, some political groups and organizations have announced they will try hard to win seats. Also, new people from different areas and groups have said they are thinking about running and getting ready for the election.</p>
            <p>The article stated that "changing members in an election in an orderly way is normal for the Legislative Council. It is one of the true meanings of democracy." It also needs to be said that under the new election system, the election is about choosing good and capable people. It especially focuses on fair and healthy competition. "Any candidate who is confirmed as qualified through legal steps will compete from the same starting line. There is no 'blessed list,' and no one gets 'special treatment'."</p>
            <p>The article said that this election will surely choose Legislative Council members who are more patriotic, more firm in their support for Hong Kong, younger, more professional, and better at new ideas and creativity.</p>
            <p>The Hong Kong Legislative Council will have its election in December. The time for nominations will start on October 24. It is widely rumored in Hong Kong political circles that Beijing wants the Legislative Council to be younger. It is possible that no current Legislative Council members over 70 years old will remain.</p>
            <p>Mr. Liu Siu-kai, an advisor to the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, recently spoke to Hong Kong media. He said that both the central government in Beijing and everyone in society want the Legislative Council to become younger. Under the rule of "patriots governing Hong Kong," there are no "anti-China and anti-Hong Kong" members. This means that older members, who were good at fighting and had experience in struggles, might not be as necessary to lead younger members to fight against anti-China forces.</p>
            <p>Also, it is rumored in political circles that those who will not run again include members who have not performed well in the council, those who speak their minds more, and party members in the Election Committee section.</p>
            <p>So far, 15 current Legislative Council members have said they will not run again. Eight of them are over 70 years old. There are also many members in their 30s and 40s.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily reported earlier that Chinese companies will actively send people to run. Several Hong Kong delegates to the National People's Congress are planning to run in the election.</p>

            <h1>US Media: Trump Refused to Give Zelenskyy Tomahawk Missiles; Meeting Atmosphere Was Poor</h1>
            <p>Axios news reported, citing two people who know about the meeting, that today, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy tried hard to get Tomahawk missiles from US President Trump. But Trump said no. After the meeting, Zelenskyy had a video call with European leaders. The European leaders were confused because Trump's attitude had changed again.</p>
            <p>The report said that Zelenskyy had hoped to get a promise of new weapons for Ukraine when he left Washington. But he found that Trump's ideas had completely changed after Trump spoke with Russian President Putin yesterday.</p>
            <p>According to people who knew about the talk between the two leaders, Trump said that his main focus now is diplomacy. He believed that giving Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine at this time might hurt diplomatic efforts.</p>
            <p>One source described today's meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy as "not easy." Another person directly said it was "bad."</p>
            <p>The sources said that no one raised their voice during the meeting. But Trump was very firm. "Trump made some strong statements during the meeting, and sometimes he seemed a bit emotional."</p>
            <p>During the meeting, Trump briefly told Zelenskyy about his phone call with Putin yesterday. He also stressed that the US's current diplomatic solution is to "freeze" the current control lines between Russia and Ukraine on the battlefield to end the war. However, stopping the war based on the current control lines is a plan that Ukraine finds hard to accept.</p>
            <p>The report said that the 2.5-hour meeting ended suddenly. Trump said, "I think we'll stop here and see what happens next week." This likely referred to upcoming talks between the US and Russia. Trump plans to meet Russian President Putin in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, within two weeks.</p>
            <p>However, after the meeting, Trump wrote on his social media platform "Truth Social." He called the meeting "interesting" and "friendly." He said he had told Zelenskyy and Putin, "It's time to stop this," and "Let both sides claim victory, and let history judge!"</p>
            <p>Trump then went to Mar-a-Lago and did not answer questions from the media. After finishing his meeting with Trump, Zelenskyy quickly had a video conference with several European leaders. According to someone who was in that meeting, some European leaders were confused by Trump's clear change in attitude.</p>
            <p>Soon after, European leaders started to release strong statements supporting Ukraine. Axios believes this shows that today's meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy was not successful.</p>
            <p>Before meeting Trump, Zelenskyy's chief of staff told Axios that Zelenskyy's main goal for this trip was not just to get Tomahawk missiles. He also wanted Trump to promise various weapons systems that Ukraine badly needed.</p>
            <p>When answering media questions, Zelenskyy confirmed that they did talk about Tomahawk missiles. But he said that he and Trump had decided not to share the details publicly, because the US wanted to avoid making the situation worse. When asked if he was still hopeful about getting Tomahawk missiles, Zelenskyy replied, "I am practical."</p>
            <p>But sources said that actually, Zelenskyy tried very hard to get Tomahawk missiles during the meeting. However, Trump refused firmly, giving no room for discussion.</p>
            <p>One source who knew about the Ukraine-Europe video conference revealed that British Prime Minister Keir Starmer suggested working with the United States. He proposed using Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza as a model to create a peace plan for Ukraine.</p>
