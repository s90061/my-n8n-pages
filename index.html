The children's TV show "After School Journey" went to Norway, a country that cares a lot about the environment. The host, Yao Ai-ning, and three primary school students experienced life in the Arctic. They learned how to deal with "poop problems" and saw how drones are used to herd reindeer. This episode will be shown on the "Little PTS" channel tonight.

According to a press release from PTS, Yao Ai-ning and the team went with local students to a forest island. They tried camping without electricity. During the day, they found mushrooms, made fires, and set up tents. At night, there were no power outlets or heaters. Surprisingly, the students said, "This was the warmest night!" Yao Ai-ning didn't know whether to laugh or cry. She said, "Because you left me alone in the big tent and all went to the small tent to keep warm!"

An interesting fact is that there are no public toilets in Norway's protected areas. Many tourists cause a "poop problem," which pollutes the environment. So, Yao Ai-ning became a "poop detective" with a park ranger. They walked with the children and found a lot of left-behind poop and toilet paper in the wild. Because of this, Norwegians give out "poop bags" that people can use to collect their waste and take it with them. This helps keep the park clean.

Also, Yao Ai-ning's team traveled north to the Arctic Circle. They saw how the Sami people, who inspired "Frozen," live. They learned how the Sami people's reindeer herding culture is changing with the weather and new technology. The Sami people even put speakers on drones to control the reindeer with sound.

The Norway episodes of "After School Journey" are shown every Saturday at 7 PM on the Little PTS channel. You can also watch them on PTS+ and the Little PTS YouTube channel.

**Fubon Supports Angel Cup Baseball Game, Invites Special Education Students to Watch Game in Xinzhuang**

The "Angel Cup Baseball Game for People with Disabilities" is now in its sixth year. The Chinese Taipei Baseball and Softball Association for People with Disabilities organizes this event. The Fubon Charity Foundation announced that they will join as a partner this year. Today, they invited students from special education programs to Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium to cheer for the Fubon Guardians team.

The "Angel Cup" helps students with disabilities enjoy baseball. This year, the baseball game will be on December 7th. Because the Fubon Charity Foundation is now involved, more than ten teams have signed up for the "Angel Cup." Schools and groups from northern, central, southern, and eastern Taiwan will join.

Pan Wei-chieh, the chairman of the disabled baseball association, said, "There's a saying, 'When you have a dream, the whole universe will help you.' We are very thankful to 'Cosmic Fubon' for helping us at this time and encouraging us to hit hard and dream big."

Tsai Ming-chun, the CEO of the Fubon Charity Foundation, said that for many years, the foundation has used its professional sports teams to help with charity work. This year is the first time they are working with the disabled baseball association. This helps ensure that people with disabilities have the right to play sports. By inviting social welfare organizations they have supported for a long time to form teams, they encourage friends with disabilities and children from rural areas to follow their dreams without limits.

Thanks to the Fubon Charity Foundation, Fubon Life, and Fubon Guardians, students and their families from Leshan Children's Home were invited to watch a game at Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium today. Wu Shu-hui, the director of Leshan Children's Home, thanked the disabled baseball association and the Fubon Charity Foundation for inviting and supporting them. This allowed the "Leshan Angels" to experience the excitement of baseball and teamwork up close.

Also, Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium has improved its facilities for people with disabilities this year. They have more seats for wheelchairs and their companions, new ticket booths for easy access, and ramps. The new design for wheelchair and companion seats gives students with disabilities a better experience. The goal is to make watching sports fair and friendly for everyone.
