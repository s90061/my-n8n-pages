            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang Says Pan Men-an Discussed Budget Law; Presidential Office: Don't Confuse the Issue</h1>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, said that Pan Men-an, the President's chief secretary, secretly talked about a law for sharing money between the central government and local governments. Today, the Presidential Office spokesperson, Kuo Ya-hui, said it was a pity that the government's request to review the law again was turned down by other parties. This caused problems for the country and its people. She said it is important to fix this mistake quickly. She also asked Huang Kuo-chang not to change the subject. She believes that if the Taiwan People's Party had agreed to review the law again, this argument would not be happening now.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Huang Kuo-chang said that when they were changing the law about money distribution, President Lai Ching-te asked someone to tell him something. The message was that if Huang's party supported reviewing the money distribution law again, the ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party, would then support Huang's party's version of the law.</p>
            <p>Today, Huang Kuo-chang explained that a lawmaker went to an event at the President's office. After the event, Pan Men-an asked this lawmaker to stay and talk about the issue. When the lawmaker came back, he told Huang about President Lai's offer. Huang said he immediately refused, saying, "No, that's not possible."</p>
            <p>Regarding this, Kuo Ya-hui said it was sad that the opposition parties rejected the government's request to reconsider the law. This caused harm to the country and its people. She said the most important thing now is to fix this mistake quickly.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that the country's money situation, the fair growth of local areas, and the rights of people should not be hurt by bad laws. This applies to all political parties. She asked Huang Kuo-chang again not to distract from the main issue. She said that if the Taiwan People's Party had supported reviewing the law again at that time, there would be no argument today.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Pitchers Sun Yi-lei and Wang Yen-cheng Shine in Japan Baseball League Minor League Game</h1>
            <p>Today, in the second-level league of Japanese baseball, two pitchers from Taiwan played against each other and both did very well. Sun Yi-lei, who plays for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, pitched for 8 innings and did not let the other team score any points. He also struck out 7 players. Wang Yen-cheng, a left-handed pitcher for the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, also pitched for 8 innings and only allowed 1 point. Both had great games.</p>
            <p>In today's game between Rakuten and Nippon-Ham in the second-level league, Sun Yi-lei showed how good he was. For the first 7 innings, he only let one player get on base because of a pitch that hit him, but that player was later out. So, no one from the other team truly reached a base during those innings. He did not let anyone get a hit until the 8th inning, after one out. But then, he got two more players out.</p>
            <p>In total, Sun Yi-lei threw 98 pitches over 8 innings. He only allowed 1 hit and one player was hit by a pitch. He struck out 7 batters. His fastest throw was 152 kilometers per hour. He did not let the other team score any points. His average for earned runs this season in the second-level league is 1.76.</p>
            <p>In the same game, Wang Yen-cheng, the Taiwanese left-handed pitcher for Rakuten, started pitching. He only allowed one point when a player hit a home run in the 3rd inning. He threw 130 pitches over 8 innings. He allowed 8 hits, gave 3 walks, and struck out 5 batters. His fastest throw was 151 kilometers per hour. He only gave up 1 point. His average for earned runs in the second-level league is 3.55.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-hsiang from Rakuten played as the second batter in this game. He hit a double once out of 4 tries. His batting average is now 0.239. Even though the Nippon-Ham team was ahead first, Rakuten tied the game in the 9th inning. In the 10th extra inning, with players on first and second base for Rakuten, Katsura Mizukami hit a double that brought in 2 points, putting Rakuten ahead. In the end, Rakuten's second-level team won the game 3 to 1.</p>

            <h1>Public Groups Protest Taipei City Government's Plan to Remove Gongguan Roundabout; 150 Police Officers Provide Security</h1>
            <p>The government of Taipei City plans to start removing the Gongguan roundabout and filling the bus tunnel under the road at midnight on September 13th. Citizen groups will hold a meeting tonight near the area to speak against the city government's plan to take it down. The Taipei City Police Department will have 150 police officers there to keep everyone safe.</p>
            <p>In late August, the Taipei City Department of Transportation announced a plan to make traffic safer at the intersection of Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road. The work will begin at midnight on September 13th. First, they will fill the tunnel for buses, which will take 44 days. Then, they will remove the roundabout, which will take 21 days. The goal is to change the area into a normal crossroad. They expect to finish by the end of November.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening, more than 10 students from universities like National Taiwan University and National Taiwan Normal University, along with groups that care about road safety, gathered to protest. They shouted phrases like "The project should stop, the democratic city government must talk with us." After their meeting, they held signs and banners and quickly walked around the Gongguan roundabout to show their protest.</p>
            <p>The "Alliance for Zero Pedestrian Deaths" posted news on Facebook about a meeting called "Protect the Roundabout: Walking Tour of the Roundabout." They announced their disagreement with the Taipei City government's plan to remove the Gongguan roundabout, the bus tunnel, and the pedestrian tunnel.</p>
            <p>The alliance said that the Taipei City government decided to start taking down the Gongguan roundabout and bus tunnel on September 13th. This is happening even though many experts, local people, students, and traffic groups have shared their worries and disagreed with the plan for the last six months. The alliance believes the city government is moving forward without enough discussion, facts, or trying out the plan first. They said this shows that Mayor Chiang Wan-an "doesn't listen."</p>
            <p>The alliance also said that tonight, before the construction starts, they will protest at the Gongguan roundabout and the bus tunnel. They are asking all road users who will be affected to come and speak up.</p>
            <p>About the plan to remove the Gongguan roundabout, the Taipei City Police Department said that police from three different areas will work together. They expect to have 150 police officers there to ensure safety.</p>
