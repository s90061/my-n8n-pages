            <h1>Rafaela's Game-Winning Hit Helps Red Sox Beat Tigers, Return to Playoffs After 4 Years</h1>
            <p>On September 26, the Boston Red Sox baseball team won against the Detroit Tigers. Ceddanne Rafaela hit the ball at the end of the game, helping the Red Sox win 4-3. This means the Red Sox will play in the playoffs, which are important games at the end of the season, for the first time since 2021.</p>
            <p>The Red Sox were losing 0-3 at first. But they made a comeback and won. They are now two games ahead of the Tigers and 2.5 games ahead of the Houston Astros in the race for a playoff spot. There are only two regular season games left.</p>
            <p>In the first seven innings, the Red Sox were behind 2-3. Then, in the eighth inning, Jarren Duran hit the ball, which brought in one run and made the score equal.</p>
            <p>In the ninth inning, Romy Gonzalez hit the ball when there was one out. Then, Rafaela hit the ball to the center field wall at Fenway Park. This brought in the winning run for the Red Sox.</p>
            <p>Rafaela said, "This is what I have dreamed of since I was a child."</p>

            <h1>Qishan Banana Festival Begins, Mayor Chen Chi-mai Promotes Good Local Farm Products</h1>
            <p>The 2025 "Qishan Banana Festival" started today at Qishan Sports Park. Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai was there to promote fresh farm products from the area. He also gave awards for the best quality bananas in 2025. He said that Qishan bananas are famous around the world. In the past, Qishan bananas were the most important product Kaohsiung sent to other countries.</p>
            <p>At the start of the event, Mayor Chen showed the new festival mascot, "Auntie Qishan Golden Banana." This mascot follows last year's popular "Uncle Qishan Golden Banana." Mayor Chen and the banana couple helped make the event lively and fun.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen said in his speech, "Kaohsiung city is changing, but Kaohsiung Qishan bananas are still the best tasting bananas in the world." He repeated that Qishan bananas are famous everywhere. He also said that because Qishan bananas were so important for trade, there was a "Banana Pier" in Kaohsiung Port. Now, this Banana Pier will be home to high-tech companies like NVIDIA.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen said that when he has guests from other countries, he always offers them Qishan bananas. He also said that Dashu pineapples and Meinong 147 rice are excellent things to share with foreign friends. He believes these are the best gifts from Taiwan's farms that can be shared with everyone around the world.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen also mentioned that Kaohsiung has worked hard to sell its products to other countries. Earlier this year, at the Tokyo Food Show, they showed Kaohsiung's bananas, pineapples, and jujubes to people from other countries. This lets other countries try Kaohsiung's excellent farm products. He also thanked the Agricultural and Food Agency for helping farmers when they had problems, such as giving money for losses and buying bananas for processing. This helps the banana business and keeps farmers' incomes stable.</p>
            <p>After the event, Mayor Chen walked through the market where small farmers were selling their goods. He tasted fresh Qishan bananas straight from the farm and handmade desserts made with local bananas. He invited everyone to come to Qishan to try the good local flavors.</p>
            <p>The "Qishan Banana Festival" is the last big event of the 2025 Summer Fresh Market. It is happening today and tomorrow at Qishan Sports Park. The festival has 7 main areas: a market for small farmers, free fruit tasting, handmade farm crafts, fun games to learn new things, visits to Qishan's farming culture, a play area for families, and a banana learning room. There are many different things to do.</p>

            <h1>Chairman Chang An-ping Says Imported Cement is Changing Sources, Calls for Government to Address Unfair Competition</h1>
            <p>On September 27, TCC Chairman Chang An-ping said that Taiwan's Ministry of Finance put an extra tax on Portland cement from Vietnam at the end of July this year. This tax is called an anti-dumping duty. However, in August, the amount of cement imported from Indonesia grew by more than 50%. This shows that cement imports are now coming from a different country. This is called a "transfer effect." Chairman Chang said that Taiwan is one of the few countries that does not charge taxes on imported cement. He is asking the government to look at this problem of unfair competition because imported cement does not have to pay carbon fees, but local companies do.</p>
            <p>Chairman Chang was at the opening of the TCC Recycling Center in Hualien today. After the event, he said that the Cement Association and the government talked for 18 months. Finally, the government agreed to put an anti-dumping tax on Portland cement from Vietnam. But he said that only putting taxes on cement from one country will not solve the main problem.</p>
            <p>He explained that, according to the customs office, from January to August this year, the amount of cement and clinker (a part of cement) imported from Vietnam went down by 10% compared to last year. But the amount from Indonesia went up by 54%. This means that after the government put the anti-dumping tax on Vietnamese cement in July, companies started to import cement from other places. According to China Cement Net, the Indonesian cement market includes 9 million tons from China's Conch Cement and 7 million tons from Red Lion Cement.</p>
            <p>Chairman Chang also said that Taiwan is one of the few countries that charges zero import taxes on cement. Local companies in Taiwan must pay a carbon fee, but imported cement does not have to pay this fee. He said, "The carbon from imported cement is counted as Taiwan's carbon, but when we export our products, we still have to pay carbon fees. This is very unfair."</p>
            <p>He mentioned that for government building projects, the rules say that all cement used in one project must come from the same place. This helps make sure the quality is the same and the building is safe. TCC's cement from its Heping and Suao factories can be traced back to its origin and follows these rules. However, imported cement comes from many different places and it is hard to know where it comes from. But a lot of this imported cement is still being sold in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chairman Chang said that imported cement often comes in large bags for concrete factories. When workers unload it, a lot of dust can be created, which pollutes the air around the area. If the government does not check and manage this more carefully, there could be problems with the quality of imported cement and harm to the environment. This would also make it harder for local companies to compete fairly.</p>
            <p>TCC is asking the government to make imported cement companies show how much carbon they produce. They also suggest the government think about charging a carbon fee or making a "Taiwan CBAM," which is a carbon border adjustment plan. This way, the hard work of local industries will not be wasted.</p>
            <p>Also, when asked about the fire at San Yuan Energy and the company's future for the last three months of the year, Chairman Chang only said that for San Yuan Energy, they need to wait for the fire investigation report before they can get insurance money. He did not want to say more. However, he clearly stated that TCC's businesses in Taiwan, mainland China, and Europe are stable. But the fire at San Yuan Energy has greatly affected TCC's profits.</p>
