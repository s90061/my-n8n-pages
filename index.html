            <h1>Slow Cleanup of Damaged Solar Panels in Yizhu: Government to Help Companies Speed Up</h1>
            <p>Chiayi County, July 25 (CNA) â€“ In Yizhu Township, Chiayi County, solar power panels at the Xinzhuang retention pond were badly damaged by Typhoon Danas. However, the company is slow in cleaning them up. Premier Cho Jung-tai visited today and was quite unhappy. He asked the company to tell the government if they have any problems, and the government will help.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai, along with Minister of Economic Affairs Guo Zhi-hui, Minister of Environment Peng Ke-ming, and Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker Cai Yi-yu, visited Budai's Xinwen and Yizhu's Xinzhuang retention ponds in Chiayi County. They came to see how the damaged solar panels from Typhoon Danas were being cleaned up.</p>
            <p>In Xinwen, the work to clean up the damaged solar panels is going as expected by the government and will soon be finished. But in Yizhu, most of the damaged solar panels are still stuck in the retention pond. This made Premier Cho Jung-tai very unhappy. He told the Thai company in charge of this solar power plant to handle it quickly. He also said that if they face any problems, they should tell the government, and the government will help. The government will not just ask when the cleanup will be done.</p>
            <p>Guo Zhi-hui also told the Thai company that the land around the Xinzhuang retention pond belongs to Taiwan Sugar Corporation. So, the damaged solar panels can be stored there for a while. If the company needs more machines or workers for the cleanup, the Ministry of Economic Affairs can help. He urged them not to delay any longer.</p>
            <p>Cai Yi-yu told CNA reporters that the solar panel company in Yizhu is from Thailand. They might not know much about how to do rescue work after a disaster in Taiwan, which is why there was a delay. The Thai company said they also want to clean it up quickly but cannot find companies to help with the cleanup.</p>
            <p>After checking the solar panel cleanup, Premier Cho Jung-tai and Guo Zhi-hui went to the memorial hall for Li Yuan-han, a 36-year-old employee of Taiwan Power Company's Chiayi office, who died while working. They gave their condolences to his family and offered money to help them. Taiwan Power Company Chairman Zeng Wen-sheng, Chiayi County Deputy Magistrate Liu Pei-dong, and Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers Chen Guan-ting, Cai Yi-yu, and Wang Mei-hui also visited the memorial hall today to show their respect.</p>

            <h1>Philippine Supreme Court: Vice President Sara's Impeachment Process Is Against the Rules</h1>
            <p>Manila, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte was facing a process in Congress to remove her from office. This was because of accusations like corruption and threatening to kill the president. Today, the Philippine Supreme Court said that this process is against the country's rules. This is because it breaks the rule that says you cannot try to remove the same official more than once in one year.</p>
            <p>Camille Ting, a spokesperson for the Philippine Supreme Court, announced in a press conference today that the House of Representatives' process to remove Sara Duterte from office should be stopped. This is based on the "one-year rule" in the constitution.</p>
            <p>The "one-year rule" means that people or groups cannot try to remove the same high-level official from office more than once in a year.</p>
            <p>Sara Duterte welcomed the Supreme Court's decision today. The Senate, which was in charge of the impeachment case, also said it "must" respect the Supreme Court's decision.</p>
            <p>In December last year, several groups in the Philippines accused Sara of breaking the constitution, corruption, not doing her public duty well, and threatening to kill the president. They sent three different requests to the House of Representatives to remove her from office.</p>
            <p>In February this year, the House of Representatives voted to remove Sara. They combined the accusations into a fourth request and sent it to the Senate. According to the Philippine constitution, the House of Representatives starts the removal process, and the Senate hears the case.</p>
            <p>In May this year, the Philippines held its mid-term elections. All more than 300 seats in the House of Representatives were re-elected, and 12 of the 24 seats in the Senate were also re-elected. This meant the removal process went across different terms of Congress.</p>
            <p>Sara's lawyers already questioned if the fourth removal request was against the rules in February. They said that the first three requests had already been voted on at the committee level in the House of Representatives, which started the removal process.</p>
            <p>In June, the lawyers again argued that the removal process should not continue across different terms of Congress. They asked the Supreme Court to temporarily stop the removal process and to say that the requests were not valid.</p>
            <p>Camille Ting explained in the press conference today that the House of Representatives did not act on the first three removal requests. So, when the previous session ended, it was like those requests were rejected. This means the fourth removal request was like trying to remove her again. Since the House of Representatives put these three requests on file on February 5th this year, no one can try to remove Sara again until February 6th next year.</p>
            <p>Sara is a popular choice for the Philippine presidential election in 2028. If the removal case had passed in the Senate, she would have lost her position as Vice President and would not be able to hold public office again for the rest of her life.</p>
            <p>According to a survey by the Philippine survey group "Social Weather Stations" (SWS) released on July 15th, 61% of people "trust Sara very much."</p>
