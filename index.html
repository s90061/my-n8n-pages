            <h1>Nieboen Chorus Wins Gold at Japan Choral Competition, Excitedly Makes Chest-Framing Gesture</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Dai Yazhen, Tokyo, July 28) A Taiwanese choir went to Japan for the Tokyo International Choral Competition. China protested and asked them to remove their national flag. Also, their name was changed from "Taiwan" to "Chinese Taipei." However, on July 27, the Nieboen Chorus from Kaohsiung won a gold medal in the folk music category with a high score. When the choir members heard the news at a dinner party, they became very excited. They repeatedly made a gesture by drawing a frame on their chests, meaning, "There are no words there, but everyone understands."</p>
            <p>After the organizers received the protest on July 26, they quickly told the Taiwanese team that they had to take down their national flag, which was hanging in the Dai-ichi Life Hall. Their name for going on stage also had to change from Taiwan to Chinese Taipei.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's office in Japan, the choir, and Legislator Chiu Yi-Ying, who came with them, worked hard to talk with the organizers. In the end, the organizers still decided to change the team's name to "Chinese Taipei" by themselves. They also decided not to hang flags from any of the participating countries. But the issue of taking down the flag did not stop the choir from performing well. The Nieboen Chorus finally won the gold medal in the folk music category with a high score.</p>
            <p>When the members of the Nieboen Chorus heard the news at the dinner party, everyone there became very excited. They jumped up, high-fived each other to celebrate, shouted "Taiwan number one," and made the chest-framing gesture.</p>
            <p>The Nieboen Chorus also posted a message on their Facebook page to thank their fans. They said, "This trip to Japan was not easy. During the competition, unexpected challenges surprised us. But we chose not to give up or back down." They also said, "This gold medal is not just for us. It belongs to all of you who believe that 'culture deserves to be sung out loud'."</p>
            <p>The fan page also showed a certificate with the word "Taiwan" written on it. It is known that the organizers made two types of certificates: one with "Chinese Taipei" and one with "Taiwan." Both were given to the Nieboen Chorus.</p>
            <p>On the evening of July 27, the Nieboen Chorus was invited to perform at a friendly gathering between Taiwan and Japan. This event was organized by the Kaohsiung Medical University Alumni Association in Japan. Taiwan's representative in Japan, Li Yi-yang, Legislator Chiu Yi-Ying, and Central News Agency Chairman Li Yong-de, among others, attended the event.</p>
            <p>Li Yi-yang spoke to the Central News Agency. He said that China used its political power in a mean and rough way to spoil music, which made people very angry. He said that besides protesting to the organizers, they must also strongly criticize China for bringing politics into music.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that China's actions to suppress Taiwan are useless. This is because "Taiwan is Taiwan, and China is China." This is a truth that cannot be changed. Taiwan is known and liked by all democratic countries in the world for its advanced technology and its free and democratic society. Its performances in culture and arts are also noticed worldwide, especially in international choral competitions, where Taiwan has won many world championships.</p>
            <p>Li Yi-yang said, "Taiwan uses our voices and feelings to reach all parts of the world. This lets the world hear Taiwan, see Taiwan, and love Taiwan. In the future, we will continue this effort and not be affected by China's pressure. We will show our strong spirit, so Taiwan can go to the world and be recognized by the world."</p>
