            <h1>Why China's Good Economic Numbers Don't Feel Good to People</h1>
            <p>China's economy grew by 5.3% in the first half of the year. This looks like a good result, especially with problems from tariffs. However, most people don't feel that the economy is doing well. An economics expert explained that this is because the "nominal GDP" only grew by 4.3%. Also, the economy is split into different parts, and money is not shared equally. This shows that China's economy is in a more serious situation than thought.</p>
            <p>On August 4, a WeChat account called "Chief Economist Forum" published an analysis of China's economic data from the first half of the year. This analysis was written by Zhao Jian, who is the head of Xijing Research Institute.</p>
            <p>Zhao Jian said that the data for the first half of the year showed that the effects of the tariff war were less than expected. Exports continued to support half of the economy. Also, new policies helped a lot. The government released different kinds of bonds earlier than planned, and big projects were started as much as possible. These efforts helped to reach the 5.3% economic growth rate.</p>
            <p>So, why do people feel differently about the economy compared to the official numbers? Zhao Jian said that while the "real GDP" grew by 5.3% in the first half, the "nominal GDP" only grew by 4.3%. By the second quarter of this year, China's GDP deflator (which compares nominal and real GDP) had been negative for nine quarters in a row. The deflator in the second quarter was even lower than in the first. This means the economy is facing a lot of pressure from deflation, which is when prices go down.</p>
            <p>Nominal GDP is the GDP calculated using current market prices for a certain period. It includes the prices of goods and services.</p>
            <p>Since the GDP deflator has been negative for nine quarters, it means that prices have been going down for more than two years. Zhao Jian said that when prices generally fall and there is deflation, the actual amount of debt people owe becomes bigger. This leads to many businesses going bankrupt and many people losing their jobs. It also makes the problem of not enough demand and too much supply worse.</p>
            <p>Zhao Jian also pointed out that how people feel about the economy depends on their job, their field, and their age. Falling prices hurt private businesses, small businesses, and companies that sell to customers more than they hurt state-owned companies, large companies, and companies that supply materials. Falling prices are better for retired people who get a fixed pension than for young people who just started working. They hurt middle-class people with a lot of debt the most.</p>
            <p>Industries that benefited the middle class, like real estate, tutoring, and digital platforms, are now shrinking because of economic cycles and government policies. White-collar middle-class people are also facing financial difficulties. Especially those with high debt will feel the pain of society changing even more strongly.</p>
            <p>Zhao Jian stated that even with the same 5.3% GDP growth, the money from government policies did not flow evenly. The money mainly went to large state-owned companies, the government, banks, and a very small number of people. However, in the past, when growth helped everyone, it was driven by industries like real estate, which benefited more than 50 different types of businesses.</p>
            <p>Finally, Zhao Jian said that the 5.3% growth in the first half of the year used up a lot of future policy support. The risks from the trade war between China and the US are also delayed. If government policies start to be reduced and the break in the China-US trade war ends, then it will be very hard to keep the economy stable in the second half of the year. If the housing market does not become stable again, the overall economy in the second half of the year will likely not improve much.</p>
            <p>He believes that China's economic situation is actually very urgent. In the second half of the year, the government needs to introduce stronger policies for housing and consumer spending. This is necessary to successfully complete this year's goals, which include not only reaching 5% GDP growth but also making sure the CPI (Consumer Price Index) is close to 2%. This was the official goal set at the beginning of the year, and it should not be much lower.</p>

            <h1>Li Chun: Comparing Taiwan-US Tariff Talks to "Black Box" Trade Agreement is Wrong</h1>
            <p>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) announced in a press release that its spokesperson, Han Ying, talked with Li Chun today. Li Chun is the current representative to the EU and will soon leave his post. They spoke on a live show called "Wu Qing LIVE." Li Chun said that temporary tariffs are common in international trade. Also, signing a non-disclosure agreement during trade talks is needed for talks to be quick and efficient. So, comparing this to the "black box" (hidden) Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement is clearly incorrect.</p>
            <p>Li Chun stated that "temporary tariffs" or "temporary trade agreements" are very common in international trade. For example, when the EU and Canada signed their Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the EU has 27 member countries. The agreement was "provisional" until all member countries approved it.</p>
            <p>Some members of the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) have questioned if the tariff non-disclosure agreement is a "black box." Li Chun explained that all trade talks involve signing a non-disclosure agreement. This is to build trust between the two sides, prevent information from leaking, and stop the talks from being affected. Also, both sides have people who care about the outcome. To make the talks efficient and on time, it is necessary to keep the agreement secret until it is finalized.</p>
            <p>Li Chun said that comparing the current tariff talks to the "Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement" from before is clearly wrong.</p>
            <p>He gave examples from before, during, and after the talks. Before the Service Trade Agreement, people didn't know who Taiwan was talking with. But for the Taiwan-US tariff talks, everyone knew in April, and many people wanted the government to talk quickly. So, the "before" part was different. Also, announcing who you are talking with is important. The Service Trade Agreement was with China, which is very sensitive, but it was not revealed. For the Taiwan-US talks, the US is an important friend to Taiwan, and everyone knows about it. So, the sensitivity of the other party is also different.</p>
            <p>He explained that during the Service Trade Agreement, people didn't know what was happening. But during the Taiwan-US talks, the government has announced how many times officials traveled, when they left, and when they came back. After the talks, the agreement will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. President Lai Ching-te also said it would definitely go to the Legislative Yuan for approval, following democratic rules. The Service Trade Agreement tried to pass quickly in 3 minutes at the last moment, with a group vote, without letting people know the details. So, when you compare the before, during, and after stages, the Service Trade Agreement is clearly not like the Taiwan-US tariff talks.</p>
            <p>Li Chun warned that the United States might still change the tariffs that have already been agreed upon. This has happened before, for example, with Mexico and Canada.</p>
            <p>Li Chun also pointed out ways to deal with the impact of US tariffs. First, Taiwanese companies need to make their products better so they can keep their share in the US market. Second, they can think about moving their focus to the European market. Third, the government must help companies understand the European market. Fourth, improving product quality can reduce the effects of tariffs.</p>
            <p>Regarding Chinese company BYD's attempt to sell cars in Taiwan by claiming they were made in a third country, Li Chun said that if Chinese electric cars enter Taiwan, there are not only product competition issues but also national security concerns about the electronic parts. Taiwan should still stop them, even if they try to hide where they were made.</p>
            <p>Li Chun suggested that rules should be made for products and where they come from. For example, electric cars are high-risk products. If they are from a Chinese brand, they should be banned. For the country of origin, Li Chun used Brexit as an example and said that it needs to be looked at and discussed more carefully.</p>
            <p>Han Ying called for everyone to support the government, which is working hard. She hopes that all political parties will work together to support the negotiation team and achieve the best result.</p>

            <h1>Truck Driver Gets Electric Shock, Taiwan Railways Between Hukou and Xinfeng Temporarily Closed</h1>
            <p>This afternoon, a truck was driving over a railway crossing between Hukou and Xinfeng on the Taiwan Railways line. The truck's cargo was too tall and got stuck. The driver tried to fix it but accidentally got an electric shock and was taken to the hospital. This caused both train tracks in that area to be closed for a while. Taiwan Railways said that after the railway police handled the situation, both tracks are now open for trains again.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways Company sent a message saying that today at 2:45 PM, at the Tangrong railway crossing (K94+787) between Hukou and Xinfeng in Hsinchu, a truck's cargo was too tall when it went under a height limit gate and got stuck. The driver got an electric shock while trying to free it. An ambulance took him to the hospital at 2:58 PM.</p>
            <p>This event temporarily stopped trains on both tracks between Hukou and Xinfeng. Taiwan Railways said that after the railway police dealt with the situation, trains started running normally on both tracks between Xinfeng and Hukou at 3:38 PM.</p>
