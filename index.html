**Taiwan's new AI supercomputer Nano5, Compal, ASE and other Taiwanese manufacturers adopt its computing power**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%96%B0ai%E8%B6%85%E7%B4%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6nano5-%E4%BB%81%E5%AF%B6%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%B0%E5%BB%A0%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B-073107510.html">News Link</a>

(Central News Agency, Taipei, June 24) The National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) held a press conference today to showcase the achievements of its new generation national AI supercomputer, Nano 5, in driving innovation and upgrading the semiconductor industry. Industry and academic institutions such as Compal Electronics, ASE Technology Holding, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and National Cheng Kung University also participated and shared their experiences.

It is understood that Nano 5, Taiwan's new generation AI supercomputer, is scheduled to launch on June 25th. It is equipped with NVIDIA H100 GPUs, providing powerful AI computing capabilities to various industries.

The NCHC stated that Nano 5 will combine Taiwan's semiconductor strengths to build a comprehensive AI ecosystem, creating a "Team Taiwan" in AI.

Nano 5 has a computing power of 4.15 Petaflops. Companies like Synopsys have already benefited from using Nano 5 to optimize their semiconductor design processes. In addition, 15 AI startups are also leveraging Nano 5 to accelerate their AI model development and deployment. The NCHC aims to provide comprehensive support for Taiwan's AI development, from cutting-edge research to industrial applications.

**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation followed a speech in which he stated that Taiwan is "of course" a country, supported by historical evidence and legal proof.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times. It claims the island is one of its provinces and has no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have repeatedly offered to hold talks with China, but these offers have been rejected. China considers Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had deliberately distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and maintained that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly encouraged conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' errors and false beliefs," the office said in a statement.

It added, "The misleading statements made by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and legal principles, will simply be discarded by history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply presenting historical facts. It called Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country "just a made-up lie without any basis."

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, where 'the two sides are not under each other's control'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists. The Republic of China remains the island's official name.

Lai has repeatedly stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future. He also emphasized that since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak for it.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has experienced increasing military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.
