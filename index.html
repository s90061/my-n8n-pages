The Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, the list has been changed. Guangzhou's Jinan University has been officially removed. Now, the list includes 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges.
The Minister of Education said that some schools in China have a special political purpose and are not just for academics. He said it was necessary to stop recognizing degrees from these schools. The Ministry explained that Jinan University has been managed by a political department of the Chinese government since 2019. The decision was made to make sure that Taiwanese students can study in a normal academic environment without political influence.
The Ministry also said that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, respectful, and fair. It advised schools in Taiwan to be careful when they receive invitations for events from China. They should check to make sure the events do not have a political purpose. If schools are not sure, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council for help. The goal is to let students from both sides learn from each other, but they must be aware of the risks.

However, the car was completely burned and destroyed. The police are still investigating the exact cause of the accident. The driver was tested for alcohol, but the test was negative.
The fire department said that drivers should always check their cars and keep a safe distance from other vehicles on the road. The police added that if a tire blows out, you should not hit the brakes hard. Instead, you should let go of the gas pedal, hold the steering wheel firmly, and slowly move to the side of the road.

**"Too Scared to Cry," Says Mainlander Spouse Xiao Wei After Receiving a Scary Phone Call**

A woman from mainland China, known as "Xiao Wei," was forced to leave Taiwan in April. Her permission to live in Taiwan was canceled because she was accused of supporting a military takeover of Taiwan on the social media app Douyin. After returning to Guizhou in China, she started making videos about her life in the countryside.
Recently, she made a video complaining that a local village official did not give her money she was supposed to get for her land. Today, she posted another video saying she received a threatening phone call from the Chinese police late at night. She said in the video, "I'm so scared, I can't even cry."
Xiao Wei said she is a simple farmer and has not broken any laws. She was just asking about her money. She said she was shaking while making the video and asked, "Is there any justice?" She feels the police were using their power unfairly. She ended the video by asking for help and protection, saying that using the internet is the only way for people like her to find justice.
