            <h1>Heavy Rain Continues in Taitung Due to Typhoon; Three Townships Suspend Work and School [Update]</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lu Ta-cheng, Taitung County, July 21) The Taitung County Government announced that heavy rain continues in the southern part of Taitung. This is because of the outer parts of a typhoon. It is easy for bad things to happen, like landslides or floods. To keep people safe, Dapu Township, Taimali Township, and Daren Township have no work or school today (July 21). The county government also asks people to be careful about landslides and other dangers. People in low areas should be careful of standing water. (Edited by Liu Wen-yu) July 21, 2025</p>

            <h1>Actress Vivian Sung Appears at New York Asian Film Festival; New Taiwan-Korea Film Gets Attention</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Liao Han-yuan, New York, July 20) Actress Vivian Sung and Korean director Park Sang-min appeared today at the New York Asian Film Festival. Vivian Sung said that she liked the script so much that she studied Korean very hard. She said it is a movie with deep meaning. Also, Lai Yu-tung, the producer of the popular youth comedy "Only a Sick Person Would Like You," was also at the party. He came to recommend new Taiwanese actors.</p>
            <p>"A House No One Knows" had its first showing at the New York Asian Film Festival on July 20. Actress Vivian Sung and Korean director Park Sang-min attended a party at Film at Lincoln Center.</p>
            <p>"A House No One Knows" is based on the Spanish movie "The Hidden Face." The Korean team moved the story to Asia. It tells a strange story about a killer's son and his family escaping to Taiwan. The whole movie was filmed in both Taiwan and Korea. Vivian Sung worked hard to learn Korean for the movie.</p>
            <p>Vivian Sung said she was drawn to the script. She likes to watch these kinds of movies. When she read the script, she could imagine it would be very entertaining. She also felt it was a movie with deep meaning.</p>
            <p>She said the biggest challenge was not knowing Korean. She spent six months practicing, starting from vowels and consonants. She practiced until she could speak her lines and act well. She said this was probably the hardest part.</p>
            <p>Thinking back about filming in two places, Vivian Sung said this was her first Korean movie. She was very nervous at first because of the language. She needed a translator to talk with the director or other actors. But when she joined the film crew, everyone was very welcoming. She felt like part of a big family. It was a wonderful journey.</p>
            <p>Recently, the youth romantic comedy "Only a Sick Person Would Like You" has been released in many Asian countries. Its producer, Lai Yu-tung, and experienced producer Huang Hsiao-fen were at the party. They hope to bring Taiwanese movies and new actors to a bigger international market.</p>
            <p>Lai Yu-tung said it is a story about pretending to be sick. He said he liked to pretend to be sick when he was a child to skip school or avoid tests. So, he wrote this story and asked director Hsu Fu-hsiang to work on it with him.</p>
            <p>"Only a Sick Person Would Like You" bravely chose new actors, Zhan Huai-yun and Jiang Qi, for the main roles. A boy who pretends to have a serious illness falls in love with a girl who truly has a serious illness but pretends she doesn't. This movie is a Taiwanese youth romantic comedy that makes people laugh and cry. It has gained many fans recently.</p>
            <p>Lai Yu-tung said finding new actors was very challenging. Both the production and distribution companies had questions. But he and the director still wanted to find actors who fit the roles. They had qualities that were close to the characters, and this was key to moving people successfully.</p>
            <p>Lai Yu-tung said, "We work with many new actors in Taiwan. They are creative and full of life. We hope to keep helping new Taiwanese actors. We want to help them reach markets outside of Asia."</p>
            <p>"Only a Sick Person Would Like You" will be shown at the film festival on July 21. (Edited by Chang Chih-hsuan) July 21, 2025</p>

            <h1>Trump Speaks About Aid for Taiwan; Asks House to Add $1 Billion to Help Stop Attacks</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chung Yu-chen, Washington, July 20) After news in February that the Trump government released $870 million (about NT$25.5 billion) in aid to Taiwan that was held back, they have again spoken about helping Taiwan. A recent statement from the White House says the government "strongly asks" the House of Representatives to think about giving Taiwan $1 billion in aid. This is to make sure Taiwan can defend itself well.</p>
            <p>On July 15, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) at the White House, which is a big part of the US President's office, released a statement about the Defense Department's spending bill for the 2026 financial year. The statement talked about the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative" in the bill.</p>
            <p>The letter said that the government thanks the House Appropriations Committee for including $500 million for the Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative in the bill. This money is very important to help the Defense Department make Taiwan's ability to defend itself stronger. The government also strongly asks them to fully consider the request for $1 billion for the Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative in the 2026 financial year's Defense Department spending bill.</p>
            <p>This is because Taiwan's strong ability to defend itself is very important for stopping attacks in the Indo-Pacific region. It is also important for keeping American people safe in emergencies.</p>
            <p>However, the bill passed by the House of Representatives on July 18 still sets aside $500 million for the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative." This money is to give Taiwan new defense items, services, and military education and training. It also says that the Secretary of Defense must give a report every three months to the Congress committees that deal with defense, explaining how the money is used.</p>
            <p>The House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party told the Central News Agency recently that when they discussed the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative" in the bill, they looked at what former US Pacific Command Operations Director Mark Montgomery said in Congress in May this year.</p>
            <p>Retired Major General Montgomery asked Congress at that time to increase military aid to Taiwan as much as possible.</p>
            <p>He wrote that this can be done through "Foreign Military Financing" (FMF), "Presidential Drawdown Authority" (PDA), and the "Taiwan Security Assistance Initiative." Taiwan is too small to deal with Beijing's challenges alone. China's total economic output is 23 times bigger than Taiwan's.</p>
            <p>Montgomery suggested that the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act should create a "Taiwan Security Cooperation Initiative." He also suggested that it should allow up to $300 million to be given in the first year. For the future, Congress should give $1 billion for this initiative in the 2026 financial year and later years.</p>
            <p>"The main use for this money will be to train and educate Taiwan's soldiers. This includes helping more of them attend captain-level courses in all areas of fighting. It also includes paying for training for army units outside of Taiwan, in places like Hawaii and facilities on the US West Coast."</p>
            <p>Montgomery served in the US Navy for 32 years and retired in 2017. He was the Director of Operations for the US Pacific Command. He was also the commander of the USS George Washington aircraft carrier group, which runs on nuclear power. And he was the Deputy Director for Plans, Policies, and Strategies at the US European Command.</p>
            <p>From 1998 to 2000, he worked at the National Security Council as the Director for Transnational Threats. Montgomery has advanced degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Oxford University. He also finished the US Navy's nuclear power training program.</p>
            <p>The Defense Department spending bill passed by the House of Representatives on July 18 is not the final version. This is because the House's version still needs to be agreed upon with the Senate. After both houses pass the same words in the bill, the President will sign it into law. As of now, the Senate Appropriations Committee has not yet shared its own version of the Defense Department spending bill. (Edited by Chen Cheng-kung) July 21, 2025</p>
