            <h1>Zelensky asks Trump to seek peace with power against Russia before White House meeting</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky today asked US President Donald Trump to show "peace through strength" against Russia. This happened before a very important meeting at the White House, and he used Trump's own words.</p>
            <p>Trump will soon meet with Zelensky and other European leaders at the White House. They will talk about how to stop Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency said that Zelensky called the White House talks "very serious." Before the meeting, he tried to impress Trump by using his famous "peace through strength" idea.</p>
            <p>Zelensky wrote on X (social media): "Only power can make Russia want peace, and President Trump has this power. We must do every step correctly to make peace happen."</p>
            <p>Zelensky also said that they will "have time to discuss the plan for security guarantees, which is the most important thing."</p>
            <p>Several European leaders had a meeting with Zelensky in Washington this morning. Zelensky also met with Keith Kellogg, who is Trump's special envoy for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters on his way to Washington: "We must make sure there is peace, a lasting peace, and it must be fair and right."</p>
            <p>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said before going to the White House that "a small chance for talks is opening." She also supported the idea of security guarantees.</p>

            <h1>EU diplomats in China may not attend military parade with Putin</h1>
            <p>The South China Morning Post has learned that European diplomats in Beijing are talking about not attending a big military parade in China next month. They are considering this because Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to be there, and Russian soldiers might even take part.</p>
            <p>The South China Morning Post reported that five people who know about the situation said that EU diplomats in Beijing were invited to the parade and other events on the same day. However, Putin's presence makes them very worried because Russia has increased its attacks on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>One of these people said that because the war in Ukraine is still happening, some European diplomats feel unsure about "being in the same place as troops who invaded Ukraine." This is true even if it's not yet confirmed that Russian soldiers will be in the parade.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin said in June that Putin will visit China from August 31 to September 3. He will go to the military parade, which is to remember the end of World War II. He will also attend a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization.</p>
