            <h1>Argentina's President announces 2026 budget; his tone becomes more careful before the midterm election.</h1>
            <p>On September 15, Argentina's President Javier Milei spoke to the country. He announced the national budget for 2026. President Milei usually speaks with strong feelings, but this time he was much calmer. He did not use his famous saying, "Long live freedom!" Instead, he said that education, health, and pensions would be the most important things to spend money on. Argentine news reports say that he did this to make people feel better, to help people agree, and to get support for the midterm election in October 2025.</p>
            <p>Since he became president in December 2023, President Milei has cut a lot of government spending. He has also fired government workers, stopped helping people pay for energy, and made the economy more open. These changes caused many protests. In early September, his party, "La Libertad Avanza," lost badly in a local election in Buenos Aires Province. They only got about 34% of the votes, which was much less than the Fuerza Patria alliance, a center-left group. Buenos Aires Province creates more than 30% of the country's money and has about 40% of the country's voters. So, the results of this election show what people in Argentina might think about politics.</p>
            <p>During his speech on September 15, President Milei spoke in a much calmer way. He told the people that "the worst times are over." He also said that the government will continue to make sure the country's money is balanced. Next year, they will focus on improving people's skills and health. He announced that about 85% of the 2026 budget will go to education, healthcare, and pensions. This includes a 17% increase for healthcare, an 8% increase for education, and a 5% increase for pensions.</p>
            <p>Important news companies in Argentina had different opinions about President Milei's speech. La NaciÃ³n newspaper said it was a "different Milei." It was the first time he spoke so calmly since becoming president. This shows that the president knows his changes need people to agree. ClarÃ­n newspaper said that President Milei "is no longer like an emperor." The election results in September made him understand that people are now looking closely at his plans and his team, not just seeing him as a hero who will save Argentina.</p>
            <p>Argentina's midterm election will happen on October 26, 2025. In this election, 127 seats in the House of Representatives and 24 seats in the Senate will be chosen. This will be the first time for President Milei to have a big election since he started in 2023. It will show if his government's changes can be successful. It will also decide what the country's plans will be for the next two years.</p>

            <h1>US says Taiwan's status is not yet decided, Yu Maochun: China forced them to say it.</h1>
            <p>On September 16, in Washington, a US scholar named Yu Maochun said that the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) believes China is changing old World War II papers to try and force Taiwan to do what it wants. AIT says these papers do not say what Taiwan's final political situation is. Yu Maochun said today that the US position has not changed. The US has never thought that Taiwan is part of China. He said they just didn't say it clearly before, but now China is making the US say this simple truth.</p>
            <p>Today, a group in Washington called the Hudson Institute held a meeting. They talked about "Hybrid Warfare and CCP Infiltration: A Shared Challenge for US-Taiwan Security Cooperation." Yu Maochun, who leads the China Center at the Hudson Institute, was in charge of the meeting. Sampson Shen, the head of the Taiwan Hong Kong Association, and Hsu Kai-Chieh, a judge from the Taipei District Court, also joined the discussion.</p>
            <p>Many people see Yu Maochun as an important adviser for former President Trump's China plans. When asked about China's legal fight against Taiwan, he said that the US's main rule on China and Taiwan is to stop anyone who tries to change the current situation by force. He said this has always been their rule.</p>
            <p>He strongly said that the "current situation" means "Taiwan's independent rule." But the problem is whether people in politics are brave enough to agree with this truth. This is why some people in Washington say that everyone should "recognize" this truth. This is not about making a new country that never existed. It is simply asking "the world to agree that Taiwan is a real, independent country," which is completely different from mainland China.</p>
            <p>He believes that "this is an issue we should look at seriously."</p>
            <p>Hsu Kai-Chieh, who knows a lot about national security, said that Taiwan and its friends should speak up more. For example, they could make a statement: if China attacks Taiwan, Taiwan's friends would say that the "One China Policy" is no longer true. This could scare China and stop it from using force against Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Sampson Shen said that when China spreads wrong political ideas, Taiwan must correct these wrong statements right away.</p>
            <p>He also said that the relationships between the United States, Japan, Europe, and even Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan are very important. These relationships will help "Taiwanese people truly build their own identity and strengths, and show Taiwan to the whole world."</p>
            <p>China is purposefully changing old World War II papers, like the "Cairo Declaration," to try and say that Taiwan belongs to them. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) recently said that China is wrongly changing World War II documents. These documents include the "Cairo Declaration," the "Potsdam Proclamation," and the "San Francisco Peace Treaty." China is doing this to support its actions to force Taiwan.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the US Department of State also spoke to a CNA reporter and said that, like the AIT said, Beijing's arguments are wrong. The spokesperson stated, "These papers do not decide Taiwan's final political situation." China is putting pressure on Taiwan in many ways, such as with its military, money, information, laws, and talks with other countries. The US will continue to help Taiwan and work with other countries to strongly support peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>When asked in an interview, Yu Maochun said that the US has never believed Taiwan is a part of China. This has always been the plan in Washington. All US governments, both Democratic and Republican, have believed that United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, passed in 1971, did not solve Taiwan's status. It only solved the issue of who would represent China.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that the US's position has not changed. They just didn't say it clearly before. Now, "China is forcing the US to state a very simple truth," because the Chinese government's claims are very silly.</p>
            <p>Also, when reporters asked about the chance of former US President Donald Trump visiting Beijing this year, Yu Maochun said that if Trump wants to make a deal with China, and visiting Beijing is part of that, "he can certainly go." But if Chinese President Xi Jinping does not want to work together, going to Beijing would not help. "It is a way to make a deal," he said.</p>

            <h1>ChatGPT introduces measures to protect teenagers, system will guess user's age.</h1>
            <p>On September 16, in Los Angeles, Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, said today that people are thinking a lot about what is right and wrong with artificial intelligence (AI). He said that ChatGPT is making a new system that can guess how old a user is. This system will give extra safety to teenagers.</p>
            <p>Recently in California, USA, a 16-year-old teenager took their own life. The parents said that ChatGPT, an AI chat helper, was involved. This made many people worried. OpenAI started ChatGPT at the end of 2022. By August of this year, it was thought that 700 million people used it every week around the world.</p>
            <p>Today, Sam Altman wrote an article on the OpenAI website. In it, he talked about three big issues that many people care about: privacy, freedom, and teenagers. At the start of his article, he said that OpenAI is creating better security features to keep users' private information safe.</p>
            <p>He said that people are talking more and more private things with AI. This technology holds people's most private information. It's like talking to a doctor about your health or telling a lawyer about legal problems. This kind of information needs stronger protection.</p>
            <p>Next, he talked about how much freedom users have. He said that with good information security, they want users to be able to use the AI freely in their own way. They want to make sure users have as much freedom as possible. As long as users do not hurt others or go against their rights, they should "treat adults like adults."</p>
            <p>He gave an example. Usually, ChatGPT will not have many flirty or unclear talks by itself. But if an adult user asks for it, they should get the answer they want. Another example is that the system will not tell someone how to take their own life. But if an adult user wants to write a story about someone taking their own life, ChatGPT should be able to help them.</p>
            <p>In the article, the protection of teenagers was highlighted in bold letters. Altman said: "For teenagers, we put safety before privacy and freedom. This is a new and strong technology, and we believe young people need extra protection."</p>
            <p>Altman said that the company is making a system to guess a user's age based on what they do online. If there is any doubt, they will be careful and assume the user is under 18 years old. He also said that in some situations or countries, ChatGPT will ask users to show proof of their age.</p>
            <p>He said that for teenagers, ChatGPT will not answer if they ask for flirty talks, and it will not talk about taking one's own life. If the system finds that a young person might want to hurt themselves, it will try to contact their parents or other helpful groups.</p>
