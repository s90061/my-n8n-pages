            <h1>Tonya Helene Paulsson Wins Bronze in University Games Gymnastics, First for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Tonya Helene Paulsson, a 21-year-old gymnast who moved from Sweden to Taiwan, won a bronze medal today. She scored 52.065 points in the women's all-around gymnastics final at the Rhine-Ruhr University Games. She is the first woman from Taiwan to win a medal in gymnastics at the University Games, making new history.</p>
            <p>The Rhine-Ruhr World University Games are happening in Germany. Tonya Helene Paulsson, 21, is a mixed-race gymnast whose father is Swedish and mother is Taiwanese. This year, she started representing Taiwan and performed very well at her first University Games. She qualified for the women's all-around final in 3rd place. She also had a chance to win medals in individual events like the balance beam and floor exercise.</p>
            <p>In today's women's all-around gymnastics final, Tonya Helene Paulsson scored 12.800 points for the vault, 13.466 for the uneven bars, 12.966 for the balance beam, and 12.833 for the floor exercise. Her total score was 52.065 points, which earned her the bronze medal. She stood on the podium as she wished. She barely beat Celia Serber from France, who came in fourth, by only 0.033 points. It was a close win that made history.</p>
            <p>Japanese athletes won both the gold and silver medals in the women's all-around gymnastics. Shoko Miyata, 20, won the gold medal with a total of 54.266 points.

            <h1>Taiwan Water Works with Companies to Offer Custom Water Supply, Aims to Increase Income by Year-End</h1>
            <p>To earn more money besides water fees, Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) will work with companies that make water purification equipment. They will use a method called "TWC Select" (OEM). This means they will offer "custom water supply services" based on what different users need, like homes, restaurant chains, or technology factories. They will start choosing companies soon and hope to begin this service by the end of the year. TWC also hopes to help more local companies that make water purification equipment grow through this plan.</p>
            <p>In the future, if users in Taiwan need custom water supply, they can contact TWC. TWC will send staff to test the water quality, give advice, and then install the water purification equipment. Usually, this will be a one-time payment. Also, TWC will provide water quality reports approved by professional organizations and check the water regularly.</p>
            <p>Water prices in Taiwan have not changed for 31 years. For every unit of water sold, TWC loses more than 2 New Taiwan Dollars. Because changing water prices affects the cost of everyday goods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs told TWC to first check if they can save money or offer new services to earn more. For example, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, suggested a system where people pay different prices for different water qualities earlier this year.</p>
            <p>It is known that TWC has started planning "custom water supply services." They will work with companies that provide water purification equipment for homes or businesses. Using the "TWC Select" (OEM) method, they will offer custom water quality based on what users need. Target customers include regular homes, restaurant chains, food processing companies, semiconductor factories, hospitals, building companies, and more.</p>
            <p>People involved in the plan say that the water TWC provides already meets the standards for drinking water sources and drinking water quality. Taiwan's water quality standards are even better than those of the World Health Organization (WHO). However, some users need special water quality. For example, some people think the water is too hard. They can install water purification equipment to make it softer. Also, high-tech factories need very clean water for their advanced processes. These are all possible customers.</p>
            <p>TWC will soon publicly choose one or two companies to work with. For their roles, TWC will be mainly responsible for checking filter materials, water quality standards, and providing technical support. The selected companies will be responsible for developing and installing the equipment, giving custom advice, and providing after-sales service. TWC expects to receive income from technical services, which is estimated to be between 30 million and 50 million New Taiwan Dollars over six years.</p>
            <p>Those involved say that smaller companies also hope to work with TWC, a state-owned company, to become more well-known and save on marketing costs. This would help them win bids for projects in other countries. TWC also wants to help more companies work together internationally.</p>
            <p>Experts in the industry say that about 40% of homes in Taiwan have water purifiers. This means nearly 60% of homes do not have them. The good thing about TWC offering this service is that TWC has its own equipment and skills to test water quality. This can make sure the water quality is good after a user installs a purifier. Otherwise, it would be hard for a regular family to know if their water quality really improved if they installed a purifier by themselves.</p>
            <p>Officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that "custom water supply services" is the most practical idea TWC has considered. TWC had looked into other projects before, but they all had challenges. For example, deep-sea water projects need a lot of money to start, and small-molecule water has legal limits.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Water Corporation Still Losing Money in First Half of Year, Leak Reduction Plan Adds Financial Pressure</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) has been borrowing money for water projects in recent years. This has led to more and more losses each year because of interest payments and the cost of old equipment. This year, they expect to lose another 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars. According to TWC's financial report, they lost about 2.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the first six months of this year. Also, a future plan to reduce water leaks will need over 70 billion New Taiwan Dollars to be paid by TWC itself. This is making their financial situation more difficult.</p>
            <p>TWC continues to work on various water supply projects. Their total debt is now over 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars. They pay a lot of interest each year. TWC has lost money for two years in a row, and these losses are getting bigger. This year, they predict another loss of about 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars. By June this year, their losses before tax were 2.432 billion New Taiwan Dollars, and their debt-to-asset ratio was 47.71%.</p>
            <p>As business conditions become harder, TWC will start an 8-year plan this year called the "Leakage Reduction Plan," which will cost a total of 80.77 billion New Taiwan Dollars. For the first four years, 2 billion New Taiwan Dollars will come from the government budget each year, totaling 8 billion. The remaining 72.774 billion New Taiwan Dollars must be paid by TWC itself. When they buy new fixed assets, they will also have to pay for their depreciation over time. With borrowing costs going up, their operating costs are also increasing. It is clear that their financial pressure will be very high.</p>
            <p>The 8-year plan to reduce leaks will use smart methods to manage and fix leaks. It will use big data to find areas where leaks are common, check for leaks, and replace old pipes. It will also focus on keeping the water pipe system in good condition. After the plan is finished, the leak rate can go down from 11.99% at the end of 2024 to 9.77% by the end of 2032. This means they can save about 59.1 million cubic meters of water each year, which is like saving 1.17 times the water that Hushan Reservoir can hold.</p>
            <p>Besides fixing leaks, TWC also recently reviewed and improved its response to water outages after Typhoon Danas. One important task is to create standard procedures for pumping stations that do not have fixed generators. They also finished preparing for areas where the ground is weak. Specific actions include moving portable generators to these areas ahead of time and renting generators based on contracts with companies. This is to make sure the power supply does not stop. For some pumping stations by the road, where space is small, water trucks and water containers will be used instead.</p>
            <p>Also, TWC will talk with Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) to get power back on first in important places. This is to cause less trouble for household water supply. TWC is also planning to learn from Taipower's experience in disaster response and management, following instructions from Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, Lai Chien-hsin. They want to find ways to use these methods to make TWC's disaster response much better.</p>
