            <h1>Israel Plans to Control Gaza City; Netanyahu Explains 5 Main Ideas for Ending War</h1>
            <p>Israel's security team recently decided to take full control of Gaza City. This decision made many people angry. Today, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu held a press conference. He said that the Gaza Strip would not have weapons anymore. He also explained five main ideas for Israel to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that at the international press conference, Mr. Netanyahu said that Israel has five main rules to finish the war in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>These rules include Hamas giving up its weapons. Also, all Israeli hostages must be set free. The Gaza Strip must not have weapons anymore. Israel wants to have strong control over safety in the Gaza Strip. Finally, a new government body must be created. This new body should not be part of Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said that the Israeli government plans to fully control Gaza City. He believes this is the best way to stop the war and defeat Hamas. He also stated that Israel will let regular people go to special safe places. In these places, they will get enough food, feel safe, and receive medical help.</p>
            <p>He also said again that Hamas is to blame for the lack of help in the Gaza Strip. He accused Hamas of taking the aid supplies that were meant for the people.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu showed a picture. He said the picture showed a lot of aid supplies that Israel let into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom border crossing. He claimed these supplies were still waiting to be picked up.</p>
            <p>He also talked about a plan with three steps to solve this problem. First, they would create safe paths to give out aid. Second, they would add more safe places to give out aid, managed by the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation." Third, the Israeli army and other groups would drop more aid from the air.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Ship Accidentally Entered Chinese Waters Last Year, Warned by Chinese Military Shots</h1>
            <p>Japanese news today reported that a Japanese navy ship, called the "Suzutsuki," accidentally went into China's waters last July. This happened near Zhejiang Province. The Chinese military fired at least two warning shots at the ship. It is not common for China to shoot warning shots at other countries' ships. This shows that the situation at that time was very dangerous and could have gotten worse quickly.</p>
            <p>Japan's Kyodo News reported a special story based on what people who know about Japan and China said. On the morning of July 4 last year, the Japanese navy ship Suzutsuki was sailing near Zhejiang Province. It was watching Chinese military training from international waters. The Chinese military saw the Suzutsuki moving closer to China's waters. They told the Suzutsuki many times to change its direction. Just before the Suzutsuki entered China's waters, the Chinese military fired a warning shot.</p>
            <p>After the Suzutsuki went into China's waters, the Chinese military fired another shot. They told the Suzutsuki to leave. The Suzutsuki was not hit by the shots and was not damaged.</p>
            <p>The news said that the Suzutsuki's navigation system had a mistake. It was not set to show the borders between international waters and other countries' waters. Because of this mistake, the crew did not know they had entered China's waters. That is why the Chinese military fired warning shots. The Suzutsuki stayed in China's waters for about 20 minutes.</p>
