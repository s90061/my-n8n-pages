            <h1>Nine High-Ranking Chinese Military Officials Punished for Disloyalty</h1>
            <p>The Communist Party of China (CPC) will hold its 20th Central Committee's Fourth Plenum next week. On October 17, China's Ministry of National Defense announced that nine high-ranking officials from the Central Military Commission were removed from the Party. Their cases were sent to military prosecutors for investigation and possible charges.</p>
            <p>These officials include He Weidong, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission. Others are Miao Hua, former director of the Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission, and He Hongjun, former executive deputy director of the Political Work Department of the Central Military Commission. The list also has Wang Xiubin, former executive deputy director of the Joint Operations Command Center of the Central Military Commission, Lin Xiangyang, former commander of the Eastern Theater Command, Qin Shutong, former political commissar of the Army, Yuan Huazhi, former political commissar of the Navy, Wang Houbin, former commander of the Rocket Force, and Wang Chunning, former commander of the People's Armed Police Force.</p>
            <p>The People's Liberation Army Daily, the newspaper of the Central Military Commission, published an editorial today. It said that these officials "lost their faith and loyalty." The editorial stated that no matter how high a person's position is, there is no special pass to avoid punishment.</p>
            <p>The newspaper added that this action shows the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission are determined to fight corruption. It also shows that the military will not allow corrupt people to hide. This is a big success in the fight against corruption within the Party and the military.</p>
            <p>The editorial explained that He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, and the other nine seriously broke Party rules and are thought to have committed serious crimes related to their jobs. They took a lot of money, which caused very serious problems and had a very bad impact. As senior leaders of the Party and the military, they forgot their original goals and lost their Party principles. Their faith broke down, and they were disloyal. They greatly failed the trust of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission.</p>
            <p>Their actions seriously hurt the principle of the Party controlling the military and the system where the Chairman of the Central Military Commission is in charge. They also badly damaged the good atmosphere in the military and greatly affected the shared ideas that unite all officers and soldiers. This caused huge damage to the Party's work, the building of national defense and the military, and the image of senior officials.</p>
            <p>The editorial said that corruption is the biggest danger for the Communist Party of China. Fighting corruption is the most complete way the Party can improve itself. The fight against corruption affects the Party's complete control over the military, the purpose of the people's army, and the long-term stability of the Party and the country.</p>
            <p>Since the 18th National Congress of the CPC, the entire military and armed police forces have worked hard to govern the Party strictly and manage the military strictly. They have promoted political training with a spirit of reform. They have punished corruption everywhere, without exceptions, and with zero tolerance. They have fought corruption with strong actions, showing a bigger determination and effort than ever before. This has led to great historical achievements in building the military politically in the new era.</p>
            <p>The editorial also mentioned that the corruption problems of He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, and others are like a new version of the problems caused by Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou. The current fight against corruption continues the clean-up from the 18th National Congress of the Party and is a deeper way to rebuild the people's army. The deep investigation into He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, and others clearly shows that no matter how high a person's position or how great their power, everyone is equal before Party rules and national laws. If someone is corrupt, they will not be excused. There is no special "free pass" from punishment, and no "iron-hatted king" (a powerful person who cannot be touched).</p>

            <h1>Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School Opens, Starting a New Model for High School Education</h1>
            <p>National Zhubei Senior High School officially became "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Zhubei Senior High School" in August this year. Today, the school held a ceremony to mark its new name. This event was also the first anniversary of Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School and the 34th birthday of Zhubei Senior High School.</p>
            <p>Principal Chen Rui-rong of Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School spoke at the ceremony. He said that changing the name is not just a simple change. The school will focus on "cross-disciplinary learning, innovation, and internationalization." He hopes to create a new and excellent model for high school education in the Hsinchu area and in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chen Yong-fu, the Vice President of Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, said that the cooperation with the affiliated high school will be very successful. He hopes that Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School will become "the best affiliated high school." He strongly believes that once the cooperation starts, it will bring good results and help the school grow even better.</p>
            <p>The Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School explained that it has already started special classes. These include a bilingual biomedical science class and an electrical engineering and information science class. In the future, Yang Ming Chiao Tung University will guide the high school students to take AP (Advanced Placement) international courses in a structured way. This will make international education available to more students at a lower cost.</p>
            <p>The school said that since the change in August, the banner at the school entrance has been updated to "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School." The outside of the administration building and its pillars have also been updated. The new school name on the signs uses the beautiful writing style of calligrapher Zhao Shi-xiong.</p>

            <h1>US Pressure Works: Global Shipping Carbon Fees Vote Delayed for One Year</h1>
            <p>The International Maritime Organization (IMO), which is part of the United Nations, voted today to delay the decision on global shipping carbon fees for one year. This happened because the United States put pressure on other countries, and there was no agreement on this important plan to reduce carbon.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this delay is a setback for the European Union and countries like Brazil. These countries actively want to reduce carbon emissions from shipping and hoped to set up a system to charge for carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>During the IMO meeting in London, the United States and Saudi Arabia, two of the world's largest oil-producing countries, strongly opposed the idea of charging carbon fees for shipping. After several days of discussion, Saudi Arabia suggested delaying the vote for one year today. This suggestion passed with 57 votes in favor and 49 against, which was a simple majority.</p>
            <p>Countries like China, Greece, Cyprus, Japan, and South Korea had previously said they supported a global system for shipping carbon fees. However, when they voted on Saudi Arabia's suggestion today, China voted to delay the decision, and some other countries chose not to vote.</p>
            <p>Even if countries agree next year, it is still not clear when the shipping carbon fees would actually start. The IMO's original idea was to start charging for carbon emissions from ships in 2028.</p>
            <p>The IMO is working on a "Net-Zero Framework." This plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from global shipping. It will set strict yearly limits on greenhouse gas emissions for large ships. Ships that go over the limit will have to buy emission permits to make up for their extra emissions. The plan also includes clear ways to check and manage these rules. It will also help promote new kinds of fuel and make it less risky for companies to invest in modernizing their ships.</p>
            <p>The IMO had planned to vote today in London to officially accept this framework. But after Saudi Arabia's suggestion passed, the discussion will be delayed for one year.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, former US President Trump asked member countries of the IMO to vote against this framework. He also posted on social media, saying that Washington "will not allow this global green scam tax and will never follow it in any way."</p>
            <p>The US government wants to have a more important role in global shipping. In the past, it has used taxes on goods (tariffs) as a way to negotiate and make other countries agree to its terms.</p>
            <p>The International Maritime Organization has 176 member countries. It is responsible for making international shipping safe and stopping pollution in the oceans. Shipping causes about 3% of the world's carbon dioxide emissions, and about 90% of global trade depends on shipping.</p>
