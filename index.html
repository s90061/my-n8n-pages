            <h1>Trump to talk to Putin before meeting Zelenskyy</h1>
            <p>A White House official told AFP that US President Trump will talk to Russian President Vladimir Putin today. Trump is expected to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The war where Russia attacked Ukraine has been going on for over three years. Recently, Trump has become more and more unhappy with Russia. He also feels for Ukraine as it fights against the Russian attack.</p>
            <p>Earlier, a high-ranking Ukrainian official told AFP that Zelenskyy and Trump's meeting tomorrow will mainly be about possibly giving long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The Ukrainian official said, "The main topics for discussion are Tomahawk missiles, and of course, Patriot missiles."</p>

            <h1>UK Spy Chief: China is a daily national security threat</h1>
            <p>The head of MI5, Ken McCallum, said today that China's actions threaten the UK's national security every single day. He said this when talking to the media in London.</p>
            <p>McCallum gave his yearly speech at MI5 headquarters in London today. He shared updates on national security and threats and answered questions from the media.</p>
            <p>The media is still interested in the case about a spy in Parliament. McCallum said he was upset that the case did not go to trial. But he added that MI5 successfully stopped the activities of two suspects.</p>
            <p>Chris Cash, who used to work for a Member of Parliament, and Chris Berry, a teacher in China, were arrested in the UK in 2023. They were accused of giving information to China that could harm the UK's national security. They were charged by prosecutors in 2024.</p>
            <p>However, the prosecutors suddenly dropped the charges in September this year. This made people question the decision. The Prime Minister's office released a statement last night from the Deputy National Security Advisor. Many members of Parliament believe the statement shows the prosecutors did not have enough reasons to drop the charges. They also think the prosecutors did not try hard enough to find more witnesses or evidence.</p>
            <p>The "Joint Committee on National Security Strategy," made up of important members from both houses of Parliament, has decided to officially investigate why the spy case failed. Emily Thornberry, who leads the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and is a Labour Party member, said in Parliament today that she cannot understand why the prosecutors made such a big decision to stop the case from going to trial. She has 20 years of experience as a criminal lawyer.</p>
            <p>In his speech, McCallum said that the relationship between the UK and China might be complicated. But MI5's job is simple: to find, stop, and strongly deal with any activities that threaten the UK's national security.</p>
            <p>McCallum stressed that he will "never step back" from any threats the UK faces, no matter where they come from.</p>
            <p>He talked about China's cyber spying on the UK, secret transfers of technology, bad interference in British public life like politics, and bothering and frightening Chinese people who speak out against China in the UK. He also said that MI5 "again" acted last week to stop such actions from China.</p>
            <p>However, McCallum also said that like other countries in the "Five Eyes" intelligence group, the UK needs to take chances that benefit its own interests when dealing with China. This is a practical approach.</p>
            <p>He repeated what he said in his speech last year: how to find a good balance between "security" and other interests should be decided by the government (senior officials) after hearing advice from national security experts.</p>
            <p>About the overall security situation in the UK, McCallum said the world is more complex, dangerous, and unfriendly than before. This has caused MI5's work to change a lot, the most since the 9/11 attacks in 2001.</p>
            <p>McCallum pointed out that since early 2020, MI5 and the police have stopped 19 terrorist attacks that were almost ready to happen. Also, just last year, the number of people in the UK who MI5 investigated for being involved in security threats by foreign countries went up by 35% compared to the year before. More worryingly, people involved in national security cases are getting younger.</p>

            <h1>Mercuries Life made NT$940 million profit in the first three quarters; net value ratio of 2.98% still below goal</h1>
            <p>Mercuries Life Insurance announced its financial report for the first three quarters of this year today. The company's profit after tax was NT$940 million, and its earnings per share were NT$0.16. Because the Taiwan stock market grew a lot, Mercuries Life sold some investments at a good time to make money. This helped reduce the effects of the New Taiwan Dollar getting stronger against the US Dollar in the first three quarters. By the end of the third quarter, Mercuries Life's net value was NT$40.8 billion. Its net value ratio went up to 2.98%, but it is still below the legal requirement of 3%.</p>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) checks insurance companies every six months. It requires that an insurance company's RBC (Risk-Based Capital) must not be lower than 200%. Also, its net value ratio must not be lower than 3% for two periods in a row. These two numbers help the FSC measure how well an insurance company can pay its debts. At the end of June this year, Mercuries Life's RBC was 154.27%, and its net value ratio was 2.31%.</p>
            <p>Mercuries Life announced its financial report for the first three quarters today. The company's total profit after tax was NT$940 million, and its earnings per share were NT$0.16. Mercuries Life said this was mainly because the Taiwan stock market rose a lot. The company adjusted its investments, which made its stock investments more profitable. It also made money by selling investments at high prices. In addition, the company followed the FSC's temporary rules for reserves and added more foreign exchange reserve funds. This greatly helped to lessen the impact of the New Taiwan Dollar becoming much stronger against the US Dollar in the first three quarters.</p>
            <p>At the end of the third quarter, Mercuries Life's net value was NT$40.8 billion. Its net value ratio increased to 2.98%, but it is still below the legal requirement of 3%. The company's total assets reached NT$1.6 trillion.</p>
            <p>Mercuries Life stated that its new contract premium income (FYP) for the first three quarters of this year was NT$25.93 billion. This is a 17% increase compared to the same time last year. Investment-linked products made up 86% of this FYP, showing that these products continue to drive business growth. For traditional products, Mercuries Life also did well in promoting interest-sensitive products. The FYP for interest-sensitive life insurance grew by a huge 93% in the first three quarters of this year compared to the same period last year. Also, to prepare for the future IFRS 17 (International Financial Reporting Standard 17), the company keeps introducing various new health and accident insurance products.</p>
            <p>Mercuries Life noted that in recent years, the global and Taiwanese economies have continued to recover steadily. The Taiwan stock market has grown strongly because of the technology and semiconductor industries. Major international markets also grew due to new technology and expectations of lower interest rates. Because of this, Mercuries Life's stock investments both in Taiwan and other countries did very well. Its business performance in the first three quarters was also better than the same period last year. The company will continue to aim for stable income and find new ways to grow in the future.</p>
            <p>Mercuries Life said it will keep changing its investment and risk management plans to make more profit. It will also make its capital stronger by getting more cash through new shares and bonds. Moreover, it is actively working on developing high-value products that will help it meet the IFRS 17 accounting rules, meeting the needs of its customers.</p>
