            <h1>Taiwanese Students Create Exhibition, Telling Stories of Indigenous People During Dutch Rule</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese students in the Netherlands are holding an exhibition called "Invisible Formosa." It tells little-known stories about how the Dutch East India Company and indigenous people interacted in Taiwan in the 17th century.</p>
            <p>Yang Er-wen organized the "Invisible Formosa: Interactions Between the 17th Century Dutch East India Company and Taiwan's Indigenous People" exhibition. She just finished her environmental science degree at Wageningen University in the Netherlands in August. She started the "Invisible Formosa" team with five other students from the same university.</p>
            <p>Yang Er-wen said in an email interview that she had visited indigenous villages. She heard interesting stories about the Dutch colonial period. She thought about her history education in Taiwan, which mostly focused on Han Chinese stories. For example, during the Dutch and Spanish colonial period, she only remembered the Guo Huai-yi incident. But she didn't know about the many complex interactions between indigenous people and the Dutch.</p>
            <p>In 1652, Guo Huai-yi was a Han Chinese farmer leader in Taiwan. He led farmers who were struggling and unhappy with Dutch rule in a rebellion. The Dutch used soldiers with guns and got help from indigenous people to fight back. Guo Huai-yi was defeated and died.</p>
            <p>Yang Er-wen said that when she went to the Netherlands, she found that most of her Dutch friends didn't know that the Dutch had colonized Taiwan. So, she decided to hold an exhibition at her university. It showed perspectives from indigenous oral history that were not mentioned in Taiwanese or Dutch history education. It received good feedback. Because of this, she decided to take the exhibition to other cities in the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>Yang Er-wen mentioned one story from the Matai'an tribe of the Amis people in eastern Taiwan. Many people thought the Dutch only operated in southwestern Taiwan. But they also went to the east to look for gold and had many interactions with the local indigenous people there.</p>
            <p>She said that the Dutch gold-seeking team left a translator in Matai'an to learn the language. But this translator was killed for unknown reasons. Later, the Dutch burned down Matai'an's ancestral spirit houses and hundreds of homes. They also killed the chief in front of everyone. They even teamed up with nearby tribes to attack Matai'an. But the Matai'an people were good fighters, and they fought so well that the nearby tribes stopped helping the Dutch.</p>
            <p>The exhibition started on September 6 at the "NGO DEI" gallery in The Hague, Netherlands. It includes stories from the Amis, Sakizaya, Paiwan, Tsou, Rukai, and Siraya tribes. These stories are combined with historical records, academic research, and video recordings. Together, they create a picture of Taiwanese and Dutch history.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the "Invisible Formosa" team, the exhibition began with a speech by Leonard BlussÃ© van Oud Alblas. He is a retired honorary professor of history at Leiden University in the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>Professor BlussÃ© said that in the 17th century, Taiwan was a central place in the East Asian sea trade network. It was also an important hub for the Dutch East India Company traveling between China and Japan. He used lively stories to show how the Dutch and Formosa met. He also looked back at how the Dutch brought Chinese workers to Taiwan, which changed the groups of people living there.</p>
            <p>After Professor BlussÃ©'s speech, three people who shared stories for the exhibition connected online. They shared about their tribes' efforts to keep their culture and language alive and about their movement for official recognition. They were Amid Olay Pakadodang from the Matai'an tribe of the Amis people, Uma Tavalan from the Sinkang community of the Siraya people, and Edgar L. Macapili, who wrote a book called "A Preliminary Study of Siraya Vocabulary."</p>
            <p>Chen Bo-liang, a secretary from the Taipei Representative Office in the Netherlands, attended the event. He said that this exhibition is not just about the history of Taiwan and the Netherlands. It is also about building a bridge for future understanding. The stories in the exhibition show the deep connection they built over time and distance.</p>
            <p>The "Invisible Formosa" exhibition runs from September 6 to 14, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Miaoli Police Accused of Helping Gang Find Stand-ins for Shooting Case; 2 Squad Leaders Indicted</h1>
            <p>Police officers from Zhunan Police Station were investigating a gun case. They are accused of helping a gang find people to pretend they owned a gun, instead of the real owner. Today, the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office said that squad leader Chang and retired squad leader Tseng have been charged with crimes like making false official documents. Another detective, Cheng, was given a deferred prosecution.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli District Prosecutors Office released a statement today. It said that in September 2022, there was a gang fight in Zhunan Township, Miaoli County. A man named Chang and a man named Wu got into an argument and hurt each other with weapons. Later, Chang told his younger gang members to chase Wu's car with a gun and shoot it. Wu and others were shot and hurt. The Zhunan Police Station then started an operation to find guns.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that squad leader Chang heard about the case. He, retired squad leader Tseng, and detective Cheng went to Hsinchu City. There, the gang leader Chang gave them the gun used in the shooting. They agreed to only take two teenagers, Wang and Yin, and not to investigate the real gun owner, who was the gang leader Chang.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said the three police detectives drove the two teenagers to a parking lot near Shiba Mountain in Hsinchu City. They filmed a fake search and arrest video and wrote false records. They also helped the gang find people to pretend they owned the gun.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that the case has finished its investigation. Squad leader Chang has been charged with crimes like making false official documents, breaking gun control laws, corruption, and not being able to explain where his money came from. Prosecutors asked the court to give him a prison sentence of more than 6 years.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that the retired squad leader Tseng was charged with making false official documents. Detective Cheng was given a deferred prosecution because he is less experienced and followed orders from his superiors. His deferred prosecution period is 2 years, and he must pay 200,000 New Taiwan Dollars to the public treasury to start fresh.</p>
            <p>In response, the Zhunan Precinct of the Miaoli County Police Bureau said in a written statement that squad leader Chang has been suspended as required. Detective Cheng's work area has been changed. They will also strictly investigate the administrative and supervision responsibilities of all people involved.</p>
