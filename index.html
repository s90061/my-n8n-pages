            <h1>Typhoon Kagasa Causes 2 Deaths, 30 People Missing, 28 Injured; Matai'an River Bridge Breaks, New Road Planned</h1>
            <p>The sea warning for Typhoon Kagasa ended tonight. The Central Emergency Operation Center said that there were 221 disaster events across Taiwan. These events caused 2 deaths, 30 people missing, and 28 injuries. Because the Matai'an River Bridge broke, the Highway Bureau has planned new roads for people to use.</p>
            <p>In Hualien County, the Matai'an River formed a natural dam. This afternoon, the water went over the dam, and a lot of water broke the Matai'an River Bridge. Guangfu Township had very bad flooding. The Central Emergency Operation Center for Typhoon Kagasa held its ninth meeting tonight to discuss the situation.</p>
            <p>The National Science and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction said that it will continue to rain near the Matai'an River until tomorrow morning. Water levels at Jianyin Bridge and Hualien Bridge are slowly going down. The relevant groups still need to watch the water levels carefully.</p>
            <p>For the Matai'an River natural dam overflow, the disaster monitoring and search and rescue team said they have set up a command center at the Hualien Tourist Sugar Factory. The Hualien County Fire Department sent 87 vehicles and 180 people to help.</p>
            <p>Other cities and counties also sent help. These include Taitung County Fire Department (8 vehicles, 4 boats, 23 people), Pingtung County Fire Department (8 vehicles, 5 boats, 22 people), New Taipei City Fire Department (27 vehicles, 3 boats, 68 people, 2 search dogs), Yilan County Fire Department (5 vehicles, 5 boats, 18 people), and Taipei City Fire Department (2 vehicles, 6 people). In total, 50 vehicles, 17 boats, 137 people, and 2 search dogs were sent.</p>
            <p>The disaster monitoring and search and rescue team reported that by 7 PM tonight, there were 221 disaster events nationwide. These caused 2 deaths, 30 missing people, and 28 injuries. A woman who was holding onto a pillar in Guangfu Market in Hualien County has been saved.</p>
            <p>Regarding the deaths, a 55-year-old man named Zhou died in Guangfu Township, Hualien County, at 4 PM for an unknown reason. Also in Guangfu Township, Hualien County, an 80-year-old man named Huang likely died from natural causes at 4 PM.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Fire Department also reported that from 3 PM to 8 PM, they received 506 phone calls. 215 of these became active cases. They also received 109 reports from the police, and 75 of these became active cases. In total, there were 290 cases.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries, and Animal Husbandry group stated that the Matai'an River natural dam overflowed at 2:30 PM. The first big wave of floodwater arrived at 3:30 PM and destroyed the Matai'an River Bridge. The second big wave arrived at 4:30 PM. Based on how the flood looked downstream, about 60 million tons of stored water flowed out.</p>
            <p>Also, the Forestry Bureau will continue to check all monitoring data and information. When the weather is safe, they will immediately send people to the area to take aerial photos. This will help with fixing things after the disaster.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Hualien branch of the Forestry Bureau has prepared staff and equipment for later rescue work. The monitoring team estimates that about 31 million tons of water remain in the natural dam. The Central Weather Bureau predicts about 200 millimeters of rain in the next 12 hours. Also, mud and sand will continue to flow out. People doing rescue work near the river should be careful.</p>
            <p>The Traffic Engineering group said that because the natural dam overflowed, all Taiwan Railways Taitung Line trains will stop running before midnight tonight.</p>
            <p>Also, if the water has not gone away by tomorrow morning, the road between Wanrong and Guangfu will be closed. Emergency plans include: trains going east will go to Hualien Station; trains going west will go to Yuli Station (local trains can go to Ruisui). The bus route will be from Fenglin Station, then take Hualien Route 46, cross Jianyin Bridge, take Highway 193, then Provincial Highway 11A to Guangfu Station, then take Provincial Highway 11A and Highway 193 to Ruisui Station.</p>
            <p>The Traffic Engineering group said that because the Matai'an River Bridge broke, the Highway Bureau has planned alternative roads. These roads are Provincial Highway 9, then Provincial Highway 11C, then Provincial Highway 11, then Provincial Highway 30 (Yuchang Highway), and then back to Provincial Highway 9. They will explain the repair plan before noon tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The Water and Electricity Life Support group said that the Water Resources Agency sent 46 heavy machines, 19 water pumps, and 87 people to help Guangfu Township in Hualien County starting at 4 PM. They also sent people to Guangfu to take aerial photos to get real-time disaster information.</p>
            <p>Also, 14,017 homes across Taiwan lost power at some point, and 2,015 homes still need power fixed. In Hualien County, 2,871 homes lost power, and 1,696 still need power fixed. 4,378 homes in Taiwan (all in Hualien County) lost water. After the water goes down, repairs will be made quickly to restore power and water.</p>
            <p>For disasters, there are currently 51 places with standing water or floods in Taiwan. Water has not gone down in 46 places (Guangfu Township and Fenglin Township in Hualien County). Water has gone down in 5 places (Hualien City and Fuli Township in Hualien County, and Taitung City and Taimali Township in Taitung County).</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense said that 27,875 military personnel are ready, along with 3,853 vehicles and machines of 42 types. All are prepared. The forces sent today arrived as ordered and are helping with disaster response as needed by local governments.</p>
            <p>Commander and Minister of Interior, Liu Shih-Fang, announced that the Central Emergency Operation Center will stay at Level 1 until noon tomorrow. This overflow caused damage to public facilities and people's homes in the city. All government departments are asked to actively work on tasks like rescuing people, fixing power, moving supplies, cleaning the environment, restoring transport, making sure communication works, and actively sharing disaster information. This will help people in Hualien get back to normal life quickly.</p>
            <p>Liu Shih-Fang said that to make sure emergency repairs after the disaster go well, the Ministry of Agriculture should bring together relevant departments to set up a forward coordination office. Vice Minister of Economic Affairs, Lai Chien-Hsin, will be the chief coordinator. This office will work with the Hualien County Government's forward command center to speed up future response and rebuilding efforts.</p>

            <h1>Director Tsai Ming-liang Says "Homecoming" Was a Surprise, Will Film "Walker" Series in Korea</h1>
            <p>Director Tsai Ming-liang's new film "Homecoming" was shown at the Busan International Film Festival. After the showing, he shared that this movie was a happy surprise he didn't plan. He was so excited after finishing the film that he couldn't sleep. Tsai Ming-liang also said that next year, he will film his "Walker" series in Korea.</p>
            <p>This year, Tsai Ming-liang brought "Goodbye, Dragon Inn" and his new film "Homecoming" to the Busan Film Festival. Many movie lovers rushed to buy tickets to see them. During the Q&A after the showing, he spoke with great energy about how he makes films and his ideas about movies. He also kindly signed autographs for all the audience members after the event.</p>
            <p>The movie "Homecoming" is 65 minutes long. Tsai Ming-liang went to Laos, the home country of the actor Anong Houngheuangsy. He brought only one video camera and one photo camera. He filmed for more than two weeks and took pictures of over 100 houses.</p>
            <p>"I asked Anong to take me around, and I was immediately drawn to the houses in their villages," Tsai Ming-liang said. He added that the houses in Laos have a "special feeling" and are made of natural materials like wood and cement. "The most interesting thing is that many houses are empty. Some are being built, some are being fixed, and some are completely broken." Many young people from Laos, like Anong, go to other countries to earn money and send it home to fix their houses.</p>
            <p>In one part of the film, Tsai Ming-liang saw a dog stuck in the middle of a ride at an amusement park. The dog was surrounded by chairs that kept spinning, and it could not get out. "I felt this was like Anong's situation; it's very hard for them to escape their difficulties," Tsai Ming-liang said. He added that people in Laos live very difficult lives but are also very hopeful. He found their overall mood very interesting. "So, I will go back to film them again."</p>
            <p>Many media and audience members were curious why Tsai Ming-liang made "Homecoming." They asked if it was related to his "Walker" series or if it was the end of the series. Tsai Ming-liang explained that his reason for making "Homecoming" was simple. It was because he met Anong and had the chance to go back to Laos with him. That's why he made this unplanned film. "In recent years, I have made many unplanned films. Almost all my films in the second half of my life have been surprises."</p>
            <p>Today, Tsai Ming-liang told reporters that as he gets older, "there isn't much time left to watch the world." He has slowly moved his focus from himself to the world. By going home with Anong, he also saw a different world that was less familiar to him. He said he often travels with his camera and films anything he finds beautiful.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-liang, who seeks "freedom" in filmmaking, said that his films are not meant to tell a story, and he doesn't want films to only tell stories. He wants to share a feeling or a picture, just like looking at art in a museum. "I hope the audience understands that films can be many different things. I always tell the audience at the start that my films are not for entertainment, so don't go to the wrong cinema."</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-liang's films are shown in theaters and also in museums. He believes that audiences need to develop their way of seeing things. He encourages people to visit museums more often to learn about art and to be open to new ideas about films. "If you see film as an art form, you will be more willing to accept different ways of expression." He joked that it's good for the film world to have him, saying, "You can see the many different possibilities of film."</p>
            <p>After his trip to Busan, Tsai Ming-liang will go to the Czech Republic next month to film the 12th part of his "Walker series." He also said that he will film "Walker" in Korea next year. "You will see the Walker appearing in different places around the world. This series is good to watch in theaters and also in art museums."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Farm Group Visits Ohio to Make Food Supply Chain Stronger with the U.S.</h1>
            <p>A group from Taiwan's farming industry visited Columbus, Ohio, in the United States. They signed an agreement with local farming groups to buy their products. Du Wen-Jen, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, said this shows Taiwan supports farmers in Ohio. It helps to lessen the problems caused by changes in international trade. This also helps to make the food supply chain between Taiwan and the U.S. stronger and more reliable.</p>
            <p>From September 20 to 23, the farm group, led by Vice Minister of Agriculture Du Wen-Jen, visited Ohio. On September 22, representatives from Taiwan's soybean and corn industries signed an agreement in Columbus, the state capital. Vice Minister Du Wen-Jen, the head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Chicago, Andy Lei, and Ohio government officials and state lawmakers were there.</p>
            <p>Hong Yao-Kun, the chairman of the Vegetable Oil Manufacturers Association, and Yang Chieh, a leader from the Taiwan Feed Industry Association, signed separate agreements. They signed with the Ohio Soybean Association and the Ohio Corn Marketing Program. In the next four years, Taiwan plans to buy about 2.12 billion US dollars (about 64 billion New Taiwan Dollars) worth of corn products and between 3.44 and 4.2 billion US dollars worth of soybean products from the U.S.</p>
            <p>Du Wen-Jen said that Taiwan and Ohio have been sister states for a long time and have a strong friendship. Their partnership is close. Ohio farmers work hard to grow more crops using natural methods. Also, the state government, state lawmakers, and top universities support this partnership.</p>
            <p>Du Wen-Jen stressed that signing this agreement does more than just improve trade links. It also shows Taiwan's support for Ohio farmers and helps protect them from changes in global trade. This will help make the food supply chain between Taiwan and the U.S. stronger and more stable.</p>
            <p>Andy Lei stated that this year marks 46 years since the Taiwan Relations Act was passed. The relationship between Taiwan and the U.S. has grown a lot in many areas. Both sides are strong partners in safety, trade, and shared values. Their relationship helps each other, and their trade connections have become much stronger. In 2024, Taiwan's investment in the U.S. was 40% of its total overseas investment. From 2021 to 2023, the amount of trade also grew by 50%, building a strong trade system.</p>
            <p>Officials from Ohio and leaders from the state parliament welcomed the farm group and thanked them for visiting. They noted that Taiwan is one of Ohio's top five trade partners. This agricultural cooperation is very important because it benefits both sides. State government officials gave thank you letters from Governor Mike DeWine and Lieutenant Governor Jim Tressel.</p>
            <p>Earlier, the 2025 Republic of China (Taiwan) Agricultural Trade Goodwill Mission visited Washington D.C. After that, they visited Arkansas, Ohio, Indiana, South Dakota, Montana, Idaho, Florida, and Texas. They talked about buying soybeans, corn, wheat, beef, and other farm products.</p>
