            <h1>US Media: Trump Wants US Military to Prepare to Attack Latin American Drug Lords</h1>
            <p>US media reported today that President Trump is getting ready to use military force against several drug groups in Latin America. This comes after Washington called these groups "terrorist organizations" earlier this year.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that Trump has told the Pentagon to get ready to take military action against drug groups that are seen as terrorist organizations. The Wall Street Journal stated that Trump ordered the Pentagon to prepare different plans for action.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal mentioned that using special forces and giving intelligence help are some ideas being discussed. Any action would be done with other countries.</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly did not confirm these reports. However, in a statement, she said that Trump's "main goal is to keep the country safe. This is why he took strong actions to call several drug groups and gangs foreign terrorist organizations."</p>
            <p>In February this year, the United States named Venezuela's "Tren de Aragua," Mexico's "Sinaloa Cartel," and six other drug groups in Latin America as terrorist organizations.</p>
            <p>The Trump government later also named Venezuela's "Cartel of the Suns" as a terrorist organization. This group has supposedly brought hundreds of tons of drugs into the US over the past 20 years.</p>
            <p>On January 20, Trump returned to the White House. On his first day, he signed an order to create a process for naming such groups. He said that these drug groups "are a bigger danger to national security than regular organized crime."</p>
            <p>After news reports about the US possibly taking military action against drug groups, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said today that "no invasion of our country will be allowed."</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum worked hard to show Trump that she is taking action against Mexican drug groups. Trump has accused these groups of bringing a lot of drugs, especially fentanyl, into the US.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum said, "We are working together, and we are helping each other. But no invasion will be allowed. This is completely out of the question."</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum stated at a morning press conference that she would carefully look at Trump's order. She also said she was told that no US soldiers would be in Mexico.</p>

            <h1>Germany Approves Plan to Speed Up Carbon Capture Infrastructure; Hopes to Balance Net-Zero and Heavy Industries</h1>
            <p>The German government has approved a new plan to build more carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems faster. Germany wants to stop adding carbon to the atmosphere by the end of 2045. At the same time, it wants to keep some industries that produce a lot of carbon.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that CCS technology takes carbon dioxide directly from factories or from the air and puts it deep underground.</p>
            <p>Industries that are difficult to make carbon-free, like those making cement and lime, and gas power plants, will be able to store carbon dioxide under the sea. They can also store it on land if the local government agrees.</p>
            <p>The German government approved this plan on August 6. It says that building and running carbon dioxide storage places and pipelines are very important for the public. This will make it simpler to plan and get approval for these projects.</p>
            <p>The previous government, made of three parties, also tried to pass laws for CCS technology, but they failed before their term ended last November. This new plan is more ambitious than the old one.</p>
            <p>Under the new plan, old natural gas pipelines can be changed to carry carbon dioxide instead of natural gas. This means fewer new pipelines will need to be built.</p>
            <p>Also, the law allows authorities to take private land to build carbon dioxide pipelines, as long as they pay fairly for it.</p>
            <p>Geologically, Germany has space to store about 1.5 billion to 8.3 billion tons of carbon under its part of the North Sea. It can store up to about 20 million tons each year.</p>

            <h1>Putin Wants to Meet Trump in UAE; US Media Reveals US-Russia Secret Ceasefire Talks</h1>
            <p>US media, quoting people who know about it, said that the US and Russia are trying to make a deal to stop the war in Ukraine. This deal would let Russia keep the land it took from Ukraine. Russia has said that Russian President Putin wants to meet US President Trump in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News, quoting unnamed sources, reported that US and Russian officials are talking about problems like Russian-controlled land. This is to get ready for a meeting between Trump and Putin, possibly next week. The US is trying hard to get Ukraine and its European friends to agree to this deal, but it is very uncertain if they will.</p>
            <p>Putin wants Ukraine to give Russia the whole Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He also wants Ukraine to accept that Russia took Crimea in 2014. This means Ukrainian soldiers, who still control some parts of Luhansk and Donetsk, would have to leave. This would be like giving up land that Russian forces have not yet taken.</p>
            <p>Sources said that, based on the current talks between the US and Russia, Russia would stop fighting along the current battle lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The sources stressed that the details of the deal are not final and could change at any time. It is not clear if Russia will leave parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions it has already taken. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in an area controlled by Russia.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that Putin today said he plans to meet Trump. He said the United Arab Emirates would be a good place for the meeting. Putin met with UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan in Moscow today.</p>
            <p>Earlier on August 8, a White House official, who did not want to be named, said Trump would only meet Putin if Putin agreed to meet Ukrainian President Zelensky. On the same day, Putin said it was not the right time to meet Zelensky.</p>
            <p>Later on August 8, Trump changed his mind. He said Putin does not need to agree to meet Zelensky before meeting him. He briefly told reporters in the Oval Office, "No, he doesn't have to. They (meaning the Russians) want to meet me, and I will do my best to stop the killing."</p>
            <p>Since Trump was elected last year, Moscow has hoped to make a deal with the US to end the war on Russia's terms. They have purposely left Ukraine and Europe out of these talks. The Washington Post believes that holding a meeting now would be a big diplomatic success for Putin, especially after Trump recently criticized Russia for bombing Ukrainian cities and called Putin "crazy."</p>
            <p>After avoiding pressure for a ceasefire for several months, Putin might now hope to control Trump at the meeting, like when they met in Helsinki in 2018. At that time, Trump agreed with Putin's denial that Russia interfered in the 2016 US election, even though US intelligence agencies said Russia did.</p>
            <p>Experts on Russian issues say Putin is sure he is winning the Russia-Ukraine war. He thinks he can reach his goals, such as making Ukraine's military weaker and stopping Kyiv from joining NATO.</p>
            <p>Tatiana Stanovaya, an expert at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote on social media that no matter how Putin says his conditions, "it is really the same demand: Ukraine stops fighting, the West stops sending weapons, Kyiv accepts Russia's terms, which is like giving up."</p>
            <p>Some experts say Trump seems determined to get a ceasefire agreement no matter what.</p>
            <p>John Foreman, a former British military officer in Moscow, said Trump is unwisely trying to make a peace deal that is unlikely to happen. He believes Putin will trick Trump with a "deal" that actually means Ukraine has to surrender. "You will see things happen like this: Trump is happy because he is praised, Putin makes small changes to avoid problems, the war continues, and then Russia celebrates," he said.</p>
