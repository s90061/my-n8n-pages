From smart devices in our homes to apps on our phones, AI is helping us in many ways.

Itâ€™s also used in customer service chatbots to answer questions quickly. This technology is changing how we interact with products and services, making many tasks easier and more personal. However, as AI becomes more common, there are also discussions about important issues like privacy, how our data is used, and the need for people to control how AI works. Experts believe that AI will continue to grow and change our daily routines even more in the future.
