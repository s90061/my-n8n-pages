Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his visit to North Korea. Videos from Russia's foreign ministry show them shaking hands and hugging. Both Russian and North Korean media reported that Lavrov will stay in North Korea until tomorrow. This visit is part of many high-level trips to North Korea by Russian officials, as Russia and North Korea are strengthening their military and political ties because of Russia's war in Ukraine. North Korea has sent thousands of soldiers to Russia to help fight Ukrainian forces and has given Russia artillery shells and missiles. Russia's TASS news agency said Lavrov thanked North Korean soldiers and that North Korean officials fully support Russia's goals in Ukraine.

**UK Media: US Asks Japan and Australia About Their Role in a Taiwan Strait War**

The Financial Times reported today that the US Pentagon is asking Japan and Australia what they would do if there was a war between the US and China over Taiwan. This request has made these two important US allies in the Indo-Pacific region unhappy. Reuters said that sources told the Financial Times that Elbridge Colby, a top policy official at the US Department of Defense, has been pushing this question in recent talks with Japanese and Australian defense officials. The Financial Times noted that this request surprised Tokyo and Canberra because the US itself has not promised to defend Taiwan without conditions. The US does not have official ties with Taiwan but is its most important arms supplier. Taiwan is facing more military pressure from China, including military drills, as Beijing tries to claim Taiwan. Taiwan rejects China's claims. Japan's Ministry of Defense said it is hard to answer a hypothetical question about a "Taiwan emergency." They stated that any action would be "based on the constitution, international law, and domestic laws and rules, depending on each specific case." Australia's embassy in the US did not comment.

**Civics Subject Test Difficulty Debated, Gender Equality Questions a Highlight**

The Civics subject test for the advanced subject test (åˆ†ç§‘æ¸¬é©—) was completed today. While different expert groups had different opinions on how hard the test was, they all praised how well it connected to real life, especially the questions on gender issues. These questions were a notable highlight and covered topics like labor conditions, caregiving responsibilities, and the definition of unemployment. Teachers from the "Winners Education" group analyzed the 2025 Civics test. They predict that the average scores will be higher than last year, especially for middle-level students, because there were more knowledge-based questions and fewer reading comprehension questions. They also noted that the questions were well-designed, combining academic concepts with real-life situations like gender equality, street performers, online platforms, food delivery, and current international events. However, there were a few questions that caused some debate, particularly questions 19 and 20, which discussed changes in annual income for couples with children in a certain country. One expert group, the National Federation of High School Teachers and Staff Unions, said the Civics test this year was "medium to slightly difficult," with many multiple-choice questions and charts. They noted that the gender-related questions were excellent, covering topics such as the work situations of women with disabilities and women's caregiving roles. Another group, the National Teachers' Association, found the test to be harder overall compared to last year.
