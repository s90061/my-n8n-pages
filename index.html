A 21-year-old man, Zhou Ziyun, went to a dentist in Taipei last month. He hit the female dentist, Ms. Shen, because he said his tooth cleaning hurt too much. Police found that the owner of Earth Village, Chen Zhongyi, had asked a main member of the Zhulian Gang's Jing'an group, Xia Weiteng, to deal with a debt of over ten million dollars. Police arrested six people. The court decided to keep Xia Weiteng and another member, Zhou Wenhan, in custody. This is because they might do it again. Zhou Ziyun is also in custody, so three people are now held.

Xia Weiteng, also known as "Xia An," said he was asked by Chen Zhongyi to handle the debt. But he said he never threatened the dentist. He added that he only talked to her calmly about how to return the mortgage papers. He also said he did not know Zhou Ziyun and did not tell him to hit anyone. He did not know why the dentist was hit.

Ms. Shen, the dentist, said she lent Chen Zhongyi 15 million NT dollars. But Chen Zhongyi did not pay it back. She sued him and won. However, he then repeatedly sent gang members to "talk about the debt." They said they would pay only if she first gave back the mortgage papers. Ms. Shen believes this was a trick to avoid paying her.

Police found that Chen Zhongyi had borrowed 15 million NT dollars from Ms. Shen and another man, Mr. Liu. Chen used house papers as a guarantee and gave them to Ms. Shen. In April this year, Chen asked Xia Weiteng to "handle" getting the mortgage papers back. Mr. Liu also received threats about similar issues.

Police found that Xia Weiteng, Yan Daozhi, and Zhou Wenhan went to Ms. Shen's clinic to talk. During the talk, they used their gang's name, which made Ms. Shen afraid. When the talks failed, they are believed to have told Zhou Ziyun to pretend to need a tooth cleaning to attack Ms. Shen.

On the day the dentist was hit, her clinic's air conditioning was being fixed, so she had no appointments that morning. But Zhou Ziyun came in and insisted on being seen. He saw a camera in front of the dental chair and kept asking to move to a different spot. Luckily, Ms. Shen refused to move, and the camera recorded the attack. Because Ms. Shen was almost seriously hurt, the court had already decided to keep Zhou Ziyun in custody. Now, Xia Weiteng and Zhou Wenhan are also held, bringing the total to three people in custody.

**May 2025 Was Second Hottest May Ever, This Year Likely to Be One of Five Hottest**

According to new reports from Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), May 2025 was the second hottest May ever recorded. The average temperature around the world was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than before factories became common. The NCEI also said that there is a very high chance (more than 99%) that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years in history.

In May, many places around the world had extremely high temperatures. On May 24, the United Arab Emirates had its hottest May day ever, reaching 51.6 degrees Celsius. Iceland had its worst heatwave in May, with over 90% of its weather stations recording new high temperatures for the month. France also had a strong heatwave in May. On May 30, the highest temperature for the whole country reached 30.5 degrees Celsius, which was a record for May. This was only the second time since 1947 that the temperature went over 30 degrees Celsius in May.

Taiwan's Central Weather Administration also said that the amount of sea ice in the Arctic has been very low since the start of this year. While it improved a little in April, in May, it was still the lowest in five years and melting faster than usual. The sea ice in the Antarctic is also in a very bad state, with almost no ice in some parts.

The Weather Administration also reported that oceans worldwide are having "marine heatwaves," meaning they are unusually hot. This is greatly hurting ocean life and the environment and economy along the coasts. It could also make climate change worse.

The Weather Administration stated that global warming continues to cause problems everywhere. From January to May 2025, the average global temperature was the second highest ever recorded. The NCEI also said that it is very likely (over 99% chance) that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years in history.

**Guangzhou Jinan University Removed from Taiwan's Recognized University List**

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of universities and colleges that it recognizes in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 colleges.

The Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools connected to China's United Front Work Department (a political organization) are not truly academic. He stated that it is important to stop working with them, and their degrees will not be recognized in Taiwan anymore.

The Ministry of Education explained that Guangzhou Jinan University has been under the control of China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal school environment without political goals, the Ministry decided to remove Guangzhou Jinan University from its list.

The Ministry of Education also said that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair, respectful, and helpful to both sides. Schools in Taiwan should be careful when China invites them to events. They should check the event's purpose, who is organizing it, the schedule, and any information provided. This is to make sure there are no political goals or content, and to avoid accepting free trips or helping with China's political messages.

Additionally, the Ministry of Education stated that if schools are unsure about the organizers or plans for an event, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. Taiwan still hopes for more learning and understanding between young people from both sides. However, students should be aware of possible risks and check the background of organizers and any political aims.
