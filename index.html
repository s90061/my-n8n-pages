            <h1>New Taipei Fisherman's Wharf Fireworks Show: Pink and Romantic Atmosphere Attracts Nearly 60,000 People</h1>
            <p>The "Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf Midsummer Fun" events started tonight with a beautiful fireworks show. About 60,000 people came to watch it. Vice Mayor Liu He-ran said there will be more fireworks shows on August 17th and 24th. He asked people not to miss them.</p>
            <p>Liu He-ran said that New Taipei City has 28 fishing ports. Since 2019, the city government has been working on a plan called "Hi Fishing Port." They are changing the fishing ports based on what they are like and what is special about the local area. This makes the fishing ports good for tourism and other things. So far, 22 fishing ports have been changed. All of them are expected to be changed by next year.</p>
            <p>Because the Danjiang Bridge will be finished soon, this year's "Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf Midsummer Fun" event is bigger. It started with tonight's fireworks. There will also be fireworks on August 17th and 24th. During the event, there will be fashion shows, student art displays, and folk song concerts. These will make the fishing port a place for fun, art, and old memories.</p>
            <p>Then, the first fireworks show, called "Eternal Love Song," started beautifully. It mostly used pink and rose colors to create a strong feeling of love. People watching were very surprised and happy.</p>
            <p>The Fisheries Department said that this year's fireworks are bigger and better than before. The show had three parts: "Not Yet Lovers," "Sweet Love," and "Vows of Happiness." The fireworks went up from the ground to the sky, making beautiful layers. This created a wonderful view over the Tamsui River, full of love and happiness. Nearly 60,000 people came to the fishing port to see the fireworks.</p>

            <h1>Blue Lawmaker Says President Giving Water is Like Feeding Deer in Nara; Green Lawmaker Criticizes as Malicious Misdirection</h1>
            <p>News reports said that a KMT lawmaker, Lin Pei-xiang, talked about a video of President Lai Ching-te giving drinks to workers. He said it looked like feeding deer in Nara, Japan. Today, a DPP lawmaker, Kuo Kuo-wen, said that the President visited the house for more than an hour. But Lin Pei-xiang only used one picture and made fun of it, saying it was "feeding deer in Nara." Kuo said this was trying to spread bad ideas on purpose.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, President Lai visited the disaster recovery center in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan. He also went to places like Jiali to see how houses were being fixed. News reports said that Lin Pei-xiang commented on the CTV program today that the President giving drinks to workers looked like feeding deer in Nara.</p>
            <p>Kuo Kuo-wen said that President Lai's visit to the house lasted more than an hour. But Lin Pei-xiang cut out most of the video and used only one picture to make a light joke, calling it "feeding deer in Nara." He said this was purposely misleading. Kuo added that it is okay to talk about politics, but this kind of language makes it seem like he doesn't respect the hard-working construction workers. Kuo said this proud attitude is probably why he caused problems before by calling some people "outcasts."</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Lin Chun-hsien said that yesterday, President Lai went to see two houses being fixed. He also brought sports drinks to thank the workers. After his visit, President Lai walked around the area and gave sports drinks to people on the street and to other workers nearby. He wanted to show care for the disaster victims and thank the engineering teams for working hard on a holiday.</p>
            <p>Lin Chun-hsien said that central and southern Taiwan were hit hard by the typhoon and then by strong southwest air currents that caused more damage. He said that facing this disaster, it is most important for everyone to work together to get through the difficult time. He pointed out that political comments should be based on facts. Useless political talk does not help with disaster recovery, and people should not use the disaster to gain political advantage.</p>
