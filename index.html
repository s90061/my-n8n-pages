            <h1>8 Chinese Planes Cross Center Line, Taiwan Military Monitors and Responds</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said today that from 6 AM yesterday until 6 AM today, eight Chinese military aircraft crossed the middle line of the Taiwan Strait. They flew into the air near the northern and southwestern parts of Taiwan. The military used its planes, ships, and missile systems on land to watch the situation closely and respond.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Ministry of National Defense shared information about the movements of Chinese planes and ships. They reported that from 6 AM yesterday to 6 AM today, they saw 12 Chinese military aircraft. Eight of these planes crossed the Taiwan Strait's middle line and went into the northern and southwestern airspaces. They also saw 9 Chinese naval ships and 2 Chinese government ships. These ships and planes were active around the Taiwan Strait. The Ministry of National Defense stressed that Taiwan's military uses its planes, ships, and land-based missile systems to carefully watch and deal with these situations.</p>

            <h1>AI Net Zero / Shin Mo Screws Works to Reduce Carbon and Uses Digital Management</h1>
            <p>Using digital technology is a current trend in industries. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for both governments and businesses in Taiwan. These things are very important for Taiwan's future ability to compete. Taiwan is the third largest country that sells metal fasteners around the world, and it is known as the "Kingdom of Screws." Shin Mo Screws, a company in Gangshan District, Kaohsiung City, is working hard to sell custom-made screws. It is also using digital ways to manage its production and working with its suppliers to help reduce carbon emissions in the industry.</p>
            <p>More than half of Taiwan's metal fastener factories are in the southern part of the country. Many of them are in the areas of Gangshan and Luzhu in Kaohsiung, forming an important group of fastener companies. This area is often called the "Screw Hole." But recently, due to changes in raw material prices around the world and cheaper prices from places like mainland China, some smaller companies have closed down.</p>
            <p>Shin Mo Screws, which started in 1990, is making big changes. The company has invested money to build new factories. They have also started using automatic machines and digital management. From the outside, the factory might look like any other screw factory. But if you watch the production line for a while, you will notice there are fewer workers, and the machines work in a very organized way.</p>
            <p>Kuo Ying-cheng, the General Manager of Shin Mo Screws, showed a reporter around the factory. He pointed to the screens on the machines and said that the machines they use now are much faster and make better quality products. Also, they have added sensors that connect to the internet. This means one worker can watch many machines at the same time. If a machine has a problem, a red light appears right away. This saves workers from checking each machine one by one and means fewer people are needed on the factory floor.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that Shin Mo Screws mainly sells its products to markets in Europe and America. For more than 30 years, since the company started, the price of finished fasteners has kept going down. However, costs like salaries and electricity have kept going up. It is hard to compete with other countries like China that can make products for less money, especially for standard products.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that to avoid unhealthy price competition, companies need to use automation and improve their industries. He mentioned that some smaller companies have decided to close in recent years. To deal with rising costs and not having enough workers, Shin Mo Screws decided to stop competing on price for standard products. Instead, they are focusing on making their research and development stronger. They want to sell special products that many customers want customized.</p>
            <p>He explained that in addition to updating machines and improving how they manage automated production, they also use a special method. This method means that one mold is used for only one type of screw. This makes the products better quality and reduces waste of materials, which also lowers carbon emissions. They are also actively working with government groups and universities to use digital technology and follow the world trend of reducing carbon emissions. This will help make their products more competitive around the world.</p>
            <p>With help from the Industrial Development Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Shin Mo Screws has improved its processes to save electricity. They have successfully reduced their yearly carbon emissions by about 3%. They also built a system to treat waste oil. This saves money because they don't have to pay other companies to handle the waste oil. It has also made the factory environment better. This shows they are planning for green production early.</p>
            <p>Shin Mo Screws also joined special programs from the Industrial Development Bureau. They are now using AI to guess how much product customers will need. They have also started using a smart system that shows factory information, and they have built a smart platform to work together and track things. This system checks how well all the machines are working. They also have a system to track information about fasteners. This system connects with their suppliers to get information right away. It helps them manage production automatically and use good work methods to make their production schedule better. This also helps solve problems like having too many products in storage or taking too long to make things.</p>
            <p>Kuo Jun-ting, the Assistant General Manager of Shin Mo Screws, said that working with other companies has made their production processes better. Sharing information on a cloud platform also means they do less repeated paperwork. This has made their production faster and helped them sell products from storage more quickly. After they started watching their production processes, the time it takes to make things is about 20% shorter. From when raw materials arrive to when products are shipped, everything can be managed using data.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that when the government helps high-tech electronics companies improve, it's often easier. This is because the way these companies work is often quite similar, so one system can usually be changed a little to fit many companies. This means electronics companies are often better at getting help and money from the government than traditional industries.</p>
            <p>He explained that traditional industries, especially metal processing factories, have many companies, and they are very different in size. Each factory has different work processes. So, it is harder to do big improvement plans for them. Shin Mo Screws worked with its suppliers to find the main problems and fix them better. This teamwork also helped more companies, making the whole industry stronger.</p>
            <p>The company leaders believe that this industry should have tried to improve more than 20 years ago. At that time, a lot of money and technology from Taiwan went to mainland China, which was a big change. Recently, money has started coming back, and the world situation is changing. Many countries are trying to limit China. This could be another chance for traditional industries in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo said that for companies, improving their industry means they might need to spend tens of millions of dollars first. But it's hard to know if they will see results right away. Also, traditional industries often have problems like not enough workers and high operating costs. Because of these challenges, some companies decide to stop their business while they are thinking about what to do.</p>
            <p>He said that if you look at what industries need now and what the trends are, protecting the environment will be a very important direction for development. Shin Mo Screws will also continue to work hard to reduce carbon emissions and help create a green and lasting environment. They will also actively join related projects.</p>
