            <h1>Doctors want heated tobacco quitting services to get government help; no flavored heated tobacco, and no display in stores.</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's National Health Agency has allowed heated tobacco with some conditions. Doctors say heated tobacco is still tobacco, and all tobacco is bad for you. They say that there should be rules: stores cannot show heated tobacco, flavored heated tobacco should not be allowed, and money from heated tobacco taxes should help people quit.</p>
            <p>The new Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act has been active for more than two years. It completely bans e-cigarettes and similar products. It also strictly controls new tobacco products, like heated tobacco, that are defined as tobacco. It added a new system to check health risks.</p>
            <p>The National Health Agency recently shared the newest results of these checks. It showed that 8 items from Company F and 6 items from Company J have been conditionally approved and sent to the companies.</p>
            <p>Wen Qi-bang, who started the Taiwan Medical Alliance for Tobacco Control, said today at a forum that heated tobacco, like regular cigarettes, has no good points. He is unhappy that heated tobacco, which has many things that cause cancer, was approved. He also asked why convenience stores are allowed to sell cancer-causing products. Heated tobacco has nicotine, so people can easily become addicted. He believes that allowing heated tobacco makes no sense.</p>
            <p>Dr. Guo Fei-ran, a doctor from National Taiwan University Hospital, said that heated tobacco is tobacco, and all tobacco is harmful. A study in Japan by the University of Waterloo in Canada looked at tobacco control. This study showed that the idea of heated tobacco being less harmful is wrong. Even if someone smokes less, for example, from 20 to 1 heated tobacco stick, the risk is still 1.5 times higher. The risk only goes down to the same level as non-smokers if people stop using all tobacco products. Also, 90% of users become people who use both regular cigarettes and heated tobacco.</p>
            <p>Dr. Guo Fei-ran said that if strict control and related rules are part of the approval, they must be truly put into action. If not, these promises might not be kept. Quitting heated tobacco is the same as quitting regular cigarettes. Heated tobacco is still a tobacco product and has nicotine. It still involves smoking. In the future, heated tobacco will be taxed. So, the government should use some of this tax money to help people quit heated tobacco.</p>
            <p>Lin Qing-li, director of the John Tung Foundation's Tobacco Hazards Prevention Center, said that since the government has approved heated tobacco with conditions, it should immediately announce that all flavored tobacco products, except pure tobacco flavor, are banned. They should also stop the sale of flavored heated tobacco that is already on the market. When heated tobacco is sold, companies should not say it is "approved after health risk assessment." Heated tobacco devices should not be promoted or advertised by showing them in stores. This means no stores can display heated tobacco devices.</p>
            <p>Luo Su-ying, head of the National Health Agency's Tobacco Hazards Prevention Division, said that heated tobacco is a tobacco product. Professional quitting services cover how to quit tobacco addiction. If a product contains additives that the central authority later bans, it must follow the rules. It is also forbidden to use words like "approved after Taiwan's health risk assessment" or other words that might make people think smoking is not harmful or only a little harmful.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether heated tobacco will be sold everywhere regular cigarettes are sold, Luo Su-ying said that during the review of heated tobacco, the committee asked companies to make promises. These promises were included in the conditional approval. This includes rules for sales points. The actual plan for where to sell depends on the heated tobacco companies. No matter how many places they open, companies must follow the conditions of the approval and the Tobacco Hazards Prevention Act.</p>

            <h1>ASE Technology Holding expects packaging and testing business to grow in the second half of the year; advanced packaging will help next year's income.</h1>
            <p>Wu Tien-yu, the chief operating officer of ASE Technology Holding, a company that packages and tests chips, said today that he expects their packaging and testing business to continue growing in the third quarter. He also expects it to grow again in the fourth quarter. For advanced packaging and testing, the company aims for an extra $1 billion in income in 2025 compared to 2024. He believes ASE Technology Holding's income will keep growing until 2026 and beyond.</p>
            <p>ASE Technology Holding held its first in-person meeting for investors this afternoon since the pandemic. Talking about their business for the second half of the year, Wu Tien-yu said that in US dollars, he expects the packaging and testing business to keep growing in the third quarter and also in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>For advanced packaging and testing, Wu Tien-yu expects annual income to increase by $1 billion compared to 2024. This will add 10% to the growth of their packaging and testing business. For their normal business, he expects growth to be in the middle to high single digits this year.</p>
            <p>Wu Tien-yu thinks that ASE Technology Holding's income will continue to grow until 2026 and later. This is mainly because of new, advanced solutions, the spread of artificial intelligence (AI), and a general increase in demand for semiconductors as the market gets better.</p>
            <p>About investments, Wu Tien-yu said that the company continues to invest in research and development, its workers, new production abilities, and smart factory buildings. These investments will help support growth for many years.</p>

            <h1>Alishan Highway and Provincial Highway 3 (Zhongpu to Dapu) will close tonight as a safety measure.</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency reported that southwest winds are causing very heavy rain in the mountains of Chiayi County. This might cause landslides, falling rocks, and trees falling down. To keep people and cars safe, the Highway Bureau will close parts of Alishan Highway and Provincial Highway 3 (from Zhongpu to Dapu) tonight as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau's Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan Branch announced that National Highway 18 (Alishan Highway) from kilometer 68.5 to kilometer 88 (Fushan to Alishan) will close at 6 PM tonight. Also, National Highway 18 from kilometer 34 to kilometer 68.5 (Chukou to Fushan) will close at 8 PM tonight.</p>
            <p>In addition, Provincial Highway 3 from kilometer 295 to kilometer 336 (Yinshui, Zhongpu, Chiayi County, to Dapu) will also close at 8 PM tonight as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>The Highway Bureau said that these roads will be checked tomorrow morning at 8 AM. They will decide then if they can open the roads, depending on the weather and road conditions. The bureau reminds drivers that during typhoons and heavy rain, mountain roads can have landslides and falling rocks, and it is hard to know what the road conditions will be like. So, people should not go into mountain areas unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
