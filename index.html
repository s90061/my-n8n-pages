            <h1>Helping Hualien Recover from Disaster: Reserve Service Men Called in Two Groups Starting October 13th</h1>
            <p>A dammed lake overflowed at Matai'an River in Hualien County, causing a big disaster. The work to rebuild after the disaster is still going on. Today, the Ministry of Interior announced that the Hualien County Government has for the first time asked reserve alternative service men to help. Starting October 13th, 240 reserve alternative service men from Hualien County will be called in two groups to help with the recovery work. Their rights and duties will be the same as when they were doing their alternative service.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said in a press release today that the Matai'an River in Hualien County had a dammed lake overflow, which caused serious damage. The Hualien County Government has, for the first time, asked reserve alternative service men to come and help. They plan to do this in two groups, with 120 men in each group, making 240 men in total. The first group will work from October 13th to 17th. The second group will work from October 20th to 24th. A third group will be planned later if needed, depending on how the disaster recovery goes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said that the men called to help are reserve alternative service men who live in Hualien County. They will be used based on what the disaster response center needs. During their service, their rights and duties are the same as when they were doing their alternative service. Their employers must give them official leave, and they can ask for money to cover their travel costs.</p>
            <p>Regarding payment, the Ministry of Interior said that they will give 700 New Taiwan Dollars as a daily payment. For 5 days, this will be 3500 New Taiwan Dollars in total. The Hualien County Government will also arrange food and places to stay, so the men can help with the disaster relief without worry.</p>
            <p>Besides the reserve alternative service men, the Ministry of Interior also said that with the spirit of "one island, one life, sharing hardships," they have for the first time sent active alternative service men from different cities and counties to help in the Hualien disaster area. As of today, 1445 men have helped, working hard on the front lines of the disaster relief. The people affected by the disaster have thanked them a lot.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior pointed out that this important experience not only showed how well the men's usual disaster prevention and relief training works, but it also made their sense of duty to public service stronger. They showed care and warmth to the people of Hualien with their actions.</p>

            <h1>Sanae Takaichi Becomes Leader of LDP; Beijing Hopes for Wise Policy Towards China</h1>
            <p>Today, Sanae Takaichi was chosen as the 29th leader of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). She might become the first woman prime minister of Japan. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that China hopes Japan will keep its promises on important matters like history and Taiwan. China also hopes Japan will have a wise and active policy towards China.</p>
            <p>According to a Chinese news source, Global Times, Sanae Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader today, October 4th. About this election result, an unnamed spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told foreign reporters that China knows about the election result and that it is Japan's own business.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that they hope Japan will follow the rules and agreements from the four important political documents between China and Japan. They hope Japan will keep its promises on big issues like history and Taiwan. They also hope Japan will have a wise and active policy towards China. This way, the idea of having a good relationship that helps both sides can really happen.</p>
            <p>When Sanae Takaichi was chosen as the LDP leader, and with the chance of her becoming Japan's prime minister, many people in China became interested and talked about it today. Chinese news described Takaichi as a "female Abe" and a conservative politician who wants a tough policy towards China. They said this would make things difficult for China and Japan's relationship. Many comments on Chinese social media were negative, and some even wished for the relationship between the two countries to get worse and lead to a conflict.</p>

            <h1>Lee Chih-kai Wins Pommel Horse for 6th Time at National Games, Hopes for Taiwan's First World Championship Gold</h1>
            <p>In the National Games gymnastics competition in Yunlin, Taiwan's famous athlete, "Pommel Horse Prince" Lee Chih-kai, won the men's pommel horse final today. He scored 13.966 points and won for the sixth time in a row. He said he hopes to stay in good shape and win Taiwan's first-ever gold medal at the World Championships in gymnastics.</p>
            <p>Last year, Lee Chih-kai could not go to the Paris Olympics. After that, he decided to "get repairs" for his body. He spent more than half a year getting better. Early this year, he came back from his injury and started to compete in the Gymnastics World Challenge Cup in May.</p>
            <p>Today, in the individual finals at the National Games, Lee Chih-kai showed his great skill on the pommel horse again. He got a difficulty score of 5.2 points and an execution score of 8.766 points. His total score was 13.966 points, which led to his sixth win in a row. After the competition, Lee Chih-kai told reporters that he thought he might be tired after competing in the all-around event yesterday. But he said, "Actually, my overall condition is very good."</p>
            <p>Because of new rules for gymnastics, a routine can only have a maximum of four "Thomas Flair" moves. Other moves must use "flair with legs together" or other new combinations of moves. This means Lee Chih-kai has to "put away" some of his famous moves. He said that the "flair with legs together" move feels like "the most familiar stranger." He also said he is still trying new things. He hopes to "quickly find his own rhythm to be ready for every competition that comes next."</p>
            <p>The World Gymnastics Championships will happen in Indonesia in two weeks. Lee Chih-kai has won one silver and one bronze medal there before. He said he hopes to win another medal of a different color. He wants to "keep challenging himself. This will also help him do well in future Asian Games or when trying to get into the Olympics."</p>
            <p>"King of Asia Cats" Tang Chia-hung also did very well on the men's horizontal bar, which is his specialty. He scored 14.600 points and won for the fourth time in a row. He said he hopes to continue the strong performance from winning gold at the Asian Championships. He wants to try and get on the podium at the World Championships. He added, "This year is a new cycle. I will first see what my score is roughly, how the judges take points off, and then try to make new history for Taiwan."</p>
