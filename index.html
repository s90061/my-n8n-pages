            <h1>Ministry of Defense: Taiwan Will Increase Supplies to Be Ready for Possible Blockades</h1>
            <p>The government recently passed a special budget to make Taiwan stronger. Taiwan's military supplies will increase from enough for 30 days to enough for 120 days. Huang Wen-chi, who is in charge of war plans at the Ministry of National Defense, said today that China's ability to block the sea is growing. So, Taiwan must increase all its military supplies. This will help Taiwan keep fighting if an enemy attacks.</p>
            <p>On September 11, the government approved the special budget. This budget includes 113.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars for the Ministry of National Defense. This money will be used to make command and communication stronger (67.3 billion), update facilities for military power (42.9 billion), and protect the sea and people (3 billion).</p>
            <p>Minister of National Defense Gu Li-xiong said then that Taiwan must be aware of and careful about China's threats. With this special budget, Taiwan's military supplies will last from 30 days to 120 days. Also, it will improve the military readiness of those in reserve, including those doing one-year military service. The money will also be used to fix training areas and store different types of ammunition. This will make sure Taiwan can keep fighting.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Ministry of National Defense held a press conference for the "New National Defense Handbook." Lieutenant General Huang Wen-chi, head of war plans, said that because China's ability to block the sea is getting stronger, Taiwan must increase all its military supplies. Getting supplies quickly will be the most important goal for each item.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-chi explained that getting fuel and drinking water will be the first things in the budget. For other items like spare parts, ammunition, and food, proper storage is needed. So, the budget includes money to fix ammunition depots, food storage areas, and parts warehouses. These repairs and the time it takes to get supplies will then meet the needs.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-chi also stressed that the ministry will keep checking its plans for possible enemy blockades. This is to make sure Taiwan can keep fighting if an enemy attacks.</p>
            <p>Military reserves are military goods planned and stored based on war plans. They are used to support military operations for the whole time they are needed. Safety reserves, also called safety supply standards, are the amount of military goods needed to keep supplying when normal supplies stop or when more supplies are needed for fighting.</p>

            <h1>First International Children's Book Fair in Taichung; Mayor Lu Shiow-yen Invites Everyone</h1>
            <p>The first Taiwan International Children's and Young Adult Book Fair will start on September 18 in Taichung City. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that Taichung has been ranked first in reading for four years in a row. Because of this, the Ministry of Culture chose Taichung for this first children's book fair. She welcomes everyone to join.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture and the Taichung City Government are organizing the first Taiwan International Children's and Young Adult Book Fair. It will be held from September 18 to 21 at the Taichung International Exhibition Center. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said in a city meeting today that everyone is welcome to come and visit.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that the city government has increased the money for buying books every year. It has doubled from 50 million to 100 million New Taiwan Dollars. Also, five big libraries, like the Green Museum Library, will open. The Ministry of Education has also said that Taichung is number one in reading for four years. This is why the Ministry of Culture chose Taichung to host the first international children's book fair. There will also be talks by famous writers and new book launches. Everyone is welcome to join.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture explained that the first children's book fair will have Taichung City as the main city. It will have a special "Taichung City Pavilion." There will also be a new Taiwan Comic Pavilion, a Picture Book Story Pavilion, and an Italy Pavilion and Children's Book Pavilion that moved from the Taipei International Book Exhibition. Many publishers will also join, showing both general and children's books. There will be talks by famous writers from Taiwan and other countries. The fair will combine exhibitions, sales, and events to encourage reading. It will be a reading party for people in central Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Cultural Affairs Bureau said that the Taichung City Pavilion will show different sides of Taichung. These include its mountains, rivers, culture, history, nature, and water. They hope the book fair will show how much Taichung supports reading. They want more children to love books and help make Taichung a city of books.</p>
            <p>The Hsin-Yi Foundation, one of the groups joining the fair, said they were inspired by the popular book "Sushi Goes on a Trip." They built a 3.5-meter-tall "Reading Forest" and three "Sushi People" stands as tall as children. They also have sushi costumes. They invite families to visit the broccoli forest and enjoy the unique humor and creativity.</p>
            <p>The Hsin-Yi Foundation also invited the "Talented Fairy Tale Writer" Lin Che-chang to give a talk on September 21. His talk is called "Let's Go to the Pet Kung Fu School to Practice Kung Fu." Children are invited to practice kung fu together on the holiday. On September 20, the Hsin-Yi storytellers will share the classic story "Guji Guji the Duckling" and the new popular story "The Rule-Follower Wins." Readers are welcome to sign up online.</p>
