            <h1>Police Officer Shoots Man in Domestic Violence Case, Man Dies; Prosecutor Says Officer Acted in Self-Defense</h1>
            <p>Miaoli County, September 26 (CNA) In April, a police officer from Toufen Police Station in Miaoli County went to an apartment complex to deal with a domestic violence case. During the event, a man named Tsai was attacking his girlfriend with a knife. The officer shot Tsai, and he died. Today, the prosecutor's office finished its investigation and decided not to charge the officer, saying the officer acted in self-defense.</p>
            <p>This event happened in late April this year. The Toufen Police Station received a report about a domestic violence case in an apartment complex on Xinyi Road in Toufen City. When officers arrived, they found Mr. Tsai holding two knives and keeping his girlfriend on the first floor of the complex, facing off with the police. Mr. Tsai did not listen to commands to put down the knives and even moved closer to the police. An officer shot him, and he was taken to the hospital but did not survive.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli District Prosecutor's Office announced today that a Toufen Police Station officer shot a man during a domestic violence call, causing the man to die. The man's family later accused the officer of causing death by accident during the investigation.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor's office said that the prosecutor in charge looked at videos, examined the body, visited the location, checked bullet paths, questioned people who were there, and compared information with security cameras. After all these steps, they decided that when the officer arrived at the scene, the man was still attacking the victim of domestic violence with a knife. So, the officer fired two shots according to Article 4, Paragraph 4, Sub-paragraph 1 of the Police Weapons Use Regulations.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor's office stated that when the officer fired the second shot, the situation was very urgent. It was hard to know if the man had dropped his knife. Also, based on the bullet path test results, it cannot be said that the officer did not aim at the man's leg. Therefore, the officer's actions were still considered self-defense and done according to the law.</p>
            <p>After the prosecutor finished the investigation, they found there was not enough evidence to charge the officer. So, they decided not to prosecute the officer, following Article 252, Sub-paragraph 10 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (Edited by Lin Shu-hui) 2025/09/26</p>

            <h1>Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan Return to Men's Doubles Semifinals at BWF Korea Open</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 26 (CNA) Taiwan's men's doubles team, Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan, who are ranked 13th in the world, won their quarterfinal match today at the BWF Super 500 Korea Open. They beat local players Cho Sung-hyun and Jin Sung-ik with scores of 21-15 and 21-18. This is their first time reaching the semifinals this season.</p>
            <p>Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan are Taiwan's top men's doubles team. The last time they reached the semifinals of a BWF Super Series tournament was at last year's Taipei Open, where they won the championship. However, Yang Po-hsuan has had problems with a wrist injury this season, which made their performance change a lot. Now, they have finally done well at the Korea Open, getting into the men's doubles semifinals of a Super Series event again after more than a year.</p>
            <p>Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan were the fifth-seeded team in this tournament. After winning two matches against other Taiwanese teams, they played against local players Cho Sung-hyun and Jin Sung-ik in the quarterfinals today. Cho and Jin are ranked outside the top 200 in the world. This was the first time these two teams played each other. Cho and Jin had surprised many by beating the world's ninth-ranked Chinese team, Chen Boyang and Liu Yi, in the first round, showing they are strong players.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first game, Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan did not seem new to playing against each other. They quickly took an 8-1 lead with strong attacks. They continued to increase their lead even after a short break in the game. They controlled the match, making it hard for their opponents to fight back. They easily won the first game 21-15.</p>
            <p>After winning the first game and being close to winning the match, Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan had a difficult second game. They even lost a 5-point lead and fell behind. But the experienced Lee Jhe-huei and Yang Po-hsuan became steady again towards the end of the game. When the score was tied at 18-18, they scored 3 points in a row to win the game and get their spot in the men's doubles semifinals.</p>
            <p>After the match, Lee Jhe-huei told CNA that their main goal was to control the speed of the game and avoid making unnecessary mistakes. He added that this week, they were not rushing their shots as much. "Other things just happened naturally; we didn't think too much," he said. (Edited by Chang Ming-kun) 2025/09/26</p>
