            <h1>DPP says "Thank You Party" rumors are false</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Yeh Su-ping, Taipei, July 29) A media report said, "Southern Taiwan has severe floods! Lai Ching-te will give an important speech tomorrow and hold a thank-you party." Today, Ms. Dai Wei-shan, spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), strongly denied these reports. She said that these statements are completely false and not true.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, a senior media person said that President Lai Ching-te would give an important speech at tomorrow's Central Standing Committee meeting. He would also openly ask people to make sure the August 23 events do not fail. It was also said he might hold a thank-you party.</p>
            <p>Ms. Dai Wei-shan said today that these statements are completely false and not true.</p>
            <p>Ms. Dai Wei-shan added that after the recall election results, the government team is carefully looking at what happened. They do not have any plans like the report mentioned. For the heavy rain in southern Taiwan that might cause problems, the government team quickly understood the situation. They also sent government officials to help with disaster relief. She asked media and other people not to report things that are not checked, so they do not confuse the public. (Edited by Su Lung-chi) July 29, 2025.</p>

            <h1>US Scholars: Failed Recall Election Will Not Affect Taiwan-US Relations, But Trust Must Grow</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Hsin-yu, San Francisco, July 28) All 25 recall cases on July 26 were rejected. Kharis Templeman, an American political scholar, believes this result will not affect how Taiwan and the US work together. However, both sides need to continue to build more trust. David Sacks, another scholar, looked at it from a national security point of view. He said the recall results bring changes. If Taiwan's defense budget is stopped, it could harm Taiwan-US relations.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's "big recall election" failed. David Sacks, a researcher at the US think tank "Council on Foreign Relations" (CFR), wrote today that this result affects the future of Taiwan's defense budget. US President Donald Trump once publicly said that Taiwan's defense budget should be 10% of Taiwan's total income (GDP). President Lai Ching-te wants the defense budget to reach 3%. If this plan is stopped, it could seriously hurt Taiwan-US relations.</p>
            <p>Sacks pointed out that if this happens, people might think Taiwan is not serious about defending itself. A weaker Taiwan might make China more likely to attack.</p>
            <p>On July 26, people voted on the first group of 24 KMT lawmakers and Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an, who was suspended. All recall efforts were rejected.</p>
            <p>Sacks said that after President Lai was elected in January last year, many Chinese scholars tried to say his election was not fair. If the DPP had won most seats in the Legislative Yuan, Beijing might have looked at these ideas again. But now, Chinese observers might think that Taiwan's voters prefer to have a divided government. This means Beijing's efforts to put pressure on Taiwan and weaken President Lai's government might increase.</p>
            <p>A "divided government" means that different political parties control the executive and law-making parts of the government.</p>
            <p>Sacks believes that President Lai must change his approach. He needs to show voters that he is willing and able to work with the opposing parties. This is to deal with the big challenges Taiwan faces. Taiwan's safety will depend on whether the government and the KMT can agree and work together.</p>
            <p>Kharis Templeman, a scholar at the Hoover Institute, a Stanford University think tank, spoke with the Central News Agency today. He said that political differences will always cause problems. Some laws proposed by the opposition parties made some voters unhappy. On the other hand, President Lai's government must try to find a way to agree with the opposition parties. If the opposition parties stop budget plans or do not approve the judges President Lai suggests, it will be very costly. Both sides must find ways to work together for the good of the country.</p>
            <p>Templeman thinks that this recall election shows that Taiwan's voters used a legal and fair way to show their opinions. This is a good sign for democracy. The results of the recall show that people in Taiwan are not extremely divided on issues related to China. They cannot be easily put into "pro-China" or "anti-China" groups.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether the recall results will affect Taiwan-US relations, Templeman believes it will not change the basic nature of how Taiwan and the US work together. What is more important is for both sides to continue to build more trust. Both presidents have not been in office for long, so there is still room to improve in this area.

            <h1>Fontrip finishes raising NT$180 million, Lion Travel continues to invest more</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chiang Ming-yen, Taipei, July 29) FONTRIP Technology, a company that provides systems for electronic tickets, announced it has finished raising NT$180 million (New Taiwan Dollars) more money. Original investors Lion Travel and Klook have put in more money. This money will be used to grow in international markets, make their technology systems better, and use AI. The company's goal is to become a platform for managing travel resources in Asia.</p>
            <p>FONTRIP Technology announced today that it has completed a NT$180 million fundraising. This round of funding was led by the New Yueh Development Fund, which is part of China Development Financial. Other investors like ITIC Venture Capital and the ITIC Innovation Company's Taiwan-Japan Fund also joined. Original investors Lion Travel and Klook continued to give more support.</p>
            <p>FONTRIP Technology was started in 2015. It was developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute and received money from Lion Travel. The company focuses on electronic ticket platforms and systems for managing travel resources at different places. Currently, they have about 80% of the market share for electronic travel packages in Taiwan. In 2024, their income was NT$680 million. They expect their income to double in the next three years.</p>
            <p>FONTRIP Technology works with over 1,000 partners. These include famous places like the National Palace Museum, Taipei 101, Sun Moon Lake and Alishan National Scenic Areas, Leofoo Village, and forest recreation areas. They also connect with over 60 sales channels in Taiwan and other countries. This has made them a big provider of electronic ticket solutions in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Lion Travel said that FONTRIP Technology has been working hard to expand overseas in recent years. They have used their experience from Taiwan in Okinawa, Japan. They launched a "City Pass" and a bus e-ticket service that work together. This has been successful in the market. In the future, they see good chances for growth in Asia's tourism areas. These chances come from making tourism digital, using cashless payments, and building smart facilities. They plan to use the Okinawa model as a first step to enter other international markets. They will focus on popular tourist areas like Kyushu and Hokkaido in Japan, and Hong Kong. They are also thinking about expanding into South Korea and Southeast Asia, to grow their business across Asia. (Edited by Lin Chia-hsien) July 29, 2025.</p>
