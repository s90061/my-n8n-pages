Many companies are now quickly using Artificial Intelligence (AI). They want to improve how they work and save money. This fast use of AI is changing many industries, from helping customers to creating content. People feel positive about the new things AI can do, but they also worry about jobs. Companies are spending a lot of money on AI tools. This means employees need to learn new skills or work with AI. Businesses need a careful plan to train their workers and change how people do their jobs.

**Article 2: Cities Are Fighting Against Extreme Weather**

Around the world, cities are experiencing more frequent and stronger extreme weather. These events include long heatwaves and serious floods. These problems are happening because of climate change. City planners and people living in these areas must find new ways to deal with them better. This includes building stronger buildings and roads that can handle floods. It also means creating green spaces in cities to fight the heat. Many places are also starting to use early warning systems to keep people safe. These changes are a big part of daily life and need everyone to work together.

**Article 3: The New Trend of Hybrid Work**

A lot of companies are now starting to use hybrid work. This means employees can work part-time from home and part-time in the office. This way of working tries to mix the freedom of working from home with the good things about working together in person. Companies hope to keep their team spirit strong. But making these hybrid models work well has difficulties. Companies need to make sure everyone has fair access to what they need. They also need to make sure teams work well together. And they have to manage different ideas about how often people should be in the office. Working life in the future will probably be flexible, but companies are still making their plans better.`;
