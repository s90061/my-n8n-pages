            <h1>National Palace Museum Exhibition in Czech Republic Opens, Vystrƒçil Calls It Great Example of Cultural Cooperation</h1>
            <p>The special exhibition "100 Treasures and Their Stories" from the National Palace Museum opened in the Czech Republic on September 11. Milo≈° Vystrƒçil, the President of the Czech Senate, said he was lucky to see these special items when he visited Taiwan in 2020. He called this exhibition "a great example of how cultural groups can work together." He also said it shows that culture can bring people closer, even across different continents.</p>
            <p>This exhibition is the first overseas event for the National Palace Museum's 100th anniversary. It opened at the Czech National Museum. The exhibition shows 131 valuable cultural items. The famous "Jadeite Cabbage" is shown in Europe for the very first time. Other classic items, like the "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" painting and the "Curio Cabinets," are also on display.</p>
            <p>On September 11, Vystrƒçil went to the opening event of the exhibition. He looked at the displays with a guide and took a picture with the "Jadeite Cabbage." He also tried the interactive parts, like an experience where you can "step into a painting."</p>
            <p>On September 12, Vystrƒçil wrote on Facebook that the truly special exhibition "100 Treasures and Their Stories" is now officially open to everyone at the Czech National Museum. He said this also means that the good cultural work between the National Palace Museum in Taipei and the Czech National Museum continues.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil explained that the exhibition shows precious items that Chinese emperors collected over many years. One of the most rare and noticed treasures of Asian culture is the famous "Jadeite Cabbage." This artwork, which some call "the Mona Lisa of Asia," is being shown in Europe for the first time.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil said, "In September 2020, I was lucky to see these special items in Taipei for the first time with my own eyes. I am very happy that some of these items can now be shown in Prague." He believes that this rare exhibition at the Czech National Museum will attract many visitors, including people from other countries.</p>
            <p>Vystrƒçil added, "This exhibition is an excellent example of our cultural groups working together. It also shows that culture can cross continents and bring people together."</p>

            <h1>France Sends Fighter Jets to Help Poland After Airspace Invaded, Summons Russian Ambassador</h1>
            <p>On September 10, several Russian drones entered Poland's airspace. The next day, France said it would send three Rafale fighter jets to help Poland protect its skies. On September 12, France also asked Russia's ambassador to come to their office to tell him they were unhappy.</p>
            <p>Poland, with help from its NATO allies, shot down some of the drones. After this, Poland put limits on flights near its borders with Belarus and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>French TV channel TF1 reported that at least 21 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace. Three of them were shot down. Most of the other drones flew hundreds of kilometers before they landed, possibly because they ran out of fuel.</p>
            <p>The allied forces could not shoot down all the drones. But Alexus Grynkewich, a top commander for NATO forces in Europe, said that when planes defend against drone attacks, they must choose which targets to stop, depending on how many there are and where they are going. France thought the same. A military source said that NATO's air defense systems shot down the drones that were "the most dangerous."</p>
            <p>However, some experts had different opinions. Pierre Servent, a defense expert for TF1 and LCI TV, said that drones are hard to stop. But, he noted, they "flew 250 kilometers in Polish airspace," so the defense work was not very successful.</p>
            <p>On September 11, Poland used Article 4 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This article allows a country to ask its allies for urgent talks if it feels threatened.</p>
            <p>France quickly responded. President Emmanuel Macron wrote on social media that after the Russian drones entered Polish airspace, he decided to send three Rafale fighter jets. These jets will help protect Poland and the eastern part of Europe's airspace together with NATO allies.</p>
            <p>Russia said it was not involved. On September 12, Russia and Belarus went ahead with their planned joint military exercises called "Zapad-2025."</p>
            <p>At the same time, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked the Russian ambassador to come to a meeting. Jean-Noel Barrot, the Foreign Minister, spoke on France Inter radio. He said France made it clear that NATO and its allies are very strong in defense and can stop attacks. He added that Russia must stop testing and trying to scare NATO countries.</p>
            <p>Barrot also said, "Whether it was done on purpose or by accident, this event is serious and completely unacceptable. It is another one of President Vladimir Putin's many actions that cause problems."</p>
            <p>Other European countries also quickly said they would support Poland. Germany announced that it would continue its mission to protect Polish airspace for three more months. It will send four Eurofighter planes instead of two for this task.</p>
            <p>The Netherlands decided to send two Patriot missile systems faster and also put in place air defense and anti-drone systems. The Czech Republic will send three Mi-17 helicopters. Poland stated that the United Kingdom will also send Eurofighter planes.</p>

            <h1>Two Boat Accidents in Northwest Democratic Republic of Congo Kill At Least 193, Many Missing</h1>
            <p>Today, officials and state news in the Democratic Republic of Congo said that two boat accidents happened this week in Equateur Province in the northwest. At least 193 people have died, and many others are still missing.</p>
            <p>State news reported that the first accident was on September 10 in the Basankusu area. A motorboat turned over, and at least 86 people died. Most of them were students, and some people are still not found.</p>
            <p>Reports from the scene said that the main reasons for the accident were "too many people on the boat and traveling at night." Pictures from the area showed villagers gathered by the river, sad for those who died.</p>
            <p>The second accident happened on the evening of September 11. It was about 150 kilometers from the first accident, near Malange village in the Lukolela area, on the Congo River. A large wooden boat carrying almost 500 passengers caught fire and then sank. The Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs said that 209 passengers were saved.</p>
            <p>We do not yet know the exact causes of both accidents. It is also unclear if rescue teams are still working to find people.</p>
