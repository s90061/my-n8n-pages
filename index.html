            <h1>Zelenskyy to Visit US, Meet Trump to Discuss Air Defense and Pressure on Russia</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that he will go to Washington this week. He will meet with US President Trump. They will talk about Ukraine's air defense and its ability to attack targets far away. They will also discuss how to put more pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Reuters says that Zelenskyy will join a Ukrainian group already in Washington. This group is meeting with US politicians and business people. Zelenskyy hopes to meet Trump on October 17th.</p>
            <p>He said he talked to Trump twice over the weekend. They spoke about the problems caused by Russia attacking Ukraine's energy system. They also talked about the situation on the battlefield. This included the idea of the US giving Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Ukraine has always wanted Washington to provide these American-made Tomahawk missiles. Tomahawk missiles can fly up to 2,500 kilometers. If launched from Ukraine, they could hit any place in European Russia, including Moscow, the capital. Ukraine promised to use them only for clear military targets. But Moscow warned that this could make the situation much worse.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv, "Honestly, I have already shared our thoughts with Trump... But some things are not good to talk about on the phone, so we will discuss them in person."</p>
            <p>He said, "We talked about some important topics. The conversation was full of information, but not yet complete." Zelenskyy is now hosting Kaja Kallas, the European Union's top diplomat for foreign and security policy, who is visiting Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Trump said he is thinking about whether to give these missiles to Ukraine. He also said he might talk about it with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy noted that the Ukrainian group traveling to the US includes Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, President's Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak, National Security and Defense Council Chairman Rustem Umerov, and other diplomats.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said he plans to meet with representatives from American defense companies and members of Congress.</p>
            <p>He stated, "The main topics include air defense and how we can put pressure on Russia."</p>
            <p>Ukraine and the US are also close to making an important agreement about drones. Under this agreement, Ukraine will share drone technology with the US. European diplomats think such an agreement is a good way to keep Trump interested in and supportive of Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Jiaxing Tribe Goes to Paris to Share Paiwan Culture; Many People Make Glass Beads, Showing Daily Tribal Life</h1>
            <p>Each glass bead has a story. The stories come not only from the beads themselves but also from the women who make them for their families. The Jiaxing tribe, which paid for their own trip to Paris to share Paiwan culture, recently held a workshop at a university. Women of different skin colors came together to learn how to make bead necklaces. As their culture traveled across countries, these glass beads started a new story in Paris.</p>
            <p>With support from UNESCO in France, the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO) in Paris held its third Intangible Cultural Heritage Day from October 1st to 2nd. This year's theme was "Textile Art."</p>
            <p>The "Glass Bead Necklace Making Workshop" was one of the events for Heritage Day. Nine women from the Jiaxing tribe in Taiwu Township, Pingtung, who are part of the "Puti Cultural Heritage Preservation Association," taught the class. Many women from Paris joined. Even though they didn't speak the same language, everyone was excited, and there was a lot of laughter. Many people came from outside the university, not just students of INALCO.</p>
            <p>During the two-hour workshop, the participants first learned about three types of glass beads used in weddings. For example, `mulimulitan` beads have colorful lines and mean importance. `marutjamulang` beads shine with a metallic green color and represent rare insects from the mountains. `palic` beads have spiral patterns and come in male and female pairs, meaning life continues.</p>
            <p>With help from the nine teachers, everyone sat in two large circles and started making beads. They learned how to tie snake knots and secure the glass beads. They used their creativity to make their own special pieces. During this time, without even realizing it, they recreated the daily life of Paiwan women gathering together to make gifts for their families.</p>
            <p>Qiu Xiaofeng (idis Sadjiljapan), a representative of the association, told CNA that there are about 30 names for Paiwan glass beads. But a bead is more than just a bead because each one holds a family's story. For example, she has a bead that her mother gave to her great-grandmother when she got married. "So, when Paiwan women wear glass beads, you can tell whose daughter she is," Qiu explained.</p>
            <p>Qiu Xiaofeng added that making beads is women's work in the tribe. Mothers sit together to prepare wedding clothes for their daughters and clothes for their sons to wear to tribal events. They put a lot of feeling into their sewing and beadwork.</p>
            <p>She said, "The bead pattern on my clothes, for example, might have been sewn by my great-grandmother. When we need to change the fabric to make new clothes, we don't throw away the pattern. Instead, we move it to the new clothes, so the family story continues. And today, these glass beads are also taking their stories to Paris."</p>
            <p>Lola, a Chinese language student at INALCO, told CNA that making the bead necklace was a bit hard. But with the teachers' help, she chose her favorite bead colors and designed a pattern, completing it step by step.</p>
            <p>Corine, who is not a student, loves textile art. She said that when she heard about the bead necklace workshop, she quickly signed up. This event allowed her to experience a faraway culture and enjoy making something. However, she found the bead-making process harder than she thought because it required steady and gentle hands.</p>
            <p>Margolaine, who is of Vietnamese descent and not a student, found out about the event on Instagram and came to participate. This was her first time learning about Taiwanese culture. She designed her necklace with mixed colors. She said, "Actually, just like they said, this is more than just a necklace; it tells our story, and it's also like ourselves."</p>
            <p>One teacher told CNA, "Seeing everyone so eager to learn how to make beads and wanting to understand our culture made me feel very warm inside."</p>
            <p>Nine members of the "Puti Cultural Heritage Preservation Association," along with a documentary director who has been filming them for five years, paid their own way to INALCO in Paris. They wanted to share their experience of recovering tribal culture over 20 years. They first performed ancient songs and held singing workshops at an Austronesian studies conference from September 29th to 30th. After that, they led the glass bead making classes.</p>
            <p>Qiu Xiaofeng said, "Our elders told us that if someone is willing to listen to our stories, we have a duty to tell them. So when we knew Parisians wanted to learn about us, we felt we should support our own culture."</p>

            <h1>Opposition Leader Machado Wins Nobel Peace Prize; Venezuela Closes Embassy in Norway</h1>
            <p>Days after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize, Venezuela announced today that it would close its embassy in Oslo. In a statement, Venezuela said this move is part of changing its foreign affairs.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Venezuelan government has not yet said anything about Machado winning the award.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that Venezuela closed its embassy in Australia. At the same time, it opened new diplomatic offices in Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso. Venezuela sees these two countries as "important partners in fighting against strong outside influence."</p>
            <p>Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said today that Venezuela closed its embassy in Oslo, but it did not say why.</p>
            <p>Cecilie Roang, a spokesperson for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told AFP by email, "This is sad. Even though we disagree on some things, Norway still wants to talk with Venezuela and will continue to work towards this."</p>
            <p>The telephone service for the Venezuelan embassy stopped working tonight.</p>
            <p>Three days ago, Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her work to bring democracy to Venezuela. According to Reuters, Machado dedicated her award to the people of Venezuela and US President Trump.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Norway's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "The Nobel Prize is separate from the Norwegian government. For questions about the prize, we let the Nobel Committee answer."</p>
            <p>Kristian Berg Harpviken, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Institute and secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told Reuters that the closing of the Venezuelan embassy is not a problem for the Committee.</p>
            <p>He said, "For the Committee, the job at hand is to choose the right Nobel Peace Prize winner... Machado is certainly a deserving winner!"</p>
