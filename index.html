            <h1>Ship Attacked and Catches Fire Near Yemen</h1>
            <p>A British company called Ambrey, which helps with sea safety, said today that a cargo ship sailing under the Dutch flag was attacked. This happened about 120 nautical miles southeast of Aden, a port city in Yemen.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency also reported that the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said military officials reported the attack. They said a ship about 128 nautical miles from Aden was hit by something unknown. It was also reported that the ship caught fire.</p>
            <p>Both the British office and the company mentioned above said they received reports of smoke near the ship.</p>
            <p>The UK Maritime Trade Operations also stated that the ship's captain saw splashes of water far away.</p>
            <p>Ambrey added that the ship did not send out an automatic identification system (AIS) signal when it was attacked.</p>
            <p>According to Ambrey, this ship was already attacked on the 23rd while it was going to Djibouti.</p>

            <h1>Russia Calls 135,000 Men for Military Service, Most Since 2016</h1>
            <p>Today, Russian President Putin announced the autumn order for military service. He is calling 135,000 men to join the army. This is the largest group of men called for autumn military service in Russia since 2016.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Russia calls men aged 18 to 30 to join the army every spring and autumn. According to the rules, these soldiers must serve for one year in military bases inside Russia. More people usually join in the spring because most young people finish school then.</p>
            <p>Russia's military service order is different from a wartime mobilization order. However, those who finish their service are more likely to be called to fight in the future. In the past, there have been reports of soldiers doing their required service being sent to the front lines in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to the order given by Vladimir Putin, 135,000 citizens of the Russian Federation will have to join the army between October 1st and December 31st. If we add the 160,000 people called in the spring, the total number of people joining the army this year in Russia will also be the highest since 2016.</p>
            <p>Since Putin started a full invasion of neighboring Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has been in a state of war. After this, the size of the yearly group of people called for service has grown by about 5% on average. Last September, he even ordered the Russian army to grow to 1.5 million active members. This makes it one of the largest armies in the world.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: Whistleblower Association Only Acts on Clear Wrongdoing</h1>
            <p>Mirror Media recently reported that Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, has been building a group that follows people. Huang Kuo-chang said in a live broadcast tonight that he started the Whistleblower Protection Association to protect whistleblowers and to uncover bad things. He said they only act when they are sure something illegal or wrong has happened. He also asked why private groups need to expose wrongdoing, saying, "Under the Democratic Progressive Party's rule, will prosecutors really investigate these cases of wrongdoing?"</p>
            <p>During his live broadcast, Huang Kuo-chang said, "The biggest paparazzi group in the country is your Mirror Media." The Mirror Media group has not replied by 11 PM tonight.</p>
            <p>Last June, Wang Yi-chuan, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party, thought he was being followed. So, he reported it to the police. In August, he received a document from the prosecutor saying they would not charge anyone. But Mirror Media reported on September 26th that Huang Kuo-chang has been building a group to follow and secretly photograph politicians from the Green camp (Democratic Progressive Party) in recent years. The report also said Huang Kuo-chang personally directed these "paparazzi."</p>
            <p>After the Taiwan People's Party responded in writing on September 26th, Huang Kuo-chang did not have any public events. Tonight, Huang Kuo-chang said on his YouTube channel that some media had reported in recent days, "How many days has he been hiding? Tell him to come out." After seeing this, he didn't know what to say. He said he was very busy these past three days, but he just didn't have public events. Yet, people said he had been hiding for many days.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that last Saturday, he supported a meaningful event, which was a bicycle race around Greater Taipei. He wanted to sign up but found that registration had closed. So, he supported it in another way. He set up a supply station at the finish line, offering drinks and protein to the athletes. He also grilled sausages there and helped with the grilling himself.</p>
            <p>Talking about the Whistleblower Protection Association, Huang Kuo-chang said that the association mainly does two things: first, it protects whistleblowers, and second, it exposes wrongdoing. He asked why private groups are needed to expose government wrongdoing. He said the reason is simple: "Under the Democratic Progressive Party's rule, do you think prosecutors will seriously investigate these wrongdoings?" He gave the "China Airlines smuggled cigarette case" that he revealed in 2019 as a clear example.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang stated that he started the Whistleblower Association because many whistleblowers were being attacked. He even helped whistleblowers with their lawsuits and gave legal advice without charging any money. He said that finding wrongdoing is not something you can do by just searching on Google at home. He always checks carefully, and "we only act when we are sure it is something illegal or wrong."</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that if it is about personal matters, like a legislator having a secret lover or visiting escort women late at night, the association generally does not deal with such things. This is because they are not related to the public good.</p>
            <p>Regarding being followed and secretly photographed, Huang Kuo-chang said, "Mirror Media Group is a combination of party, prosecutor, and media." He said they accused him of having paparazzi. But after seeing the news title and content, his first thought was, "If you want to talk about having paparazzi, the biggest paparazzi group in the country is your Mirror Media." He asked if they didn't feel ashamed writing these things.</p>
