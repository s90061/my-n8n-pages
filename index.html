Since April, the New Taiwan Dollar has become much stronger. This is a problem for life insurance companies that have money in other countries, as they could lose a lot of money due to exchange rates. To help these companies, the financial regulator, FSC, announced three temporary rules in mid-June. They also started accepting applications from companies. Today, the FSC said that 10 companies have applied to use their reserve funds, and these applications are now being checked.

The three temporary rules announced on June 12 by the FSC include: first, using an average exchange rate for calculating capital levels; second, making it easier to account for policy reserves, but companies must save money for foreign exchange if they make a profit; and third, changing the rules for a new financial system, with the final deadline to apply by the end of September. Everyone was watching how companies would apply for these temporary rules, as July 10 was the last day to announce profits.

Cai Huo-yan, the deputy director of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said at a regular meeting that 10 life insurance companies have applied to use their reserve funds. He added that even though it's a notification process, the applications are still being checked. Companies need to choose which products are included, and an actuary and an accountant must approve it. Later, they need to explain how releasing these funds affects their half-year and yearly financial reports.

**Judge Nominee Lin Li-ying: Prosecutors Are Careful and Don't Force Confessions**

Today, the Parliament Committee discussed Lin Li-ying, who has been nominated to be a Grand Justice. A legislator from the Taiwan People's Party, Lin Yi-chun, suggested that prosecutors might force people to confess or wrongly hold them in custody. Lin Li-ying replied that judges check very carefully if a prosecutor's request to hold someone is fair. She said that prosecutors cannot just decide to hold someone, and they are very careful and "would not force people to confess."

The President's office announced seven Grand Justice nominees in March and sent their names to Parliament for approval. This afternoon, the Parliament Committee held a meeting to review Lin Li-ying, who is currently a chief prosecutor at the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office.

**Singer Hung Pei-yu Finishes Recording New Album, Jokes New Songs Are So Hard She Wanted to Throw Bricks at Her Head**

Singer Hung Pei-yu recently finished recording her second music album. She shared that finding songs was very difficult, and she had to record many of them several times. She jokingly said, "Some songs were so hard that during recording, I wanted to hit my head with a brick."

According to her record company, Hung Pei-yu laughed and said that choosing songs for her second album took more than a year, and recording took four months. She explained, "Some songs were so hard that when I was singing, I really wanted to throw bricks at my head. This includes how the words fit with the music, how these ideas became part of me and then came out in my singing, and singing from my own point of view. All of it was very challenging."

Hung Pei-yu won the Golden Melody Award for Best New Artist in 2023 for her first album, "Ming Shi." She then sang the theme song "Tong Kuan" for the movie "Happy Day Off" and won the Golden Horse Award for Best Original Film Song. She said she does not feel pressured to release her next work; instead, she feels the awards help her. "Winning awards means that the work everyone did together at that time was recognized, and the next step is a completely new thing."
