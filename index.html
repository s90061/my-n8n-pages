A US newspaper, The Seattle Times, reported today that Microsoft is reducing its workforce by about 4%. This means around 9,100 people will lose their jobs. This is the biggest layoff for Microsoft since 2023.

In June last year, Microsoft had about 228,000 employees around the world. Microsoft has not said anything about this yet.

Bloomberg News said in June that Microsoft was planning to lay off thousands of workers, especially in its business parts. In May, Microsoft already announced layoffs that affected about 6,000 employees. Many companies in the US are cutting jobs this year because the economy is uncertain. They are trying to become smaller to deal with this situation.

**French Food to Be Served on the International Space Station**

French astronaut Sophie Adenot will go to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2026. She will eat special French dishes prepared by a Michelin-star chef. These dishes will include lobster soup, foie gras, and onion soup.

The European Space Agency said today that other foods like fish with parsnip sauce, chicken with tonka beans and creamy corn, and chocolate cream with roasted hazelnuts will also be on the menu.

Food sent to the International Space Station must meet strict rules. The European Space Agency said the food must not break easily or be too heavy. Also, it must last for two years. Fresh fruits and vegetables are only available when new spaceships arrive with supplies. Most of the meat for space is canned, vacuum-packed, or freeze-dried. To make things more interesting, one out of every ten meals is chosen based on what a specific astronaut likes.

Sophie Adenot said, "When we are on a mission, sharing our food is a way to teach our colleagues about our culture. It is a powerful experience that connects us." The menu for Sophie Adenot was made by French chef Anne-Sophie Pic. She has a total of 10 Michelin stars and was named the best female chef by "The World's 50 Best Restaurants" in 2011. Pic said creating this menu with 4 starters, 2 main courses, and 2 desserts was an "exciting challenge." Sophie Adenot, who is 42, used to be a helicopter test pilot. She is expected to go to the International Space Station for the first time in 2026.
