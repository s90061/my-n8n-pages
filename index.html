            <h1>National Development Council Approves Shalun Science Park Plan to Keep Semiconductor Advantage</h1>
            <p>The National Development Council (NDC) held a meeting today. They approved a plan to set up the "Shalun Eco-Science Park in Southern Taiwan Science Park." After this plan is finished, the Shalun area in Tainan will have a new science park that is about 531 hectares big. This is expected to create about NT$2.24 trillion (about US$70 billion) in yearly income. This will help Taiwan keep its strong position in the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>The NDC had a meeting today. They approved the "Shalun Eco-Science Park in Southern Taiwan Science Park" plan, which was presented by the National Science and Technology Council. The plan will now be sent to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
            <p>The total cost for the "Shalun Eco-Science Park in Southern Taiwan Science Park" plan is about NT$122.7 billion (about US$3.8 billion). The money will be given out each year from the science park management's operating funds. They expect to finish checking land development and environmental impact by the end of 2027. After getting the land, building work for the public areas and factories will start at the same time.</p>
            <p>NDC Minister Yeh Chun-hsien said that once this plan is done, a new science park of about 531 hectares will be added in the Shalun area of Tainan. This is expected to create about NT$2.24 trillion in yearly income and 35,000 good jobs.</p>
            <p>Yeh Chun-hsien also said that this plan will help Taiwan keep its strong position in the semiconductor industry. It will also quickly build a larger industry system in the south. This is to meet the big demand from new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing. This will help reach the goal of "balanced Taiwan." Also, the park is designed to be an eco-science park. This means it will help industry and nature grow together. It can be a new good example for future science parks in Taiwan and other countries.</p>
            <p>The NDC added that the National Science and Technology Council's idea of a "new Silicon Valley in the Greater South" is centered in Shalun, Tainan. As big building projects in the Shalun area of Tainan are completed, more people will come to work and live there. The services for daily life nearby are also getting better. This, along with new technologies and research areas in the Shalun Smart Green Energy Science City, will help improve technology. It will also make related industries stronger in the world. This will help Taiwan stay ahead in the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>At today's NDC meeting, they also talked about a plan for "Continuing the Policy to Improve Five Key Elements for Industrial Investment â€“ Planning for Talent and Labor." The NDC and the Ministry of Labor gave reports on "talent" and "labor" separately.</p>
            <p>The NDC said that to have enough talent, they are working with other government groups to carry out the "National Talent Competitiveness Enhancement Program." This program works with the "AI New Ten Big Projects." Some of the things they are doing include watching trends in AI jobs and needs. They are starting from elementary and middle schools up to universities, encouraging learning in many areas, and investing in the next generation of AI talent. They are also making regional partnerships between schools and industries stronger and working with universities to form alliances. They are focusing on attracting AI industry talent, making the Talent Taiwan center's services bigger, and encouraging more international talent to come to Taiwan and stay here to develop their careers.</p>
            <p>For labor, the Ministry of Labor's main goal is to protect the rights of local workers. They continue to find and use different types of workers. There are two main policy directions: First, to "protect job opportunities for local workers." They plan to help 35,000 women return to work each year and help 120,000 middle-aged and older people find jobs. Second, to "increase the use of international workers." This includes making it easier for hotels to recognize training courses and expanding opportunities for overseas students to work in mid-level technical jobs. This helps industries have enough local and international workers. It also helps businesses stay strong.</p>

            <h1>Luo Chih-chiang and Cheng Li-wen Sign Up for Party Chairman Election, Hope for Fair Contest</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) party chairman election will happen in October. KMT lawmaker Luo Chih-chiang and former lawmaker Cheng Li-wen registered today at the party headquarters. Luo Chih-chiang said he is the best person to bring people together, help the KMT and Taiwan People's Party work together, and make way for younger leaders. Cheng Li-wen said she hopes the party will hold a clean, fair, and open election.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairman election is on October 18. People can pick up forms and register from September 15 to 19. Former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin, who decided to run, picked up his form today at the party headquarters. Luo Chih-chiang, Cheng Li-wen, and former Changhua County Commissioner Cho Po-yuan, who had already picked up their forms, brought their supporters to the party headquarters today to register. They paid a NT$3 million (about US$93,000) processing fee and a NT$10 million (about US$310,000) deposit. The scene was very lively with cheers.</p>
            <p>When Luo Chih-chiang arrived, several KMT lawmakers were with him. Luo Chih-chiang said he has a few main ideas for running for party chairman. First, they should not fight among themselves. Everyone needs to work together to keep an eye on the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). Only by working together can they get through tough times. Sadly, in the current party chairman election, some people are still fighting within the party. He promised not to fight internally. He wished all candidates well and hoped this would be an honest election.</p>
            <p>Luo Chih-chiang believes that a KMT chairman needs many qualities. Among the current candidates, some are very respected, some are very good at fighting, and some are good at explaining ideas. Each has their own strengths, and he is not the most perfect candidate. But if voters think the KMT should have new, younger leaders, and should choose a chairman who can unite the party, help the KMT and Taiwan People's Party work together, and build support at the local level, then he believes he is the best choice. The final goal is to win the elections in 2026 and 2028.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen said today is a day of national shame. Running for party chairman is a very important historical duty. She believes there is no Republic of China without the KMT, and if the Republic of China stops existing, there will be no KMT. Both succeed or fail together. She hopes all KMT members, like her, remember what Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard. Do not break up the group, do not lose your courage."</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen said that she hopes that after registering today, the party headquarters will hold a clean, fair, and open election. She hopes there will be no secret deals or unfair choices. This should show the KMT's good behavior as a big party. They should not let outsiders laugh at them. The election should be fair and positive, without attacking fellow party members, which would make allies sad and enemies happy.</p>
            <p>Regarding the idea of KMT and Taiwan People's Party working together, Cheng Li-wen said she has often said she hopes they can cooperate. This would build trust and communication to create the strongest team to beat the DPP. The KMT needs to choose a party chairman quickly. This is what the public and KMT members both want.</p>

            <h1>Government Approves Extending Electric Vehicle Tax Breaks Until the End of 2030</h1>
            <p>Rules that let people buy electric vehicles with less tax are ending on December 31 this year. Today, the Executive Yuan approved changes to the "Commodity Tax Act" and the "Vehicle License Tax Act." These changes will extend the tax breaks for electric vehicles for five more years, until December 31, 2030.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan approved changes to Article 12-3 of the "Commodity Tax Act" and Article 5 of the "Vehicle License Tax Act" today.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said after the meeting that Premier Cho Jung-tai explained during the meeting that the tax breaks for electric vehicles are ending soon. To reach the goal of having all vehicles be electric by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, these changes will extend the tax breaks until December 31, 2030.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that after this proposal is sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, the Ministry of Finance will work with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to talk with all political parties in the Legislative Yuan. They hope to finish changing the law quickly.</p>
            <p>Song Hsiu-ling, the head of the Department of Taxation at the Ministry of Finance, added at the press conference after the Executive Yuan meeting that to help the government's vision for green technology and new industries, they want to encourage people to buy vehicles that cause less pollution. Since January 2011, they have offered tax breaks on commodity tax and vehicle license tax for electric vehicles. Currently, if you buy an electric vehicle that runs only on electricity and register it, you don't have to pay commodity tax. However, for electric cars, the tax break is limited to the tax amount calculated on a value of NT$1.4 million (about US$43,000). If the value is higher, you still pay tax on the extra amount. For vehicle license tax, local governments can choose to not collect it.</p>
            <p>Song Hsiu-ling said that by the end of July this year, about 890,000 electric cars and motorcycles had received commodity tax breaks, saving about NT$25.8 billion (about US$800 million) in taxes. Also, about 110,000 vehicles had received vehicle license tax breaks, saving about NT$9 billion (about US$280 million) in taxes.</p>
            <p>Song Hsiu-ling said that in terms of reducing carbon dioxide, it is estimated that from 2022 to 2024, electric cars and motorcycles together reduced about 1.02 million tons of carbon dioxide. In addition, these tax breaks can create an average of NT$100 billion (about US$3.1 billion) in yearly income for the electric vehicle industry. They can also create an average of 16,528 jobs in related industries each year.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance said they will work with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to talk with all political parties in the Legislative Yuan. They hope to finish changing the law before the current tax breaks end this year, so the new policy can start smoothly.</p>
