            <h1>Three Dead, Twenty Injured in Shooting at Catholic Elementary School in Minnesota, USA</h1>
            <p>Officials from the U.S. Department of Justice said that a shooting happened today at a Catholic school in the southern part of Minneapolis, Minnesota. This event caused three deaths and injured twenty people.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the official, who did not want to be named, also said that the person who did the shooting was among those who died.</p>
            <p>The school where the event took place is called Annunciation Catholic School. It had only opened two days before. This private school has about 395 students.</p>
            <p>Police in Richfield, a town nearby, said that a man dressed in all black and carrying a rifle was reportedly seen at the school. Local news said that the shooting happened while the children were having their morning church service.</p>
            <p>Pictures from a local TV station showed parents walking with students, who were wearing green polo shirts and blue shorts or skirts. They walked under a yellow police tape line as they left the school.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump said on social media that he was told about the shooting. He also said that the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) had arrived at the school. He asked everyone to "Please join me in praying for those involved!"</p>

            <p>At the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan, Taiwanese athletes Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu worked together today in the mixed team trap shooting event. They won the bronze medal match by beating Qatar 43 to 37. This is the first medal for Taiwan's shooting team at this competition.</p>
            <p>Yang Kun-pi, a skilled shooter who has been to the Olympics three times for Taiwan, competed with his partner Liu Wan-yu in the mixed team trap shooting today at the Asian Championships. They both did well in the three qualification rounds. Yang Kun-pi shot 24, 25, and 24 points, only missing two clay targets. He got the highest score of 73 points. Liu Wan-yu got better as they went along, scoring 20, 21, and 24 points. Together, they had a total of 138 points, placing them 4th and allowing them to move to the next round.</p>
            <p>They missed getting into the gold medal match by only 2 points. However, in the bronze medal match against Qatar, Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu showed strong control. Especially in the third round, they both hit all 10 targets, getting a perfect score. This gave them a 6-point lead, which helped them win. With their opponents unable to catch up, Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu won 43 to 37. This also brought the first medal for Taiwan's shooting team at these Asian Championships.</p>
            <p>It's important to know that Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu have been competing together in international events for many years. After winning a silver medal together at the 2019 Universiade in Naples, they later won other mixed team events, such as the Shooting World Cup and the Asian Trap Cup. Now, they have also won a bronze medal at the Asian Shooting Championships. As they continue to gain more experience in international competitions, they have a good chance to win medals at the 2026 Asian Games in Nagoya.</p>
