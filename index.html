Amazon has started using drones to deliver packages to customers in two US states, Texas and Arizona. This service, called Prime Air, aims to get orders to people faster and more efficiently. Currently, the drones can only carry packages weighing up to five pounds, and they can only deliver to homes within a specific area close to the drone's take-off site.

The company says safety is their top priority. Before expanding the service, they have done extensive testing to make sure the drones operate safely and reliably. Customers who are eligible for drone delivery will see the option during checkout on the Amazon website. Once an order is placed, the drone will fly to the designated delivery location and gently lower the package to the ground using a cable.

Amazon believes drone delivery has the potential to revolutionize how people receive their online orders, especially in rural areas or places where traffic is often a problem. While it's still in its early stages, the company is optimistic about the future of Prime Air and plans to expand the service to more locations in the coming years.

**The Rise of 'Quiet Quitting' and Its Impact on the Workplace**

A new term, "quiet quitting," has become popular recently, describing employees who are doing the bare minimum required of them at work and no more. These individuals are not actually quitting their jobs, but they're mentally disengaging and setting clear boundaries between their work and personal lives. This trend is partly a reaction to burnout and the pressure to constantly be available for work.

Many employees say they are choosing to "quiet quit" because they feel undervalued, overworked, or that their efforts are not being recognized. They're prioritizing their well-being and refusing to go above and beyond without proper compensation or appreciation. The rise of remote work and the blurring of work-life boundaries have also contributed to this trend.

While some employers may see "quiet quitting" as a negative behavior, others view it as a sign that employees need better support and a healthier work environment. Companies are beginning to consider ways to improve employee engagement, such as offering more flexible work arrangements, providing opportunities for professional development, and recognizing employees' contributions. Ultimately, addressing the root causes of "quiet quitting" is crucial for maintaining a productive and motivated workforce.

**Florence's Uffizi Gallery Launches TikTok Channel to Attract Younger Audience**

The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, one of the world's most famous art museums, has joined TikTok in an effort to connect with a younger audience. The museum is creating short, engaging videos that showcase its vast collection of Renaissance masterpieces, providing historical context and interesting facts in an accessible way.

The Uffizi hopes that by using TikTok, it can make art more approachable and relevant to young people who might not otherwise visit the museum. The videos feature museum staff, art historians, and even dancers, offering diverse perspectives and creative interpretations of the artworks. The museum also encourages user interaction by responding to comments and questions, fostering a sense of community.

This move reflects a broader trend among cultural institutions to embrace social media as a tool for education and outreach. By using platforms like TikTok, museums can reach a wider audience and inspire a new generation of art enthusiasts. The Uffizi's TikTok channel has already gained a significant following, demonstrating the potential of social media to make art accessible and engaging for everyone.
