The price of Bitcoin, the world's biggest cryptocurrency, reached a new record high this evening, getting close to $112,000. This happened because investors are more willing to take risks, and big companies are buying more of it.

Reuters reported that Bitcoin reached its highest point ever today at $111,988.90. The latest price went down a little to $110,922.48, which is still a 2% increase.

**Trump's Second Round of Tariffs Announced, Brazil Faces Highest 50% Tax**

Washington, July 9 (CNA) - U.S. President Donald Trump continued to announce new tariffs on goods coming into the U.S. from more countries today. This afternoon, he sent a letter about tariffs to Brazil's leader, saying Brazil would face a new tax rate of 50%. This is the highest rate announced so far and will start on August 1.

In early April, Trump began "equal tariffs," placing taxes of 11% to 50% on many countries, which worried global financial markets. He then said there would be a 90-day pause, with only a 10% basic tax. Countries used this time to talk with the U.S., hoping to get lower tax rates.

The pause on equal tariffs was supposed to end today, but on July 7, Trump signed an order to extend it until August 1. From that day on, he has been using his social media platform, Truth Social, to share letters to other country leaders, telling them about the new tariff rates.

This afternoon, Trump posted a tariff letter to Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva on social media. In the letter, he started by saying that Brazil's trial of former President Bolsonaro was a "witch hunt" and should stop right away.

Foreign news reports say that Bolsonaro, who was good friends with Trump when he was president, is currently on trial in Brazil. He is accused of planning a coup to stop Lula from becoming president in January 2023.

The tariffs on goods from Brazil to the U.S. will go up from 10% to as much as 50%, starting August 1. In his letter to Lula, Trump also wrote that one reason for the change in tariffs on Brazil is Brazil's actions against the basic right to free speech for Americans, including content control orders from Brazil's Supreme Court to U.S. social media platforms.

He also said that because Brazil is making it hard for U.S. companies to do digital business and is using unfair trade practices, he will tell U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to immediately start a Section 301 investigation into Brazil.

Earlier today, Trump also announced letters to the leaders of seven other countries: the Philippines, Brunei, Moldova, Algeria, Iraq, Libya, and Sri Lanka. These letters informed them that goods from their countries to the U.S. would face new tariffs between 20% and 30%.

Except for the letter to Brazil, Trump's other letters were almost the same. They told countries their new tax rates and warned that if they responded with their own taxes, the U.S. would add even higher taxes. But he also said that "these tariffs may go up or down depending on our relationship with your country."

He also wrote in the letters that if goods are sent through a third country to avoid higher taxes, they will still be taxed at the higher rate. If companies choose to build factories or make products in the U.S., they will not have to pay this tariff.

On July 7, Trump sent the first group of tariff letters to the leaders of 14 countries: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Kazakhstan, South Africa, Laos, Myanmar, Tunisia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Serbia, Cambodia, and Thailand. These countries face tax rates from 25% to 40%, starting on August 1.

So far, Trump has sent tariff letters to 22 countries, but Taiwan is not one of them.

Regarding talks between Taiwan and the U.S., a national security official said earlier that the bilateral tariff talks are not stuck and are still happening.

The U.S. has announced a trade plan with China and trade agreements with the UK and Vietnam.
