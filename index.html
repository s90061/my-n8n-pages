            <h1>Technology Companies Show Good Results, But US Stock Market Ends Lower</h1>
            <p>(New York, July 31st, Central News Agency) Major stock market indexes in Wall Street closed lower today. This happened even though big technology companies like Microsoft and Meta (the company that owns Facebook) reported very good financial results. People who buy and sell stocks were waiting for important news about jobs in the US. They were also waiting for a deadline for US tariffs set by the White House to end.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 330.30 points, which is 0.74%. It closed at 44130.98 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index fell by 23.51 points, or 0.37%. It finished at 6339.39 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology stocks, went down slightly by 7.22 points, or 0.03%. It closed at 21122.45 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index dropped a lot, losing 179.40 points, or 3.10%. It closed at 5607.92 points.</p>

            <h1>Trump Is Not Happy as UK, France, and Canada Plan to Recognize Palestine, Worries It Helps Hamas</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 31st, Central News Agency) France and the United Kingdom announced they will recognize Palestine as a state in September. Now, Canada has also said it will do the same. Today, the White House said that US President Trump has told the leaders of France, the UK, and Canada that he is unhappy. Trump believes that supporting the creation of a Palestinian state now would be like rewarding Hamas, an armed group.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, a White House spokesperson, spoke at a press conference this afternoon. When asked about recognizing Palestine, she said that Donald Trump has told the leaders of France, the UK, and Canada about his concerns. Trump thinks that Hamas, the Palestinian armed group, is currently stopping a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of all hostages. He believes that supporting a Palestinian state now would mean "rewarding Hamas."</p>
            <p>Ms. Leavitt also said that Trump wants all hostages held in Gaza to be released. There are still about 20 hostages alive in Gaza, and she said these might be the hardest to free. This is "because Hamas is using these innocent people as a way to bargain." Even so, the US is still working hard to end this conflict.</p>
            <p>Hamas attacked Israel in a big way in October 2023. After that, Israel said it was at war and started fighting back in the Gaza Strip. The war is still going on.</p>
            <p>At this time, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said yesterday that Canada plans to recognize Palestine as a state in September. This makes Canada the third G7 country, after France and the UK, to announce this plan recently.</p>
            <p>Reports from other countries say that Carney stated this action depends on democratic changes happening. These changes include the Palestinian Authority holding elections next year, but Hamas must not be allowed to take part.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, the UK announced it would officially recognize Palestine in September. However, this depends on Israel taking certain "real steps," like agreeing to a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. France also announced a similar plan last week.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Go Down as US Tariff Deadline Gets Close</h1>
            <p>(Houston, July 31st, Central News Agency) The price of oil around the world went down today. This happened because of a deadline set by US President Donald Trump for August 1st. This deadline is for "reciprocal tariffs," which means taxes on goods from other countries. Countries that have not yet made a trade agreement with the US are worried about what will happen. This worry caused oil prices to drop.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Brent crude oil futures for September, which ended today, fell by 71 cents or 0.97%. The price became 72.53 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures for September also fell by 74 cents or 1.06%. The price became 69.26 US dollars per barrel.</p>
