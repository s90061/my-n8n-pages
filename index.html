            <h1>80 Years Since War Ended: Shinjiro Koizumi First to Visit Yasukuni Shrine</h1>
            <p>Today marks 80 years since Japan surrendered in World War II. Shinjiro Koizumi, the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, visited Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo before 8 AM. He is the first person from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government to visit the shrine.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine himself. Instead, he will send a payment for offerings in his role as the head of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
            <p>Takayuki Kobayashi, a former Minister for Economic Security and a member of the House of Representatives, also visited Yasukuni Shrine this morning. He also gave money for offerings from his own pocket.</p>
            <p>After his visit, Mr. Kobayashi told reporters, "My grandfather died in the war in China. As a family member of a war victim, I came here to pray. This visit made me feel even more strongly that I must do my best to protect peace."</p>
            <p>Koichi Hagiuda, a former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, who was also a key member of the Abe group, visited the shrine too. Among other political parties, Naoki Hyakuta, the head of the Japan Conservative Party, has already visited. The Sanseit≈ç party plans to visit with a group of lawmakers led by its head, Sone Kamiya.</p>
            <p>Today, ceremonies are being held across Japan to remember about 3.1 million people who died during World War II, including those who died from atomic bombs.</p>
            <p>The Japanese government held a "National Ceremony for the War Dead" at the Nippon Budokan in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo. Emperor Naruhito, Empress Masako, the Prime Minister, and other important leaders, along with about 4,500 family members of war victims and other people, attended the event. After a minute of silence at noon, Emperor Naruhito will give a speech.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare said that the oldest person at this year's ceremony for the war dead is 98-year-old Shoji Nagaya from Hokkaido, whose brother Yasushi Nagaya died in the war. The youngest person is 3-year-old Junya Katayama, who is the great-great-grandson of war victim Masao Ito.</p>

            <h1>Los Angeles Olympics Breaks Tradition: Venues Can Have Company Names</h1>
            <p>For many years, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) did not allow sports venues to have company names. But this rule will change for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The organizers announced today that the IOC has agreed to let 19 venues be named after companies. This change could bring in millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles Organizing Committee for the 2028 Olympic and Paralympic Games (LA28) released a statement today. They announced that these Games will be the first time in history that venues can have company names.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, Casey Wasserman, the head of the LA28 organizing committee, said that the total budget for these Olympic and Paralympic Games is 6.9 billion US dollars. Allowing company names for venues will bring more money to the event.</p>
            <p>The committee said that up to 19 venues can have company names. The first venue announced is the squash center inside Universal Studios, which will be called the "Comcast Squash Center." Comcast is the biggest cable TV and internet company in the US.</p>
            <p>Another venue is the Honda Center in Anaheim, where volleyball games will be held. This stadium has been named after the car company Honda for many years. It will be the first Olympic venue to keep its original name.</p>
            <p>In the past, the IOC rules said that the names of sports venues must be neutral. They could not have company names or political or religious messages. But the Los Angeles organizing committee asked the IOC to change this. Now, the IOC has agreed. So, for the first time, in the games three years from now, venues can have company names.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wasserman, the head of the committee, said that when the US hosts the Olympics, it relies on private money, not money from the government. So, they need to use business ways to get money. He said it took a long time to talk to the IOC and convince them because having company names for sports venues is very common in American sports culture.</p>
