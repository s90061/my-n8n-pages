            <p>Yu Kai-wen and Huang Shih-yuan played very well in the mixed doubles competition. In the semifinal match, they played against a Japanese team that included Uematsu Toshitaka, who has won three World Championship gold medals. But Yu Kai-wen stopped Uematsu's strong shots, and Huang Shih-yuan played well from the back of the court. They won 5-2 and moved on to the gold medal match.</p>
            <p>In the final, they played another Japanese team. Yu Kai-wen and Huang Shih-yuan continued their good teamwork. They quickly got a 3-0 lead. Even when the other team tried to catch up, the Taiwanese team stayed strong in the important 6th game. They broke the tie and won the match 5-2. This was Taiwan's first gold medal at this Asian Soft Tennis Championship.</p>
            <p>Zhu Wen-ching, the chairman of the Soft Tennis Association, said that this mixed doubles gold medal made the whole team feel very happy. It also ended Taiwan's nearly 17-year wait for a win at the Asian Championship. He hopes that the new generation of players will do even better and aim for the highest honors at the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games.</p>

            <h1>Jimmy Kimmel's Show Is Stopped After He Talks About Kirk Shooting; Hollywood Shows Support</h1>
            <p>The TV channel ABC stopped Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show. This happened after he talked about the Charlie Kirk shooting and because the Trump government put pressure on them. Today, people in Hollywood are supporting Kimmel and criticizing the White House for trying to stop free speech.</p>
            <p>The TV network, which is owned by Walt Disney, said that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will not be shown for an unknown amount of time. This is because at least one local TV station refused to show it. Also, the main communication office said they would investigate Kimmel's comments.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Jimmy Kimmel often criticized Trump. On his show on September 15, he talked about the death of Charlie Kirk, who was a conservative online personality. Kimmel said that Kirk's friends were using his death "to get political advantages."</p>
            <p>The Writers Guild and the Actors Guild said that stopping Kimmel's show because of what he said is against the right to speak freely, which is protected by the country's main law. They said that ABC should not give in to pressure from the government.</p>
            <p>This is another important event. Before this, other people like journalists, professors, teachers, and company workers were also criticized for what they said about Kirk's death.</p>
            <p>Kirk died last week in Utah. He was 31 years old. The police have charged a 22-year-old person as a suspect, but they do not yet know why the shooting happened.</p>
