            <h1>US General Says: If Russia Doesn't Stop Fighting, US Should Add More Sanctions</h1>
            <p>The meeting between the US and Russia will happen on August 15th. A retired US general said today that US President Trump should tell Russian President Putin that if Russia does not stop fighting right away, the US will support more punishments for Russia. The US will also give Ukraine weapons for fighting. The general also said that because Trump likes to make deals, Taiwan and other US friends should be a little careful.</p>
            <p>The important meeting between the US and Russian leaders will be in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15th. Trump said today that if Putin does not agree to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia will face "very serious results." But Trump did not say what these results would be.</p>
            <p>Mark Montgomery, a retired US Navy Rear Admiral and a senior expert at the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies" in Washington, spoke to CNA today. He said he hopes Trump understands he needs to tell Putin that Russia is in a weak position. Montgomery also stressed that if Russia does not stop fighting and announce a ceasefire immediately, the US will support more punishments for Russia and give both attack and defense weapons to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>What does this meeting mean for Taiwan? Montgomery thinks Trump likes to make deals a lot. So, Taiwan and all US friends should be a bit careful with Trump.</p>
            <p>Montgomery said that for Taiwan, facing China, which is much stronger, is indeed worrying. "But Taiwan already has many things to worry about," he added. He advised Taiwan to keep making its society stronger, spend more money on defense, do military exercises with the US, try to make trade agreements with the US, and invest a lot in the US. He said, "Try to be the best partner for the US."</p>
            <p>TSMC, a large Taiwanese company, has said it will invest more in the US, up to 165 billion US dollars. Montgomery said this is a good start. Also, Taiwan buys almost all its military weapons from the US and wants to buy more. "These are good signs," he said. He hopes this will help Taiwan and the US make a deal. This deal would lower the tax the US puts on goods from Taiwan from 20% to 15%, which is the same as for Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>He thinks a trade agreement between Taiwan and the US will probably happen after the US and China announce a meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping. "Hopefully, it will be before that meeting actually happens," he said.</p>
            <p>News from other countries said that people working for Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are talking about a possible meeting between the two leaders. This might happen later this year when Trump visits Asia. He might visit China around the time of the APEC meeting in Korea, or they could have a meeting during the APEC summit from October 30th to November 1st. If this meeting happens, it would be their first time meeting since Trump returned to the White House.</p>

            <h1>Washington D.C. Wants to Become the 51st US State Again After 800 Soldiers Arrive</h1>
            <p>Trump sent National Guard soldiers to Washington D.C. to keep the city safe. This shows again that Washington D.C., the capital city, has a special status. It cannot control its own soldiers. This has led to new calls for D.C. to become a state. For many decades, D.C. has not become a state. This is because of many reasons and a power struggle between the two main political parties in the US Congress.</p>
            <p>On August 11th, US President Trump decided that the police in the District of Columbia (also called Washington D.C.) would be directly controlled by the national government. He also sent about 800 National Guard soldiers there. Last night, people in D.C. started sharing pictures on social media of soldiers walking in the streets or of police officers.</p>
            <p>The President sending soldiers directly shows that the local government does not have enough power. Also, people in D.C. pay national taxes but cannot vote in Congress. These unfair situations, where D.C. is treated "less than a state," have made the discussion about D.C. becoming a state grow quickly.</p>
            <p>Supporters believe that if D.C. becomes a state, it can protect itself from Trump's actions. Also, the city government will not have to worry about being fully controlled by the national government. Muriel Bowser, the Democratic mayor of D.C., brought the idea of "statehood" into public attention on August 11th. She said that she and past leaders have been working on this for many years.</p>
            <p>For many decades, the closest D.C. came to becoming a state was in 2021. At that time, the US House of Representatives passed a law to make D.C. the 51st state. But the Senate did not vote on this law.</p>
            <p>D.C. has always been a strong supporter of the Democratic Party. If it became a state, it would give the Democrats two more seats in the Senate. This would also help the Democrats get more power in the Senate in the future. Now, the Republican Party controls Congress, so it is even harder for D.C. to become the 51st state.</p>
            <p>Also, not all Democrats fully support D.C. becoming a state. Some worry that people who are not strongly for one party might see this as a political move just for the Democrats' benefit. This could make the public support for the idea weaker. So, some Democrats did not vote for it.</p>
            <p>Washington D.C. was made a "special district" instead of a "state" a long time ago. This was when the 13 American states first came together as a country. They needed a neutral area just for the national government to work.</p>
            <p>In 1790, the US Congress passed a law for the capital city. They decided to choose land along the Potomac River to be the permanent capital. The next year, it was named "The District of Columbia."</p>
            <p>People in D.C. could only vote for president after 1961, thanks to a change in the Constitution. In 1973, they got their own elected government under the "Home Rule Act." Congress only had the power to watch over it. But this law does not mean the local government has full control. There are still limits. On August 11th, Trump used Section 740 of the law. This section allows the President to take temporary control of the police if there is "a special emergency."</p>
            <p>"We do not have complete self-rule," Mayor Bowser said at a press conference on August 11th.</p>
            <p>If D.C. does become a state, the plan is for it to be called "State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth." This name would honor Frederick Douglass, a famous person who worked to end slavery for Black people.</p>
            <p>The original special federal area would become much smaller, only about 2 square miles (about 5.17 square kilometers). This small area would include only the White House, the US Capitol Building, the US Supreme Court, and the government buildings near the Capitol and the National Mall. The rest of the area, about 66 square miles, would become part of the 51st state.</p>
            <p>D.C. would also choose 2 senators and 1 representative who can vote in Congress.</p>
            <p>Those who support statehood believe it would fix a past mistake and make sure voters get fair representation. Those against it say D.C. is too small. If it became a state, it might have too much influence on the national government.</p>
            <p>What does President Trump think? He said today that "(D.C. getting) statehood is silly."</p>

            <h1>Ukraine and Europe Agree on Rules for Talks Before US-Russia Meeting: Land Can Be Discussed, Control Cannot Be Given Up</h1>
            <p>The meeting between the US and Russia will take place in Alaska, USA, on August 15th. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, who cannot attend, said today that he and leaders from Europe and the US have agreed on 5 main rules for the US-Russia meeting. The biggest new idea is that Ukraine is ready to talk about land issues. But this can only happen based on where the fighting lines are now. Ukraine also said it will not agree to Russia having full control over any Ukrainian land.</p>
            <p>In Berlin, Volodymyr Zelenskyy had an online meeting. He spoke with US President Donald Trump, leaders from many European countries like the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and Finland. Also in the meeting were Mark Rutte, the NATO Secretary-General, Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, and AntÃ³nio Costa, the head of the European Council.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Zelenskyy and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held a press conference together. Merz announced that everyone at the meeting agreed on 5 main rules for the upcoming US-Russia meeting. One rule is that Ukraine is ready to talk about land problems. But this can only start from the "contact points," which means the current fighting lines. Ukraine also said again that it will not accept any occupied areas as Russian land. Ukraine's official borders will stay the same.</p>
            <p>Other things they agreed on are: Ukraine must be part of any future talks about Ukraine. The first thing to talk about must be stopping the fighting right away. Later talks need to include ways to keep Ukraine safe, such as Western countries helping the Ukrainian army stay strong. Also, the talks must be based on a single view from countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. If Russia does not agree to stop fighting on August 15th, Europe and the US will think about putting more punishments on Russia.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also added that Russia should not have the power to stop Ukraine from joining NATO and the European Union. He said again that he hopes to arrange a three-way meeting with Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked more about Ukraine's position on its land, Zelenskyy repeated that Ukraine will not take its soldiers out of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. He said that all issues about Ukraine can only be discussed with Ukraine. He also pointed out that Ukraine's constitution clearly states that it does not accept Russia having control over any Ukrainian land.</p>
            <p>Talking about the coming US-Russia meeting, Zelenskyy said: "We hope the main topic of the meeting will be to stop fighting immediately. The US President has said many times that after the meeting in Alaska, he will talk to me directly to discuss what happened and decide what to do next."</p>
            <p>Also, Zelenskyy criticized Russian President Putin for recently "bluffing." He said Putin is trying to put more pressure on all fighting areas before the meeting. Putin wants to make it seem like Russia can take over all of Ukraine. "Putin does not want peace; he only wants to take our country," Zelenskyy added. He also said that punishments have hurt Russia's economy badly. He asked other countries to keep putting pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>Trump plans to meet Putin face-to-face in Anchorage, Alaska, on August 15th. This will be the first time a US President in office has met Putin since 2021.</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that Putin might suggest a plan for stopping the fighting. In this plan, Ukrainian soldiers would leave the Donbas region. For southern Ukraine, the current fighting line would be the border for future control. Before this, Zelenskyy had said many times that Ukraine would not give up any land or control.</p>
