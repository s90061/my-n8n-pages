<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te stated on Sunday that Taiwan is "of course" a country. He argued that China lacks both historical and legal evidence to support its claims of sovereignty over the island, strongly rejecting Beijing's increasing political and military pressure.

China views democratically-governed Taiwan as "sacred" Chinese territory, asserting it has belonged to China since ancient times and is merely one of its provinces, with no right to be called a state.

President Lai and his administration firmly reject this perspective and have repeatedly offered talks with China, which have been declined. China labels Lai a "separatist."

In the first of a series of ten speeches titled "uniting the country," Lai discussed Taiwan's history, including the ancient connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesian groups, such as native Hawaiians. He used this to illustrate what he believes is Taiwan's distinct development separate from China.

He added that the people of Taiwan have a history of resisting invasion, citing uprisings against Japan's colonial rule from 1895-1945. Furthermore, under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for a mere eight years.

"Of course, Taiwan is a country," Lai declared during a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, also highlighting its presidential elections. "But China insists that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. China maintains that the 1971 United Nations resolution, which removed Taipei's seat and gave it to Beijing, serves as one of the legal foundations for its claims.

Lai, who in March referred to China as a "hostile foreign force," asserted that Beijing's claim about the U.N. resolution being related to Taiwan's sovereignty was "totally wrong," as the resolution only addressed which government was represented at the organization.

Lai also emphasized that China's threat to Taiwan is real, pointing to Beijing's daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he asked, receiving applause.

The defeated Republic of China government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

**Taiwan adds China‚Äôs Huawei and SMIC to export control list**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-adds-china-huawei-smic-073838565.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) ‚Äî Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision comes amidst growing trade and technology disputes between Taiwan, China, and the United States.

Being placed on the ‚Äústrategic high-tech commodities‚Äù list means that Taiwanese companies must obtain special export permits before selling goods to these companies. The list also includes other entities such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda, as well as various other companies in China, Iran, and other countries.

The export control entities list was last updated on Sunday. Neither Huawei nor SMIC has yet commented on their inclusion.

Both Huawei and SMIC have already been sanctioned by the U.S. These two companies are currently producing China's most advanced domestically developed artificial intelligence chips. This effort aims to compete with U.S.-based Nvidia and provide Chinese tech firms with essential chips despite existing export restrictions.

Taiwan is home to the world‚Äôs largest chip manufacturer, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which is a significant supplier for Nvidia.

Last November, the U.S. directed TSMC to stop supplying certain advanced chips to Chinese customers. This was part of a broader strategy to limit China‚Äôs access to cutting-edge technologies.

China maintains that self-governed Taiwan is its own territory and reserves the right to annex it by force if necessary. The U.S. is Taiwan's most important unofficial ally and a major seller of arms.
