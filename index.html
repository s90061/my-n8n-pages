The Military Police Command practiced moving supplies using the Taipei Metro system in the early morning. This was part of Taiwan's "Han Kuang 41" military exercise, which is a 10-day event. The aim was to train civil and military units to work together and to check how well resources can be moved using underground tunnels. During this exercise, FIM-92 portable Stinger missiles, which Taiwan received from the US, were shown in public. These missiles are important for defending the capital city from low-flying attacks. Taiwan uses four different kinds of Stinger missiles. The military says these missiles were obtained through military aid and have been trained on by various units.

**US Congress Criticizes Secret Service for "Unforgivable" Failures in Trump Assassination Investigation**

The US Congress has released a report on the attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump a year ago. The report strongly criticized the Secret Service, calling their actions and response "unforgivable." On July 13 last year, Trump was shot at during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania, and the bullet hit his ear. One person died and two others were hurt in the incident, and the shooter was killed by government snipers. The congressional report states that the Secret Service had "a series of preventable failures" that almost caused Trump's death. It also noted that no one has been fired for these mistakes, and it asks for stricter punishments.
