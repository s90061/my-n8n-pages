  <p>Kaohsiung City is making it easier for families to get money when they have a baby. From July 1st, if you live in Kaohsiung for 10 months (instead of 1 year), you can get NT$30,000 for each baby.</p>
  <p>Also, if a baby is born early, families can still get the money. The city will count the residency time from the baby's expected birth date. This new rule will help more families receive support.</p>
  <p>Families can choose between the baby money or a special service. This service helps mothers after birth, and it is worth NT$30,000, NT$40,000, or NT$60,000, depending on if it's the first, second, or third baby. Families with low income can get both the money and the service.</p>
  <p>The city is also building more places for children to be cared for. By 2026, there will be 85 public childcare centers. They also have places where parents can drop off children for a short time, even at night or for 24 hours. There are 24 family centers with fun activities, lessons, and books for parents and kids. Kaohsiung wants to be a happy city for families to raise children.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 2px solid #eee; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;">Brad Pitt's F1 Movie is a Big Hit!</h3>
  <p>Brad Pitt's new movie, "F1: The Movie," is doing very well! It was the number one movie in North America this weekend. It made 55.6 million US dollars in North America and 144 million US dollars around the world.</p>
  <p>This is the best start for a movie from Apple (Apple Original Films) in movie theaters. Apple has made other movies, but not all of them did well in cinemas. However, "F1 Movie" is their first big summer movie. The people who made this movie also worked on the very popular movie "Top Gun: Maverick."</p>
  <p>The movie cost more than 200 million US dollars to make, so it needs to earn more money to make a profit. But for now, it's doing great! Experts say it's a "great opening" for a sports drama. Both movie critics and fans like it a lot.</p>
  <p>Other movies also played in theaters. A new live-action "How to Train Your Dragon" movie was second, making 19.4 million dollars. The animated movie "Elio" was third with 10.7 million. "M3GAN 2.0" was fourth, but it didn't do as well as expected, making 10.2 million dollars. "28 Years Later" was fifth with 9.7 million dollars.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 2px solid #eee; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;">Sad News: Leopard Cat "Dou Zao" Dies from Dog Attack</h3>
  <p>A leopard cat named "Dou Zao," who was being watched by scientists after being released, has died in Nantou City. It seems that stray dogs attacked and killed her. Scientists also found two old lead pellets in her body, possibly from an air gun.</p>
  <p>The research team is asking people not to feed stray dogs and cats. They also want people to stop illegal hunting.</p>
  <p>"Dou Zao" was born in 2021 and lost her family when she was young. She was then cared for by a research center. In 2022, she was released into the wild. Later, cameras saw her with her babies, and she became a mother of two. The team learned a lot from watching "Dou Zao" for over three years. They called her a "legendary leopard cat" because she taught them so much.</p>
  <p>Her body had clear injuries, and doctors confirmed she died because of a dog attack. Finding the lead pellets showed she had been shot before.</p>
  <p>"Dou Zao" had 5 groups of babies, but two groups did not survive. This helped scientists learn new things about how leopard cats raise their young and about hidden dangers, like burning farms and building concrete near rivers. The team also learned that farms that are friendly to nature are important for leopard cats, and these cats help control mice on farms.</p>
  <p>"Dou Zao"'s death reminds us that human actions can be very dangerous for wild animals. Stray dogs and cats are killers of wildlife. Also, illegal hunting and losing natural homes can ruin efforts to protect animals. The team asks people not to leave their pets alone, not to feed stray animals, to stop illegal hunting, and to support farming that helps nature. We hope "Dou Zao"'s death will not be for nothing.</p>
