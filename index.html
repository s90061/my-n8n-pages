            <h1>Jiasing Hospital and Doctor Wang Tian-xing's Old Home Are Now Historic Sites in Chiayi City</h1>
            <p>Jiasing Hospital and the old home of Doctor Wang Tian-xing are located on Wufeng South Road in Chiayi City. The family of Dr. Wang asked for them to be recognized as historic sites. The committee for cultural heritage agreed. They said the buildings are different from typical hospitals built in rows of shops. They are important for studying hospital styles during the Japanese colonial period. So, they decided to make them Chiayi City Historic Sites.</p>
            <p>Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui said that Dr. Wang Tian-xing's family asking for this shows they care about local history and culture. It also means that more people are helping to save cultural heritage. These buildings show Dr. Wang's great work in medicine in Chiayi. The buildings mix Japanese and Western styles. They have important history and social value. For the people of Chiayi, they are a special memory of the city.</p>
            <p>The committee members said that Jiasing Hospital is a two-story building. It mixes Japanese and Western styles. Some parts of its structure and inside areas are damaged. The two-story clinic area at the back has completely fallen down. But the ground still has foundations and column bases. From these, we can guess how the building was built and where the stairs were.</p>
            <p>Also, Dr. Wang Tian-xing's old home is a one-story wooden building. It has five open areas. The roof is made with a special style called "five ridges and four slopes." It has Western-style wooden roof frames. The pillars have Chinese poems written on them. In the main hall, there is a Buddhist shrine. The style, parts, and materials used in the space mix Chinese and Western designs. This clearly shows the different styles of Chinese life and building during the Japanese colonial period.</p>
            <p>The committee members believe that these two buildings clearly show how hospitals and homes existed together during the Japanese colonial period. They are different from hospitals that were part of a row of shops. They are important for studying hospital building types from that time. Also, the work on them is very detailed. They have high artistic value and show great craftsmanship. So, the committee decided to name them Chiayi City Historic Sites.</p>
            <p>To help the owners understand the law about protecting cultural heritage, the Cultural Affairs Bureau sent experts to visit the site many times early this year. In March, the head of the Chiayi City Cultural Affairs Bureau, Hsieh Yu-che, visited the owners. He talked with them about future repairs and how to use the buildings again.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi City Cultural Affairs Bureau explained that Wang Tian-xing was a descendant of General Wang De-lu, a famous leader from the Qing Dynasty. His father, He Qi-xu, was a scholar during the Qing Dynasty. Wang Tian-xing went to Taipei Medical College, run by the Japanese government. He earned three medical degrees from Taiwan and Japan: a Taiwan Medical Doctor, a Tokyo Medical Doctor, and a Tropical Medicine Doctor. Jiasing Hospital had many departments, including internal medicine, pediatrics, ophthalmology, obstetrics and gynecology, dermatologic surgery, proctology, and physical therapy. The hospital also had a research lab. They made their own medicines to help the local people.</p>

            <h1>Secret Files Show Kissinger Wanted to Lure Chinese Army to Diaoyutai Islands in 1974, But Changed His Mind</h1>
            <p>According to old, secret US government papers, in January 1974, the People's Republic of China took control of the Paracel Islands in the South China Sea. At that time, Henry Kissinger, who was the US Secretary of State, asked his staff if they could trick the Chinese army into going to the Diaoyutai Islands (which Japan calls the Senkaku Islands). But he later decided not to do it.</p>
            <p>Japan's Kyodo News reported today that officials in the State Department disagreed with the idea. So, the plan was never carried out.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Kissinger might have been unhappy that Japan made friends with the People's Republic of China in September 1972, before the US did. He was also worried about Japan getting too close to Beijing. He might have wanted to "punish" Japan with this idea. However, it is not clear exactly how he planned to lure the army.</p>
            <p>On January 19, 1974, the People's Republic of China fought with South Vietnam at that time. In the same month, China took full control of the Paracel Islands.</p>
            <p>The secret papers show that on January 31, Kissinger had a meeting with his staff at the State Department. They were talking about what to do about the situation in the South China Sea. He said, "Can we lure them (China) to the Senkaku Islands? That way, we can teach the Japanese a lesson."</p>
            <p>Arthur Hummel, who was the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs at the time, asked Kissinger, "I understand we need to teach the Japanese a lesson, but is it worth doing this much?"</p>
            <p>Kissinger replied, "No," and gave up the idea.</p>
            <p>Rust Deming, who worked as a diplomat at the US Embassy in Japan at that time and later became the Deputy Chief of Mission there in the 1990s, told Kyodo News that he thought Kissinger felt that "Japan should take more responsibility for defending its own land."</p>
            <p>Kissinger became the National Security Advisor in 1969, during the time of former President Richard Nixon. In September 1973, he also became the Secretary of State. After Nixon left office in 1974, Kissinger continued to hold both jobs under former President Gerald Ford. He left the National Security Advisor role in November 1975, but stayed as Secretary of State until 1977.</p>
            <p>Kissinger helped in talks about Okinawa returning to Japan. He also helped make decisions about the Diaoyutai Islands.</p>
            <p>On one hand, he helped Nixon visit Beijing in 1972 and worked for the US and Beijing to start official relations in 1979. On the other hand, he had different ideas from Japan about textile trade and kept a distance from Japan.</p>
            <p>Kissinger passed away in November 2023 at the age of 100.</p>

            <h1>Dadaocheng International Arts Festival Starts in October with a Fun Costume Parade</h1>
            <p>A costume party that takes you back 100 years will return to Dadaocheng in Taipei. The 2025 Dadaocheng International Arts Festival will begin in October. Every year, many people join the "1920s Costume Event." This year, local businesses have even formed their own bands to join in. Everyone is invited to have fun together.</p>
            <p>The theme for the 2025 Dadaocheng International Arts Festival is "The Accelerating Era." It tries to respond to the fast changes happening in the world today. The festival's opening press conference took place today. Chou Yi-cheng, who started the festival, said that art is not just a mirror that shows what is happening. It is also a tool to criticize and inspire. "In this fast-changing time, there are both challenges and chances. Art is a key power that guides us forward," he said.</p>
            <p>The Dadaocheng International Arts Festival will last for one month. This year's events include a new talent dance competition, talks about different topics, performances by international artists, and activities in local neighborhoods. It focuses on connecting with the local area. For example, Dadaocheng is famous for its textile industry. A group of high school students from Taipei has created an online game called "Circular Textile Battle." They are using this game to connect the industry with the festival's theme. This helps people learn more about clothes made from sustainable materials.</p>
            <p>There will also be the "1920s Costume Parade," which is popular every year. People are invited to dress up and go back in time to the 1920s. Weng Yu-ching, the production director of the Dadaocheng International Arts Festival, said that this year the parade will start from five different routes. All routes will meet at Yongle Square. The main stage will have exciting performances. For example, Hsieh Hsiao-hui, the chairman of Huang Chia, who recently went to the Paris International Fabric and Accessory Exhibition, will lead her own band to perform.</p>
            <p>Minister of Environment Peng Chi-ming came to support the event today. He used the example of many places in Taiwan facing typhoons one after another. He said that extreme weather is also a part of "The Accelerating Era." The Dadaocheng International Arts Festival combines many activities with sustainability. A sustainable culture will be the start of all changes. He hopes for more cooperation in the future.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Dadaocheng International Arts Festival will take place from October 1 to October 31.</p>
