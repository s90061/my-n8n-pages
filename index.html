Elon Musk, a rich tech person who used to support former US President Trump, announced today that he has started a new political party in the US. He says it will fight against what he calls a "one-party system" in America.

Musk wrote on his social media site X, "We live in a one-party system, not a democracy. This has led to a lot of waste and corruption, making our country go broke. Today, the 'America Party' is starting to give you back your freedom."

This news comes after Trump signed a big spending bill into law yesterday. Musk was against this bill. Musk had given almost $300 million to Trump's campaign before and worked in a special part of Trump's government that aimed to cut government spending. However, their relationship got bad when they disagreed publicly about Trump's spending bill.
