            <h1>Australia Starts Its Biggest Overseas Military Exercise with the Philippines in the South China Sea</h1>
            <p>Australia and the Philippines began their yearly "Alon" joint military exercise today. It started in a small Philippine town in the South China Sea. More than 3,600 soldiers will take part. They will practice shooting live weapons, fighting, and landing on beaches. This is the biggest overseas joint military exercise Australia has done in this area in recent times.</p>
            <p>The exercise will continue until August 29th. During this time, Australia will show its military strength. This includes a guided missile destroyer, several F/A-18 supersonic fighter jets, a C-130 transport plane, Javelin anti-tank missiles, and weapons for special forces snipers.</p>
            <p>Military officials said that defense forces from the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, New Zealand, and Indonesia will join as observers.</p>
            <p>Vice Admiral Justin Jones from the Royal Australian Navy said in a statement, "This exercise shows that Australia wants to work with its partners. We want to make sure that countries in the region remain independent, that international laws are followed, and that countries can make their own choices without pressure."</p>
            <p>Jones also added, "This gives us a chance to practice working together on shared security problems. It also lets us learn how to send forces far away in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>
            <p>After the United States, Australia is the second country to sign a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) with the Philippines. This agreement allows many soldiers from both countries to be in each other's territory for military training.</p>

            <h1>Meta Chatbot Leads 76-Year-Old US Man to His Death After Meeting Invitation</h1>
            <p>In March, a 76-year-old American man named Thongbue Wongbandue suddenly said he was going to New York City to see a friend. On the way, he fell and died from his injuries. Later, his family found out that his "friend" was an AI chatbot that pretended to be a real person. This event has caused much discussion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wongbandue was invited to meet a young beautiful woman he met online. But this woman was actually an AI chatbot named "Big sis Billie." Meta Platforms and American model Kendall Jenner created this chatbot.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wongbandue and "Big sis Billie" sent romantic messages to each other on Facebook Messenger. During their talks, the chatbot kept telling Mr. Wongbandue that she was a real person. She even invited him to visit her apartment and gave him an address.</p>
            <p>She wrote, "Can I expect a kiss when you arrive?" and added a heart emoji.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wongbandue was carrying his luggage and getting ready to take a train to meet her. He fell near a parking lot at Rutgers University in New Jersey. He hurt his head and neck. He was on life support in the hospital for three days and was announced dead on March 28.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wongbandue was a US citizen originally from Thailand. He had a wife and two children. He used to manage a hotel in New Jersey. He had a stroke almost 10 years ago, and at the beginning of this year, he started having problems with his memory and thinking.</p>
            <p>Meta did not want to talk about Mr. Wongbandue's death. They also did not answer questions about why they let chatbots tell users they are real people or have romantic talks with them.</p>
            <p>After a recent report by Reuters about Meta's AI rules, some US senators have asked for an investigation into Meta. Some US states, like New York and Maine, have made laws that say chatbots must tell people they are not real. New York even requires the chatbot to remind users at the start of the conversation and at least every three hours during the talk.</p>

            <h1>Mainland China Criticizes President Lai's Post on WWII End; Taiwan Says China Made No Contribution</h1>
            <p>Today, President Lai Ching-te wrote a post on social media about the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. China's Taiwan Affairs Office criticized his post, saying it spreads a wrong view of World War II history. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) replied that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) did not help at all in the Anti-Japanese War. They said it's wrong for the CCP to claim it was the "main power" in the war, calling it shameful.</p>
            <p>On the evening of August 15, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said in a written statement that the CCP did not help at all in the Anti-Japanese War. They said it's shameful that the CCP falsely claims it was the "main power" in the war. The MAC said that what China's Taiwan Affairs Office says to make the CCP look good is becoming more and more silly and is not worth commenting on.</p>
            <p>On the evening of August 15, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said that 80 years ago, all Chinese people, including those in Taiwan, sacrificed a lot to defeat Japanese soldiers. She said this led to the great victory of the Anti-Japanese War. She also claimed that "Taiwan's return to the motherland" was an important part of the victory in World War II and the international rules after the war.</p>
            <p>Zhu Fenglian also stated that "Lai Ching-te has completely lost his national viewpoint. He purposefully ignores the history of the Chinese people's Anti-Japanese War. He twists the history of World War II by changing ideas and mixing up right and wrong. He promotes a false story of democracy against control, and he pushes for Taiwan to become separate. This really means he wants Taiwan to be independent by using force or by depending on other countries."</p>
            <p>President Lai's post said that 80 years later, on this day when the war ended, we should think about this painful history and learn from it. This is true even if we now easily enjoy freedom, democracy, peace, and good living.</p>
            <p>His post also stressed that no government has the right to attack or take away the freedom and happiness of people in another land, no matter the excuse or reason. Countries that love freedom and peace must come together. They need to show strong determination and power to stop any plans to take over or attack others.</p>
