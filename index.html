The French President, Emmanuel Macron, spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone today. This was their first known call since 2022. Macron asked Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine quickly.

Macron also said that France strongly supports Ukraine's independence and its borders. He asked Russia and Ukraine to stop fighting soon and start talking to find a stable and lasting solution to the conflict. They also decided to work together on the issue of Iran.

The Kremlin, Russia's presidential office, said that Putin told Macron that Western countries are to blame for the conflict in Ukraine. Putin said these countries ignored Russia's security for many years and made Ukraine a base against Russia. Moscow also said that Putin told Macron any peace deal should be complete and long-lasting, remove the reasons for the Ukraine crisis, and accept the new land situation.

**Trump: No Plans to Extend Tariff Break, Possible Deal with India**

US President Donald Trump said today that he is not thinking about extending the 90-day break on equal tariffs, which ends on July 9. He plans to send letters to many countries to tell them about the new tariffs they will need to pay.

Trump also said that the US might make a deal with India to lower the tariffs India has to pay. He mentioned that doing business in the US will be an honor for countries, but some countries will not be allowed to trade with the US. When asked about Japan, Trump said he does not think the US and Japan can reach a deal. He said Japan and other countries have taken advantage of the US for 30 or 40 years, and it is hard for them to make agreements now. He added that Japan exports millions of cars to the US but does not accept US cars or rice, even though they need it.

He said he will write to Japan to say that since they cannot do what the US needs, they will have to pay a 30% or 35% tariff, or whatever rate is decided. Taiwan and Indonesia are also close to making tariff agreements with the US.
