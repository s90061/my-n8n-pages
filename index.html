**Trump: US and Vietnam Make Trade Deal, 20% Tariff on Vietnamese Goods**

As the US special tariff period ends soon, US President Trump said today that a trade deal has been made with Vietnam. Based on this deal, Vietnam will pay a 20% tax on goods sent to the US. For goods that are just passing through Vietnam, the tax will be 40%. Also, Vietnam will fully open its markets to US goods.

In early April, Trump announced these special tariffs, which caused some problems in global money markets. He then said there would be a 90-day pause, where only a 10% basic tax would be in place. Countries used this time to talk with the US, hoping for lower taxes after the pause.

The 90-day pause for these tariffs ends on July 9th. Recently, Trump has said many times that he will not make the pause longer. The US has already made deals with the UK and China. People are watching to see what happens with other countries' tariff talks.

This morning, Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that he just made a trade deal with Vietnam. He said it happened after he spoke with the General Secretary of Vietnam's Communist Party, To Lam. He called it a "great deal" for both countries.

Trump explained that under the agreement, Vietnam will pay a 20% tax on all goods entering the US. For goods that are just shipped through Vietnam, the tax will be 40%. Vietnam will also "completely open its trade market to the United States." This means that US goods can be sold to Vietnam with no taxes.

According to information from the White House, the US originally planned to put a 46% tax on goods from Vietnam.

Trump also said that he believes American SUVs, or large engine vehicles, "will be a great addition to Vietnam's various product lines."

**Taipei Prosecutors Office: Strongly Condemns Threats Against Prosecutors, Will Act Strictly**

The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said late today that they strongly condemn bad people for putting pictures of prosecutors and other law enforcement officers on social media. These pictures had blood marks, and the people threatened "life for a life." The office said they will quickly investigate and punish these violent threats by law to keep law enforcement officers safe.

A press release from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office stated that they strongly condemn these illegal acts of threatening law enforcement officers. They also said that the Taipei City Police Department's Criminal Investigation Division will immediately investigate these cases strictly according to the law. This is to make sure that prosecutors, judges, and other law enforcement officers are safe. It also helps to keep court investigations and trials fair and clear.

The press release also said that everyone should respect court processes. If people involved in a case have different opinions or arguments, they should use the legal steps in criminal court. They should make their arguments and defend themselves in court, and the court will decide what is right. People should not use violence or threats to try to stop court decisions. The court needs to be able to make decisions independently and clearly.
