            <h1>Tainan Encourages Livestock Farms to Rebuild and Upgrade After Typhoon</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Daanas caused damage to over 100 livestock farms in Tainan. The city's Agriculture Bureau found that farms with modern facilities were better at handling the storm than older ones. The Bureau is now encouraging farmers to use special government help after the disaster to improve their farms.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Agriculture Bureau held a press conference today. They invited Mr. Zeng Sheng-cheng, who is the head of the Tainan Pig Farming Association, and Mr. Huang Bing-xun, who is a manager at the Tainan Egg Chicken Association. They shared how modernizing their farms helped them during the typhoon.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu Xing-jun, who is the head of the Livestock Section at the Agriculture Bureau, said that Tainan is the fourth largest area for livestock in Taiwan. It is very important for the country's meat and egg supply. The typhoon and heavy rain might affect the supply of these products for up to six months.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu explained that the Ministry of Agriculture has announced a special plan for helping livestock farms after Typhoon Daanas and the heavy rains in July. This plan offers money to build, rebuild, or fix animal shelters, compost areas, offices, or storage spaces. It also covers livestock equipment. The city government will help farmers apply for this aid to quickly restart their production.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zeng Sheng-cheng said that his pig farm in Baihe had been updated with modern equipment as part of a government plan. Because of this, his farm had very little damage from the typhoon and is working normally now. He encourages other farmers to use this chance to change their farms to the newest modern equipment, which will help their businesses last longer.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Bing-xun said that his chicken farm in Yanshui also had modern equipment. This helped it survive the typhoon. Compared to other traditional chicken farms that were badly hit, he said that upgrading "brought protection." He urged farmers to use the government's help.</p>
            <p>Ms. Xu Xing-jun said that to make the industry stronger, the city government has been helping livestock farms with a four-year "10 Billion Pig Farming Fund Plan" and a two-year "Poultry Farm Modernization Upgrade Plan." These plans have helped solve many management problems on farms, reduced the need for many workers, and made farms safer from diseases. They also help farms handle extreme weather better and protect animals and equipment inside.</p>
            <p>She added that the Agriculture Bureau wants damaged farms to rebuild using the government help. They should plan to add eco-friendly and energy-saving features. This will lower the effects of extreme weather and help their farms become modern and last for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Shihlin Electric Sees Orders for AI Data Centers Until 2028</h1>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh Han-chang, the CEO and General Manager of Shihlin Electric, a big heavy electrical equipment company, said today that Shihlin Electric is involved in building modular container-type AI data centers. They provide full solutions for power and electricity supply systems. Their transformer products continue to grow because of three main reasons, and some orders are already confirmed until 2028.</p>
            <p>Regarding new business areas, Mr. Hsieh said that the company is not only working on automated equipment for advanced packaging like CoWoS, but also on parts for liquid cooling systems used in AI servers. They are working with system companies to supply controllers and drivers.</p>
            <p>Shihlin Electric held an investor conference this afternoon. When talking about their partnership with Teco and Hon Hai, Mr. Hsieh pointed out that modular container-type AI data centers are becoming popular. Large international companies are building these expandable data centers. Shihlin Electric is a main supplier of power equipment for these international companies when they set up data centers in Taiwan, and they have a lot of experience. Shihlin Electric is a part of this trend for modular container-type AI data centers. They have also joined another group to offer integrated power supply systems for these container data centers.</p>
            <p>People in the industry say that Shihlin Electric supplies power equipment for international companies like Amazon, which are building data centers in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Looking at their heavy electrical business, which includes switchboards and transformers, Mr. Hsieh said that the transformer business grew a lot in the first half of this year, and the switchboard business was steady. The main demand comes from Taiwan Power Company's plans to improve the power grid and replace old equipment. He expects this will continue to create demand for medium and large transformers for the next 5 to 10 years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh mentioned that the building of high-tech semiconductor factories in Taiwan has also increased the need for transformers. Shihlin Electric has about 70% of the market share in this area. Also, Shihlin Electric expects good sales in the US market for the next 5 to 10 years, as the US is their biggest market for exports. They also sell to Canada, Southeast Asia, and Japan to spread out their business risks.</p>
            <p>Looking at the global transformer market, Mr. Hsieh said that besides the US, Japan also has strong demand. This is mainly because the AI industry needs more power equipment. Also, smart grids are becoming common, which means the power grid needs to be more stable. Shihlin Electric is trying to deliver transformers faster, aiming for 80 weeks, which is much quicker than their competitors.</p>
            <p>Regarding changes in tariffs (taxes on imports), Mr. Hsieh said that Shihlin Electric is talking with each customer. Even though costs have increased, some customers are willing to pay all the extra tariffs, and some are willing to pay half.</p>
            <p>For how far ahead they can see orders, Mr. Hsieh stated that some of Shihlin Electric's orders are confirmed until 2028. Orders for 2026 are sure, and orders for 2027 are "almost certain."</p>
            <p>About new transformer factories, Shihlin Electric said that their new T3 factory, which makes large power transformers for 500kV products, will start making products in mid-September. They are also planning a fourth transformer factory, which they expect to finish planning in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
            <p>According to information, in the first half of this year, electricity distribution projects made up about 72% of Shihlin Electric's total sales. Vehicle parts were about 14%, automated equipment and parts were about 11%, and other areas made up about 3%. Currently, the North American market accounts for about 15% of their sales.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi County Greenhouses Damaged by Typhoon, Agriculture Department Helps Farmers Clear Debris</h1>
            <p>In early July, Typhoon Daanas damaged 2,938 greenhouses and net houses in Chiayi County, covering an area of 961 hectares. Today, the Agriculture Department said it has found 19 companies to help farmers remove the damaged structures. The Environmental Protection Bureau is also helping to clear away old farm plastics, so farmers can start growing crops again sooner.</p>
            <p>It has been a month since the typhoon, but you can still see many fallen greenhouses and net houses in Chiayi County. Ms. Li Qiu-ying, the head of the Agriculture and Forestry Crop Section at the Agriculture Department, told Central News Agency that the county government has a list of 19 demolition companies for farmers to contact. If the iron parts of the greenhouses are given to the companies for recycling after they are taken apart, farmers might not have to pay. However, if the recycled iron is not worth enough to cover the cost of demolition, farmers will still need to pay.</p>
            <p>Also, the Environmental Protection Bureau is helping farmers remove old farm plastic sheets and nets that were damaged by the typhoon. But farmers must separate the plastic sheets by type, roll them up, and fold them neatly. This makes it easier to process and reuse them later.</p>
            <p>Ms. Li said that the Ministry of Agriculture has a program to help farmers rebuild damaged greenhouses and net houses after Typhoon Daanas in 2025. As of August 20th, farmers' associations in Chiayi County have received 465 applications for rebuilding greenhouses, and 135 of them are already finished.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Shi-yan, a farmer from Taibao City, said that he only recently found a company to remove his damaged greenhouse. Because so many greenhouses were damaged, he had to wait more than a month for his turn to have his greenhouse removed. He has already applied to the government to rebuild his greenhouse in a different location.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu explained that when rebuilding a greenhouse, farmers must first pay a 20% deposit to the greenhouse construction company. The cost of building a greenhouse can be from millions to tens of millions of Taiwan dollars, depending on its size. Many farmers have trouble finding the money for the deposit, and he is one of them.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Wu said he had 0.9 hectares (about 2.2 acres) of greenhouses, and only 0.4 hectares (about 1 acre) were destroyed by the typhoon. He is lucky that half of his farm can still be used. Some farmers lost everything, which is truly heartbreaking.</p>
