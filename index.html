        const text = `**News Title:** Huang Kuo-chang: AIT Understands and Supports Discussions on National Defense and Nuclear Power

People's Party leader Huang Kuo-chang said today that he has spoken with Raymond Greene, the head of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). Huang said that the People's Party supports Taiwan's defense budget and has shown this in their budget proposals. AIT understood and supported this.

Raymond Greene recently said that the U.S. hopes Taiwan will invest more in defense and social strength, as Taiwan aims to spend more than 3% of its GDP on defense. He believes that all political parties in Taiwan will put in the necessary effort to keep peace.

Huang also mentioned that the People's Party believes Taiwan should keep using nuclear power. He said this would help fix the current government's energy policy problems. AIT also agreed with this idea and hopes for closer cooperation between Taiwan and the U.S. on nuclear power.

**News Title:** First New "Danjiang" Ship for Taiwan Navy Launched

The first new ship of the Tuo Chiang-class patrol vessels, named "Danjiang" (ship number 627), was launched yesterday. This is part of the second group of five new ships being built for the Taiwanese Navy. A source said that Navy Commander Admiral Tang Hua led the ceremony.

The new ships in the Tuo Chiang class are named after rivers in Taiwan. The "Danjiang" ship is named after the Danda Creek in Nantou. The ship was made in February and is now being fitted with equipment and weapons. It will be given to the Navy next year by Lungteh Shipbuilding.

These Tuo Chiang-class ships have a 76mm fast gun and a Phalanx close-in weapon system. They also carry Hsiung Feng II and III anti-ship missiles and Sea Sword II air defense missiles. This means they can attack targets in the air and on the sea. They are even called "aircraft carrier killers."
