A recent report indicates that more than half of companies are seeing good returns on their investments in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Businesses are using AI to make their operations more efficient, improve customer service, and develop new products. For example, AI can help automate repetitive tasks, allowing employees to focus on more complex work. It can also analyze large amounts of data quickly to help companies make better decisions.

The report also highlights some challenges companies face when adopting AI. These include ensuring the quality of data used by AI systems and finding enough skilled people to manage and develop AI technologies. Despite these difficulties, many companies believe that AI is essential for their future growth and competitiveness. They plan to continue increasing their spending on AI in the coming years.

**Cities Adapting to More Frequent and Intense Heatwaves**

Cities around the world are experiencing hotter temperatures and more frequent heatwaves, which are impacting daily life. This extreme heat can be dangerous for people's health, especially for the elderly and young children. It also puts a strain on city infrastructure, such as power grids and transportation systems, which can struggle to cope with the increased demand for air conditioning and other services.

To address this growing problem, cities are looking for ways to adapt and cool down. Some solutions include planting more trees and creating green spaces, which can lower local temperatures. Other strategies involve using "cool roofs" that reflect sunlight rather than absorbing heat, and improving early warning systems to alert citizens about dangerous heat levels. Urban planners are also designing cities with better ventilation and more shaded areas to make them more comfortable during hot periods.

**"Bleisure Travel" Becomes Popular as Business Trips Include Leisure Time**

A new trend called "bleisure travel" is becoming increasingly popular, where people combine their business trips with personal leisure activities. Instead of just flying in and out for a meeting, employees are extending their stays to explore the destination, visit friends, or enjoy a short holiday. This trend is partly driven by more flexible working arrangements, including remote work, which allows people to work from different locations.

Companies are starting to recognize the benefits of bleisure travel. It can improve employee morale and well-being, making business trips feel less like a chore and more like an opportunity. This can also help with employee retention and attraction. While there are some challenges for companies, such as managing expenses and ensuring clear policies, many are open to this new approach. It offers a way for employees to balance their professional responsibilities with a desire for travel and personal experiences.`;
