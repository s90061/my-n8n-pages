More and more people are experiencing a condition called 'tech neck' because of how they use their phones and tablets. This happens when you spend too much time looking down at your device. This constant forward-leaning posture can cause pain in your neck, shoulders, and even your back. It can also lead to headaches.

Experts say that looking down at a phone puts a lot of pressure on your spine. Over time, this can lead to stiffness and long-term problems. To avoid 'tech neck,' it's important to change your habits. Try holding your phone up higher so you don't have to bend your neck as much. Take frequent breaks from your screen and stretch your neck and shoulders. Simple exercises like moving your head from side to side and up and down can also help. Being aware of your posture is key to preventing this common modern problem.

**Bringing Employees Back to the Office: A Difficult Challenge**

Many companies are asking their employees to return to the office after a long period of remote work during the pandemic. However, this is proving to be a difficult challenge for many businesses. Employees who have become used to the flexibility of working from home are often not eager to come back to the traditional office setting.

Reasons for resistance include long commutes, a desire for a better work-life balance, and the belief that they can be just as productive at home. Some studies show that forcing employees back can lead to lower morale and even more people leaving their jobs. To encourage a return, companies are trying different approaches. These include offering better office spaces, organizing social events, or adopting a hybrid model where employees come in only a few days a week. Understanding employee needs and offering some flexibility seems to be important for a successful return to the office.

**Europe's Summer Travel Forecast: Preparing for the Heat**

As summer approaches, many people are planning trips to Europe. However, recent forecasts suggest that travelers should be ready for very hot weather in some popular areas. While northern parts of Europe like Scandinavia and the UK might see milder temperatures, countries in the south, such as Spain, Italy, and Greece, are expected to experience intense heatwaves.

Last year, many parts of southern Europe saw record temperatures, affecting tourist activities. This year, similar conditions are possible. Travelers are advised to check weather forecasts regularly before and during their trips. It is important to stay hydrated, wear light clothing, and avoid being outside during the hottest parts of the day. Choosing destinations with cooler climates or planning activities for the early morning and late evening could make for a more comfortable summer holiday in Europe.
