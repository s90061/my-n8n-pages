            <h1>Patients may get long-lasting antibiotics to use at home from November</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) started a new plan in August. This plan allows people to get antibiotic shots at clinics instead of staying in the hospital. Today, Minister Shih Chung-liang talked about the next step. They are thinking about adding portable, long-lasting antibiotics that people use once a day. This could start in November. Then, patients can get antibiotic treatment at home.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang spoke at the "2025 Integrity Forum" for a group that researches new medicines in Taiwan. He said that in the past, if you needed antibiotics, you had to stay in the hospital. This was because patients needed three shots a day, every eight hours. You could get the shots at a clinic, but it was very hard for people to go to the clinic three times a day. So, most people chose to stay in the hospital.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang explained that now there are long-lasting shots. These shots fixed the problem of needing three shots a day. But doctors found that most of these long-lasting shots are for more serious infections. So, drug companies made a small, easy-to-carry pump. This pump can give the older, more common antibiotics that used to need many shots in just one use.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has more and more older people. This new way of treatment helps old people spend less time in the hospital. It also lowers their risk of getting infections and helps them go back to their communities sooner and stay active. Shih Chung-liang believes this new technology not only stops strong germs from growing but also lets patients "take it home." They get all the medicine in one use. A meeting this week will decide if this new method can be used. It might be part of treatments as early as November 1st.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu, who is in charge of the National Health Insurance Administration, sent a message to reporters. She said that this week's meeting will talk about portable infusion devices. Before this, medical teams often chose strong antibiotics given once a day. But this didn't allow quick changes to the treatment. The portable infusion device can give medicine continuously for 24 hours. This means doctors can change the medicine based on the patient's infection. This helps to control infections well.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu also said that "Non-Hospital Intravenous Antibacterial Treatment (OPAT)" is a good and easy way to treat people. It is very useful for mild to medium infections. OPAT is a new way of treatment. It allows patients who used to need hospital stays for antibiotic shots to get treated at home. This helps hospitals have more beds for other patients and lets patients move around more easily.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu mentioned that the Emergency Medicine Association suggested this plan. The National Health Insurance Administration worked with doctors' groups and infection experts to discuss it. It started in August. Now, 23 hospitals and 8 clinics are using it. 215 people have finished their treatment. Hospitals say it works very well.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Green Museum and Library opens for a special look, Mayor Lu Shiow-yen and Japanese architects lead the event</h1>
            <p>The Taichung Green Museum and Library will open by the end of this year. Today, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen joined Japanese architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. They showed everyone around the new building. Mayor Lu said that the Green Museum and Library will not only be famous in Taiwan but also a world cultural landmark.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the Taichung Green Museum and Library had a special preview event. It is the first building in Taiwan that combines a city art museum and a city library. Mayor Lu, along with the architects Kazuyo Sejima, Ryue Nishizawa, and Taiwanese architect Liu Pei-sen, were there. They guided everyone to explore the building. The main design for its opening was also shown.</p>
            <p>The tour started in the main hall of the Green Museum and Library. When the main doors opened, two round glass houses could be seen. One is the service desk for the Green Museum and Library. The other leads to a public space underground. This is one of the "mixed-use spaces" in the building. A bridge above the main hall lets people see the building from different high places. From there, visitors can enjoy the artwork "Reproduction" by artist Lin Ming-hong. In the center of the hall, there is a stainless steel water pool with a curved shape. It not only reflects the green outdoor view and the surrounding light but also helps control the temperature inside the building.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that Taichung is known as a city of culture. But it did not have its own city art museum and library. After she became mayor, she wanted to make this dream come true. A team of Japanese and Taiwanese architects planned this world-class cultural building. She believes it will be a landmark not just for Taiwan, but for the world.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu pointed out that the Taichung city government paid 100% of the money to build the Green Museum and Library. She said that during her time as mayor, people always doubted her projects, like the Taichung Shopping Festival and the Hot Pot and BBQ Festival. She thanked the citizens for supporting her. She said the Green Museum and Library is a gift for the citizens. She believes that only with the dreams of its citizens can such a world-class landmark be built.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu described the Green Museum and Library as a beautiful, transparent, and elegant building. You cannot see inside from the outside, which gives privacy. But from inside, you can see the outdoor views. The exhibition halls are 27 meters high. This means they can show very large artworks in the future. The two parts of the building can be seen through each other, which was very hard to build.</p>
            <p>Kazuyo Sejima said that the place where the Green Museum and Library stands is very special. It is in a large central park and combines the functions of an art museum and a library. She believes that this space will create new culture in the future. After it is finished, as people use the space, their power will create many things that cannot be imagined now.</p>
            <p>Ryue Nishizawa said he hopes this building will be like a park. Even if people come here not to read, they can still spend comfortable time here. Even if they don't go into the museum to see art, they can still feel artistic and enjoy art-related experiences. His goal is for the whole space to feel like a park.</p>

            <h1>Sheltered workshops find it hard to operate, the Ministry of Labor gives more money for rent and staff</h1>
            <p>Sheltered workshops are important places where people with disabilities can work. But these workshops face high costs, like rent, which makes it hard for them to keep going. Today, the Ministry of Labor announced that it will give more money to sheltered workshops. This money will help with rent, management costs, and staff for marketing. The goal is to help these workshops stay open.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Labor had a regular meeting to talk about its work. Liu Yu-yi, who leads the employment group for people with disabilities at the Ministry of Labor, said that the ministry has a plan to help sheltered workshops. This plan is called "Subsidy Project for Local Governments to Provide Sheltered Employment Services for People with Disabilities." It gives money for starting and running workshops, fixing or replacing equipment, paying staff, rent, and marketing.</p>
            <p>However, Liu Yu-yi said that to meet the needs of sheltered workshops, they have recently changed the plan. The changes include giving more money to workshops, allowing them to hire staff more flexibly, and letting employees return to the workshop for a longer time after trying a regular job. These changes aim to make workshops better and improve their training services.</p>
            <p>Regarding the increased money for workshops, Liu Yu-yi explained that this includes rent for buildings, land, or vehicles used by the workshops. In the future, the highest monthly subsidy will be NT$40,000, and this amount will no longer decrease each year. Also, to help with running costs, workshops will get an extra NT$6,000 to NT$30,000 each month for management fees, depending on how many people they serve. If a workshop's equipment needs fixing because of natural disasters or other unexpected events, it will not have to wait three years for the next subsidy.</p>
            <p>To make staffing more flexible, large workshops with more than 24 employees can ask for money to hire a second marketing person. This is to help sell their products. Also, the rules for hiring technical advisors and marketing staff will be less strict. This will make it easier for workshops to find people to work.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-yi also said that to encourage disabled employees to move to regular jobs, the time they can return to the sheltered workshop after trying a regular job has been extended. It used to be 3 months, and now it is 6 months. This helps employees feel more secure when they try to move to a new job.</p>
            <p>According to numbers, by July 2025, there were 164 sheltered workshops across the country, with 2021 employees.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-yi said that this year, the budget for the "Subsidy Project for Local Governments to Provide Sheltered Employment Services for People with Disabilities" is NT$360 million. Next year, it will be NT$420 million. This is to help meet the operating needs of sheltered workshops.</p>
