            <h1>Taiwan Nichia Promotes Dai Zhenjia to Executive Director, Highest-Ranking Taiwanese Executive</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia announced today that Dai Zhenjia, who is currently a managing director, has been promoted to executive director. This makes him the highest-ranking Taiwanese executive in the Nichia Group. Dai Zhenjia is now the third most powerful person in Taiwan Nichia, after the president and vice president.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia explained in a press release that an executive director holds an important position in Japanese companies. This role is only below the president and vice president. An executive director is in charge of the main business operations and strategic decisions. They also play a key part in board meetings and regular meetings. This promotion shows that Nichia highly values Dai Zhenjia's leadership and contributions over many years.</p>
            <p>Besides Nichia, Dai Zhenjia also works as the Vice Chairman for Taiwan Asia Semiconductor, a company owned by Nichia. This shows that he is helping to connect different parts of the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>Lee Kuo-kuang, the chairman of Taiwan Asia Semiconductor, said that it is very important for a Taiwanese senior manager to become an executive director in a Japanese company. This shows that Taiwanese professionals are very skilled and can compete well in global companies. It also means that Taiwan and Japan have stronger economic ties and trust each other more.</p>
            <p>An "executive director" is similar to an executive director in Taiwanese companies. In Japanese companies, this role often helps the president and manages all company matters. This is a very important job.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Woman Beat Partner and Burned Her Face to Death; Also Abused Her 4 Years Ago</h1>
            <p>In February this year, a woman named Luo in New Taipei City used a pool cue to hit her girlfriend's head and a lighter to burn her face. This caused her girlfriend to die. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged Luo with causing death by injury. Luo admitted to all charges in court. It was found that Luo had also hurt her girlfriend four years ago. This was not the first time she was violent.</p>
            <p>Luo, who is 34 years old, and Qiu were partners. They lived together in a rented apartment in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City. Around 1 AM on February 4th this year, Luo first pushed Qiu down with her hands, causing Qiu's head to hit the ground. After Qiu lost consciousness, Luo moved her to the bed, and Qiu's head hit something again.</p>
            <p>Luo also used a pool cue to hit Qiu's head and body. Then, she used a lighter to light tissues and other things that burn easily. She burned Qiu's face, head, and shoulders. This caused a lot of bleeding at the back of Qiu's head, a broken bone at the back of her skull, and eventually brain damage, leading to her death.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office charged Luo with causing death by injury. Yesterday, the New Taipei District Court held a hearing. Luo admitted to all the bad things she did.</p>
            <p>Also, it was found that Luo had hurt Qiu many years ago. In February 2021, they argued. Luo used a wine bottle and an ashtray to hit Qiu. She also grabbed Qiu's head and hit it against a wall. This caused injuries to Qiu's head. At that time, the prosecutors charged Luo with assault, but the case was dropped after they reached an agreement.</p>
