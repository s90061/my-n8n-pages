            <h1>China: Vice Premier He Lifeng to Sweden for US Economic and Trade Talks from July 27-30</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced this afternoon that Vice Premier He Lifeng will travel to Sweden from July 27 to 30. He will hold economic and trade talks with the United States. This is to continue discussions about "trade problems they both care about."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce also said that China and the US will follow the important agreement made by their presidents (China's President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump) in a phone call on June 5. They will use the US-China economic and trade talks to continue discussions. They will do this based on ideas of respect for each other, living together peacefully, and helping each other win.</p>
            <p>On July 22, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business that he would have the third round of high-level talks with Chinese officials in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, on July 28 and 29. The goal is to arrange a possible delay for a deadline and to talk about making trade between the two countries more balanced.</p>
            <p>In May, the United States and China had talks in Geneva. They agreed to greatly lower high taxes on goods for 90 days. This break in the trade conflict will end on August 12.</p>

            <h1>Responding to Questions, China: Yarlung Tsangpo River Project is 'Within Our Country's Rights'</h1>
            <p>China is building a power plant project using water on the lower Yarlung Tsangpo River. This has caused worries and criticism from India and Bangladesh, which are downstream. Today, Guo Jiaqun, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said that this project is "within China's country rights." He also said it will not harm the areas downstream. China has talked with the countries downstream and is working with them on water flow and flood control.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Foreign Ministry held a regular press conference this afternoon. According to CCTV news, Guo Jiaqun said these things when asked by foreign media.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiaqun stated that building the power plant on the lower Yarlung Tsangpo River is "within China's country rights." Its purpose is to quickly develop clean energy, greatly improve the lives of local people, and actively respond to climate change. He said that China "always acts very responsibly" when developing rivers that cross borders. China also has a lot of experience building power plants that use water.</p>
            <p>He claimed that the planning, design, and building of this project "strictly follow China's highest rules for this kind of work." They are doing all parts of the project, caring for the environment, avoiding many important nature areas that are sensitive, and keeping the natural environment as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiaqun said that the Yarlung Tsangpo River power plant project will help prevent and reduce disasters for the whole river area. It will not cause bad effects on the areas downstream. China has worked with the countries downstream by giving information about water levels and helping with flood control. They have also talked about this project when needed. China will continue to work more closely with downstream countries to "benefit the people in the river area."</p>
            <p>BBC and other news groups reported that India and Bangladesh, which are downstream from the Yarlung Tsangpo River, are worried about China's power plant project. They are concerned that it will harm different kinds of animals and plants, and people's ways of making a living. Experts and officials from India have warned that the dam from this project will let China control or change the river's path.</p>

            <h1>2026 Kinmen Marathon Route Changed, Flatter Course to Help Achieve Better Times</h1>
            <p>The 2026 Kinmen Marathon will happen next year on January 24 and 25. The running path has been changed to be flatter, which will help runners get better times. People from Kinmen can sign up now. All other runners can sign up starting on July 28.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen County Government held a press conference this afternoon to share information about the event. Li Wen-liang, the Vice County Mayor of Kinmen, and Sun Li-chi, the head of the Education Department, were there.</p>
            <p>Li Wen-liang told reporters that the new path still has a military feel. It also brings back the Boyu Road part that many runners liked. Besides welcoming runners who have joined before, the Kinmen Marathon also has special numbers for first-time runners and unique souvenir alcohol. He warmly asked runners who have not yet done the Kinmen Marathon to join.</p>
            <p>Regarding the problem of plane tickets being hard to get, Li Wen-liang said that if runners sign up for the Kinmen Marathon but cannot book a flight right away, they can put their names on a waiting list. This will show how many flights are needed. The county government will also talk with airlines about using bigger planes and adding more flights. He told runners not to worry if they cannot book a flight at first.</p>
            <p>When asked if runners from mainland China would join, Li Wen-liang said they are welcome. The county government also plans to invite runners and running groups from Fujian. Last year, about 1,000 runners from mainland China joined. They hope to get even more runners this time.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen County Government Education Department said in a news release that the full marathon path has been changed a little. It will start from the area in front of the Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center, run towards the southwest of Kinmen, and then go around the island counter-clockwise. It will pass through Qionglin Village, Ci Lake, along Boyu Road, the military tunnel area on Ring Island South Road, and the natural areas around Double Carp Lake and Ci Lake, before coming back to the start and finish line.</p>
            <p>The Education Department said that the new, flatter parts of the path will help runners get better times. Also, the time limit for the full marathon has changed from 7 hours to 6.5 hours. This still makes it easy for first-time marathon runners, but also encourages experienced runners to try to get their personal best times.</p>
            <p>For the 2026 Kinmen Marathon, people from Kinmen could sign up from 6 PM this afternoon. Sign-ups for all other runners will open on July 28. Sign-ups for competitive groups will open at 3 PM, and for leisure groups at 6 PM. The 2026 Kinmen Marathon event on January 24 is for the health and leisure group, starting at Jincheng Sports Field. The competitive group event is on January 25, starting in front of the Kinmen-Matsu Joint Services Center.</p>
