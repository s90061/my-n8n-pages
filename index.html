            <h1>Spain's Wildfires Out of Control: Heavy Spring Rains and Empty Farms Make Them Worse</h1>
            <p>Spain is having many wildfires in August. This year, about 400,000 hectares of land have burned. This is the worst year since records began. News reports say that very hot weather and dry conditions cause fires. Also, a lot of rain in spring made many plants grow. Then, old farms were not used anymore, so there were no fire breaks. All these things together made the fires very hard to stop.</p>
            <p>The Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s reported that bad wildfires in northwest Spain lasted for three weeks. Now the very hot weather is gone. Firefighters and soldiers are still working hard. Only two big fires in LeÃ³n province (in the Castilla y LeÃ³n area) are still burning out of control. Other fires are now under control.</p>
            <p>But this year's wildfires have caused a lot of sadness for many people in Spain.</p>
            <p>The European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) says that Spain has lost about 400,000 hectares of land to wildfires this year. This is the worst fire season since 2006. So far, four people have died, and more than 35,000 people had to leave their homes.</p>
            <p>The Spanish TV and radio company (RTVE) looked at why this year's fire season was so bad. They found that many things worked together to make the fires spread very quickly and be almost impossible to stop.</p>
            <p>First, Spain had unusually strong heat in August. From August 3rd to 18th, there were 16 days of extremely hot weather. This was a new record. The average temperature was 4.6 degrees Celsius higher than usual. This meant that half of the country was at high risk of fire.</p>
            <p>VÃ­ctor Resco de Dios, a professor and fire expert from the University of Lleida in Spain, said that the long period of unusual heat caused a "sudden drought." The air became very dry, which made plants take more water from the ground. Plants released more water into the air. This made the soil dry up fast and the plants become very dry quickly. Dry plants burn easily.</p>
            <p>Also, Spain had a lot of rain in spring this year. This caused many plants to grow. When these plants dried out because of the sudden drought, they became fuel for fires. Strong winds and land that helps fires spread also made the wildfires very dangerous.</p>
            <p>Climate change and global warming are part of the problem. But changes in Spain's landscape and how land is used are also big reasons why fires are bigger and stronger.</p>
            <p>VÃ­ctor FernÃ¡ndez-GarcÃ­a, a researcher from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland who studies nature and fires, said that since the 1960s, more people have moved to cities in Spain. This left many villages empty. Farms were not used, and fewer animals were raised. These empty farms and pastures used to stop fires naturally. Now, large forests cover these areas. This gives wildfires a lot of continuous fuel.</p>
            <p>Experts warn that the current bad fires are just a "preview." Wildfire seasons will happen more often and be much worse in the future. Climate change makes heatwaves stronger. Also, there is more dry material in mountain areas that can burn. Fires can burn much larger areas in less time, and they are harder to put out.</p>
            <p>Experts suggest that the Spanish government should not spend so much money on fire planes and equipment. Instead, they should focus on agricultural and forest plans to stop fires before they start. By managing the land and natural areas well, they can create natural fire breaks and stop too much fuel from building up. They say that "the time when wildfires could be easily put out is over."</p>

            <h1>Ukraine Uses Cheap Drones to Destroy Two Important Bridges in Russia</h1>
            <p>Ukraine says its army used cheap drones to attack many mines and weapons hidden by Russian soldiers under bridges. They successfully blew up two important bridges on Russia's border. These drones cost between 600 and 725 US dollars (about NT$22,178).</p>
            <p>CNN reported that the Ukrainian army said Russian troops often used these two bridges near Kharkiv, Ukraine, on the Russian side of the border to move supplies.</p>
            <p>These bridges were very important. Russian soldiers had placed mines under them. If Ukrainian soldiers came close, the Russian army could blow up the bridges to stop them.</p>
            <p>The 58th Independent Motorized Infantry Brigade of Ukraine, who did this mission, told CNN that they saw unusual activity near the bridges. So, they decided to watch the bridges more closely.</p>
            <p>A person from the brigade told CNN: "It was clear something was happening there. We couldn't send a normal drone under the bridge to check because the signal would be lost. So, we sent a first-person view drone with special fiber optic equipment."</p>
            <p>The video showed that when the drone got close to the bridge, it found many anti-tank mines and other weapons piled up under it. A piece of fabric, possibly used to hide them, was lying nearby. The representative said, "After we saw the mines, we attacked."</p>
            <p>After the drone attacked the mines and weapons, the video stopped. Another camera, filming from a bit further away, showed a big explosion. CNN confirmed that the bridge in the video was in Belgorod, southern Russia, near the Ukrainian border.</p>
            <p>The representative said, "Then we decided to check another Russian bridge. We found mines there too, so we attacked it. We saw a chance and we used it."</p>
            <p>Russia has not said anything about the bridge attacks.</p>
            <p>The 58th Independent Motorized Infantry Brigade told CNN that the drones used in this attack each cost between 25,000 and 30,000 Ukrainian Hryvnia, which is about 600 to 725 US dollars.</p>
