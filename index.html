            <h1>US Congressional Report: Quiet US-Taiwan Military Cooperation Appears to be Expanding</h1>
            <p>A report released by the US Congress in late July talks about the military aid given to Taiwan in recent years. The report says that military cooperation between the US and Taiwan, including training in both countries, seems to be increasing. This is happening even though it is mostly not open to the public. Taiwan joined the US "International Military Education and Training" (IMET) program in 2023. This helps the two militaries work together better.</p>
            <p>The report, called "Taiwan: Defense and Military Issues," explains that selling weapons to Taiwan has always been the clearest way the US helps Taiwan's defense. Most of these sales happen through the "Foreign Military Sales" (FMS) system.</p>
            <p>From 2015 to 2025, the US government told Congress about more than 28 billion US dollars (about 837.2 billion New Taiwan dollars) in FMS sales to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The report also points out that besides the "Foreign Military Sales" program, the 117th Congress (from January 2021 to January 2023) passed the "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act." This law allows new ways to provide weapons to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act" was the first time the "Presidential Drawdown Authority" (PDA) was used for Taiwan. This authority lets the US Department of Defense directly give defense items and services to Taiwan from its own supplies. This was done because Congress was worried that FMS deliveries were taking too long.</p>
            <p>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) said that since the "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act" started, the US government has announced three PDA plans for Taiwan, totaling 1.5 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>This law also introduced "Foreign Military Financing" (FMF) for Taiwan for the first time. This money can be used as loans or grants to buy US weapons. Since then, Congress has also given money for military aid to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Regarding US-Taiwan security cooperation, the report states that it seems to be growing. It also mentions Taiwan's involvement in the "International Military Education and Training" (IMET) program. The US government started IMET with Taiwan based on the budget law for the 2023 financial year. This is to improve how well the two militaries can work together and act jointly.</p>
            <p>There is not much public information about Taiwan's part in IMET. In 2023, Mira Resnick, who was a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told Congress that Taiwan joining IMET would allow it to get large discounts in the US Department of Defense's training system.</p>
            <p>She said, "We believe that providing IMET will save Taiwan millions of dollars each year. This money can then be used again and invested in its defense budget."</p>
            <p>Thomas Shattuck, an American expert who has studied Taiwan and relations across the Taiwan Strait for a long time, wrote in an article last year on the Global Taiwan Institute (GTI) website that the IMET program lets Taiwanese military officers train in the US with military members from other countries.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has started several actions to make its military more ready and has increased its defense budget. The US Congressional Research Service estimates that Taiwan's defense budget grew by almost 5% each year from 2019 to 2023. In 2024, Taiwan spent about 2.5% of its total economic output (GDP) on defense. Taiwan's president has also said he plans to increase military spending to more than 3% of GDP this year.</p>
            <p>The report also points out that Taiwan faces problems at home in reaching its defense goals. Lawmakers have different ideas on the best way to stop China from using military force. Although Taiwan's two main political parties say they support spending more on defense, the arguments between the government and the Legislative Yuan (which is controlled by opposition parties) over the budget this year have made some people worry if Taiwan can secure enough money for defense.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the Taiwanese military has difficulty finding, training, and keeping soldiers. Some experts also think that civilian defense is not prepared enough. Essential services like energy, food, water, communication, and other vital infrastructure are also easy to damage from outside attacks.</p>
            <p>The report concludes by saying, "At a societal level, it is currently unclear what costs for economic safety, personal safety, and life the people of Taiwan are willing or able to accept if there is a war across the Taiwan Strait."</p>

            <h1>Brazil's President Denies Provoking US, Continues to Seek Non-Dollar Trade Solutions</h1>
            <p>On July 30, US President Trump announced that he would put a 50% import tax on about 36% of goods Brazil sends to other countries. Yesterday, Brazilian President Lula said that Brazil will continue to look for other ways to trade with other countries without using the US dollar.</p>
            <p>Brazil's news agency, AgÃªncia Brasil, reported that Lula spoke at a Workers' Party meeting in BrasÃ­lia yesterday about the US tariffs. He said Brazil needs to create a different currency for trading with other countries, and Brazil does not need to be controlled by the US dollar.</p>
            <p>Even though the US did not directly say that replacing the dollar in global trade was a reason for taxing Brazil, experts believe this idea, which was discussed within the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), was one of the reasons behind Trump's decision to add tariffs.</p>
            <p>The US dollar is used as an international currency, which gives the US an advantage in the world economy. During the BRICS summit held in Rio de Janeiro on July 6 and 7, Trump criticized the group. He also threatened to take action against countries that try to trade without using the dollar.</p>
            <p>Lula made it clear that Brazil does not want to anger the US, but Brazil must protect its own important interests. He said Brazil is not a small country and wants to negotiate as equals.</p>
            <p>Lula stated that the US is a very powerful country, the most aggressive country in the world, and also has the most advanced technology and the largest economy. However, Brazil also wants to be respected and will not accept being taxed for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Lula also mentioned that the US criticized former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's failed attempt to take power by force. This was one of the reasons Trump decided to put tariffs on Brazil.</p>
            <p>After the 50% tax on Brazil was announced, the US Treasury Department got in touch with the Brazilian government to start talks. On August 1, Trump said he was ready to talk with Lula.</p>
            <p>Brazil's Minister of Economy, Fernando Haddad, said that the Brazilian government will announce a series of measures in the coming days. These measures will provide financial help to Brazilian businesses affected by Trump's tariffs.</p>

            <h1>Tariffs Impact Diners, Silicon Valley Taiwanese Supermarket Owner Attracts Customers Against the Trend</h1>
            <p>As new US tariffs begin, American shoppers are facing higher prices again. Hu Li-min, an honorary leader of the Global Jade Mountain Technology Association and a Taiwanese businessman with many companies in the US, said in an interview that his high-end supermarket is getting more customers. This is because people in Silicon Valley are changing how they eat and are eating out less often.</p>
            <p>With the new tariffs, prices in the San Francisco Bay Area are starting to go up. This means shoppers are facing another round of higher prices.</p>
            <p>However, a recent study by the San Francisco Chronicle about supermarkets found that most prices have not changed a lot yet. The only exception is for goods that are fully imported, like coffee, which have become more expensive.</p>
            <p>Hu Li-min told the Central News Agency that his fancy restaurants might feel the effects more. But supermarkets are less affected by rising prices. Especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, many young people in Silicon Valley prefer foods that are already partly prepared. For example, they buy ready-made meals to heat at home, and they go to restaurants less often.</p>
            <p>People in Silicon Valley have a lot of money to spend. He said that if supermarket products are good quality, many people will still buy them even if they cost a little more.</p>
            <p>Also, supermarkets usually set prices by adding a set percentage to the cost of the goods they buy. For example, if they sell one pound of fish and add 10% to the cost, if the cost is $5, they sell it for $5.50, making $0.50 profit. If the cost goes up to $10, they adjust the selling price to $11, and then their profit is $1. So, they can actually make more profit.</p>
            <p>Therefore, since people still need to eat, things like rising prices and tariffs actually make supermarket businesses better.</p>
            <p>Hu Li-min has invested in a Japanese supermarket. Right now, there is only one store in Fremont, a city where many Taiwanese people live. Last year, the store made over $20 million in sales. He plans to open three more new stores in the Bay Area by the end of this year and next year.</p>
            <p>Because TSMC built a new factory in Arizona, more Chinese people have moved there. Businesses related to this have also reached out to Hu Li-min, hoping to work together.</p>
            <p>Hu Li-min said that tariffs only affected him when he was buying new equipment for the new store, like freezers. At that time, imported equipment became more expensive, and shipping costs went up. This caused more financial pressure. Now, things are stable, but he will keep watching for changes in government policies.</p>
            <p>When talking about Taiwan getting a temporary 20% tariff, Hu Li-min said the most important effect is not the number itself. Instead, it is the difference in tax rates compared to Japan and South Korea. This makes traditional industries in Taiwan, which were already weaker, less able to compete on price.</p>
            <p>Taiwan and the US are still discussing this. Hu Li-min believes that the US is the biggest market, Taiwan sells much more to the US than it buys, and the US wants Taiwan's computer chips. These factors make the talks more difficult for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He believes that if Taiwan gets a lower tax rate, looking at other countries' current tariffs, Taiwan's rate might be 15% or possibly 19%. President Trump thinks like a businessman, but his time in office is limited. Many countries understand this situation, so they choose to invest more. Perhaps they will invest in stages over a longer period. This might lower the risk of facing high tariffs.</p>
