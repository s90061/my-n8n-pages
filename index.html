            <h1>Taipei Nangang Sports Center Reopens with AI Robot Answering Questions</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Sports Department announced today that the Nangang Sports Center has reopened. It is the fourth sports center in Taipei. After being closed for six months for repairs, it officially opened again on September 3rd. Today, they had an opening party. The sports fields are better now, and the swimming pool has a new system to stop people from drowning. Also, an AI robot can answer your questions.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Sports Department held a celebration for the Nangang Sports Center reopening. It took place on the basketball court on the third floor. Lee Yi-po, a former member of the boy band TOP1, was the host. A group called "Vigorous Cool" performed a street dance and basketball show. There were also booths for people to enjoy.</p>
            <p>The Sports Department said that the Nangang Sports Center was closed in March for six months of repairs. From August 27th to September 2nd, over one thousand people tried it during a 7-day test opening. It officially opened on September 3rd, and today's event was a celebration.</p>
            <p>After the repairs, everything got better, both the computer systems and the equipment. The Sports Department said that for computer systems, there is now a special area with an AI robot. This robot can answer questions about the center, how much tickets cost, and news about events. You can also buy tickets, sign up for classes, and book sports areas faster at a self-service machine near the entrance. You can also use U-Sport exercise money and get U-coins there, which makes things easy.</p>
            <p>For the equipment, the Sports Department said the swimming pool now has an AI system to prevent drowning. It uses a new salt system to clean the water instead of chlorine. This means the pool will not smell strongly of chlorine, and people will be less likely to have allergies. New classrooms have new floors and air conditioners.</p>
            <p>The basketball court has a new wooden floor. The badminton courts have special mats approved by the BWF. The gym has new exercise machines and mats. The whole building uses UV light and ozone to clean the air, and it has good ventilation to keep the air fresh.</p>
            <p>For sports classes, they have added new Pilates classes that use machines. The shooting area has new electronic targets. All the showers and toilets in the center are also new. This makes the sports center a good, safe place with many different ways to exercise.</p>

            <h1>Trump Wants to Reclaim US Base in Afghanistan, Taliban Official Says: Not an Inch</h1>
            <p>(Kabul, September 21, CNA) Former US President Trump has said he wants to take back the Bagram air base in Afghanistan. Today, an official from the Taliban government in Afghanistan said that Afghanistan will not give up any land. They will not make a deal with the United States about it.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that Bagram air base is the biggest air base in Afghanistan. It is north of Kabul, the capital city. For twenty years, the US used this base for its actions against the Taliban. But the US army left the base four years ago.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," that the US built Bagram air base. He said if Afghanistan does not give it back, something bad will happen. Trump also told reporters that the US is talking with Afghanistan about this.</p>
            <p>Fasihuddin Fitrat, who is in charge of the Afghan army, said today, "Someone recently said that they have begun talks with Afghanistan to get the Bagram air base back."</p>
            <p>Fitrat also said, "It is not possible to agree to give up even a tiny piece of Afghan land. We do not need an agreement."</p>

            <h1>To Save Against Low Birth Rate, Chen Shih-chung Plans to Promote Temporary Childcare and "Three-in-One" Child-Rearing Facilities</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 21, CNA) Chen Shih-chung, a minister in the government, said today that Taiwan needs to help with the low birth rate. He plans to offer "temporary childcare" for children under 12 years old. He also wants to create "three-in-one" places for children. These places will have an infant care center, a kindergarten, and a primary school all together. This should make it easier for parents.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Taiwan had 213,000 baby births. This number has gone down every year since then. Last year, there were only 134,000 births, and the number is still dropping this year. The government recently approved three plans to help with pregnancy. These include 100,000 New Taiwan dollars for having a baby, money for IVF treatment, and money to help save eggs or sperm for future use.</p>
            <p>Today, Chen Shih-chung went to a party for the Taiwan Medical Reform Foundation's 25th birthday. After the party, reporters asked him if the "Good Pregnancy" plans would help with the low birth rate, which is a big problem for the country. He said that the most important thing now is to stop the number of births from falling. After that, the government will work on better childcare, housing, and workplaces that support families. This will slowly help Taiwan's birth rate go up again.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung talked about new plans for homes and rent money. For example, social housing will be available for up to 12 years, and rental laws will change. These plans are to help young married couples have a stable home. The next important step is to make childcare better. The government will start offering "temporary childcare" services. This is very important for families where both parents work.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung explained that sometimes parents have sudden things they need to do. They need a safe place for their children. The government will combine ideas from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Because children under 12 cannot be alone at home, this temporary childcare will be for children from birth to 12 years old. This will help parents feel less worried.</p>
            <p>Also, the government will start "three-in-one" childcare places. Chen Shih-chung said they want to put baby care centers, kindergartens, and primary schools all in one place. For example, a primary school could have places for babies and young children inside it.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-chung said that with these "three-in-one" places, parents with two or three children will not have to go to many different places to pick them up. First, they will start these services in areas that do not have enough childcare. Slowly, they will make childcare services for all children from birth to 12 years old better and easier to use.</p>
