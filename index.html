            <h1>GCTF Workshop in Lithuania Focuses on Stronger Supply Chains</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced that the Taiwan Representative Office in Lithuania, together with the US Embassy in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a non-governmental organization (NGO), held a workshop. This workshop, part of the "Global Cooperation and Training Framework" (GCTF), took place in Lithuania from September 4 to 5. It focused on making supply chains stronger. This event shows that Taiwan wants to keep helping other countries and is actively doing so.</p>
            <p>A press release from MOFA explained that the Taiwan Representative Office in Lithuania worked with the US Embassy in Lithuania, the Lithuanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and an NGO called "Civic Resilience Initiative" (CRI). They held the GCTF workshop in Vilnius, the capital city of Lithuania. The main topic was how to make supply chains more able to handle problems.</p>
            <p>People from governments, companies, and universities from Taiwan, Lithuania, the United States, the Republic of Palau, and Japan were invited to the event. They talked about three main subjects: "Thinking Again About Supply Chains," "New Ideas and Being Flexible," and "Working Together: Public and Private Sectors." Jennifer Olegeriil, who is the Minister of Justice of the Republic of Palau, shared Palau's experiences in dealing with economic pressure. Li Chun, Taiwan's Representative to the European Union and Belgium, also gave a speech online. He talked about how economies can stay strong when there are political problems in the world.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that during the opening of the workshop, Wang Hsueh-hong, Taiwan's Representative in Lithuania, spoke. She said that democratic countries are now facing economic pressure from countries that do not have free elections. Taiwan wants to share its experiences with other countries. The goal is to build supply chains that are better able to cope with difficulties together. The US Ambassador to Lithuania, Kara McDonald, the Lithuanian Deputy Foreign Minister, Julius Praneviƒçius, and the chairman of CRI, Tomas Kazulƒónas, also gave speeches. They all said that democratic countries should work together more closely to make supply chains safer.</p>
            <p>MOFA also said that nearly 110 people came to this event. These people were from different governments, businesses, and universities in many countries. This showed that many countries think it is very important to have strong supply chains. The GCTF started in 2015. Since then, it has become an important way for countries to build up their skills together. This was the second time a GCTF event was held outside of Taiwan in Lithuania. It shows Taiwan's strong wish and actions to keep helping the international community.</p>

            <h1>Japan and Australia Confirm Importance of Peace in Taiwan Strait; Taiwan's Foreign Minister Welcomes This</h1>
            <p>Japan and Australia had a "2+2" meeting in Tokyo yesterday. The foreign and defense ministers from both countries were there. After the meeting, they put out a joint statement. In this statement, they again said that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important. Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu (Lin Chia-lung), said today that he is thankful for and welcomes the fact that Japan and Australia continue to care about peace in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The "2+2" talks between Japan and Australia, where foreign and defense ministers meet, happened in Tokyo yesterday. From Japan, the Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and the Defense Minister Gen Nakatani attended. From Australia, the Foreign Minister Penny Wong and the Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles were present.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) released a press statement today. It said that the joint statement after the meeting again stated that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important for the safety and success of the whole world. The statement also asked for the issues between Taiwan and China to be solved peacefully through talks. The joint statement also showed strong worry about China's growing military actions in the East China Sea, the South China Sea, and the areas of air and sea around Japan. It strongly disagreed with any actions that try to change the current situation using force or threats. Both Japan and Australia also said they are very worried about China and Russia working more closely in the military to help Russia's attack on Ukraine.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that countries with authoritarian governments are currently trying to expand their power. This is challenging the global system that follows rules. This has made the world unstable. Taiwan is a responsible member of the Indo-Pacific region. It will continue to work more closely with partners who share similar ideas, such as Japan and Australia. Together, they will protect important values like freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. They will help keep peace, stability, and wealth in the Taiwan Strait and around the world.</p>
