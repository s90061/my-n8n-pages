            <h1>Yang Yi-chan, nominated for Golden Bell Best Supporting Actor, keeps his late sister's charm as a lucky item.</h1>
            <p>Actor Yang Yi-chan is nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the Golden Bell Awards for his role in "The Outsider." He shared that his lucky item is a protective charm his older sister left him before she passed away. Meanwhile, Janine Chang, who is nominated for Best Actress, said that for her role as a doctor again, a needle holder given to her by a doctor is her lucky item.</p>
            <p>Yang Yi-chan, Janine Chang, Bao Hua (Tsai Ken-yen), David Huang, and Tang Sheng-jung, the producer of "The Outsider," attended a Golden Bell tea party hosted by PTS (Public Television Service) today. Yang Yi-chan is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this show. He said that his lucky charm is a traditional protective charm his sister left him. He added, "I carry it with me all the time, except when I'm filming. It's simple, but it means a lot to me."</p>
            <p>Yang Yi-chan is attending the Golden Bell Awards again after 10 years. He said, "I feel calm about winning. I think about where my passion was 10 years ago. Now, my mind and body are more balanced. I am happier when I can tell a story that brings up important topics." He also recently went to Hualien to help as a "shovel hero" and shared that he felt very emotional and cried often when he saw the situation there. He hopes to help Hualien with all his strength.</p>
            <p>Janine Chang said this is her first time being nominated for a Golden Bell Award. She explained, "I only walked the red carpet for 'Black & White' in 2009. I feel like the Golden Bell Awards are very far from me, they didn't even ask me to present an award."</p>
            <p>Janine Chang, who is nominated for Best Actress, said she is very happy and thinks her competitors are very strong. She said she does not care too much about winning or losing, but she still hopes to go on stage. She playfully said, "I can give up being the most beautiful on the red carpet; I just want to go on stage (to receive the award)."</p>
            <p>In the show, Janine Chang plays a doctor again. She shared that her lucky item is a "needle holder" a doctor gave her. Bao Hua, who is also nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, has a ring her daughter made for her as a lucky item. She said, "When I received it, I felt very warm and loved."</p>
            <p>Singer David Huang is nominated for Best Newcomer for his first acting role. He jokingly said he didn't want to act at first. His girlfriend convinced him to take the role after leaving home five times. He said, "I never thought I would be here. My world is usually music. But this acting experience gave me many new experiences and lessons. Finding out about the nomination on my birthday was truly the best birthday gift."</p>

            <h1>Football Association's Broadcasting Fees Overspent by 200%, No Player Sign-off Sheets for Equipment Purchases</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Audit reported today on how government money given to the Football Association was used. The report showed that the Football Association spent 200% more than planned on broadcasting international games in 2023. Also, for two years in a row, the Association bought equipment with government money, but the number of people who signed for it was less than the approved number, or they didn't provide proper sign-off sheets from the players. The government should improve how it checks and approves these funds.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's men's national football team will not play in the 2027 Asian Cup finals. Many mistakes in managing the Football Association have come to light. The team captain, Chen Po-liang, even said that "Taiwanese people bully Taiwanese people." This has made many people pay attention.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Audit released reports. These reports are about the Ministry of Education's Sports Administration supervising the National Sports Training Center (which is a government organization) and how it gives money to sports groups. They also looked at whether the Football Association spent the money from the Sports Administration correctly.</p>
            <p>The report first pointed out that the Football Association received money from the Sports Administration to pay for plane tickets and broadcasting. The budget for these purchases did not have detailed price analysis. This caused the prices in the budget to be different from market prices. The cost of plane tickets was also clearly higher than what other sports associations paid during the same time. The review decided to give the contracts to companies with higher prices. This was not fair or just.</p>
            <p>The report explained that for the same project, money was given for broadcasting and marketing. This was not done according to the Government Procurement Act. They either went directly to one company for the purchases or used two different companies that seemed connected in an unusual way. The Ministry of Audit sent this information to the investigation agency and the Control Yuan on March 17 this year, as required by law.</p>
            <p>In addition, the report also talked about problems with how the Sports Administration checked the money given to the Football Association. First, the Football Association's broadcasting costs for five projects in 2023, including the "2023 International Men's Football Invitational: Chinese Taipei vs. Thailand," were much higher than planned. The actual costs were between NT$700,000 and NT$800,000 more than the expected amount for each project. This means they overspent by 140% to 200%.</p>
            <p>The report pointed out that for example, when the Football Association organized the "2023 International Men's Football Invitational: Chinese Taipei vs. Thailand," the budget for broadcasting was NT$500,000. They planned to broadcast on TV and online during popular times, using 6 cameras and 4K quality, with a commentator and an analyst. However, when they finished paying, the broadcasting cost went up to NT$1,200,000.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that the Sports Administration explained this was because more broadcasting channels were used than planned. But the original budget of NT$500,000 did not state the number of broadcasting channels. When the costs were settled, there was no explanation for the difference in broadcasting. The Sports Administration simply agreed to pay the full amount based on the statement that said "increased broadcasting channels." The Ministry of Audit sent a letter to the Sports Administration on March 12 this year, asking them to review and improve how they check and approve applications for and final reports of government funds.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the report also showed that in 2023, the National Sports Training Center gave money to the Football Association for the "2022 Hangzhou Asian Games and 2024 Paris Olympics" women's football training program. They approved over NT$760,000 for yearly disposable equipment. Out of this, NT$500,000 was for uniforms (equipment), calculated for 50 people, with NT$10,000 per person.</p>
            <p>The report stated that the Football Association bought a total of 454 items, including training shirts and shorts, warm-up suits, jackets, backpacks, and football socks. The total cost was NT$542,080 (NT$490,000 from the government grant and NT$52,080 from their own money). When the Football Association finished reporting its expenses, the only sign-off sheet for uniforms (equipment) was from the "2024 Paris Olympic Qualification Round One" event in Lebanon in March 2023. Only 34 people signed, which is less than the approved 50 people. Also, the sign-off sheet did not list the specific items or quantities received. This means it was not clear what equipment was given out. However, the National Sports Training Center still approved the expenses.</p>
            <p>In addition, the report mentioned that in 2024, the National Sports Training Center gave money to the Football Association for the "2026 20th Nagoya Asian Games" women's football training program. They approved over NT$930,000 for yearly disposable equipment. Out of this, NT$600,000 was for uniforms (equipment). NT$500,000 for competition and team uniforms was calculated in the same way as in 2023. Another NT$100,000 was for training vests and training clothes for new players and to replace damaged items. The Football Association bought 50 sets of competition and team uniforms, and 10 sets of training vests and training clothes.</p>
            <p>The report pointed out that when the Football Association completed its financial report, it only provided an application form signed by the head coach. It did not provide player sign-off sheets as required. This means it was not clear what equipment was given out to players. However, the National Sports Training Center still approved the expenses.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Audit stressed that the Sports Administration should make sure the National Sports Training Center checks how the Football Association's purchased uniforms and equipment are actually used. They should also handle these matters correctly according to the rules.</p>

            <h1>Tamsui Shalun Beach Might Reopen for Wading; New Taipei City Says Safety Comes First</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City's Tamsui Shalun sea area has finished its report on sea conditions. The report still says the sea should not be fully open, but it suggests opening the beach and shallow water for people to wade in. New Taipei City Deputy Mayor Chu Ti-chih said that if they open it, "safety" will be the most important thing.</p>
            <p>Today, the New Taipei City Council discussed city matters. Chen Wei-chieh, a Kuomintang council member, asked about the Tamsui Shalun Cultural and Creative Park and opening the Shalun beach. Sheng Hsiao-jung, the director of the Economic Development Department, said that the Cultural and Creative Park is about 91.12% finished. Inside decoration is happening now, and it should be finished on time.</p>
            <p>Yang Tsung-min, the director of the Tourism and Travel Department, said that National Taiwan Ocean University was asked to study the sea conditions in the Tamsui Shalun area. The final report was just completed yesterday. The land area is considered safe, and the beach might be opened. However, a decision will be made after a water safety meeting at the end of the year. If they decide to open it, things like maintenance and management will need to be discussed with Tamsui District Office and other groups.</p>
            <p>Chu Ti-chih said that whether it's the Cultural and Creative Park or Shalun Beach, if they are opened, "safety" must come first. But the sea condition studies show strong currents that pull away from the shore at all times of the year. So, there is still some danger.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei-chieh said that Shalun Beach has been closed for many years because it was called a dangerous area. People in the local area have different opinions on whether to open it. He said that if safety cannot be guaranteed, it should not be opened carelessly.</p>
            <p>Cheng Yu-en, a Democratic Progressive Party council member, also posted on Facebook. She said that Shalun is not just Tamsui's coastline, but also a place of many youthful memories for many people. If it is to be opened safely and securely in the future, they need to clearly mark safe water areas, have more staff present on weekdays and weekends, and raise people's awareness of water safety through activities and education. This way, the beach can truly become a place where citizens can "get close to the sea and play in the water."</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department said that based on the final report about sea conditions, they suggest opening the land area of Shalun for activities like horseback riding, sand sliding, and taking wedding photos. They also suggest allowing wading in the safe area near the shore (with water depth not going over the knees). However, because the currents in the Shalun sea area are too fast during tides all year round and flow out to sea, and there are rip currents, different water activities have medium to high risks. So, they still suggest not opening the water for activities.</p>
