A Taipower worker in Chiayi, Mr. Guo Zhimao, has been working long hours to fix power outages after Typhoon Danas. His two young children missed him greatly. So, yesterday, their mother took them to see their father at the repair site in Liujiao Township. This short visit made Mr. Guo feel much better and he smiled.

As of yesterday evening, 98.6% of homes in Chiayi affected by the typhoon have their power back. However, about 3,586 homes are still without electricity, mainly in the coastal areas where the damage was worst. Taipower teams are working hard, day and night, to fix all the problems.

**French Foreign Affairs Committee Vice Chairman: Taiwan is a Symbol of World Freedom; I Will Support Taiwan My Whole Life**

Mr. Olivier Cadic, the Vice Chairman of the French Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, said in an interview that the biggest problem for France to support Taiwan is that there are many different opinions within France. However, many lawmakers are interested in Taiwan. He believes Taiwan is a symbol of freedom for the world and he will support Taiwan his entire life.

Mr. Cadic often speaks up for Taiwan in the French Senate and other groups. He said that China's power might not be real because it is based on fear, not on people's support. He thinks Taiwan is stronger than it looks. He believes other countries should work together to tell China that attacking Taiwan would be too costly and not worth it.

Mr. Cadic also said that Taiwan is a real democracy. He sees that even with different political ideas, all Taiwanese people want to decide their own future. He wants Taiwanese democrats to know they are not alone. He says Taiwan has become a symbol of freedom for the world, like the Statue of Liberty, and it inspires everyone.
