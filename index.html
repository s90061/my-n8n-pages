            <h1>Important Vegetable Growing Areas are Recovering Well, Ministry of Agriculture Says Prices Will Be Stable in Early September</h1>
            <p>Typhoons recently hit Taiwan one after another. This caused vegetable prices to change a lot. Today, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun held a meeting for the "Price Stabilization Group." In the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture said that the weather is becoming stable now. Important vegetable growing areas in central and southern Taiwan are recovering well. They expect that more vegetables will be available from early September, and prices will become stable.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun held the "Price Stabilization Group" meeting today. After the meeting, the Executive Yuan sent out a press release. It said that since July, typhoons "Danas" and "Yang-liu" and heavy rain caused damage to leafy vegetables and other vegetables in central and southern Taiwan. This made vegetable prices at stores change a lot quickly. In the meeting, Cheng Li-chiun asked the Ministry of Agriculture to quickly help farmers recover their farms and production. They should do this with "generous, simple, and fast" methods. They should also stay in close contact with local farming groups to know what is happening in the industry. They should offer help and guidance at the right time to quickly get the market supply and prices back to normal.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said that the weather is becoming stable. Important vegetable growing areas in central and southern Taiwan are recovering well. From early September, more vegetables are expected to be available, and prices will become stable. During the recovery period, the Ministry has helped farmer groups to sell stored vegetables based on what the market needs. They also helped imported vegetables go through customs faster to make sure there are enough goods in the market.</p>
            <p>For stores, the Ministry of Agriculture said they have helped farmer groups work with big supermarkets like PX Mart and A-Mart across Taiwan. From August 15th, they started offering special prices for cabbage. Also, in PX Mart stores across Taiwan, they set up special areas for cheap vegetables for people to buy.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun also said that since the rainy season started, the supply of some farm and animal products went down, and their prices changed. This happened because of unstable weather. Especially, the number of pigs produced went down because of hot summer weather. Also, the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming, so demand will go up. The Ministry of Agriculture should keep watching the pig and pork market prices and amounts. They should also ask Taiwan Sugar Corporation to provide more. They should also improve ways to control supply to make sure there is enough.</p>
            <p>Lastly, about homes damaged by storms and heavy rain, Cheng Li-chiun thanked all the kind people and companies for their help. This made the recovery work faster. She also asked the Public Construction Commission to watch building material prices closely. This is to make sure building costs are fair and stable.</p>

            <h1>Financial Times: US Commerce Secretary's Words "Too Much," Beijing Tells Companies Not to Buy H20 Chips</h1>
            <p>The Financial Times from the UK reported today that Beijing is telling its own tech companies not to buy H20 AI chips. These chips are made by Nvidia specifically for China. This started because Chinese officials felt that what the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said about chip export rules was "too much" or "very unfair."</p>
            <p>The Financial Times said that several Chinese government groups that check on businesses have started to act. They are trying to stop Chinese tech companies from buying H20 chips.</p>
            <p>Sources said that groups like the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) took action because of Lutnick's words last month.</p>
            <p>In April, Washington stopped Nvidia from selling H20 chips to China. Then, last month, they allowed it again. On July 15th, the day after the H20 export ban was lifted, Lutnick spoke to the US business news channel CNBC. He said, "We will not sell them our best products, nor the second best, and not even the third best."</p>
            <p>He also said, "The idea behind this is to sell enough (products) to China so that their developers become dependent on American technology."</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the situation said that some high-level people in China thought these words were "too much" or "very insulting." This made leaders try to limit Chinese tech companies from buying H20 chips.</p>
            <p>These sources also said that because of this, Chinese tech companies have delayed or greatly reduced their orders for H20 chips.</p>
            <p>The actions by Chinese authorities show that powerful computer chips are key for AI. This is a main reason for the tension between the US and China, the two biggest economies in the world.</p>
            <p>These actions have caused problems for Nvidia. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, visited Beijing just last month. Sources said that Huang's visit was positive. Nvidia got enough orders from Chinese customers and told their production partner, TSMC, to start making H20 chips again.</p>
            <p>A source close to Chinese leaders said, "Lutnick's words gave the groups that control business more reasons to push tech companies to use Chinese-made chips."</p>
            <p>The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) sent informal messages, called "window guidance," to big tech companies like ByteDance and Alibaba. They told them to stop buying H20 chips from Nvidia because of national security worries.</p>
            <p>On July 31st, the CAC also called a meeting with high-level Nvidia staff. They said there were "serious security issues."</p>
            <p>The CAC stated that US AI experts found that Nvidia chips have features like location tracking and can be turned off remotely. Nvidia strongly denied this.</p>
            <p>Sources said that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), which checks on telecom and software companies, also talked informally with Chinese tech company leaders. They repeated the CAC's position. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), which works to make China's technology independent, released rules. These rules told tech companies to stop buying all Nvidia chips, including H20.</p>
            <p>The CAC's involvement puts more pressure on big Chinese tech companies. Even if these instructions are not official, if the authorities punish them, it will greatly affect their daily business.</p>
            <p>Some US officials and lawmakers want to make chip export rules stronger. However, US President Donald Trump said that besides H20, he might allow a weaker version of Nvidia's Blackwell chip to be exported to China.</p>
            <p>Sources said that some Chinese tech companies delayed their H20 orders because they are waiting to see if the Blackwell chip, made for China, will be allowed for sale.</p>
            <p>The report also said that a person who recently talked with leaders in Beijing shared that some leaders want to completely ban foreign "inference chips." These chips are a big part of what AI needs.</p>
            <p>However, this policy will likely not happen soon because China does not have enough of its own chips. Beijing hopes to fix this problem next year when many new advanced production lines start working.</p>

            <h1>Jam Hsiao Asks for Help on New Album, Will Share Money to Really Help Li Bing-Hui</h1>
            <p>Today, singer Jam Hsiao held a press conference for his new album called "Be a Kind and Caring Person." He invited singer Li Bing-Hui to be a special guest. Jam Hsiao said, "From now on, I will let him sing at my events." He hopes to talk to companies about sharing his payment with Li Bing-Hui. This is a real way to help.</p>
            <p>Jam Hsiao's new album will be available on August 26th. For this album, he worked with many musicians from different generations. This includes his long-time partners Wu Hsiung and Huang Ting, who he has worked with for over 20 years. He also invited singer Li Bing-Hui, singer Wei Ru-Xuan, and Lin Yi-Shuo, the lead singer of "Lilium." Today, Li Bing-Hui also came to the press conference as a guest. He even played a claw machine game with Jam Hsiao.</p>
            <p>Jam Hsiao said he wants to find ways for Li Bing-Hui to perform again. For example, he can write songs for Li Bing-Hui or take him to perform in different places. Or, he can talk to companies for commercial shows. They wouldn't need to pay extra, but use some of the budget to invite Li Bing-Hui to perform together. Right now, there are at least 10 events known before the end of the year. He hopes this will give Li Bing-Hui longer-term help in his life.</p>
            <p>Jam Hsiao also said that Li Bing-Hui has trouble walking after his stroke. Also, he is getting old. Jam Hsiao feels bad seeing him still singing on the streets for little money. He wants to really help Li Bing-Hui lessen his life's worries. He said, "He is still singing on the streets of Tamsui. At his age, he really should be enjoying his retirement."</p>
