Some short, strong rain showers also reached over 40 or 50 millimeters.</p>

            <p>Ms. Chu Mei-lin stated that on August 5, as the southwest wind becomes weaker, the total rainfall will slowly decrease. From August 6 to 8, the weather will mostly be cloudy to sunny.</p>
            <p>In addition, the 13th tropical low-pressure system of this year formed this morning. Ms. Chu Mei-lin pointed out that it is expected to become a light typhoon in the future, but it will not directly affect Taiwan's weather. Its path will generally move towards the northeast.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Metro Promotes Reusing Lost Items, Donating 571 Useful Goods to Help Those in Need</h1>
            <p>The Taichung Metro Company recently looked through all the lost items that no one claimed. They chose 571 everyday items that were still in good condition and gave them to social welfare groups. They hope to help people in need and turn lost items into a kind of warmth for society.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Metro Company announced today that in the first half of this year, they found almost 7,600 lost items. According to rules, if the person who found an item is a company employee, the company owns the item after the storage period ends. The company regularly checks and chooses items that can be used again. They clean and sort these items. They mainly give warm clothes, small daily items, and other useful things to social welfare groups.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Metro Company said that they recently picked out 571 useful everyday items. They gave these items to "Taichung Peace Station" and "Fengyuan Peace Station," which are part of the Ren-an Social Welfare Foundation. The items included warm coats, woolen hats, thermos bottles, helmets, stationery, and personal items. All of these items are very practical for daily life. The Ren-an Social Welfare Foundation said that these items are not just real help, but also show that society cares about homeless people and families in urgent need. This makes the donation very special.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Metro Company said they will continue to support the plan to reuse lost items for charity. They plan to hold two donation events regularly each year. They will also ask the Taichung City Government's Social Affairs Bureau to suggest social welfare groups to work with. This will make the best use of resources and directly help homeless people and other people in need. It will turn lost items into a different kind of kindness for society.</p>
