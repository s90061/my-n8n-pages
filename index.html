Airlines are struggling to keep up with the huge increase in people wanting to travel this summer. After a couple of years of quieter skies, airports are now packed, and airlines are finding it difficult to manage. Issues such as staff shortages, particularly pilots and ground crew, are causing many flights to be delayed or cancelled. Weather problems have also made the situation worse. This is frustrating for passengers who are eager to go on holiday or visit family and friends.

Airlines are trying to solve these problems by hiring more staff and adjusting their schedules. However, training new staff takes time, and the demand for travel is still very high. This means that delays and cancellations are likely to continue for the next few months. Passengers are advised to check their flight status before travelling to the airport and to be prepared for potential disruptions. They should also consider travel insurance that covers flight cancellations and delays.

**Sustainable Tourism Gains Popularity as Travelers Seek Eco-Friendly Options**

More and more people are choosing sustainable tourism options when planning their holidays. This growing trend reflects a desire to minimize the negative impact of travel on the environment and local communities. Sustainable tourism includes activities like staying in eco-friendly hotels, supporting local businesses, and participating in responsible wildlife tours.

Travelers are becoming more aware of the environmental consequences of flying and are looking for ways to reduce their carbon footprint. Some are choosing to travel by train or bus instead of flying, while others are opting for destinations that are closer to home. Local communities also benefit from sustainable tourism, as it often creates jobs and supports local economies. As awareness grows, it is expected that sustainable tourism will become even more popular in the years to come.
