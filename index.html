Greece is still trying to control a wildfire on Crete Island. Strong winds today made it hard to put out the fire. This fire has burned many forests and olive tree farms and made thousands of people and tourists leave their homes.

On the third day of fighting the fire, about 130 firefighters, 48 vehicles, and 6 helicopters were used. But strong winds and dry weather could make the fire start again in some parts of the island.

A fire department spokesperson said that about 800 people left Koropi, a suburb of Athens. More than 120 firefighters, with help from 8 planes and 8 helicopters, are fighting the wildfire there.

Also, many parts of Europe are experiencing an early summer heatwave. Officials think that at least 8 people have died because of the high temperatures across Europe.

Tourism is very important for Crete Island. Because the wildfire started at the beginning of the summer holiday season, hotels there are worried about fewer bookings in the future. The Greek weather service expects temperatures to reach 38 degrees Celsius today.

**Russia's Summer Attack and US Aid Pause Put Double Pressure on Ukraine**

Russia is currently attacking Ukraine this summer. Russian forces attacking Sumy in northern Ukraine are holding back many Ukrainian soldiers. This makes it hard for Kyiv to defend the eastern front. At the same time, the US has decided to stop some weapon deliveries, putting Ukraine under double pressure.

The Wall Street Journal says that Ukraine is now facing a strong Russian attack. Also, efforts by US President Trump to make peace between Russia and Ukraine have stopped.

Russian President Putin's plan is to put more pressure on Ukraine's military and people while the US, Ukraine's strongest supporter, slowly pulls back. This is to weaken Ukraine's ability and will to fight. The weapons that the US has stopped sending include air defense equipment that helps Ukrainian cities against air attacks. Russian air attacks are now getting stronger.

This new situation makes Russia more confident that it can win against Ukraine and the West in this long war. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said on July 3 that Ukraine will have to save its military equipment, and this could make Russian forces move faster on the battlefield.

Russia has 50,000 soldiers in the Sumy region in northern Ukraine. They are now about 19 kilometers from Sumy city, which is a new target. The Ukrainian army says that Russia has three times more soldiers there.

Ukraine has moved soldiers to stop Russia from moving forward, but the fight in Sumy is making Ukraine's already small army even more strained. Russian forces are attacking in many places along the 1200-kilometer front line from northeastern to southern Ukraine. This forces Ukrainian commanders to send their best units to fill gaps in the front line.

Some experts say that taking land might not be Russia's main goal right now. Putin wants to slowly wear down Ukraine's soldiers and equipment, and also reduce support from its people and the West.

Taras Chmut, who leads a group called "Come Back Alive" that raises money for weapons for Ukraine, said, "We should not measure how many square kilometers of land we take back, but rather the rate of losses, because these losses are hard to make up for."

Ukraine is now attacking targets further behind the front line to weaken Russia's fighting ability. According to Ukraine's army chief Oleksandr Syrskiy, Ukraine is using long-range drones to attack military equipment and factories in Russia. This costs Russia 15 times more than what Ukraine spends on drones.

Ukraine is also using air strikes and assassinations to target Russian commanders and scientists. Russia's Ministry of Defense said on July 3 that Major General Mikhail Gudkov, deputy commander of the navy, died in Russia's Kursk region, which is next to Ukraine's Sumy region. Earlier, unofficial Russian and Ukrainian social media channels reported that Gudkov died in a missile attack on his command post.

NBC News reported that the US Department of Defense this week held back some weapons for Ukraine. Officials said they were worried about not having enough weapons. But three US officials said that a top military analysis found that this aid package would not harm the US military's own supply of ammunition.

Several sources said that the decision to hold back weapons for Ukraine surprised the State Department, US lawmakers, officials in Kyiv, and European allies.

Adam Smith, a leading Democrat in the House of Representatives, criticized the Pentagon for saying they were doing it to "maintain military readiness." He said it seemed fake when the real goal was to stop aid to Ukraine.

Sources said that Elbridge Colby, a top official in the US Department of Defense in charge of policy, supported stopping aid to Ukraine. Colby has long said that the US should reduce its support for Ukraine to move weapons and resources to the Pacific region to fight China.

**TPBL Kings Announce Coach Ryan and Player Manigault Are Leaving After Winning Championship**

The New Taipei Kings, who just won the Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL) championship, announced today that head coach Ryan Marchand, assistant coach Mark Coppola, and popular foreign player Kenny Manigault will be leaving the team. The team plans to announce a new head coach soon.

Ryan Marchand, 36, has been the Kings' head coach since 2021. He focuses on details, follows rules, and talks well with players. He made the team strong in both offense and defense. He also led the Kings to win the championship for two years in a row (last year in the P. LEAGUE+). He also won the Coach of the Year award twice. He had a strong relationship with the team's main players.

Now, Ryan and assistant coach Mark Coppola will start a new journey. The Kings team said in a statement that they thank both coaches for their help with strategies, leadership, and team culture over the past four years. They helped the team build a strong base for the future. The team also said they will announce the new head coach soon to continue the team's steady growth.

Also, Kenny Manigault, a popular foreign player for the Kings, who was chosen for this season's TPBL All-Defensive First Team and All-TPBL Second Team, decided to leave the team today. He wants to try new things in his career. The Kings team respects Manigault's decision with his family.

The Kings team said that Manigault was not just a strong player and defender on the court. His fighting spirit, teamwork, and professional attitude also greatly influenced the team's culture. He was a very important part of the Kings for three years. "We thank him for his great performances and effort over three seasons, and we wish him continued success on the court in the future."
