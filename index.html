            <h1>China Supports Palestine: Clear Stance but Limited Power</h1>
            <p>The war between Israel and Hamas has continued for almost two years. The situation in Gaza, where people need help, is getting worse. Many Western countries are now saying they recognize Palestine as a country. China was one of the first countries to have official relations with Palestine. Right now, China's role in the Middle East is mostly about showing moral support. Its real power to stop the conflict is not as strong as America's, but its influence will grow in the future.</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, sent fighters into Israeli towns and attacked. About 1200 people died, and more than 200 people were taken as hostages. The Israeli army fought back, attacking the Gaza Strip many times.</p>
            <p>At first, China did not directly criticize Hamas. The spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, Mao Ning, said two days later that China is "a common friend of Israel and Palestine." She also said that the conflict should be solved with a "two-state solution."</p>
            <p>It wasn't until May 10, 2025, that Xiao Junzheng, China's ambassador to Israel, clearly stated in an interview with Israeli news that "Hamas's terrible acts are inhumane, cannot be forgiven, and are very upsetting. China is against and condemns what Hamas did on October 7. This is very clear." This statement came just before US President Trump visited the Middle East. People talked about the timing of China's statement, thinking it might be a way to create distance between Israel and the US, and to get closer to Israel.</p>
            <p>In fact, one week after the attack, on October 14, 2023, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with Turkey's Foreign Minister. Wang Yi said that Israel's actions had gone too far beyond self-defense. He also said, "The reason the situation between Palestine and Israel is like this today is that the Palestinian people's right to have their own country has been ignored for a long time. Their right to live safely has not been fulfilled for a long time, and their right to return home has been ignored for a long time."</p>
            <p>To understand China's position‚Äî"supporting Palestine but avoiding Hamas"‚Äîwe need to know China's history of supporting developing countries after the Chinese Communist Party took power. We also need to understand that China's foreign policy tries to balance its ideas of "not interfering," being against terrorism, and needing economic growth.</p>
            <p>‚óè China's Support for Palestine's Statehood: Driven by History</p>
            <p>According to official Chinese statements, "China is one of the first countries to support the Palestinian people's fight for freedom and to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the State of Palestine."</p>
            <p>In 1964, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was formed. The next year, it opened an office in Beijing that was treated like an embassy. In November 1988, Palestine announced that it was creating the State of Palestine in the West Bank. China quickly formed official relations with Palestine.</p>
            <p>After the Chinese Communist Party came to power in 1949, during Mao Zedong's time, China's foreign policy was to support people in developing countries (called "Asia, Africa, and Latin America") who were fighting against strong powers and colonial rule. Israel was supported by Europe and America, so the Palestinian freedom movement naturally received China's support. Yasser Arafat, the past leader of the PLO, visited China 14 times. His successor, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, has also visited China 5 times since 2005.</p>
            <p>A Chinese expert on international relations told the Central News Agency that in the early days, China's support for Palestine was mainly political, and other help was very small. In 2001, after the September 11 terror attacks in America, China felt that it also faced threats from extreme nationalism, separatist groups, and extreme religious ideas in Xinjiang. So, fighting terrorism became a top priority for China. This means that while China still gave political support to Palestine, it was careful about taking actions that involved terrorism.</p>
            <p>Hamas, which was officially formed in late 1987, controls the Gaza Strip. This is different from the Palestinian areas in the West Bank. Hamas is seen as a "terrorist organization" by countries in Europe and America, and it does not recognize Israel's right to exist, unlike the PLO. However, China has not called Hamas a terrorist organization.</p>
            <p>‚óè Fighting Terrorism First: China Helps and Avoids Hamas</p>
            <p>On July 23, 2024, different Palestinian groups signed the "Beijing Declaration" in Beijing. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with the deputy chairman of Fatah, the largest Palestinian group, on that day. But the government did not say if Wang Yi met with representatives from Hamas, the other large group that controls Gaza. Israel's Foreign Minister Yisrael Katz said on social media platform X that Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement in China to control Gaza together after the war. He criticized this, saying it means not rejecting terrorism.</p>
            <p>Some experts have different ideas about whether China secretly gives more support to Hamas. Guermantes Lailari, a former US Air Force officer and now an international visiting scholar at Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, wrote an article in April 2024. He said that Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political office (who was killed by Israel in May 2025), once studied at Renmin University of China in Beijing. Mohammed Deif, a Hamas military leader (later killed by Israel), studied how to make cannons, rockets, and explosives at the People's Liberation Army Engineering University in 1996.</p>
            <p>The article also said that according to several sources, during the current Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli army found many Chinese weapons and advanced explosives, spy equipment, and other military supplies in Gaza. They also found two tunnel engineers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This suggests that China helped Hamas build a large network of tunnels in Gaza.</p>
            <p>China said in January 2024 that it did not give advanced weapons to Hamas. But Lailari said that even if these Chinese-made weapons reached Hamas through Iran, China knew about it.</p>
            <p>‚óè Middle East Peace Helps China, but Its Power to Help is Limited</p>
            <p>In 2002, China started to have a "Chinese Government Special Envoy for Middle East Affairs." This has only been for about 20 years. The Chinese expert mentioned earlier said that this position is more like a big country creating a role to protect its own interests and ideas. But for more than ten years, this role "has done almost nothing and has not been very noticeable."</p>
            <p>In March 2023, China helped Saudi Arabia and Iran, two old rivals, agree to start diplomatic relations again and reopen their embassies. This made people see China's influence in a new light. China needs energy from other countries, so it wants peace and stability in the Middle East. However, China has not played a special role in helping with things like military ceasefires.</p>
            <p>In June this year, as part of the Israel-Hamas war, Israel and Iran attacked each other more strongly than ever before. America also launched "Operation Midnight Hammer," attacking nuclear sites in Iran and using "massive bunker-buster bombs" for the first time in a real fight. But China, which is Iran's partner and its biggest buyer of oil, did almost nothing except ask for the situation to calm down.</p>
            <p>Craig Singleton, a senior fellow for China affairs at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, analyzed that China only talks about its support because "promising too much and delivering too little would show the limits of its power." Other analyses suggest that China wants to avoid direct conflict with the US on Middle East issues.</p>
            <p>When looking at the Palestinian issue, China's support mainly shows its "moral position." But Palestine also helps China.</p>
            <p>In June 2023, Palestinian President Abbas visited China. He supported China on issues that China cared about. In a joint statement, he clearly said that Xinjiang is not a human rights issue, but a problem of fighting terrorism, stopping extreme ideas, and preventing separatism. "The Palestinian side firmly opposes interfering in China's internal affairs using the Xinjiang issue as an excuse." Almost all Arab countries, which are Muslim, have not questioned human rights issues in Xinjiang. This is very important for China to keep its Muslim people at home calm.</p>
            <p>Also, China and Israel started official relations in 1992. The Chinese expert said that the benefits of technological and trade cooperation between the two countries are much greater than what a troubled Palestine can offer. China's relations with Israel also show that China wants to have richer and more balanced relationships with Middle Eastern countries.</p>
            <p>He said that as China becomes stronger, its involvement in the Middle East will also increase. But right now, it can only help with agreements that are "within its power." China also knows that its power to get involved is still limited.</p>

            <h1>Two-State Solution Summit: Arab League Says It's the Only Path to Middle East Peace</h1>
            <p>The United Nations General Assembly's summit about the two-state solution started on September 22nd at the UN. France and Saudi Arabia organized this meeting together. The Arab League clearly said that Palestine becoming a country is necessary for the region to be stable and for the conflict to end. It is also the only way to keep peace in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>This UN summit, which talked about the "two-state solution" for Palestine and Israel, was held in New York at the United Nations headquarters on September 22nd, Eastern US time.</p>
            <p>This summit came from the "New York Declaration," which France and Saudi Arabia had suggested before. The declaration strongly said that the Palestinian problem should be solved peacefully and that the two-state solution should be put into practice. It also asked for everyone to work together to end the war in Gaza and to make the two-state solution happen effectively.</p>
            <p>The Arab League has approved this declaration. Also, more than 10 UN member countries had already signed it in July.</p>
            <p>Arab countries believe that the long conflict between Israel and Palestine means that Israel must stop occupying Palestinian land for so many years. They believe that Palestine should become a country through the "two-state solution."</p>
            <p>As early as 2002, Arab countries signed the "2002 Arab Peace Initiative" to show this long-held belief.</p>
            <p>The main points of the Arab Peace Initiative are: Arab countries will have normal relations with Israel. In return, Israel must leave all Palestinian land that it has been occupying and blocking since 1967, which it says is for safety. Palestine must also become a country, and Israel must fairly solve the problem of Palestinians who have had to leave their homes.</p>
            <p>Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace agreement with Israel in 1979. Jordan followed in 1994.</p>
            <p>However, Israel has continued to increase its control over Palestine in the past year. Because of this, the Arab League, which has 22 member countries, held an urgent meeting in Cairo on September 4th. They decided that Israel must completely leave the Palestinian land it controls. They said this is a necessary step before Arab countries can have "full normal relations" with Israel.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) warned Israel that taking over any part of the West Bank would seriously hurt the spirit of the "Abraham Accords." It would also cross a "red line" for the UAE. These words were the strongest criticism the UAE has made against Israel's actions since the Israel-Hamas war started in October 2023.</p>
            <p>The UAE also stated strongly that if Palestine cannot become a country, the UAE will not give aid for rebuilding after the war, as Israel has asked.</p>
            <p>The "Abraham Accords" were agreements pushed by US President Donald Trump during his first term. They helped countries like the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco start normal diplomatic relations with Israel.</p>
            <p>Lana Nusseibeh, the UAE Assistant Minister for Political Affairs and Special Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said, "Signing the Abraham Accords is about continuing to support the Palestinian people and their rightful demand for an independent state."</p>
            <p>Saudi Arabia had planned to reach a peace agreement with Israel in 2023. But in 2024, at the "International Coalition for a Two-State Solution" meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia's capital, the Saudi Foreign Minister clearly said that Saudi Arabia cannot have normal relations with Israel if Palestine is not a country.</p>
            <p>At the Arab-Islamic Leaders' Summit held in Qatar on September 15th, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi boldly called Israel "the enemy." Several high-ranking Egyptian government officials told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that this "enemy statement" might mean the end of the peace between Israel and Egypt that has lasted for more than 40 years.</p>
            <p>Currently, about 150 countries around the world recognize the State of Palestine. These include France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
