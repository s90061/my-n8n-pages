            <p>Li Lecheng, China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology, met with Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing today. Minister Li hopes that Apple will continue to work deeply in the Chinese market and be part of China's new industrial development.</p>
            <p>Cook is visiting China. According to a message on the official WeChat account of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, "MIIT News," on October 15, Li Lecheng met with Cook and his team in Beijing today. They talked about Apple's business growth in China and how to improve cooperation in the electronics and information field.</p>
            <p>Li Lecheng said that China has a very large market and a complete industrial system. This means there are great chances for investment and buying products. China will continue to open up its economy at a high level. It will also work hard to make industries smarter and to create smart industries. This will create a good business environment for Apple and other foreign companies.</p>
            <p>Li Lecheng stressed that he hopes Apple will continue to work deeply in the Chinese market. He wants Apple to actively join China's new industrial development. He also wants Apple to work with other companies in China's supply chain to create new things together.</p>
            <p>According to official Chinese reports, Cook said in the meeting that he was thankful for the Chinese government's support for Apple's growth in China. He said Apple will continue to invest more in China and improve the level of cooperation for everyone's benefit.</p>
            <p>According to a report from The Paper on October 14, Cook's public activities in China started on October 13. First, he visited THE MONSTERS 10th-anniversary exhibition in Shanghai.

            <h1>Fengyuan High School Security Officer's Demerit Removed; Taichung City Government Says Mediation Must Be Fair</h1>
            <p>A student at Fengyuan High School died by suicide after being bullied. A school security officer was given a demerit, but this punishment was later removed. This was because the school used the wrong law. Now, the Taichung City Government has ordered that from today, when different government offices and schools try to solve problems, the people who made the first decision cannot decide whether to agree to the solution.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung City Council's Civil Affairs Committee met. City councilors from the Democratic Progressive Party, Hsieh Chih-chung, Chang Yu-yen, Huang Shou-ta, and Wang Li-ren, asked questions. They talked about the Fengyuan High School student who died after being bullied. The school used the wrong rules for punishment. So, a security officer named Huang filed a lawsuit and reached an agreement to remove his demerit. But the Education Bureau, which is in charge, did not know about this.</p>
            <p>Li Shan-chih, the head of the Legal Affairs Bureau, explained that the school thought the security officer, Mr. Huang, managed things wrongly. Since Mr. Huang is a contract employee, his relationship with the school is based on a contract. The school should have punished him according to the contract rules. But they mistakenly used the "Public Servant Performance Evaluation Act." Mr. Huang appealed, but the review committee said it was not an administrative punishment, so they did not accept the appeal.</p>
            <p>Li Shan-chih added that Mr. Huang later filed an administrative lawsuit. The judge thought there was a problem with the law the school used and asked both sides to reach an agreement. The school, Fengyuan High School, was the one who gave the punishment, and the security officer was the one who appealed. Only these two parties would know about the agreement. The Education Bureau was not a party, so they did not get a notice. For important events, the school should report to the higher authority.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chih-chung said it was absurd that for such a serious school safety event, Fengyuan High School only sent a staff member from the human resources office to the mediation meeting. Li Shan-chih believes that after an agreement is reached and the original punishment is removed, the school should give a new punishment using the correct law.</p>
            <p>Wang Li-ren said that the incident became public a year later because many groups are now talking about it. He noted that some teachers who are not good at their jobs might also want to use administrative lawsuits to reach agreements with schools and get their punishments removed. He asked the city government to check carefully if other people are trying to use this method to cancel their punishments.</p>
            <p>Deputy Mayor Lai Shu-hui replied that the Education Bureau did not receive a report from the school. She explained that administrative lawsuits now have a mediation and reconciliation process, which came after a law change to reduce the number of lawsuits. The city government has now ordered that when any office or school needs to mediate or reconcile, the original office that gave the punishment cannot decide whether to accept the agreement.</p>

            <h1>Shunze Temple to Give 5800 "Shovel Superman" Hats to Thank Guangfu Disaster Heroes</h1>
            <p>Puyan Shunze Temple in Changhua has made a special "Shovel Superman Hat" to thank all the kind volunteers from Taiwan who helped with disaster relief in Guangfu Township, Hualien. People can sign up for the hat online and show pictures of themselves helping at the disaster site to get one. The temple plans to give away 5800 hats for free.</p>
            <p>A lake blockage burst in the Matai'an Stream in Hualien, causing serious damage to Guangfu Township. Many "Shovel Supermen" from different places came to help. Staff from Shunze Temple told a Central News Agency reporter today that they made the "Shovel Superman Hat" to thank these heroes and all disaster relief workers for their selfless help. The hat says "Shovel Superman Hualien Cheer Up" and has a picture of a shovel. It is a very meaningful souvenir.</p>
            <p>Shunze Temple announced that they will give out the hats on October 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, and November 1, 2, 8, 9. The times are from 9 AM to 5 PM. To get a hat, people must first send a private message on Facebook to register their name and the date they want to pick up the hat. Then, they need to go to the main hall service desk and show a photo of themselves at the disaster site. After that, they can get a "Shovel Superman Hat" for free.</p>
            <p>In 2019, a Norwegian triathlon athlete named Gustav Iden won a world championship in France. He was wearing a hat with "Shunze Temple" written on it. This made the temple's hat very famous, and it is now called the "Champion's Hat."</p>
