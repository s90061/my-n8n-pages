            <h1>Taiwanese Groups in Eastern US March in Manhattan for UN, Want Taiwan to Help</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese groups, students, and lawmakers from the eastern US gathered today in New York. They joined a big march to support Taiwan joining the United Nations. Officials from countries friendly to Taiwan also came to a special event in front of the UN building. They kept telling the world why Taiwan needs to be part of the United Nations.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly started on September 9th at the UN headquarters. Taiwanese groups from New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. joined the march in downtown Manhattan, just like every year. Many families came to the event.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers Wang Cheng-hsu, Mai Yu-chen, and Lai Hui-yuan led the march. They walked through busy 42nd Street and Bryant Park until they reached the square in front of the New York Public Library.</p>
            <p>People marching shouted slogans like "UN for Taiwan" and "Keep Taiwan Free." Many international tourists and New Yorkers along the route clapped and cheered.</p>
            <p>Li Chih-chiang, the head of Taiwan's office in New York, spoke to the people at the New York Public Library square. He said that Taiwan has not been part of the United Nations since 1971. He explained that they are marching today to let everyone know that the UN is not fair to Taiwan. He said Taiwan should be a member of the United Nations and take part in its work.</p>
            <p>The lawmakers who came to New York for the march also met with members of the US Congress and UN representatives from friendly countries. Before the march, they joined staff from Tuvalu and Belize (two friendly countries) at a special event in front of the UN building to promote Taiwan.</p>
            <p>This year's main message is "Chip in with Taiwan, Better Together." This message highlights Taiwan's strong skills in chip technology. Besides ads on special vehicles and taxi screens, Taiwanese business groups also paid for a huge ad in Times Square.</p>
            <p>Wang Cheng-hsu, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party, said that four years ago, the pandemic deeply affected the whole world. Taiwan is on the first island chain, facing China, which is where new diseases can easily start. He said that if Taiwan, being on this frontline, can find out about new viruses and diseases, it would greatly help the world.</p>
            <p>He stressed that Taiwan has shown it can help prevent diseases and provide medical supplies. Taiwan has a good healthcare system. By sharing its good ways of working, Taiwan can help the world effectively reduce the impact of new diseases on people everywhere.</p>
            <p>Mai Yu-chen, a lawmaker from the Taiwan People's Party, said that her work in the parliament is for the good of the country and its people. She believes that different ideas can be discussed, even if the ways of discussing them are different. She said that in New York, they are also talking and sharing their needs so that everyone can agree. Taiwanese people are asking the United Nations to listen to Taiwan's voice and work together with Taiwan for the world.</p>
            <p>While in New York, Wang Cheng-hsu and Mai Yu-chen visited Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis. Malliotakis wrote on Facebook that the relationship between the US and Taiwan is strong. She supports Taiwan's right to join in during the UN General Assembly.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Hostages Not Back Yet, Families Blame Netanyahu</h1>
            <p>The Israeli group "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" said today that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the biggest problem in getting the hostages back. They spoke shortly after Netanyahu accused Hamas leaders of making the war in Gaza last longer.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" said in a statement that a recent attack by Israel in Doha, the capital of Qatar, "clearly showed that the only thing stopping the hostages from returning home and the war from ending is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu."</p>
            <p>The statement also said, "Whenever a deal seems possible, Netanyahu always causes problems."</p>
            <p>On September 9, Israel launched an air attack in Qatar. This was the first time such an event happened in Qatar. Israeli warplanes attacked a building in Doha to kill Hamas members who were part of the talks for a ceasefire in Gaza. The attack killed 5 Hamas members and 1 Qatari police officer.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Netanyahu said that if Hamas leaders hiding in Qatar could be removed, the war might end. He also accused Hamas of stopping past attempts to reach ceasefire agreements.</p>
            <p>He wrote on social media platform X: "The Hamas terrorist leaders living in Qatar do not care about the people of Gaza. They stop all efforts for a ceasefire, wanting this war to go on forever."</p>
            <p>"Getting rid of them is the biggest obstacle to releasing all hostages and ending the war."</p>
            <p>However, the "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" called Netanyahu's words another "excuse" for not bringing the hostages home.</p>
            <p>The forum stressed: "It's time to stop all these delays, which are only to keep power."</p>
            <p>"These delaying tactics... put the lives of the hostages at risk. They have been held for almost two years and are at their limit. These tactics also make it impossible to get back the bodies of those who died for a long time."</p>
            <p>When Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, 2023, they took 251 people. Today, 47 people are still held by Hamas in the Gaza area. This number includes 25 people that the Israeli military has confirmed are dead.</p>
            <p>AFP reporters said that thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv tonight. They asked the government to end the war and quickly agree to a hostage exchange.</p>

            <h1>Washington Post: Trump Plans to Send 1,000 National Guard to Keep Peace in Louisiana Cities</h1>
            <p>The Washington Post reported today, using documents from the Pentagon, that the US President Donald Trump's government has made a plan. The plan is to send 1,000 National Guard soldiers from Louisiana to city centers in the state to help keep peace and order.</p>
            <p>Most US cities have seen less violent crime. However, since Trump became president, fighting crime has been a main focus for him. Trump has increased efforts to fight crime in cities led by Democrats. This has caused legal arguments and led to protests, including thousands of people demonstrating in Washington D.C. last weekend.</p>
            <p>Leaders of the Democratic Party said that sending many soldiers like this seems more like Trump showing his power, rather than a real way to fight crime.</p>
            <p>More than ten people in Shreveport, Louisiana, told Reuters that they think these plans are more for show in politics, not a real way to solve crime problems.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not say much about the documents.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that the planning documents say this plan would let the military help police work in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge.</p>
            <p>The Pentagon's plan for this action would last until September 30, 2026. However, the documents do not clearly state when it will start. The report says that the documents highlight the "special advantages" of the Defense Department's plan for law enforcement in Louisiana.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, who is in the same Republican party as Trump, must ask for this plan to happen. But it is not yet confirmed that federal or state officials have approved it.</p>
            <p>The Defense Department's plan for Louisiana shows that they are thinking about a very big operation. In this operation, the National Guard would help strengthen the police in areas where crime is common. According to the Washington Post, the National Guard might also help find drugs and give support for supplies and communication to local authorities.</p>
