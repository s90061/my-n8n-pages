            <h1>Tesla Approves Large Stock Reward to Keep Musk Leading</h1>
            <p>New York, August 4th â€“ Electric car company Tesla announced today that its CEO, Elon Musk, will receive 96 million restricted shares. This is a temporary reward, worth about 29 billion US dollars (around 864.5 billion New Taiwan dollars). This comes while his old pay agreement is still being discussed in court.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Musk's 2018 pay agreement was for a record 55.8 billion US dollars (about 1.66 trillion New Taiwan dollars). But a court in Delaware canceled it last December. The court said the way Tesla's board approved it was not right and was unfair to shareholders.</p>
            <p>Musk appealed in March this year. He said the judge made several legal mistakes when canceling his pay agreement.</p>
            <p>Later, Tesla said its board had created a special group to talk about some pay issues related to Musk. They did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Tesla shared information with US regulators today. The special group said that if the Delaware court fully approves Musk's 2018 performance award for being CEO, then these new temporary stock awards will be canceled or reduced. This is to make sure he doesn't get paid twice.</p>
            <p>For Musk to get these shares, he must stay in a key leadership role at Tesla until the end of 2027. Also, he cannot sell the shares for five years, unless it's to pay for taxes or the cost of buying the shares.</p>
            <p>Tesla's special group said this reward is to slowly increase Musk's voting power. Musk and Tesla's shareholders have always said this is important to keep him focused on Tesla's business growth.</p>
            <p>The group said, "We know that Musk's other business projects, interests, and needs will take up a lot of his time and attention. But... we also believe this reward will encourage him to stay at Tesla."</p>

            <h1>Trump Criticizes India for Buying Russian Oil, Says He Will Raise Import Taxes</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 4th â€“ US President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform "Truth Social" today. He said India is buying Russian oil and does not care about how many people Russia's war machine has killed in Ukraine. He added that he will greatly increase the taxes on goods from India.</p>
            <p>Reuters and other news sources reported that Trump wrote on "Truth Social": "India is not only buying a lot of Russian oil, but they are also selling a large part of it in the open market and making a lot of money."</p>
            <p>Trump also said: "They do not care how many people the Russian war machine has killed in Ukraine. Because of this, I will greatly increase the taxes India has to pay to the United States."</p>
            <p>Last month, Trump announced that he would put a 25% tax on goods from India starting August 1st. He also criticized India for buying most of its military equipment from Russia. He said India is also the biggest buyer of Russian energy, like China. He warned that the US would add more punishments for India because of these actions.</p>
            <p>However, two Indian government sources, who did not want to be named, recently said that India will continue to buy oil from Russia, even if Trump threatens to punish them.</p>

            <h1>Tensions Between US and Europe Lessen, EU Delays Trade Actions Against US for Six Months</h1>
            <p>Brussels, August 4th â€“ Olof Gill, a spokesperson for trade at the European Union Commission, said today that the EU will delay its planned trade actions against the United States for six months. These actions were supposed to start on August 7th.</p>
            <p>US financial news channel CNBC and other media reported that Gill stated: "On July 27, 2025, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and US President Donald Trump, reached an agreement about tariffs and trade."</p>
            <p>Gill also said: "The EU and the US are still working together to finalize a joint statement based on the agreement from July 27. To achieve these goals, the EU Commission will take the necessary steps to stop the trade taxes on the US that were planned to start on August 7th. This pause will last for six months."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that people familiar with the situation said the EU expects Trump to announce executive actions this week. These actions will officially confirm lower taxes on cars from the EU and no taxes on some industrial products, like airplane parts.</p>
            <p>The sources also said that the US and Europe are expected to release a joint statement. This statement will explain the political promises that Trump and Von der Leyen made last month.</p>
