            <h1>Taiwanese Yueqin and Portuguese Guitar Meet Happily in Canada</h1>
            <p>What do Taiwan and Portugal have in common? A talk at the TAIWANfest in Toronto, Canada, showed that the traditional Taiwanese musical instrument called "Yueqin" and the traditional Portuguese "Fado guitar" both look round. These instruments are a great way for people from Taiwan and Portugal to learn about each other and connect.</p>
            <p>This year, the TAIWANfest in Canada used Portugal as a starting point. It aimed to have deep talks by looking at history, books, music, government ideas, and art.</p>
            <p>A-Da (real name Jiang Yu-da), who leads Taiwan's "Rural Armed Youth Band," and Simon Arruda, a Fado guitar player of Portuguese background from Toronto, both shared their stories. They talked about how they started playing their traditional string instruments again: the Taiwanese Yueqin and the Portuguese guitar. This happened at the "Hope Lecture" held yesterday at the Toronto Harbourfront Centre. People who attended were surprised to see how similar the two instruments were after hearing them play and explain.</p>
            <p>A-Da is the main person in the Rural Armed Youth Band. He writes songs, sings, and plays guitar and Yueqin. In its early days, the band used folk music and punk rock energy to support many social movements.</p>
            <p>A-Da said that the Yueqin is about 300 years old. It was called the "beggar's instrument." It was a tool for common people in Taiwan to make a living by singing and playing music. When you play the Yueqin, which has only two strings, there is no set rhythm. The player must learn to find "freedom" through amazing practice. It is a true Taiwanese instrument, but it almost disappeared after 3 generations of political and cultural problems.</p>
            <p>Arruda is one of only four people in the greater Toronto area who publicly play traditional Portuguese guitar music. He is also said to be the youngest. He said that the Portuguese guitar has 12 strings. It is the main instrument for "Fado," the traditional music of Lisbon, Portugal. It is about 250 years old. Fado songs are often about sailors going to sea or about poor people's lives.</p>
            <p>Arruda mentioned that from 1933 to 1974, when Portugal was ruled by a strong government, Fado music often showed sadness or disagreement. The government ordered that Fado songs had to be "checked" before they could be sung. In 1974, a special Fado song was played on the radio, asking everyone to protest in the streets. This music "uprising" eventually caused the government to fall in 1975.</p>
            <p>After the talk, Arruda told CNA that he used to play normal guitars or jazz guitars. Five years ago, he started practicing a traditional Portuguese guitar that his father had bought for him a long time ago. Since then, he found a new sense of who he is. He even started to learn more about the Portuguese language and culture, and he does not want to stop playing it.</p>
            <p>When talking about what the Yueqin and the traditional Portuguese guitar have in common, Arruda said he was very surprised that both instruments strongly express the feelings of everyday people through music. Also, both can be played with singing or alone.</p>
            <p>A-Da told CNA that when he started learning the Yueqin 10 years ago, he dreamed of playing it abroad one day. He feels very happy and that it means a lot to have this chance now.</p>
            <p>A-Da also said that before coming to Canada to perform, he knew nothing about Fado music and the traditional Portuguese guitar. Because of this, he listened to many Fado songs and watched videos. Through talking with Arruda before and during the talk, he was very surprised that Portugal also had a long period of "white terror," a time of political repression. He was also surprised by the important role Fado music played in bringing political change to Portugal.</p>
            <p>Talking about keeping the Yueqin culture alive, A-Da said that 15 or 20 years ago, when teachers like Chen Ming-chang started playing the Yueqin, the culture of the Yueqin was almost gone. These past few years, more people have slowly started to bring the Yueqin back. Hengchun is now teaching it in elementary schools, and teacher Chen Ming-chang has held a Yueqin folk music festival in Beitou for more than 10 years. He said, "Old, middle-aged, and young people are slowly coming together."</p>
            <p>A-Da laughed and said, "My teacher's wife often tells me: 'It's your generation's turn now. You need to take over and pass it on to the next generation.'"</p>

            <h1>Most US Stocks End Lower, TSMC Shares in US Rise a Little; Advisors Say Watch Nvidia Report</h1>
            <p>Most US stocks finished lower. However, shares of Nvidia and TSMC, a big chip company, both went up by more than 1% in the US market. On August 25, the Taiwan stock market went up a lot, gaining 512.91 points, ending at 24277.38 points. Nvidia also launched its new computer brain for robots, called Thor. Investment experts said that the US central bank might lower interest rates slowly. This could bring more money into the market. The good mood in the Taiwan stock market remains, and it might reach new high points. Everyone is watching closely for Nvidia's financial report.</p>
            <p>Nvidia, a very big company that makes chips for artificial intelligence, will share its financial report later this week. Investors are paying close attention, and because of this, most major US stock markets ended a bit lower.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 349.27 points, which is 0.77%. The S&P 500 index went down a little by 27.59 points, or 0.43%. The Nasdaq index dropped by 47.25 points, or 0.22%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks chip companies, went up a small amount by 1.84 points, or 0.03%.</p>
            <p>Nvidia, the large AI chip maker, announced that its Jetson AGX Thor developer kit and production modules for AI robots are now fully available. These new parts use Blackwell graphics processors (GPUs). They can do AI calculations 7.5 times faster and use 3.5 times less energy than older products. This will help the age of general-purpose robots come faster.</p>
            <p>Experts in the market said that Nvidia will release its financial report on August 27 in the US. This report will be a very important sign for how the whole AI market will develop, and it is a main focus for investors.</p>
            <p>Nvidia's stock price went up a bit by 1.02%, closing at $179.81. TSMC's shares that can be bought in the US (ADR) went up by 1.12%, closing at $235.59.</p>
            <p>On August 25, the Taiwan stock market went up a lot by 512.91 points, closing at 24277.38 points. The total value of shares traded was 417.833 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Large investors bought 33.07 billion New Taiwan Dollars more than they sold.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan stock futures index fell by 75 points after hours, closing at 24180 points, a drop of 0.31%.</p>
            <p>Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve, hinted on August 22 that interest rates might be lowered as early as September. This made oil prices go up because people think lower interest rates will help the US economy and increase the demand for oil. International oil prices continued to rise.</p>
            <p>Hon Hai, a big electronics company, announced that it will invest an extra 5.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars in Mexico. People in the market think that the main reason is to make more AI servers for customers in North America.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-ching, who is a manager at Taishin Securities Investment Advisory, told CNA that people hope the US Federal Reserve will lower interest rates slowly over time. This could bring more money into the Taiwan stock market. The Taiwan stock market closed above its monthly average on August 25, showing that positive feelings are still strong. The index might try to reach its previous high point of 24551 points. The market is waiting for Nvidia's second-quarter financial report. If the report is better than expected, it could further boost AI stocks and push the index higher.</p>

            <h1>Trump Meets Lee Jae-myung, Suggests 'Land Ownership' for US Bases in Korea</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump said today that he wants the United States to own the land where American military bases are located in South Korea. He also asked South Korea to pay more money for the approximately 28,500 US soldiers stationed there.</p>
            <p>According to reports from AFP and Yonhap News Agency, Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung today at the White House. When asked about US troops in South Korea, Trump said he wanted to ask the government in Seoul to give the US "ownership" of the land it leases for military bases.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Maybe one thing I want to do is ask them to give us ownership of that land while we have that military base. We spend a lot of money to build a strong base, and South Korea also helps."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "But I want to see if we can get rid of the lease and get ownership of the land where our large military base is."</p>
            <p>When asked if his government would reduce the number of 28,500 US troops in South Korea, Trump said he did not want to talk about that "right now." He said, "Because we have always been friends, and we are friends now."</p>
            <p>People continue to guess that Washington is thinking about changing the size, organization, and role of US troops in South Korea. This is to better protect against the "urgent threat" from a stronger China.</p>
