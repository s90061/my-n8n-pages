            <h1>Strengthening Slime Toy Rules: Ministry to Check Every Batch from August 1st</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 17th, Central News Agency reporter Liu Chien-ling) The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that to improve how slime toys are managed, starting from August 1st this year, they will change from checking some batches to checking every batch. If a company avoids these checks, they could be fined between NT$200,000 and NT$2,000,000. The Ministry will continue to test slime toys bought from the market and check them.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs made boron in "slime toys" a required item for inspection on March 1st last year. Before these toys are imported or leave factories in Taiwan, they must be tested according to national rules. Only if they meet these rules can they be sold in the market.</p>
            <p>Today, the BSMI sent out a press release. It said that from August 1st this year, they plan to change to checking every batch of these products. This is to make sure products are good quality from the very beginning. If products bought from the market do not meet the quality rules, companies will be told to remove them from shelves and fix them within a set time. This is under Article 59, Paragraph 1 of the Commodity Inspection Act. If a company avoids inspection, they will be fined between NT$200,000 and NT$2,000,000 under Article 60, Paragraph 1 of the same act.</p>
            <p>The BSMI said they will keep testing and checking these toys in the market. If they find toys that are not okay, they will send people to find out why. They will write down their findings and deal with the issue according to the Commodity Inspection Act. This two-step checking process helps protect buyers.</p>
            <p>The BSMI emphasized that all types of toys for children under 14 years old must be inspected. Whether they are imported or made in Taiwan, they must pass inspections and have an inspection label before they can be sold in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The BSMI advises people buying and using toys to make sure they have a "Commodity Inspection Mark." Also, check if there is a detailed label in Chinese. You should read about the suitable age for the toy, important notes, main materials, warnings, and how to use it.</p>
            <p>The BSMI also said to choose toys that are right for a child's age. Do not give toys meant for older children to very young children, as this can cause harm. Flexible slime toys may have chemicals like borax. Touching them for a long time can cause skin problems or allergic reactions. So, you should be careful about how long you use them and wash your hands right after.</p>

            <h1>Russian Army Keeps Attacking, Says It Took 3 Villages in Ukraine</h1>
            <p>(Moscow, July 17th, Central News Agency, based on foreign reports) The Russian army said today that it has taken three villages in different parts of the frontline in Ukraine. This makes their summer attack bigger. They did not listen to the United States government's call for a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>The Russian Ministry of Defense said that Russian forces have "freed" the villages of Popiv Yar in Donetsk (eastern Ukraine), Degtiarne in Kharkiv (northeastern Ukraine), and Kamianske in Zaporizhzhia (southern Ukraine).</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Ukraine has not yet said anything about Moscow's claims.</p>
            <p>Russia continues its attack on Ukraine. In June this year, the Russian army moved forward faster for the third month in a row.</p>
            <p>AFP looked at information from the American research group "Institute for the Study of War." This analysis showed that the land Russia took in Ukraine in June was the most in one month since November last year.</p>
            <p>On July 14th, US President Donald Trump asked Russia to make a peace deal within 50 days, or they would face strong punishments. But Ukraine said that Russia does not want to end the war and will keep attacking no matter what.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tai-ying in Trouble Over Blood Tests at NTNU; "Mulan General" Once Led Taiwan Women's Football to 3 Asian Cup Wins</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 17th, Central News Agency reporter Chen Jung-chen) Chou Tai-ying, a famous football player once called the best in Taiwan women's football, was known as "The Mulan General." After she stopped playing, she became a coach and did very well. But now, she is part of a problem with blood tests for the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team and is facing criticism.</p>
            <p>Chou Tai-ying, who is 61 years old, not only helped the Taiwan women's football team win the Asian Cup three times in a row, but she was also named the best player in the Asian Cup in 1979. She even led the team to the top 8 in the World Cup.</p>
            <p>Also, she was the first Taiwanese woman footballer to play overseas. She won championships in leagues in West Germany and Japan. She is truly a legend in Taiwan women's football.</p>
            <p>After Chou Tai-ying stopped playing, she went back to her old school, NTNU, to coach. She led the NTNU women's football team to win the college football league nine times. Her coaching results were also great. She even became the head coach for the Taiwan women's national team for a while. Her importance in Taiwan football is very clear.</p>
            <p>However, Chou Tai-ying recently got involved in a problem about blood tests for the NTNU women's football team. She was accused of threatening players to take blood tests for a study by taking away their academic credits. This made many people angry. A letter of apology written by Chou Tai-ying was put on NTNU's Facebook page. But many people thought it did not sound truly sorry, so the letter was quickly taken down.</p>
            <p>NTNU's actions in this matter have also been criticized by many. The Premier and the Minister of Education were very angry about it. Because of pressure from many sides, NTNU said today that they plan to temporarily stop the coach involved from working. Today, lawmakers and others went with the students who were affected to the Ministry of Education. After the meeting, they agreed on seven points. One of these points is to remove Chou Tai-ying's coaching license.</p>
            <p>Jane Chi-sheng, a representative for the affected students, said that they spoke up because they want the sports world to be better. She said they do not forget that Chou Tai-ying was a national player, a football legend, and that she worked hard for sports education. She stressed, "We did not start this out of hate; we just needed a real apology."</p>
