ASE Technology Holding, a company that packages and tests computer chips, finished its ex-dividend trading on July 2nd. The company gave out a cash dividend of NT$5.3 per share. After falling by 2.75% the day before, its stock price went up strongly today. It reached a high of NT$148, which is an increase of NT$6.5 or nearly 4.6%. This means the stock completed its ex-dividend recovery in just two trading days.

ASE Technology Holding expects to do well in the second half of the year. They predict that their advanced packaging and testing business will grow by 10% this year. They also expect to earn an extra US$1 billion to US$1.6 billion from advanced packaging and testing in 2025 compared to 2024. Their testing business is expected to grow twice as much as their packaging business this year.

The company is positive about the growth in AI-related industries, like edge AI, special chips (ASIC), and high-performance computing (HPC). They plan to invest more in advanced packaging until at least 2026.

**Tesla's Q2 Deliveries Drop Again Due to More Competition and Musk's Political Actions**

Electric car company Tesla announced today that its car deliveries dropped a lot again in the second quarter. This is because there is more competition in the market and because people are reacting negatively to CEO Elon Musk's involvement in politics.

Tesla delivered 384,122 cars in the second quarter. This is 13.5% less than the same time last year, but it was better than some recent predictions. After the news came out, Tesla's stock price went up.

These sales numbers show that the electric car market is becoming more competitive around the world. Tesla used to be the main company, but now other companies like BYD and other cheaper Chinese companies are competing. Big car makers like General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen are also joining the competition. Elon Musk's political activities, supporting right-wing ideas, have also caused some people to avoid buying Tesla cars or protest against the company. This has hurt sales. Recently, Musk had disagreements with former US President Donald Trump again, which caused Tesla's stock to fall on July 1st.

These numbers suggest that Tesla's financial report, which will be released on July 23rd, might show weaker profits again. Experts from S&P Capital IQ predict that Tesla's profits will go down by 16% to 1.2 billion US dollars.

**Chunghwa Telecom Shares Rise 20% Towards Full Recovery After Dividend Payout**

Chunghwa Telecom, a major telecommunications company, began its ex-dividend trading today. This means they paid out a cash dividend of NT$5 per share to their shareholders. The starting price for its shares was NT$129.5. In the morning, the share price rose by NT$1 to NT$130.5, recovering about 20% of the dividend amount.

Chunghwa Telecom is the first of Taiwan's three big telecom companies to pay out dividends this year. They are giving NT$5 in cash per share, and they are paying out 104.2% of their earnings, which is the highest since 2017 and also the highest among the three big telecom companies. In total, they are paying out NT$38.787 billion.

Even though the share price has not fully recovered the dividend amount, many people are buying the shares. Due to risks like tariffs and currency exchange rates, telecom stocks have become a safe choice for investors. Chunghwa Telecom's share price has reached new highs many times before, and its market value is stable above one trillion NT dollars. In recent years, the company has also been working on new AI technologies, making its network stronger, and growing its business services (ICT).

Taiwan Mobile will pay its dividend on July 9th, giving NT$4.5 cash per share, totaling NT$13.6 billion. Far EasTone Telecom will also pay its dividend on July 9th, giving NT$3.56 cash per share, totaling NT$12.836 billion. This year, the three telecom companies together will pay out NT$65.223 billion in cash dividends, which is the highest in five years. This will add more money to the Taiwan stock market.
