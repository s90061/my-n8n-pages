            <h1>Hong Shen-han: Mining once supported the economy, hoping the history of miners will be remembered by society.</h1>
            <p>Today, Minister of Labor Hong Shen-han went to the "New Taipei Miners Go Home Concert." This event was organized by the New Taipei City Retired Miners Exchange Association. He said that the history of miners is part of the history of mining and economic growth. It is also a history of hard work and sadness. He hopes this history will continue and be remembered by everyone in society.</p>
            <p>Last year was 40 years since three big mining accidents happened at Haishan, Meishan, and Haiyi mines. Because of this, artists who care about Taiwan's mining industry started the "Haishan 40 Memorial Event." Today, the "2025 New Taipei Miners Go Home Concert" was held at the New Taipei City Hakka Cultural Park. Minister Hong Shen-han also brought government officials to show his support and care for the older miners.</p>
            <p>Minister Hong Shen-han spoke at the event. He said that for a country's economy to grow, energy development is very important. In the early days of economic growth, mining was a very important support. To keep this memory alive, the miners themselves are key. This memory or history is not just words on a page. It is a story made of their lives, hard work, sadness, and experiences.</p>
            <p>He also said that this concert uses a gentle way to make the fight for history and rights stronger. It can even get more support from different parts of society. The Ministry of Labor will fully support the money needed for digital albums that record the spoken history of coal mining communities.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that older miners suffer a lot from lung diseases, which is very difficult. He hopes everyone can work together to make sure this part of Taiwan's historyâ€”the history of miners, mining, economic growth, and their strugglesâ€”continues and is remembered by society. The Ministry of Labor wants to keep working with everyone, whether it's about their contributions or the lessons learned.</p>

            <h1>Calls for Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru to step down are growing; Koizumi reportedly advises him to resign.</h1>
            <p>Japanese media reported that last night, Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Koizumi Shinjiro, talked with Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru. Koizumi advised Ishiba to avoid a situation on September 8th where party members might officially ask for a new party leader. This would be like being "forced out." In simple terms, Koizumi suggested that Ishiba should understand the situation and resign on his own.</p>
            <p>Since Ishiba became Prime Minister last autumn, his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has lost three elections: last year's general election, the Tokyo Assembly election in June, and the Upper House election in July. The LDP does not have more than half of the seats in both houses of parliament, which is a first in the party's 70-year history. Because of this, some party members want Ishiba to step down.</p>
            <p>The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that according to people inside the LDP, Koizumi and the LDP Vice President, former Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide, visited the Prime Minister's official residence last night. Suga left after about 30 minutes, but Koizumi stayed for about 2 hours to talk with Ishiba Shigeru.</p>
            <p>The election for the LDP President (party leader) usually happens every three years, and a president can serve up to three terms. If an early election for the president is held, it means the current president is being forced to leave.</p>
            <p>To hold an early election for the president, more than half of the LDP members of parliament (295 people, not including the Speakers of both houses) and the 47 local party branches (total 172 votes) must agree. The LDP plans to register these requests on September 8th at the party headquarters.</p>
            <p>Inside the LDP, more and more people are asking for an early election. Former Prime Minister Aso Taro already said he wanted an election during a training meeting for the Aso group on September 3rd. Minister of Justice Suzuki Keisuke also asked for a new election on September 5th. He was the first minister to openly ask the Prime Minister to resign. After him, several Deputy Ministers and parliamentary secretaries also publicly supported this idea.</p>
            <p>On September 5th, Koizumi said at a press conference, "It is very important for the party to be united, and we must create an environment where we can move policies forward." He also said, "I believe Prime Minister Ishiba is not happy with the current situation in the party. He will think that he has a duty to help the party unite and decide what to do next."</p>
            <p>Fuji News Network (FNN) in Japan asked 295 LDP members of parliament through interviews or phone calls. As of midnight on September 7th, 131 members, or 44% of all members, said they "want an early election." Also, out of 47 local party branches, 20 want an early election. This makes a total of 151 votes, which is close to the 172 votes needed to pass.</p>
            <p>In the latest survey, 131 LDP members of parliament want an early election for the president. This is more than 50 people compared to the survey in late August.</p>
            <p>Looking at the overall trend, besides Minister of Justice Suzuki Keisuke, a total of 23 Deputy Ministers and parliamentary secretaries want an early election. Among experienced and young members of the House of Representatives who have been elected 5 times, 80% want an early election. Also, 80% of the Aso group, or 35 people, want an early election.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, only 47 people (16%) said they "do not want an early election," which is about the same as the August survey. 117 people are still undecided or did not answer. The 47 local party branches are also still deciding. 20 want an early election, 9 do not, and the remaining 18 said they would "decide tomorrow" and are currently undecided.</p>
            <p>Combining the views of the members of parliament and local party branches, 151 people already want an early election. This is only 21 votes short of the 172 needed. Therefore, the 171 undecided members of parliament and 18 undecided party branches will be very important.</p>
            <p>The LDP will accept written requests from members tomorrow, from 10 AM to 3 PM. In the evening, they will announce if an early election for the president will be held.</p>

            <h1>Lai Ching-te holds talks with party officials in Hsinchu; Wu Zheng says the focus is on people's daily lives.</h1>
            <p>Today, President and Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Lai Ching-te visited the Neitianhou Temple in Hsinchu City to offer incense. After that, he went to the Fleur Lis Hotel to talk with party officials. DPP spokesperson Wu Zheng said that during the meeting, the local council members mainly talked about issues that affect people's daily lives. The President promised to take these suggestions back to his team and the Executive Yuan (Taiwan's cabinet).</p>
            <p>Lai Ching-te started his "Unity Tour" of 22 cities and counties across the country, joined by DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung and others. This morning, he first visited the Neitianhou Temple in Hsinchu City. He did not talk to reporters during this visit. At 11 AM, he went to the Fleur Lis Hotel in Hsinchu City to meet with party officials.</p>
            <p>At the Neitianhou Temple, Hsu Kuo-yung spoke to reporters. He said that the purpose of talking with party officials is to understand their ideas. The DPP needs to move forward, and these discussions help to unite the party. All opinions given will be used for future plans.</p>
            <p>Regarding rumors that some in the party want to force out Legislative Yuan caucus convener Ker Chien-ming, Hsu Kuo-yung simply said, "Silence is golden." About the fact that no one has signed up to be the party caucus executive for the upcoming legislative session, he said the DPP always has talented people, and they will come forward when the time is right.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, DPP spokesperson Wu Zheng spoke to reporters. He said that the President's visit was to thank Ker Chien-ming and all the party officials and council members in Hsinchu. They have helped the ruling team since last year's big election. Besides saying thank you, the President also thought it was important to talk with the council members, listen to local opinions and needs, and have good discussions.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng explained that during the meeting, the council members focused on issues related to daily life. They especially talked about Hsinchu's need for more resources in education and healthcare. This is because many new people have moved to Hsinchu due to the Hsinchu Science Park. The President said that the central government will put more money into AI development, long-term care, and childcare. He will take the council members' suggestions back to his team and the Executive Yuan.</p>
