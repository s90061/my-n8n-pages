            <h1>Israel Attacks Yemen; Houthi Rebels Say Their Prime Minister Died</h1>
            <p>The Houthi rebels in Yemen said today that Israel recently attacked Sanaa, the capital city of Yemen. The attack killed some important government officials controlled by the Houthi movement, including Prime Minister Rahawi and several ministers.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Houthi movement said in a statement that Rahawi (Ahmed al-Rahawi) and some ministers died in the airstrike on Sanaa on August 28.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military said on August 28 that its forces "accurately hit military targets of the Houthi terrorist government in the Sanaa area of Yemen."</p>
            <p>Rahawi became the Prime Minister of the Houthi-led government in August 2024.</p>
            <p>While Israel was fighting Hamas, a Palestinian group in the Gaza Strip, the Houthi movement fired missiles at Israel many times. The Houthi movement said these attacks were to support the Palestinian people.</p>

            <h1>Japan to Place Long-Range Missiles in Kyushu, Covering China's Coast and Taiwan Waters</h1>
            <p>Japan wants to make its southwest islands stronger against China, which is growing its actions at sea. So, Japan has decided to place improved long-range "Type 12 Surface-to-Ship Missiles" in Kumamoto City, Kyushu, starting this year. These missiles can reach China's coast and the waters around Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that Japan's Ministry of Defense will start placing these improved Type 12 missiles at the Ken-gun military base in Kumamoto City this year to make the southwest islands safer.</p>
            <p>Also, the government is thinking about placing them at the Yufuin base in Yufu City, Oita Prefecture, and the Katsuren sub-base in Uruma City, Okinawa Prefecture, in the next few years.</p>
            <p>Currently, Japan's ground missiles can only go a few hundred kilometers. But the new improved Type 12 missiles can go over 1000 kilometers. If they are placed in Kyushu, they can cover the waters around Taiwan and coastal areas of China.</p>
            <p>Reports say that someone from the Ministry of Defense said, "This will greatly increase our ability to stop attacks."</p>
            <p>Some people say China might be ready to attack Taiwan as early as 2027. Japan's Ministry of Defense is worried about this. So, they decided to start placing the improved Type 12 missiles this year, instead of waiting until after 2026. They are also thinking about placing them in all seven ground-to-ship missile units across the country in the future.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Ito Kazumi, who is in charge of the Kyushu Defense Bureau, visited Kumamoto Governor Kimura Takashi in Kumamoto Prefecture to explain about placing the improved Type 12 missiles at the Ken-gun base in Kumamoto City.</p>
            <p>Governor Kimura said, "National defense is a matter for the country (central government). This decision to place missiles was made after many years of discussion." Kimura understood the reason but also said that some people in the prefecture are worried. He asked the Ministry of Defense to explain things to the people and to take safety steps like training.</p>
            <p>Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki is against placing the missiles. In March this year, when Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa visited Okinawa, Tamaki said, "If these improved Type 12 missiles are placed, the risk of being attacked will go up, and the people of Okinawa Prefecture will not understand."</p>

            <h1>US Senate Military Committee Visits Taiwan; Lin Chia-lung Says US-Taiwan Friendship is Strong, Protecting Democracy Together</h1>
            <p>Today, a group led by Roger Wicker, who chairs the US Senate Armed Services Committee, finished their visit to Taiwan. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said that this visit sent a strong message: the friendship between Taiwan and the US is very strong. He added that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to work closely with the US Congress and government to protect democracy and make the region more successful.</p>
            <p>Roger Wicker, the head of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29. They left by plane today at 3:40 PM. This was Wicker's first time visiting Taiwan as the committee chairman. It was also the first time in nine years that a US Senate Armed Services Committee chairman visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung wrote on Facebook tonight that Wicker's visit was very important. It showed that the friendship between Taiwan and the US is very strong. Since 1979, when the US Congress passed the "Taiwan Relations Act," and 1982, when former US President Ronald Reagan made "Six Assurances," these two promises have always been key parts of US-Taiwan relations. They continue to help Taiwan make its defense stronger.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also said that peace in the Taiwan Strait and safety and growth in the Indo-Pacific region are now facing threats from authoritarian powers. He believes that to keep peace, Taiwan must show it is determined to defend itself and work with other countries that share its values.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung stated that under President Lai's leadership, Taiwan is slowly increasing its defense budget. It will reach 3.32% of its GDP by 2026, and aims for 5% by 2030. At the same time, Taiwan also hopes to work more closely with the US to improve its ability to fight in special ways (asymmetric warfare).</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung pointed out that Wicker's group also visited Palau, a friend of Taiwan, and the Philippines, with whom Taiwan is working more and more closely. Taiwan also hopes to use recent chances to work with the US in technology and energy. The goal is to build a partnership that benefits both sides. Taiwan also wants to expand this cooperation to other countries, like those in the First Island Chain, using a "Taiwan-US joint fleet" model, to help countries that share similar ideas succeed together.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung repeated that Taiwan and the US are not only strategic partners but also share the same democratic values. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to work with the US Congress and government to make US-Taiwan relations stronger, protect democracy together, and help the region become more peaceful and stable.</p>
