            <h1>Taichung Man Saved from Scam While Selling Burial Plots</h1>
            <p>An old man in Taichung, named Mr. Wang, wanted to sell ten burial plots he owned. Recently, he received a message from a buyer who offered a high price. However, the buyer asked Mr. Wang to give them his ATM card first. When Mr. Wang went to the bank to get the ATM card, a bank employee noticed something strange and called the police. Police officers came to the bank and worked with the employee to explain the scam. They successfully stopped Mr. Wang from losing money.</p>
            <p>Today, the First Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department said that on August 11, at 11 AM, the Cathay United Bank in Taichung reported an incident. A man was trying to get an ATM card because someone told him to. It seemed like he was being tricked into becoming a "money mule" for a scam. They asked the police to come and help.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they learned that 84-year-old Mr. Wang told the bank employee that he was selling his ten burial plots. A stranger had added him as a friend on LINE and offered to buy them for NT$5 million (New Taiwan Dollars). But the condition was that Mr. Wang had to give his new ATM card to the buyer first. The bank employee thought this was suspicious and reported it.</p>
            <p>The police explained how normal transactions work, saying that people usually send money through bank transfers. During this time, the buyer kept sending messages, asking, "Are you done with it?" Then, the police officers asked the buyer, "Why don't you send money for the sale? Why do you need an ATM card?" The buyer did not answer directly and threatened to complain about the officers' attitude.</p>
            <p>After Mr. Wang called his daughter to talk about it, he finally believed it was a scam. He decided not to get the ATM card for the fake buyer. He thanked the police and the bank employee many times.</p>

            <h1>US Adds Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics to Trade Blacklist</h1>
            <p>The US Department of Commerce announced today that it has added 32 companies and organizations to its trade blacklist. This list now includes Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co. Ltd. and its offices in China, Singapore, and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>According to documents from the US Federal Register, reported by Reuters, the list of controlled companies now has 32 more entries. Twenty-three of these are in China. Others are in India, Iran, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
            <p>Two companies on the list are Gimci Semiconductor Technology (Wuxi) Co. Ltd. and Gicun Semiconductor Technology (Shanghai) Co. Ltd. They were added because they helped SMIC, China's largest chip maker, get chip-making equipment from the US.</p>
            <p>SMIC was already on this list. To send US equipment to SMIC, companies need a special permit, which is usually not given.</p>
            <p>Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co. Ltd., which makes powerful computer chips, along with its offices in China, Singapore, and Taiwan, are also on the list. The US states this is because they used products from the US "to help China's military become more modern, to be part of China's advanced computing and chip-making and distribution, and to directly supply China's military, government, and security groups."</p>
            <p>The US Department of Commerce also said that Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics provided technology to military users in Russia. Because of this, more rules are now in place for the company.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not reach these companies for their comments.</p>

            <h1>AI Needs Power: Delta Electronics Market Value Reaches NT$2 Trillion, Almost Catching MediaTek</h1>
            <p>AI data centers use a lot of electricity. AI servers are becoming more powerful, which also creates problems with heat. Some experts say that "AI power is computing power." Delta Electronics, a company that provides power solutions, has become very important in the AI field. Its stock price has risen quickly, and its market value is now more than NT$2 trillion (New Taiwan Dollars), almost as much as MediaTek.</p>
            <p>Last year, Delta Electronics faced challenges in the electric car market. But this year, because of the growing need for AI, its business and stock price have both increased sharply. Delta Electronics recently announced its sales for the first eight months of this year were NT$336.211 billion, which is a 24.6% increase from last year. Its profit for the first half of the year was NT$24.178 billion, a big increase of 53.8% compared to the same time last year. Earnings per share were NT$9.31.</p>
            <p>Because of this good performance, Delta Electronics' stock price has more than doubled in about two and a half months since the second half of the year. It rose from NT$413 to a very high price of NT$854 this Friday, making it a new fast-growing stock.</p>
            <p>On Friday, Delta Electronics' stock closed at NT$837, up by NT$6. According to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Delta Electronics' current market value is about NT$2.1741 trillion. This is more than NT$2 trillion, placing it as the fourth largest company by market value in Taiwan, after TSMC, Hon Hai, and MediaTek.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics first went past Fubon Financial Holdings in market value in July this year, becoming the fourth largest company in Taiwan's stock market. Fubon Financial Holdings, which is now fifth, has a market value of NT$1.2094 trillion. Delta Electronics has left it far behind and is now close to MediaTek, which is third with NT$2.3784 trillion.</p>
            <p>Even Delta Electronics' chairman, Cheng Ping, has said, "Only AI is doing well this year." Luckily, the AI market is big enough and strong enough to support Delta Electronics' good growth this year.</p>
            <p>Chen Ying-yuan, Vice President and General Manager of Delta Electronics' Power and System Business Group, explained why the demand for AI power is so strong. He mentioned a forecast from Gartner, a research company, that global AI data centers will need 261 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity in 2024. This is a huge number. To compare, Taiwan's total electricity use in 2024 is 283 TWh. This means that global AI data centers will need almost as much electricity in one year as all of Taiwan uses in a whole year.</p>
            <p>Even more surprising, this number is expected to reach 500 TWh by 2027. This means it will double in just three years, and building power plants cannot keep up. So, besides making powerful power supplies, it is very important to make them use electricity more efficiently.</p>
            <p>Chou Chih-hung, a spokesperson for Delta Electronics, added that Delta Electronics' power systems can change electricity with over 97% efficiency, which is the best in the world. These few percentage points are important because power systems often change electricity several times. Also, because AI data centers use so much electricity, the efficiency of power conversion becomes very critical.</p>
            <p>Also, according to the law of conservation of energy, the electricity lost during power conversion turns into heat. This means more electricity is then needed to cool things down. So, power conversion efficiency is very important.</p>
            <p>Analysts say that as AI servers become more advanced and need more power, Delta Electronics will play an even bigger role. This is because Delta Electronics started with power supplies and has worked on cooling for many years, so it can offer complete power solutions.</p>
