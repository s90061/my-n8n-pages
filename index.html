(Washington D.C. 14th July, Comprehensive Foreign News Report) Atlanta police said today that BeyoncÃ©, the American pop music queen, had unreleased music and concert plans stolen on July 8th. One suspect, who has been identified, is still free.

According to Agence France-Presse, police reports show that the items were stolen on July 8th from a car rented by BeyoncÃ©'s choreographer and a dancer in Atlanta. This happened just two days before her "Cowboy Carter" tour was set to start in Atlanta.

Christopher Grant, the 37-year-old choreographer, told the police that when he returned to his car, he found the rear window broken and his luggage stolen. The report says that the stolen items included several hard drives. These hard drives contained "music with watermarks, unreleased music, videos recorded for performances, and plans for past and future performances."

Also, stolen items included an Apple laptop, headphones, and several expensive clothing items. The police used the location signals from the laptop and headphones to search the area, but the report did not say that any lost items were found.

According to a statement from the Atlanta police, an arrest warrant has been issued for one suspect. The suspect's identity has not been shared, and they are still at large.

BeyoncÃ© started her "Cowboy Carter" tour in April after winning her first Grammy Award for Album of the Year with the same album.

As this tour nears its end, BeyoncÃ©'s four shows in Atlanta finished today. The final two shows will be in Las Vegas in late July. (Intern Translator: Chen Che / Editor: He Hong-ru) 2025/07/15

***Lin Chun-Hsien Calls on Tainan Representatives to Raise 6 Million NTD for Disaster Fund***

(Tainan, July 15, Central News Agency reporter Yang Si-rui) Typhoon Danas badly hit Tainan. Lin Chun-hsien, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), asked other legislators Kuo Kuo-wen, Lai Hui-yuan, Lin Yi-chin, and several Tainan City council members to help raise 6 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD). This money will be given to a special fund for the typhoon disaster. They hope this act will encourage more people to donate and help people in the affected areas get back to normal life.

Lin Chun-hsien spoke at a press conference in the Tainan City Council this afternoon. He said that the damage from the disaster was much worse than expected. He mentioned that DPP politicians quickly offered help with people and supplies. Now, they are entering the rebuilding stage, which needs more help from different sources.

He said that he spoke to Premier Cho Jung-tai this morning. It is expected that a plan for the highest amount of aid for the typhoon disaster will be made. However, he stressed that disaster relief still needs both government and private help. Therefore, he and three other legislators, along with the DPP group in the Tainan City Council, raised 6 million NTD for disaster relief. They hope this will encourage more people to join in.

Lin Chun-hsien also said that the day after the disaster happened, DPP politicians started helping with relief efforts. They not only helped get food, tarps, and lights but also sent people to help put tarps on damaged houses. They also worked with different groups like the military, police academy graduates, and alternative service members to help rebuild the affected areas.

Lin Chun-hsien shared that he recently saw people cooking hot meals for those affected in Xiliao, a severely damaged area in Qigu. He found out they were from the Nansi earthquake disaster area. They decided to help in the typhoon-hit area because they had received much help from others during their own earthquake.

Kuo Kuo-wen said he found companies to help and arranged for engineering vehicles to help people clean their homes, which worked very well. He added that the rebuilding process will be more difficult. He hopes that with the help of the politicians, raising 6 million NTD will help the disaster victims and encourage more people to give.

Lai Hui-yuan said that her area was one of the worst-hit areas this time. She is very thankful that Lin Chun-hsien organized this effort. She also thanked kind people who gave supplies or helped in the affected areas. Local farmers' associations and district offices also helped send supplies. She mentioned that a lot more help is still needed, and everyone's continued support is important. (Editor: Li Hsi-chang) 2025/07/15

***UK Media: Trump Asked Zelensky if Weapons Could Hit Moscow if Supplied***

(Washington D.C. July 15th, Comprehensive Foreign News Report) According to people who know about the matter, former US President Donald Trump privately encouraged Ukraine to hit deeper into Russian territory. He even asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky if Ukrainian forces could hit Moscow, the capital of Russia, if the US provided long-range weapons.

The British "Financial Times" reported that this conversation happened between the US and Ukrainian leaders on July 4th. The content of the talk goes against what Trump had said before about the Russia-Ukraine war and his promise during his campaign to stop US involvement in conflicts overseas.

It is still unclear if Washington will give these kinds of weapons. However, this discussion shows that Trump is increasingly upset that Russian President Vladimir Putin has refused to join Trump's suggested talks for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. Trump had promised to end the war in one day.

Trump had a phone call with Putin on July 3rd but called the conversation "bad." This made him call Zelensky the next day.

Two people who know about the call said that Trump asked Zelensky if Ukraine could hit military targets deep inside Russia if he provided weapons that could do so.

According to the sources, Trump asked during the call, "Volodymyr (Zelensky's first name), can you hit Moscow? ... Can you also hit St. Petersburg?"

Zelensky reportedly answered, "Of course. If you give us those weapons, we can do it."

According to two sources, Trump supported this idea. He said the goal of this plan was to "make them (the Russians) feel pain" and force the Kremlin in Russia to come to the negotiating table.

A Western official who knew about the call said that this conversation shows that Western countries, who are partners with Ukraine, increasingly want to give Ukraine long-range weapons that can "take the war to Moscow." US officials have also privately agreed with this idea in recent weeks.

Both the White House and the Ukrainian President's office did not reply to the Financial Times' request for comments.

Three people who knew about the matter said that Trump and Zelensky's talks led to the US giving Zelensky a list of possible weapons for Kyiv last week in Rome.

Zelensky met with US defense officials and people who work between NATO member countries. He received a list of long-range strike systems. These weapons might be given through a third country.

Ukraine had asked for Tomahawk missiles. These are accurate cruise missiles with a range of about 1,600 kilometers. However, one source said that like the previous Biden government, the Trump government is worried that Ukraine might not use them responsibly.

Two sources also said that a weapon discussed recently by the US and Ukraine is the "Army Tactical Missile System" (ATACMS).

Ukraine has used US-supplied ATACMS missiles to attack targets in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine. Some have even hit deep inside Russian territory. But these missiles have a range of 300 kilometers, which is not enough to reach Moscow or St. Petersburg. (Translator: Hong Pei-ying / Editor: Yang Chao-yan) 2025/07/15
