            <h1>Night Market Fight: Taichung Police Arrest 3, Find Undocumented Workers and Illegal Employer</h1>
            <p>A Vietnamese man named Mr. Wei was eating at Hanhsi Night Market in Taichung. He got into an argument with another person from Vietnam. Mr. Wei then teamed up with two friends to hit the other person and run away. Police later found the three people in Dali District.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Police Department's Third Precinct said today that they received a report on September 6th about a fight with many people in the night market. However, when the police arrived, everyone involved had already left.</p>
            <p>Police formed a special team. They looked at security camera videos to find the people by their cars. On September 10th, they found the suspects in Dali. When police went to the area, they saw Mr. Wei and his friends getting into a car driven by an employer, Mr. Jiang. Police quickly stopped the car and arrested all three people involved in the fight.</p>
            <p>Police found that Mr. Wei was unhappy because he thought the Vietnamese person had bumped into him while he was eating. So, he and his friends, Mr. Tai and Mr. Chou, who are also from Vietnam, beat the person. This also caused damage to things in the shop, like cups.</p>
            <p>When police arrested Mr. Wei, they also found two undocumented workers from Vietnam, Mr. Pei and Ms. Deng, in the car. After questioning, Mr. Wei and his two friends were sent to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for causing a public fight. The undocumented workers were sent to the National Immigration Agency to be dealt with. Police are still looking for the person who was attacked.</p>
            <p>Also, the employer, Mr. Jiang, gave jobs to these illegal workers. He will be reported to the Taichung City Government's Labor Bureau for a fine because he broke the Employment Service Act.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Education Gives "Apricot Garden Fragrance Award," Hopes to Inspire More Teachers to Keep Their Beliefs</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education held an awards ceremony today in Nantou County for the "Apricot Garden Fragrance Award." The National Education Agency said that many educators work hard without being noticed. They use their passion and actions to help students grow. The award aims to show great appreciation and encourage more teachers to hold onto their good beliefs.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education's National Education Agency held the "Apricot Garden Fragrance Award" ceremony today at National Chung Hsing Senior High School. A total of 65 education staff and 10 groups received awards. Peng Fu-yuan, the Director-General of the National Education Agency, said that everyone nominated had moving stories and important actions. They are role models in education. Just being nominated is a high honor. He hopes the awards will inspire more educators to stick to their original goals and be brave to try new things.</p>
            <p>The National Education Agency said in a press release that Lin Jin-hua, a staff member at Taichung City Dali High School, is not a teacher who stands in front of a class. However, she has spent many years helping students. She actively cares for students who need help and assists student athletes in applying for financial aid for school. She acts as strong support for the children. She also got special certifications to help improve access for people with disabilities. She is like a "godmother" to the students, giving full support from training to emotional help.</p>
            <p>The National Education Agency also said that Hsu Rui-hua, a director at National Guanshan Industrial and Commercial Vocational High School, has worked in rural areas for 42 years. She has visited homes in 16 townships, going to mountains and across the sea, never giving up on any student. One student had mental health problems and could not go into the classroom. Hsu Rui-hua had countless talks, home visits, and worked with different teams to help the student return to school and go to college. Hsu Rui-hua uses her love and strong will to protect the hope of every child.</p>
            <p>Li Hong-wen, a director at Pingtung County Zaixing Elementary School, brightens students' lives with his love and patience. Twenty years ago, Li Hong-wen encouraged a young girl who felt sad because her family was poor. He told her, "You will become a great person." Many years later, this girl also became an elementary school teacher. She wrote a letter to thank Li Hong-wen for his encouragement that made her dream come true. This teacher-student relationship, which lasted over 20 years, is a perfect example of how warm education can be.</p>
            <p>Wu Xiao-fang, a teacher at National Hemei Experimental School, has worked quietly for 35 years. She voluntarily helps with homework and supervises students studying at night. For students with physical disabilities and poor eyesight, she made special 3D teaching tools. This opened a new way for them to learn by touch. Wu Xiao-fang also started a "Morning Glow Arts Camp" and used the "Pygmalion effect" to help students find their skills. This helped children who once thought they had no hope to feel confident again and achieve their dreams.</p>
            <p>The National Education Agency stated that the "Shadow Legend Troupe," which won a group award, was started by Xiao Ru-xun. Three generations of his family have worked together. They have been at Taipei City Dali Elementary School for 20 years. They work hard to turn shadow puppetry into lessons that are both educational and artistic. The troupe mixes fairy tales, cartoons, and different languages. They also created puppets and stages that have national patents. This broke old traditions, bringing new life to shadow puppetry. It also helps students change from being audience members to creators, moving from behind the scenes to the stage, and even to international stages.</p>

            <h1>Defense Stocks Fall After Big Gains: Thunder Tiger and Lungteh Shipbuilding Hit Highs Then Drop Below a Key Price Line</h1>
            <p>Stocks related to defense and drones have risen a lot in the third quarter because the government supports them. Today, even though TSMC helped the Taiwan stock market reach a new high, many people sold their defense stocks to make a profit. Companies like Thunder Tiger and Lungteh Shipbuilding reached their highest prices ever this morning but then fell. Thunder Tiger dropped 5.05%, and Lungteh Shipbuilding dropped 9.34%. Both fell below their 5-day moving average, which is a common line used to track stock prices.</p>
            <p>The Taipei International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition will start on September 18th. This event has made drone and unmanned boat stocks more popular recently. Thunder Tiger and Lungteh Shipbuilding both opened today at new record high prices of NT$191 and NT$214. However, because these stocks have made big profits for investors recently, many people sold them today to take their earnings.</p>
            <p>Thunder Tiger opened today at a new high of NT$191. This is more than double its low price of NT$62.2 on July 22nd. It closed at NT$178.5, which is a big drop of 5.05%. It also fell below its 5-day moving average of NT$180.7.</p>
            <p>Among drone stocks, Mid-light Electric reached a high of NT$141 on September 4th. This was more than 1.55 times its low price of NT$55.2 on July 4th. Today, it closed at NT$112.5, dropping 6.49%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense announced earlier that it will start a project to buy nearly 50,000 military drones that are also for commercial use. This project could be worth up to NT$50 billion. This news has caused a big increase in the prices of drone and defense stocks.</p>
            <p>Thunder Tiger Technology recently said it will show a new 6-meter "SeaShark 600 Stealth" unmanned surface vehicle (USV) at the Taipei International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition. They hope to get a large order from the Ministry of National Defense, which plans to buy over 1,300 unmanned boats. This could be worth tens of billions of NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Lungteh Shipbuilding, a company that makes unmanned boats, also reached a new record high price of NT$214 this morning. Its stock had risen 86% since August 22nd, when it was NT$115. Today, people sold their shares to take profits, and the stock closed at NT$184.5, a daily drop of 9.34%. Other important aerospace and defense stocks, AIDC and Evergreen Aerospace, also fell. They dropped 5.51% and 2.06% respectively, both falling below their 10-day moving average.</p>
