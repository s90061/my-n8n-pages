A large Chinese tugboat named "United Ocean Engineering 5001" reportedly entered Taiwan's territorial waters without any interception, carrying an unknown cargo. The Hengchun Coast Guard's PP3559 vessel apparently took no action, citing an inability to receive the ship's signal. Taiwan ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone) has issued a warning, expressing concern about the "United Ocean Engineering 5001"'s unclear intentions. There are fears that if it is towing large military equipment or engaging in 'grey zone' intrusions, potentially damaging Taiwan's undersea cables, it should be closely monitored and intercepted.
