            <h1>North Korea Tests Two New Anti-Aircraft Missiles, Kim Jong Un Watches</h1>
            <p>North Korea's state media reported today that its leader, Kim Jong Un, watched the test-firing of two "new" anti-aircraft missiles. This happened after North Korea said South Korea was causing problems at the border.</p>
            <p>The official news agency, KCNA, said the tests on Friday showed that these new missile systems are very good at fighting.</p>
            <p>The report did not give many details about the new missiles. It only said they use "special and unique technology" for how they work and respond. The report also did not say where the tests happened.</p>
            <p>KCNA stated, "These tests proved that both types of missiles are very good at hitting different things in the air."</p>
            <p>South Korea's military said yesterday that some North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the heavily guarded border between the two Koreas on August 19. South Korea's military fired warning shots. North Korean state media quoted military leaders who called this a "planned and intentional act to cause trouble."</p>

            <h1>North Korean State Media: Two New Anti-Aircraft Missiles Successfully Tested</h1>
            <p>North Korea's official news agency, KCNA, reported today that its leader, Kim Jong Un, watched the test-firing of two "new" anti-aircraft missiles. This news came after North Korea accused South Korea of causing tension at the border.</p>
            <p>The report said that the tests, which happened yesterday, showed that these new missile systems have "excellent fighting abilities."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and US Little League Baseball Play in Williamsport; Coach Says: "Don't Worry About the Other Team"</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese young players will play against the US team in the Williamsport Little League World Series tomorrow. They will try to win the championship, which they haven't won for a long time. The head coach of the Taipei Dongyuan Elementary School team, Lai Min-nan, who represents the Asia-Pacific region, said he is sure they don't need to worry about the other team. He believes Lin Jin-tse should start as pitcher, and two other pitchers are ready to help in the middle or end of the game. He called this the perfect plan.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's young team has made it to the championship game in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, this year. Everyone from other countries and the 10 US teams is talking about them. They are wondering if Taiwan can win again, having already won 4 games.</p>
            <p>The Taiwanese team played very well and excitingly in the international championship game. Their pitchers threw well, and their fielders played strongly. The Aruba team had many chances to score, but Taiwan's good pitching and fielding stopped them every time.</p>
            <p>Coach Lai Min-nan of Dongyuan Elementary School has 30 years of experience coaching Little League baseball. His decision about changing pitchers in the last part of Friday's game caused some discussion.</p>
            <p>After the game, he told reporters that before the game, he told all the players to be ready. He prepared for different situations, including having two starting pitchers. So, Lin Jin-tse was not on the first list of starting pitchers. He was getting ready to pitch at any time if needed. His arm is fine now. The first pitcher (Liu Wei-heng) pitched for more than 5 innings, which was better than expected. In the end, they used the relief pitcher Chen Qi-sheng, who finished the game and helped them win.</p>
            <p>Coach Lai Min-nan explained that the players had never seen such a big event. In an unexpected situation, they made the relief pitcher come in early. With players on base, the pressure was even higher for both pitchers. But letting the relief pitcher play early helped him get used to the situation. If he walked a batter, it wouldn't be a big problem because first base was empty. This way, he could get used to the field and the situation. The relief pitcher finally saved the game.</p>
            <p>About playing against the champion from the 10 US teams, he said, "We don't need to worry about the other team. Lin Jin-tse should definitely start as pitcher, and the other two pitchers will be ready to help in the middle or end of the game. This is the most perfect plan."</p>
            <p>Dongyuan Elementary School has won all 4 of their games, and Coach Lai Min-nan's choices for players have also been talked about. He said that from the game against Mexico to the international championship, his decisions about pitchers were correct. The pitchers played very well, just as he expected, giving up fewer and fewer runs, and even no earned runs. In today's international championship game, they only used one pitcher.</p>
