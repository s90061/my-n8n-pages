Apple has announced a new partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. Soon, the artificial intelligence (AI) features of ChatGPT will be built directly into Apple's iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems. This change is expected to happen later this year with the release of iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and iPadOS 18.

This new integration means that Apple's voice assistant, Siri, will become much smarter. If Siri cannot answer a question, it will be able to ask ChatGPT for help. Users will be able to use ChatGPT for free without needing to sign up for an account. Apple has said that user privacy is a top priority, and requests sent to ChatGPT will be kept anonymous. This move is seen as a big step for Apple to compete in the fast-developing AI world and for OpenAI to reach more people.

**Extreme Heatwaves Affecting Many Parts of the World**

Many countries in the Northern Hemisphere are currently experiencing extremely hot weather. Temperatures are reaching over 40 degrees Celsius in many places, breaking previous records. Scientists believe these very hot periods are happening more often and becoming more intense because of climate change.

This extreme heat is creating serious health dangers for people. It is also putting a lot of pressure on electricity systems, as more people use air conditioning. Farmers are struggling because their crops are damaged by the heat. Daily life is also changing, with many schools and businesses closing. Emergency services are receiving many more calls for help. This situation shows how global warming is already affecting people around the world.

**Rise of Digital Nomads Changes Global Travel**

More and more people are now working remotely, meaning they don't need to go to an office. This has led to a big increase in "digital nomads." These are people who travel around the world while working online. They can do their jobs from almost anywhere as long as they have an internet connection.

This growing trend is changing the travel industry. Tourist destinations and hotels are now trying to attract these digital workers. Some countries are even offering special visas that allow people to live and work there for longer periods. Hotels are adding co-working spaces and faster internet to meet their needs. This change is also having an effect on local cultures and economies, bringing new chances and sometimes new challenges for the places where digital nomads choose to live.`;
