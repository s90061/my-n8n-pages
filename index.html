            <h1>Legislature Reviews Child Care Service Law: All Parties Support Government's "Supervision Cloud"</h1>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee reviewed the "Child Care Service Act" bill today. The bill talks about putting cameras in child care centers and sending the video data to a "supervision cloud." Members of parliament from all parties supported the government's plan for this "supervision cloud." However, they did not agree on how many days the data should be saved or if the central government should help local governments build these systems. So, these points will be discussed again later.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee of the Legislative Yuan continued to review the Child Care Service Act bill today. They invited Lu Chien-te, Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, and Chou Dao-chun, acting Director-General of the Social and Family Affairs Administration, to attend the meeting.</p>
            <p>The New Power Party, Taiwan Statebuilding Party, Taiwan Green Party, and Obasan Alliance for Human Rights held a press conference this morning. They said that the most urgent change needed is the "supervision cloud." They want all child care centers to have cameras. This is not for watching them all the time, but to save evidence if something happens. They asked all members of parliament to support this change in the law so that facts can be recorded.</p>
            <p>Article 30 of the Executive Yuan's version of the Child Care Service Act bill says that to keep children safe and save evidence, child care centers must install video cameras. The video and audio data must be saved for at least 30 days. This data should also be sent to an online system set up by the local government. The central government should help local governments set up these online systems.</p>
            <p>During the review of each article, Wang Yu-min, a KMT member of parliament, said this is a very important article. She also said that many child care centers do not like it. They feel like they are seen as people who will always make mistakes, so they need to be watched very closely. Child care centers also worry that they might not be ready with the camera equipment, and they want to know if the government will help them.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min said that because this involves children's rights, child care centers, and the central and local governments have a shared responsibility. She supports the government's version of the bill because it is fair and considers everyone's opinions. She also said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare should talk to the child care providers to help them understand the good intentions of the policy.</p>
            <p>Chang Ya-lin, a DPP member of parliament, said that if something happens, evidence can speak for itself. Schools and parents can get the evidence, and if there is bad treatment, they can find out what happened. She supports the government's version of the article. Wang Cheng-hsu, another DPP member of parliament, said he tends to support the government's version, but he suggested that the videos should be saved for at least 3 months, as "30 days is indeed a bit short."</p>
            <p>Lin Shu-fen, a DPP member of parliament, said that after the law about how money is shared between the central and local governments is changed, the central government will give more than NT$370 billion to local governments. She asked if there would be enough money if the central government "must" help local governments build these systems. Chen Chao-tzu, a Taiwan People's Party member of parliament, asked about the safety standards for the video data. She wanted to know how to stop the videos from being used or shared in the wrong way. She said that "basically, the government's plan is correct."</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te said that everyone in society cares about the "supervision cloud." He said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare will follow the principle of "the best interests of the child" from the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). They will try to find the best solution for children, parents, and child care centers. He asked everyone not to worry, saying that this is to save evidence and also to protect child care workers from being misunderstood. He also mentioned that the central government has limited money, and suggested changing "should" help local governments build systems to "can" help.</p>
            <p>Chou Dao-chun said that when child care centers upload videos to the system, it's like backing them up to the cloud. He said, "We are not doing live online monitoring or using technology for law enforcement." He explained that the videos will only be used to find out what happened if there is a big problem and evidence needs to be saved. Also, he said that permission is needed to watch the videos; they cannot be watched at any time or without a reason. He said that child care workers worry about their privacy, and after the law is passed, they will talk more with them.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min said that the original version of the government's bill was the best. She said that local governments need to do work, and "one side provides the money, the other side provides the effort, which is very reasonable." Lu Chien-te said that after the law on how money is shared between the central and local governments is changed, the central government will have big money problems. He said that building the system costs about 200 million NT dollars, and the central government has its own difficulties, but it will respect the Legislative Yuan's decision.</p>
            <p>In the end, because there was no agreement, Wang Cheng-hsu, who was leading the meeting, said that the related proposals and extra decisions would be kept for future discussions.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Ho An Hospital Long An Branch Incident: Control Yuan Asks 3 Agencies to Review</h1>
            <p>The Control Yuan said today that a patient at Taichung Ho An Hospital Long An Branch was possibly sexually assaulted, and the hospital did not report it right away as required by law. Also, a nursing assistant named Lin hurt a patient who was under supervision. Because of these events, the Control Yuan has asked the Taichung City Government, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Ministry of Justice to review and improve. It has also asked the Executive Yuan to actively promote different ways to supervise people and to prevent cruel treatment.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan shared in a press release that Control Yuan members Wang You-ling and Chi Hui-jung pointed out that in June 2022, Long An Branch knew that a female patient (Patient A) might have been sexually assaulted by a male patient in the same hospital. However, the hospital did not save evidence immediately and did not report it. They only separated the two people involved and talked to the family, thinking it was consensual because the woman's physical condition was better. It was only later, when Patient A called the 113 protection hotline herself, that the case was reported. But because nearly six months had passed, there was not enough evidence, and the prosecutor decided not to press charges.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan members said that after Patient A reported it, the Taichung City Government sent people to investigate and told the police to look into it. However, they did not investigate Long An Branch for breaking the rule about reporting responsibly. Also, from 2022 to 2024, the hospital still got good reviews for its mental health services, which shows that they did not supervise properly.</p>
            <p>Regarding the nursing assistant Lin hurting a supervised patient named Yang, the Control Yuan members found that Mr. Yang was placed under supervision at Long An Branch by the Changhua District Prosecutors Office. The nursing assistant Lin, who hurt him, was hired by Long An Branch to guard patients in the ward. However, she was not checked or trained for security work. She also had a history of hurting people and an angry personality. When she was working, she would threaten, punch, and kick Mr. Yang. Even though the Changhua District Prosecutors Office visited monthly and had a way to communicate with Long An Branch, they could not prevent or quickly handle the violence.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan members stated that the law for carrying out security measures clearly says that for supervision, suitable places should be set up for different types of cases. This should follow principles like "different levels, different ways of treatment," "moving around," "regular checks," and "easy transfers." This is to give different help based on the person's situation. But it has been over 4 years since the law changed, and except for some mental health wards in courts that have opened, other judicial mental hospitals, mental recovery centers, mental nursing centers, and places for people with disabilities are still being planned. This means that local prosecutors still have trouble finding places for supervision.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan members asked the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Health and Welfare to check how things are working in practice. They asked them to consider including mental health facilities and places where security measures are carried out in a "mechanism to prevent cruel treatment." This would involve regular and unplanned visits and systematic checks. They also asked them to look at all rules and set up ways to prevent problems, so that patients and supervised people are not treated badly or cruelly. The "Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment" has not yet become part of Taiwan's law, so the Executive Yuan should work faster to pass this law.</p>

            <h1>Illegal Accommodation Faces Fines Up to NT$2 Million; Travelers Urged to Check Legality</h1>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that illegal hotels can be fined up to NT$2 million (about US$60,000) by law. They ask people to use the Taiwan Stay website to check if a hotel is legal when booking by phone or through online travel agencies (OTAs).</p>
            <p>In August this year, in Jiufen, Ruifang District, New Taipei City, some people complained that their guesthouse bookings were suddenly canceled and prices were raised. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications Tourism Administration today sent out a press release saying that if a travel business is found to be operating illegally, it can be fined up to NT$2 million under the Development of Tourism Act, and must stop operating.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that to protect legal businesses and stop illegal ones, they created the "Taiwan Stay" platform in 2020. This platform lists all legal hotels and guesthouses in Taiwan, so travelers can choose safely and not have bad experiences.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said that for the Jiufen incident in New Taipei, they have asked the local government to investigate and give out fines as required, to show how important legal accommodation is.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration also said that since they started the "Good Host B&B" brand in 2011, nearly 1,900 excellent guesthouses across Taiwan have joined. These selected guesthouses meet six important qualities: "friendly, kind, clean, healthy, safe, and cultured." They are a great example for places to stay when traveling in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration stated that to fight illegal accommodation and prevent tourists from staying in illegal places, which can ruin their travel experience, the Development of Tourism Act was changed and put into effect in April this year. The penalties for illegal accommodation have been made much higher, with the maximum fine being NT$2 million. Also, if illegal businesses advertise their services, the fine is now higher, up to NT$1.5 million.</p>
