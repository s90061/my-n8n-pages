            <h1>Kaohsiung fishing boat loses power and drifts; Penghu and Tainan Coast Guard assist for a safe return</h1>
            <p>A fishing boat from Kaohsiung, named 'Hong San He', lost power today. It was drifting in the waters near Qimei, Penghu, because its engine broke. The Penghu and Tainan Coast Guard teams went to help. They fixed the boat together and then escorted it back to port. All four people on the boat were safe.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard's Thirteenth Patrol Command received a report around 1:10 PM today. It said that the 'Hong San He' fishing boat, with four Taiwanese crew members, was about 23 nautical miles southwest of Qimei. The boat's engine had a problem and it couldn't move. The command immediately told the Penghu Coast Guard team to send a boat to help. They also asked the Tainan Coast Guard team to send a patrol boat to assist.</p>
            <p>The Penghu Coast Guard team reached the boat at 4:06 PM. They went onto the fishing boat and found that its battery was dead, so it couldn't start. After 30 minutes of repairs, the problem was fixed. The 'Hong San He' boat could move again. A Tainan patrol boat then went with the 'Hong San He' boat back to the harbor. The captain thanked the Coast Guard very much for helping them quickly.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard advises all boats to check their engines carefully before going out to sea. This helps keep everyone safe. If there is an accident at sea, people can call the Coast Guard's free emergency number '118' or tell them through a fishing radio station. The Coast Guard will come to help right away to keep people and their property safe.</p>

            <h1>Peng Jin-long: Bank account freezing follows a reasonable notification principle, should be restored as soon as possible afterwards</h1>
            <p>Recently, some banks have frozen people's accounts without warning. They did this to help stop fraud and control risks better. This made many people upset. Today, Peng Jin-long, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), talked about whether banks should tell customers before freezing accounts. He said it is hard to tell customers beforehand. But banks should tell customers after the account is frozen and help them get their account back to normal quickly.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long led a regular press meeting today to answer questions from reporters.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if banks should tell customers before or after freezing accounts. Peng Jin-long said that the FSC is very careful about fraud. He explained that financial companies are also victims of fraud, not the ones causing it. So, the FSC must help financial companies in the fight against fraud.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long said that the FSC will not stop fighting fraud. He added that the FSC's goal to stop fraud will not change, but the methods might. They will listen to suggestions and change how they do things. Many plans are already being put into action, such as asking the Bankers Association to start a 'Committee for Preventing Financial Fraud'.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long also said that the FSC will not tell everyone how banks freeze accounts or why customers' accounts get frozen. This is because fraudsters would learn these methods. However, if banks handle things unfairly, the FSC will ask them to make changes right away.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long noticed that the number of suspicious accounts is not increasing as before. This is because more banks are finding good ways to make it harder and more expensive for fraudsters to use financial companies. He stated, 'We will not give up. We will continue our work, and we will make our methods better,' including focusing on 'precise fraud prevention.'</p>
            <p>Regarding the account freezing system, Peng Jin-long explained that there is a rule for reasonable notification. It is not good to tell people before their accounts are frozen. But after, banks can use different ways to help customers get their accounts back to normal quickly.</p>
            <p>Deputy Director-General Chang Chia-kuei from the Banking Bureau added that if an account still needs to be watched, banks should tell the customer in a proper way, as long as it does not stop the control from working. Also, for accounts that are being watched, banks should have a quick way for customers to complain and get help.</p>
