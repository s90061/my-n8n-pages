            <h1>Scammers Pretend to Be Officials, NCC Suggests Blocking Calls with Hidden Numbers</h1>
            <p>Recently, some people have received calls from hidden numbers. The caller said they were officials from the National Communications Commission (NCC). They falsely claimed that the person's mobile phone number had problems. They used this trick to scam people out of millions of New Taiwan Dollars. The NCC said today that they do not call people first. Also, they never use hidden numbers to contact people. These kinds of calls are scams.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency's "165 Anti-Scam Dashboard" recently shared a story. A person got a call from a hidden number. The caller said they were an NCC official. They lied and said the person's phone number had a problem, and that someone might be using their identity. Then, they told the person to talk to fake lawyers and police. They asked the person to pay for "evidence fees" and "deposit money." They tricked the person into giving them millions of dollars.</p>
            <p>The NCC posted on Facebook that they do not call people first. If you get a call from a hidden number and the person says they are from the NCC, it is a scam call.</p>
            <p>The NCC also reminded everyone to be very careful when they see calls from hidden numbers. If you are not sure, please call the "165 Anti-Scam Hotline" right away to check.</p>
            <p>The NCC said that recently, there are still scams where people pretend to be government offices and use hidden numbers. To lower the risk of being scammed, the NCC suggests that people can set their phones to reject calls from hidden numbers. For landline phones, people can ask Chunghwa Telecom for the "Call Filtering" service. This service will automatically reject calls with hidden numbers or send them to voicemail.</p>
            <p>If you use an iOS phone, there is a function called "Silence Unknown Callers." This can make calls from people not in your contacts or people you have not talked to before (including hidden numbers) silent. To do this, go to "Settings," tap "Phone," and then turn on "Silence Unknown Callers."</p>
            <p>If you use an Android phone, most models can use a setting to "Block Unknown Numbers." This will directly reject calls from hidden numbers. To do this, open the "Phone" app, go to "Settings," find "Blocked numbers," and turn on "Block unknown callers" or "Block unknown numbers."</p>
            <p>The NCC suggests that if older people at home do not know how to set this up, family or friends can help them. Or, they can take their phone to a nearby telecom shop and ask for help.</p>

            <h1>Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi Dies at 101; "Murayama Statement" Apologized for Past Aggression 50 Years After War</h1>
            <p>Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi passed away today at a hospital in Oita City. He was 101 years old and died from old age. Murayama made a speech called the "Murayama Statement" 50 years after the war. In this statement, he accepted that Japan had ruled and attacked other countries in the past. He said Japan wanted to face history, admit its aggression, deeply think about it, and apologize. This was a very important moment in Japan's history of government.</p>
            <p>Oita TV reported that Murayama was born in Oita City on March 3, 1924. He was the sixth child out of 11 brothers and sisters.</p>
            <p>In June 1994, Murayama became the 81st Prime Minister. This happened when the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the New Harbinger Party formed a shared government. He was the first Prime Minister from Oita Prefecture. In 1995, which was 50 years after the end of World War II, he gave the "Murayama Statement."</p>
            <p>The "Murayama Statement" was approved by the Cabinet on August 15, 1995, and then made public. People had very different opinions about it. However, later Prime Ministers, Koizumi Junichiro and Abe Shinzo, both used words like "deep reflection" from the "Murayama Statement" when they gave their speeches 60 and 70 years after the war.</p>
            <p>But, some people in Japan thought that the "Murayama Statement" blamed Japan too much. They believed it hurt Japan's good name and national interests.</p>
            <p>When Murayama was interviewed this year, he said, "It helps to build trust with other Asian countries if we admit past mistakes, apologize, and show we want to be a peaceful country. This is also important for Japan's future." He also said he was "very happy to see that later governments continued to use (the statement). It became a base for good relationships with Asian countries."</p>
            <p>Murayama said he would leave his job in January 1996. He was Prime Minister for 561 days. After he left office, he became the first leader of the "Social Democratic Party," which used to be called the "Socialist Party." In 2000, he stopped running for elections and left politics completely. After that, he lived a calm life at home with his family.</p>
            <p>When he turned 100 in 2024, Murayama said, "I don't especially feel 100 years old. I just live simply and let things happen naturally. I feel very happy that I can spend time with my family every day."</p>
            <p>Murayama lived to be 101 years old. Among all Japanese Prime Ministers, only Higashikuni Naruhiko lived longer, at 102 years old.</p>

            <h1>Lu Chin-kai Acquitted in Retrial of 30-Year-Old Murder Case, High Prosecutors Office Appeals</h1>
            <p>Lu Chin-kai, a baker, was involved in the murder of a female university student from National Chung Hsing University in 1993. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison. After Lu Chin-kai asked for a new trial, which was approved, the High Court said he was not guilty at the end of September this year. The High Prosecutors Office believes that the first trial did not have enough reasons for its decision. So, they have appealed the case today.</p>
            <p>In 1993, a female student from National Chung Hsing University went for an interview at an apartment on the 3rd floor in Zhonghe City (now Zhonghe District, New Taipei City). A tutoring center had arranged this meeting. Later, she died. Police looked into the case and thought that Lu Chin-kai, a baker who lived in the apartment, and his friend Chen Hsi-ching, who was staying with him, were very likely involved. At the beginning of 1994, both men were caught.</p>
            <p>The police said that Chen Hsi-ching, who had a record of public indecency, went to stay with Lu Chin-kai after he was released from prison on December 17, 1993. They had met in prison. On December 22 of the same month, Chen Hsi-ching pretended to look for a tutor. The tutoring center then sent the female university student for an interview. Chen Hsi-ching and Lu Chin-kai together held the student down and sexually assaulted her. They also used sanitary pants to tie a knot around her neck, which caused her to die from not being able to breathe.</p>
            <p>The first court sentenced Chen Hsi-ching and Lu Chin-kai to death. The Supreme Court sent the case back many times. In the sixth retrial, the Taiwan High Court decided that Lu Chin-kai had tied sanitary pants around the student's neck, but it was not the cause of death. It was Chen Hsi-ching who later decided to tie a deadly knot, which led to the student's death. Because of this, Lu Chin-kai was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sexual assault and attempted murder. Chen Hsi-ching was sentenced to death.</p>
            <p>After the sixth retrial, Lu Chin-kai decided not to appeal, and his sentence became final. Chen Hsi-ching continued to appeal. In 2009, the Supreme Court decided to sentence Chen Hsi-ching to death, and this became final. Lu Chin-kai was released from prison on parole in 2012. He asked for a new trial. The Taiwan High Court agreed to a new trial. The prosecutors appealed this decision, and the Supreme Court canceled it and sent it back. In April this year, the High Court again agreed to a new trial. After hearing the case, on September 25, they said Lu Chin-kai was not guilty because there was not enough evidence. The High Prosecutors Office believes that the first trial did not have enough reasons for its decision, so they have appealed today.</p>
