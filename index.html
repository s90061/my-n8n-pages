            <h1>University Games Support Station Landlord Supports Taiwan: Will Keep Showing Taiwan's Flag Proudly</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lin Shang-ying, Berlin, July 24) During the World University Games in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany, the landlord of the Taiwan team's support station in Essen was asked by the city government to take down the flag. This morning, the landlord said that he will "continue to show the Taiwan flag proudly" to support Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team rented a physical therapy clinic called "Physiotherapie Essen â€“ Phillip DÃ¶rmann" in Essen, one of the host cities for the World University Games. This place is used as a support station, offering daily training, care, and rest areas for Taiwanese athletes.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday (July 22), the Essen Mayor's office asked Phillip DÃ¶rmann, the landlord of the support station, to take down the Taiwan flag hanging outside his clinic. After hearing about this, Taiwan's representative in Germany, Hsieh Chih-wei, wrote a letter to Essen Mayor Thomas Kufen to protest. He also sent a copy of the letter to Mr. DÃ¶rmann, who is in charge of the clinic and the support station.</p>
            <p>Today, Hsieh Chih-wei shared Mr. DÃ¶rmann's reply on his personal Facebook page. Mr. DÃ¶rmann said, "My team and I fully support Taiwan!" He also said that he and his clinic team are very happy to serve the Taiwan team during the World University Games.</p>
            <p>Mr. DÃ¶rmann believes that Taiwan's flag should be displayed inside and outside the physical therapy clinic during the games. He said he was "very surprised and disappointed" about the city's request to take down the flag. He also said sorry to Taiwan for the trouble this caused.</p>
            <p>He also promised that Physiotherapie Essen â€“ Phillip DÃ¶rmann will use its social media and other ways to keep "showing the Taiwan flag proudly."</p>
            <p>Mr. DÃ¶rmann's words touched Hsieh Chih-wei very much, and he shared the original letter on Facebook. Yesterday morning, Hsieh also received a formal reply from Essen Mayor Kufen. In the letter, Mayor Kufen formally apologized to Taiwan because his office had asked Mr. DÃ¶rmann to remove the Taiwan flag.</p>
            <p>The Rhine-Ruhr World University Games are held from July 16 to 27. Taiwan sent 196 athletes to compete in 15 sports. Following the experience from last year's Paris Olympics, the Taiwan team set up a support station. This station provides food, physical therapy, sports protection, nutrition, and mental health advice to support the athletes outside the competition venues.</p>
            <p>Physiotherapie Essen â€“ Phillip DÃ¶rmann has a perfect 5.0-star rating on Google Maps and is also a friendly place for LGBTQ+ people. Besides the clinic's original space and equipment, teams from Taiwan's National Sports Training Center and National Sports Science Center also brought their own equipment. This allows athletes to exercise or use physical therapy and sports protection services at the support station whenever they need to.</p>
            <p>During the games, Mr. DÃ¶rmann's team posted on the clinic's official Instagram. They said it was "a great honor" to welcome athletes from Taiwan during the World University Games. They also praised the Taiwan support station team for their hard work, strong feelings, and team spirit.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Men's Basketball Loses Closely to Poland by 2 Points at Universiade, Misses Best Historical Record</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chen Jung-tsen, Taipei, July 24) Today, the Taiwan men's basketball team played a game for 9th to 12th place at the World University Games in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. Even though Hsu Te-chi scored the most points for the team with 17 points and 5 assists, Taiwan still lost to Poland 87 to 89. This means they will not break their best record in team history.</p>
            <p>At the last World University Games in Chengdu, China, the Taiwan men's basketball team got 11th place, which was their best record ever. This time, team captain You Ai-che, who plays overseas, led the team again, along with other Taiwanese professional basketball players like Lin Hsin-kuan and Chen Fan-po-yen. However, they only won one game in the group stage, so they could not get into the top 8. Luckily, after beating India by a large score yesterday, the Taiwan men's basketball team moved on to the games for 9th to 12th place.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's basketball team played against Poland. They wanted to win and get into the game for 9th or 10th place, which would be their best record ever. They started the first quarter well. But in the second quarter, they didn't shoot as well, and Taiwan was behind by 2 points at halftime.</p>
            <p>After halftime, the game was still very close. The Taiwan team kept the score tight. At the start of the fourth quarter, they scored 9 points to Poland's 3, taking the lead again. Even though Poland caught up later, Li Yun-chieh and Sung Hsin-hao made three-point shots near the end of the game, helping Taiwan tie the score. This gave them a chance to play in overtime.</p>
            <p>However, when they were behind by 2 points, Hsu Te-chi took the last shot but missed. So, the Taiwan men's basketball team lost to Poland. This means they just missed breaking their best record in team history. Next, they will play against Latvia for 11th place. If they lose that game, they will finish the World University Games in 12th place.</p>
            <p>In this game, five players from the Taiwan men's basketball team scored ten or more points. Hsu Te-chi scored the most with 17 points, and also had 5 assists and 2 steals. The shooter Li Yun-chieh played for less than 12 minutes but scored 14 points very effectively, including 4 three-pointers. Captain You Ai-che showed his all-around skills, getting 10 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals.</p>
