            <h1>Taiwan Literature Museum to Hold "Autumn Literary Market" for 22nd Anniversary on October 18</h1>
            <p>The National Taiwan Literature Museum is getting ready to celebrate its 22nd anniversary. The museum announced today that its "Autumn Literary Market" will start on October 18 and last for two days at the museum. It will offer a cultural experience with different brands, food, and music.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Literature Museum said today that this year's "Autumn Literary Market" will focus on the idea that "literature is a conversation." It will include elements of local languages, connecting independent bookstores, art, international cultures, special foods, and music shows.</p>
            <p>The market will have almost 100 stalls with quality brands, food, music, and talks. There will also be 6 special booths from the Czech Republic. In addition, there will be 3 discussion talks, 1 art project where people create together, and 9 music performances. These events will bring together different languages and creative backgrounds for cross-cultural conversations.</p>
            <p>The market is planned with five themed areas: Book Forest Island, Language Island, Literature Island, Food Island, and Wind Sound Island. These islands will be both inside and outside the museum, forming an "Autumn Literary Island." This will let visitors have their own literary conversations in different parts of the museum.</p>
            <p>This year marks 100 years since the birth of writer Yeh Shih-Tao. The Yeh Shih-Tao Literature Memorial Museum will also set up a special post office. It will have a unique stamp for a limited time. Visitors are welcome to "write a letter to Elder Yeh."</p>

            <h1>Hou Jin-ying, Daughter of Hou Yu-li, Helped Many Financial Leaders in Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Hou Jin-ying, who was the chairperson of Far Eastern International Bank, passed away on October 3 at the age of 95. Hou Jin-ying taught at National Chengchi University for over 30 years. Many important people in finance, like Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long and former Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Huang Tien-mu, either took her classes or were her students. Because she taught so many people, Hou Jin-ying was called "Taiwan's Godmother of Finance." Hou Jin-ying saw Taiwan's financial system change, moving towards more freedom, and now to a time with many different financial companies. She spent her whole life helping finance grow and left behind a great example for bankers.</p>
            <p>Hou Jin-ying's father, Hou Yu-li, was a very important person in the Tainan business group. He started his business by selling cloth. Even though Hou Jin-ying came from a rich family, she worked hard to make her own path in life. She was the first woman to get a master's degree from National Taiwan University's Economics department. There, she met her husband, Liang Kuo-shu, who later became the Central Bank Governor. They then went abroad to study more.</p>
            <p>When she came back to Taiwan, she became a teacher. She taught in the Department of Public Finance and the Department of Banking at National Chengchi University and also became the head of the Banking Department. Former Premier Lin Chuan, Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long, former Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Huang Tien-mu, and former Bank of Taiwan Chairman Lu Chu-cheng all either took her classes or were her students. Hou Jin-ying once said, "My special right was just to enjoy the congratulations from my student leaders."</p>
            <p>Lu Chu-cheng remembered that when he became the Minister of Finance, Hou Jin-ying gave him a small plush dog doll to encourage and bless him. Huang Tien-mu said that the kind "Teacher Hou" once gave him a glass lion. She encouraged him, a gentle person, to bravely move to a higher position.</p>
            <p>Even though she was happy about her students' achievements, Hou Jin-ying always said humbly, "Young people need to work hard by themselves. Teachers can only help a little, it's not that great!"</p>
            <p>Besides teaching many students, Hou Jin-ying was very smart and knowledgeable. In the late 1960s, she studied new economic ideas from around the world and wrote "Modern Monetary Economics." This was the first textbook on monetary economics written by a local scholar. She also worked with Liang Kuo-shu on writings that suggested international economic and trade policies. They were not only a great couple in the finance world but also the best partners in academics, always helping each other learn.</p>
            <p>After Liang Kuo-shu passed away in 1995, Hou Jin-ying became the chairperson of the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance. She wanted to continue her husband's idea of training financial talent in Taiwan. With her strong will and hard work, she overcame problems like not enough equipment and money. She successfully changed and improved the academy, creating Taiwan's first financial training and testing center that met international standards. This made it a key place for training financial talent in Taiwan and an important link for Taiwan's financial industry to connect with the world.</p>
            <p>In 2008, Hou Jin-ying moved to the business world and became the chairperson of Far Eastern International Bank. She led the bank to become a professional and refined bank in Greater China, even in a very competitive financial environment. Even when she was over 90 years old, she personally led shareholder meetings. She looked energetic when she reported on the bank's performance, which left a deep impression on people.</p>
            <p>In September this year, the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance and the Department of Finance at National Chengchi University started the "Jin-ying Lecture" series of courses. This continues Hou Jin-ying's ideas about education.</p>
            <p>Hou Jin-ying once said, "I just do every small thing carefully and seriously, that's all." This idea is simple, but it is not easy to do. Hou Jin-ying worked hard for Taiwan's financial industry all her life, and her example as a great banker will always be remembered.</p>

            <h1>0050 Becomes the Largest Taiwan Stock Fund, Surpassing Allianz Income & Growth Fund</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market is reaching new highs, led by TSMC. Because of this, the value of the Yuanta Taiwan 50 (0050) ETF has also grown a lot. Today, its total value reached NT$767.3 billion. This means it has become bigger than the Allianz Income & Growth Fund, which used to be the largest actively managed Taiwan stock fund with NT$75.6 billion. Now, 0050 is the biggest Taiwan stock fund by value.</p>
            <p>Fund companies say that in the past, investors in Taiwan liked foreign funds that pay dividends and are actively managed. The Allianz Income & Growth Fund was the biggest of these. However, in recent years, investors in Taiwan have started to prefer passively managed ETFs. Among these, 0050 is the first ETF in Taiwan. It has been around the longest and is also the biggest. The fact that 0050's value has now gone past the Allianz Income & Growth Fund is a very important sign.</p>
            <p>The 0050 ETF mainly follows the top 50 biggest listed companies by market value in Taiwan. It has benefited from Taiwan's stock market often reaching new highs recently. This is especially true because the latest increase in the market has been led by large companies like TSMC. So, 0050 has gained a lot from this, and its total value has gone up quickly.</p>
            <p>Also, Yuanta Funds greatly lowered the fees for 0050 earlier this year. After that, they split the ETF to make it easier for more people to invest. This successfully brought in many investors and was a key reason for 0050's value to grow.</p>
            <p>The total value of 0050 has reached new important levels many times. In early September, it passed NT$700 billion and became the biggest Taiwan stock ETF. In less than a month, on October 2, its value passed NT$750 billion. Based on how its fees are calculated, which go down as its value grows, its management fee is now less than 0.1%. Today, its value went over NT$760 billion, making it the biggest fund in Taiwan, whether actively or passively managed.</p>
