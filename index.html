            <h1>China's Property Whitelist Approves 30 Trillion Yuan; Promotes "Good Houses"</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development announced yesterday that a "whitelist" plan for building projects has already approved over 7 trillion Chinese Yuan (about 30 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) in loans. This plan aims to help construction projects get money and finish unfinished buildings. The next step is to make "good houses" that are safe, green, and smart, by focusing on five things: good standards, good design, good materials, good construction, and good maintenance.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Chinese media like "First Financial" and "Cailian Press," the State Council Information Office of China held a press conference yesterday morning. The topic was "Successfully Finishing the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025)."</p>
            <p>Dong Jianguo, the Vice Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said that the national "whitelist" projects have approved over 7 trillion Chinese Yuan in loans. This has greatly helped to ensure that commercial housing projects are built and given to buyers. For selling houses, they are also slowly moving towards selling completed houses. This helps to stop problems with not being able to deliver houses. During the "15th Five-Year Plan" (2026-2030), they will keep working closely with other government departments to set up a new way for the real estate market to grow.</p>
            <p>Also, Ni Hong, the Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, said that "good houses" are what many families dream of for a better life. The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development is focusing on 5 key areas: good standards, good design, good materials, good construction, and good maintenance. By working on these five things, they believe that "good houses" will be available to buyers during the "15th Five-Year Plan."</p>
            <p>Ni Hong said that they want designers to work hard on housing problems. This year, nearly 2,000 plans were submitted for the National Residential Design Competition. These plans include not only new houses but also ideas for improving old houses to become "good houses." They are also working to develop new building materials for "good houses," such as green materials, to make homes better.</p>
            <p>Ni Hong mentioned that the "Residential Project Standards" officially started on May 1st this year. These standards say that new homes should be safe, comfortable, green, and smart. They also have rules about ceiling height and soundproofing. For example, new residential buildings must have ceilings at least 3 meters high, and buildings with 4 floors or more must have elevators.</p>
            <p>The report noted that "good houses" were mentioned in the government's work report for the first time this year. The 2025 government work report stated that they want to "meet people's needs for high-quality living, improve standards, and build safe, comfortable, green, and smart 'good houses'."</p>
            <p>"First Financial" reported that since China's "Good House" building system was developed, 88 projects have started using it. This includes 74 commercial housing projects and 14 affordable housing projects. These projects cover a total area of 12.87 million square meters, including 1,052 residential buildings and over 65,000 homes. They are in 20 provinces, autonomous regions, and cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Hunan.</p>
            <p>In addition, during the "14th Five-Year Plan," a total of 5 billion square meters of new commercial homes were sold across China. At the same time, the market for existing homes continued to grow. Currently, in 15 provinces and cities across China, more second-hand homes are sold than new homes.</p>
            <p>To solve the problem of real estate companies running out of money and to make sure buildings are finished, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and the Financial Regulatory Administration together announced the "Notice on Establishing an Urban Real Estate Financing Coordination Mechanism" in January 2024. This is also called the real estate "whitelist" mechanism. It gives loans from state-owned banks to building projects approved by the government. This policy has been in place for 1 year and 9 months.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Police Debunk False Rumors of 100 Deaths in Guangfu Disaster Area</h1>
            <p>In Hualien, a dam made of earth and rocks in the Mataâ€™an River broke, causing a disaster. Many people called "shovel heroes" came to help in the affected areas. However, some false rumors started spreading online, saying that hundreds of people died in the disaster area. The Hualien County Police Department quickly asked the person spreading the rumor to explain and told people not to break the law.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Police Department said that while everyone was working hard to rescue people in the Guangfu disaster area, many shocking false rumors and fake news appeared online. Some rumors made the number of deaths much higher than it was, and others unfairly criticized the government's rescue efforts. This greatly hurt the work of government agencies trying to help and people's trust in the government. It also made the rescue workers feel less motivated.</p>
            <p>The police said that a 40-year-old man named Zhong from northern Taiwan came to help with the rescue on his own. Without checking the facts, he posted on his online account that hundreds of people had died in the disaster area. This caused a lot of shock and fear among the public.</p>
            <p>The government groups responsible for the rescue quickly went online to say the information was false. Some people also replied to Mr. Zhong's post, saying it was not true. The Hualien County Police Department immediately asked Mr. Zhong to explain where he got the information. After the police told him it was fake news, Mr. Zhong quickly apologized and corrected his post online.</p>
            <p>Chen Bailu, the head of the Hualien County Police Department, said that in a time of free speech, people should be careful to check if information is true before sharing it. They should avoid spreading fake news, which can cause fear and tension in society. If they do, they could break Article 53 of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act and Article 63 of the Social Order Maintenance Act.</p>
