            <h1>Kaohsiung City Government Invites Bids to Build 12-Hectare Sports and Leisure Park</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Government held a meeting today to invite companies for the "Niaosong District Shanshui Section Sports and Leisure Zone Public Urban Renewal Project." This project will create a 12-hectare multi-purpose sports and leisure park. The total area is 12.43 hectares, and the total investment is expected to be 18 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Government explained that this is a public urban renewal project focused on sports, leisure, and healthy living for older adults. It will use the good location near the MRT Yellow Line to encourage development around public transport (TOD). This will create a multi-purpose sports and leisure park. The city government also set up a clean government platform to make sure the bidding process is open, fair, and just.</p>
            <p>Director-General of the Sports Development Bureau, Hou Zun-yao, said that this project covers 2.87 hectares for sports and leisure, plus 5.45 hectares for a stadium and 4.02 hectares for nearby park building and care. The total area is 12.43 hectares, with a total investment of 18 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The company chosen for the project must plan at least 1,200 ping (about 3,960 square meters) for sports facilities and 500 ping (about 1,650 square meters) for urban renewal education public space. They must also rent Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium for 9 years and 11 months. They must hold at least 50 baseball events each year, with at least 30 games being Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) first-team matches. They will also donate a large scoreboard for the outfield. This will help upgrade and keep the stadium running well.</p>
            <p>Director-General of the Urban Development Bureau, Wu Wen-yen, said that the city government started reviewing urban plans because of the stadium upgrade and the development plans for MRT Yellow Line stations Y3 and Y4. Last December, the Ministry of Interior's Urban Planning Committee approved the plans. This set the development goal for the area in front of Chengcing Lake, creating the basis for inviting bids for this project.</p>
            <p>The Urban Development Bureau stated that this project has the advantage of two MRT stations. It will connect the Zhongzheng living area and the Fengshan Benkan business area, serving about 80,000 consumers. It will also attract about 400,000 potential consumers from Fengshan and Niaosong. This will create a one-day shopping area that combines sports, leisure, business, and healthy living for older adults.</p>
            <p>The deadline for submissions for this project is February 25 next year. The city government said that to encourage more teams to join, the deadline for questions has been extended to November 3. This is to make sure companies have enough time to offer new ideas. Quality teams are welcome to bid.</p>

            <h1>Su Chiao-hui Suggests Making Urban Renewal an Official Industry, Cho Jung-tai Agrees</h1>
            <p>Today, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Su Chiao-hui questioned why there are fewer urban renewal projects compared to old and dangerous building projects. She said the main reasons are that review times are too long and property rights are too complicated. She suggested that besides changing the Urban Renewal Act, urban renewal should become a regulated industry. Premier Cho Jung-tai replied that making management organizations official is a goal for the government. Next year's central government budget will include rewards to help this industry grow.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan continued its general policy questioning of the Premier this afternoon.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui said during her questioning that there are fewer urban renewal projects than projects for old and dangerous buildings. She used the Grand Hotel and Leofoo Hotel as examples. She noted that the Grand Hotel's project was approved in 6 months, and Leofoo Hotel's in just 2 months. Both chose to rebuild old and dangerous buildings instead of urban renewal.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui explained that the first reason is that urban renewal review times are too long, and the timeline is unclear, making costs hard to estimate. Another reason is that property rights are too complex, taking a lot of time to sort out. The Urban Renewal Act has been in place for 27 years and completed 1,200 projects. The Old and Dangerous Building Act started 8 years ago and has completed 4,500 projects. She suggested that the government should think about changing the law. Urban renewal should follow the example of old and dangerous building projects to make review standards clearer.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai stated that the Ministry of Interior has many ways to help local governments. This makes urban renewal policies easier to access. It also relaxes rules for organizations that manage all parts of a project.</p>
            <p>Minister of Interior Liu Shyh-fang said that they are currently working to change the Urban Renewal Act. This will simplify urban renewal, including administrative processes and changes in rights, to encourage more people to join.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui said another reason urban renewal is slow is complex property rights. For property owners, there are no special benefits from the government. If the government leads the way in private land urban renewal, it would also help. Besides changing the Urban Renewal Act, she asked if there is a chance to make the urban renewal industry officially managed, similar to how real estate agents are managed by the Real Estate Brokerage Management Act.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that making management organizations official is a goal and direction for the government. Next year's central government budget will also have related rewards. They hope to help the industry grow.</p>
            <p>Liu Shyh-fang also said that a special law is one idea, and putting it into the Urban Renewal Act is also an idea. The main point is to make it professional and for the government to be able to oversee it. Once it becomes an industry with licenses, people who want urban renewal will trust it. Both a special law or changing the Urban Renewal Act can be considered.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that President Lai Ching-te has often asked to improve the speed of urban renewal. This is important for housing quality, housing safety, and the look of the city. Urban renewal must be strongly promoted. To boost local demand in the future, large-scale domestic construction also needs urban renewal.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that besides current government-led and self-initiated urban renewal, the government is looking into "independent urban renewal." This would allow homeowners to pay less in administrative fees. They would not have to share land or building space with developers. They could have more usable area for themselves. Instead of working with a developer, they might work with a construction management company. This company would provide building, financial, and administrative support during the review process. Property owners would not have to pay such a high cost to improve their living environment.</p>
