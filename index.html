            <h1>India Sends Women to UN Peacekeeping Missions, a Big Success</h1>
            <p>Since 1950, India has been an important country sending troops to United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions. For 75 years, India has sent more than 290,000 peacekeepers and joined 50 missions.</p>
            <p>Lieutenant General Rakesh Kapoor from the Indian army, who is in charge of information systems and training, said that this meeting is an important place for countries to talk, work together, and understand each other. They will also discuss how countries should work to keep peace, as written in the UN Charter.</p>
            <p>Kapoor told a CNA reporter that in 2007, India sent a special team made up entirely of women to work in Liberia. This was the first time in the world this had happened. Now, Indian teams all over the world have women members. This shows that India cares about women's rights in places where there is fighting.</p>
            <p>Kapoor said, "India started something new for UN peacekeeping missions because we sent a team of all women to Liberia. After that, all our teams have had women in them. They have good communication with the local women."</p>
            <p>Kapoor also said that when conflicts happen, women and children are the most affected and weakest. So, it is very important to understand the problems women face and help them be more careful.</p>
            <p>Kapoor told the CNA reporter that the Indian women soldiers are role models for women in conflict areas. In every society, women are important for shaping public opinion. "Our women soldiers can inspire local women. They can show them that women are accepted and can join in social activities. This helps the local society develop in a good way."</p>
            <p>India's peacekeepers work with peacekeepers from all over the world. They work in very difficult and unstable places to keep peace, safety, and human dignity. They do their jobs with bravery and skill. They have earned the respect of the people in the countries they serve. But 182 of them have died bravely so far.</p>

            <h1>Mid-Autumn Festival Holiday: Cleaning and Plumbing Heroes Help Hualien Disaster Victims Make Their Homes Brighter</h1>
            <p>Today is the first day of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Many volunteers came to Guangfu, Hualien. They changed their shovels for brooms and squeegees. Also, "plumbing heroes" came to help. Together, they helped victims clean their homes and fix their water and electricity. The asphalt roads are now visible, and the floors in homes are no longer covered in grey mud.</p>
            <p>The overflowing of the blocked lake in Mata'an Stream caused a disaster. Over 1,800 homes in the Guangfu area of Hualien were affected. Thanks to the hard work of the "shovel heroes," the first part of cleaning mud from homes is almost finished. The second part, which is detailed cleaning inside homes and fixing water and electricity, still needs more people to help.</p>
            <p>According to Taiwan Railways statistics, by noon today, more than 20,000 people had left Guangfu Station. Volunteers wearing rain boots used brooms, mops, and water hoses to go into homes. The floors and walls, which were black and grey, are now much cleaner.</p>
            <p>"Plumbing heroes" also showed up, carrying water hoses and toolboxes. A plumber from Yilan said that light switches and power outlets had mud in them. They need to check all electrical systems in the affected homes first. After seeing how much mud there is, they can start fixing things.</p>
            <p>Plumbers from Kaohsiung came to Guangfu to help during the holiday. While they were holding water hoses on the side of the road, disaster victims stopped them to ask for help.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin, a plumber from Tainan, said that if they only change things like power outlets and light switches, each home could be finished in about half a day. But he is worried that mud might have entered the pipes and damaged the materials. This could cause short circuits later. So, he suggests that residents replace all the wiring in their homes, which would take at least one day.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsieh, who lives on Dunhou Road, stood at her door and thanked the volunteers passing by. She said that she saw the large amount of mud that was there before. Now it is all gone. She is thankful for the help from volunteers everywhere. She feels closer to going home once the water and electricity are fixed.</p>
