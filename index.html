            <h1>White House Limits Political Speech After Kirk's Death, Trump Supporters Divided</h1>
            <p>After the American political internet celebrity Charlie Kirk was killed, the White House started to control what people say politically. However, conservatives have different opinions about this. Some agree with limiting what they call hate speech. Others warn that the Trump government is going too far.</p>
            <p>Kirk, 31, was shot and killed on September 10 while giving a speech at Utah Valley University. On September 12, officials said that Tyler Robinson, 22, was arrested for Kirk's murder.</p>
            <p>After the event, President Trump and other important officials publicly warned that bad things said by left-wing groups would not be accepted.</p>
            <p>Pam Bondi, the Attorney General, promised to take legal action against people who spread hate speech. Brendan Carr, the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), threatened to take action against TV and radio companies after a TV host said something he disagreed with.</p>
            <p>Vice President JD Vance believes that people who celebrated Kirk's death should lose their jobs. Secretaries Marco Rubio and Pete Hegseth have already punished foreigners and military members who celebrated Kirk's assassination.</p>
            <p>But many important conservatives do not agree with the government's actions.</p>
            <p>Republicans like Karl Rove, who was an advisor to former President George W. Bush, Texas Senator Ted Cruz, and conservative writer Tucker Carlson, are worried. They fear that Kirk's death is being used to stop people from having different opinions or to limit free speech. They think this could be bad for Republicans if Democrats are in power in the future.</p>
            <p>Cruz said on his own podcast, "If the government gets involved and says, 'We don't like what your media says, and you will be banned if you don't say what we want to hear,' this is definitely not good for conservatives."</p>
            <p>He called Carr's threat to fine TV and radio companies or take away their licenses "very dangerous."</p>
            <p>Trump strongly supported Bondi and Carr. But in an interview on September 19, he did not explain the difference between "cancel culture" and "consequence culture." Instead, he criticized the questions as a trick. He told reporters in the White House, "I strongly support free speech," but also complained that the media always reports unfairly about him.</p>
            <p>Taylor Budowich, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, said that Trump's team is working on an official order about political violence after Kirk's death. He also said again that they fully support free speech.</p>
            <p>He said in a message, "People are free to speak their minds. However, sometimes if you don't have anything good to say, it's best to say nothing. Some people should remember this idea."</p>

            <h1>World Athletics Championships: Botswana Wins Africa's First Gold in Men's 1600m Relay</h1>
            <p>The final of the men's 1600-meter relay race at the 2025 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, Japan, happened today. The team from Botswana won by a very small amount, beating the United States and South Africa. This makes them the first African country to win a gold medal in the men's 1600-meter relay at the World Championships.</p>
            <p>During the race today, it was raining very heavily. The American team was in the lead for most of the last part of the race.</p>
            <p>However, Busang Collen Kebinatshipi, a 21-year-old runner from Botswana, ran very well. In the final section, he ran faster than his South African and American competitors. This helped the Botswana team win the gold medal with a time of 2 minutes and 57.76 seconds.</p>
            <p>The American team has won an amazing 9 gold medals in the men's 1600-meter relay at the past 10 World Athletics Championships. This time, they got a silver medal with a time of 2 minutes and 57.83 seconds. They just barely beat South Africa, who got the bronze medal, by only 0.002 seconds.</p>
            <p>Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, a 24-year-old sprint runner, led the American women's team today. They won the gold medal in the 400-meter women's relay with a time of 41.75 seconds. She is now the second woman in history to win three gold medals in sprint races at one World Championships.</p>
            <p>Jefferson-Wooden also won gold medals in the women's 100-meter and 200-meter races at this championship. She has now matched the record of three gold medals set by Jamaican runner Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce at the 2013 Moscow World Championships.</p>
            <p>Today, the Jamaican team, led by Fraser-Pryce, won the silver medal in the women's 400-meter relay with a time of 41.79 seconds. The German team got the bronze medal with a time of 41.87 seconds.</p>

            <h1>Offshore Banking Units' Profits Up 70% in First 7 Months, Reaching NT$54.6 Billion</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced new numbers for the three main offshore financial centers. Offshore Banking Units (OBUs) earned NT$54.6 billion before tax in the first seven months of the year. This is a 70% increase compared to last year. The FSC explained that this happened because people expect interest rates to go down. Also, the total amount of foreign currency deposits and their costs have decreased. This means banks paid less in interest, which helped OBUs make more money.</p>
            <p>The FSC is promoting three big international financial services. These are Offshore Banking Units (OBU), Offshore Insurance Units (OIU), and Offshore Securities Units (OSU). People often call these the "Financial 3O."</p>
            <p>According to FSC data, by the end of July, there were 59 OBUs. This included 35 local Taiwanese banks and 24 foreign banks. In July alone, OBUs earned NT$7.49 billion before tax. This was a decrease of NT$970 million, or 11.47%, from the previous month.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jia-kui, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC Banking Bureau, said that the monthly decrease in July was mainly because US customs rules are still uncertain. This caused the net income from investments to fall. However, if we look at the first seven months, the pre-tax earnings were NT$54.6 billion. This is a big increase of NT$22.49 billion, or 70%, from the same period last year. This increase was mostly due to expectations of lower interest rates and a drop in both the amount of foreign currency deposits and their costs. Because banks paid less in interest, their profits for the first seven months went up.</p>
            <p>Offshore Insurance Units (OIUs) saw a big jump in pre-tax earnings in July, reaching US$2.127 million. This was an increase of US$1.453 million from the previous month and the highest profit in the last five months. Cai Huo-yan, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC Insurance Bureau, said that the increase in monthly profit was because life insurance companies had losses in June from selling financial assets. This problem was not there in July, which helped profits go up. Property insurance still saw a decrease in monthly profit because of old contract losses that were still causing problems. Reinsurance companies, however, made more money because they released some money saved for claims.</p>
            <p>For the first seven months, OIU pre-tax earnings were US$10.371 million, which is 35.85% less than last year. Cai Huo-yan explained the reasons. Life insurance companies earned less from interest. Property insurance companies changed how they calculated estimated premiums because they wanted to control risks from natural disasters, and they also had more claims. Only reinsurance companies had a good effect from releasing money saved for claims.</p>
            <p>In July, there were 2 OIU policies, and the total premium income was US$488,000. Life insurance companies did not sell any policies in July, and this has been true for several months. Overall, for the first seven months, only life insurance saw a drop in premium income. Property insurance and reinsurance, however, saw growth.</p>
            <p>Offshore Securities Units (OSUs) had pre-tax earnings of US$5.16 million in July. This was a decrease of US$9.34 million from the previous month. For the first seven months, OSU pre-tax earnings were US$40.15 million. Huang Zhong-hao, the Chief Secretary of the FSC Securities and Futures Bureau, said this was mainly because oil prices changed a lot from June to July. This caused brokers who deal with oil ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) to lose money.</p>
