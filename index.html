The United States plans to stop Chinese citizens and other "foreign rivals" from buying farmland. This is because of worries about national security. China's embassy in the US said that making China's investments a political issue will make other countries lose trust in the American market.

The US government announced this plan on July 8. Brooke Rollins, the US Secretary of Agriculture, said that foreign groups buying American farmland are using it "as a weapon against us." She added that the "Chinese Communist Party buying US farmland" has happened many times.

By the end of 2023, China was the 20th largest foreign owner of US farmland, with about 112,234 hectares. One of the biggest Chinese owners is Smithfield Foods, which was bought by a Chinese company in 2013.

**Taiwanese Editor Hu Yang-hua in Hollywood: Good Editing Makes You Forget It's There**

Taiwanese film editor Hu Yang-hua has been asked to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in the US. He has worked in Hollywood for over ten years. He believes that movies can help people experience different lives. He thinks that a film editor's job is an "invisible art." The best editing makes viewers forget that it is even there.

Hu Yang-hua is 39 years old and from Taiwan. After studying at Taipei National University of the Arts, he went to the US in 2010 to study film. He then started working in Hollywood. Now, as an editor, he can vote for the Oscar awards. He feels that his journey from Taiwan to Hollywood and becoming a member of the Academy is "amazing."

Hu Yang-hua explained that film editors are the last people to work on a movie. They take all the parts, like the script, the actors' performances, and the filmed scenes, and put them together. They decide the movie's speed and feelings. He believes that if people watch a movie and say, "That was a great film," instead of "The editing was great," then the editor did a good job. The goal of editing is to make viewers completely lost in the movie, so they don't even notice the cuts.

**Typhoon Danas Lands Twice in Zhejiang, Then Moves Southwest to Fujian**

After Typhoon Danas left Taiwan, it moved towards China. Last night at 9 PM, Danas first landed in Wenzhou, Zhejiang, but then quickly moved back to the sea. At 11 PM last night, it landed again in Ruian, Zhejiang. After that, it changed direction to the southwest and entered Fujian today. Because of this, Fuzhou announced that all schools in the city are closed for today.

Danas's path is very unusual. After landing in China, it moved southwest, which is rare for a typhoon. Besides going from Zhejiang into Fujian, it might also go into southern Jiangxi and northern Guangdong. This has caused a lot of talk among people in China.

Many people and weather experts in China have called Danas's path "strange" or a "U-turn." Some worry that even if Danas becomes a weaker storm, its leftover clouds could still bring heavy rain to inland areas and cause damage. But others think the rain from the typhoon will help cool down the hot weather.
