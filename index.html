            <h1>US Commerce Secretary Talks About "50-50 Share" in Trade Deal with Taiwan, Focusing on Chip Making</h1>
            <p>The US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, spoke yesterday about a trade agreement with Taiwan. He keeps suggesting a "50-50 share" for making computer chips, meaning the US and Taiwan would each make half. He also said that if the US has enough chips made at home, it can better protect Taiwan, which is different from the usual idea of the "silicon shield."</p>
            <p>"This is a very important agreement that is coming soon. I think we will start talking with them (Taiwan) and working this out very quickly," Lutnick told the American news channel NewsNation.</p>
            <p>When asked what the US wants from a trade deal with Taiwan, he explained that 95% of the chips in phones and cars are made in Taiwan. Taiwan is 9,000 miles away and only 80 miles from China. He noted that Beijing has clearly said it wants to take Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said that the Trump government wants to move a lot of chip manufacturing to the US. This way, the US can make its own chips. "How can you protect yourself if you can't make your own chips?" he asked.</p>
            <p>Lutnick pointed out that when he became Commerce Secretary, only 2% of chips used in the US were made there. His goal is to reach 40% before he leaves. This goal seemed almost impossible because it would need over 500 billion US dollars (about 15.2392 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) and a full supply chain. But this is his aim.</p>
            <p>"So, getting Taiwan to join and agree to be part of the supply chain is the magic of the Trump government."</p>
            <p>He said this is not a natural choice for Taiwan. Taiwan's natural thought is: "We make 95%, and we are happy with that." But Trump would say: "This is not good for you, and it's not good for us. Because we protect you, and if we are to keep protecting you, you must help us become reasonably self-sufficient."</p>
            <p>Taiwan worries that if it loses the "silicon shield," the US might not protect it if China takes military action. Lutnick argued that if Taiwan has 95% of the chips, how would the US get those chips to protect Taiwan? Would they send them by plane or ship? The US must rely less on Taiwan's chips.</p>
            <p>So, he suggested the "50-50 share" idea to Taiwan: the US makes half, and Taiwan makes half. Lutnick said that even with this, the US would still deeply depend on Taiwan, "because we cannot live without the other half." But if the US has half of the chips, it would be able to do what is necessary.</p>
            <p>He said this is how the US thinks. They have told Taiwan that it is very important for the US to make 50% of its own chips. Currently, Taiwan makes 95% of the world's chips. A "50-50 share" will need a lot of talking, but it is what the US is working towards.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's temporary 20% tariff rate has started. Lutnick first announced on September 11 that a big agreement with Taiwan was coming. The Executive Yuan's Office of Trade Negotiations said the next day that tariff talks between Taiwan and the US are still moving forward, and they are waiting for the US to arrange a final meeting.</p>

            <h1>Shooter Killed, At Least 2 Dead and 9 Hurt in Michigan Church Shooting and Fire</h1>
            <p>Police in the US said that a Mormon church in Grand Blanc, Michigan, was attacked with gunfire and fire today. At least two people died and nine were hurt. The shooter was a man from Michigan and he was killed. US President Trump has also posted about this event.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that police said the shooter drove his car into a church of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also called the Mormon Church) during a large service. Then he started shooting, and the church caught fire.</p>
            <p>People close to the situation told CNN that some of the injured were seriously hurt, and children were also among them.</p>
            <p>Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said the fire has been put out. Police think the shooter started the fire on purpose. "Investigators are still working out when the fire started and what caused it," he said. He also thought that more dead people might be found once officers can safely go inside the church.</p>
            <p>Renye also said that the shooter was killed after he shot at law enforcement officers. Police confirmed the shooter was a 40-year-old man from Michigan.</p>
            <p>Grand Blanc is about an hour's drive north of Detroit, a big city in Michigan.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that US President Donald Trump posted about the event on his social media, "Truth Social," today. He called it "quite terrible" and said, "The bad guy is dead, but many things are still unclear. This seems to be another attack targeting American Christians."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press quoted local police saying that there is no more danger to the public from this incident.</p>
