A British F-35 stealth fighter jet landed in India in June after having problems during a training exercise. It was on the HMS Prince of Wales aircraft carrier. Now, a team of 40 people will go to India to try to fix it. However, sources say the jet might be taken apart and sent back to the UK by a military transport plane.

The HMS Prince of Wales and its ships were in the Indo-Pacific area in June. They planned to visit Singapore, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India.

The Hindustan Times reported that on June 14, a British Navy F-35B stealth jet took off from the HMS Prince of Wales. It had an issue during a training exercise and had to land quickly at an airport in Kerala, India, where it has been ever since.

A group of British experts was supposed to arrive in Kerala on July 2 to fix the jet, but their trip was delayed. A team of 40 people is now expected to leave the UK on July 5 to try to deal with the jet.

Sources told the Press Trust of India (PTI) that the F-35 stealth jet, which costs over 110 million US dollars, is still there. A small team of six people from the HMS Prince of Wales is guarding it.

India Today mentioned that the F-35 has been worked on many times since it landed, but it still can't be fixed. So, it remains in Kerala. Because of bad weather and heavy rain, India suggested moving the F-35 into a hangar. The UK first said no but later agreed to move it inside.

The UK is not sure when the F-35 can be fixed. Taking some parts of the jet apart and sending it back to the UK by military transport plane seems to be the best plan right now.

NDTV reported that the UK might use a C-17 Globemaster transport plane to take the F-35 back to the UK. However, because the C-17 is not very wide inside, parts of the F-35, like its wings, must be removed before it can fit.

If the UK decides to fly the jet back home, they will have to take the F-35 apart. Since the F-35 has many secret parts, trained engineers must do this work, and the British military must watch closely.

**High Security Risks with Xiaohongshu and Douyin: Information Security Institute Suggests Checking Permissions and Choosing Apps Carefully**

The National Security Bureau recently said that five Chinese appsâ€”Xiaohongshu, Weibo, Douyin, WeChat, and Baidu Cloudâ€”have security risks. The Institute for Information Security (IIS) today suggested that people regularly check their phone app permissions and be careful about where they get apps. This will help prevent personal information from being stolen or used improperly by the Chinese government.

The IIS sent out a press release, asking people to be more aware of cybersecurity. They should pay close attention to what information apps collect and what permissions they ask for when downloading or using them.

The National Security Bureau, the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, and the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the National Police Agency checked Chinese apps like Xiaohongshu, Weibo, Douyin, WeChat, and Baidu Cloud. They used the "Mobile Application App Basic Cybersecurity Testing Standard v4.0" set by the Ministry of Digital Affairs. The checks found many high-risk activities, showing serious problems with cybersecurity protection in Chinese-made apps.

Based on the National Security Bureau's findings, the IIS looked at six possible security risks and their effects. First, collecting sensitive information: for example, if people look for nearby hospitals at home, the app might record their location and what they searched for, learning about their health.

Second, reading saved content: personal photos, work presentations, medical records, or financial reports on a phone could be read by an app and sent back to a distant server to be looked at and used. Third, apps asking for more permissions than they need to work.

Fourth, getting system information: apps can get and look at a list of programs installed on a user's phone and device details to create a profile of their habits. Fifth, getting biometric information: face information is very sensitive. If it gets out, it could be used to pretend to be someone else or to commit fraud.

Sixth, sending data back and sharing it: this risk means an app might send phone data, personal user information, and other things to servers in China or share it with other companies without the user knowing.

The IIS gave an example: an app might automatically send contacts, location information, device details, and personal information like usernames and passwords saved on different online platforms to servers outside of China without the user knowing. This could mean the information is given to Chinese national security, police, or intelligence departments, allowing the Chinese government to use Taiwanese people's personal information further.

The IIS said that if a personal phone or mobile device becomes a security weakness, it could be used by Chinese hackers to get into government databases, which would be very bad. For internet security and personal data safety, the IIS suggests: 1. Before installing an app, carefully read the permission requests and privacy rules. 2. Regularly check phone app permission settings and turn off permissions that are not needed. 3. Choose apps from trusted sources first and avoid installing unknown programs. 4. Use security tools to watch data transfer and unusual actions. 5. Before giving sensitive information to an app, think about if it's reasonable and necessary.

**US Wants to Separate China: New York Times Says Trade Deal with Vietnam Is a Key Step**

The United States and Vietnam have made a trade agreement. The US will put tariffs (taxes) of 20% on goods exported from Vietnam and 40% on goods re-exported through Vietnam. The New York Times reported on July 3 that this is an important step for the US to try and separate China. However, it might also cause problems for countries in Southeast Asia.

The New York Times reported on July 3 that the US putting a 40% tariff on goods re-exported through Vietnam is aimed at China. This is because China has been using countries like Vietnam to avoid US tariffs. As other Southeast Asian countries try to avoid high US tariffs, this rule might become a common part of trade deals between the US and those countries.

The report said that the details of the agreement are not yet clear. For example, it's not known if "re-exported goods" means goods that originally came from China or goods made in Vietnam that have a certain amount of Chinese parts. However, this could cause problems for Southeast Asian countries.

Some American business groups said that if re-exported goods include products using Chinese parts, American companies would move their production out of Vietnam. If it's cheaper to produce in China, they might even move production back to China.

Some Southeast Asian countries have recently taken steps to watch re-exported products more closely. The Thai government thinks that strict checks on re-exported goods could mean Thailand's exports to the US drop by 15 billion US dollars. The US had previously asked the Thai government to check foreign investments and stop Chinese companies from coming into Thailand. Thailand has promised to check foreign investments more strictly in areas like electric vehicles.

On the other hand, many Southeast Asian countries are worried about how China will react to being separated. The Chinese government has said it might take action in return, like boycotting products from those countries or limiting the export of important minerals to them. The Chinese government has also made the situation in the South China Sea more tense, using military actions to strengthen its claims over most of the waters.

Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, said, "This is a big gamble, to see how the US, China, and companies in other countries will react." The US wants to push China out, but countries like Vietnam taking the US's side could have risks for the region's politics.
