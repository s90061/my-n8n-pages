            <h1>Kaohsiung Mountain Areas Damaged; Mayor Chen Estimates NT$1 Billion Needed for Repair, Hopes for Faster Rebuilding</h1>
            <p>Recent heavy rains have caused many roads in the mountain areas of Kaohsiung to collapse and lose their foundations. Mayor Chen Chi-mai said that about NT$1 billion will be needed to repair the damage. He hopes that the parliament will support rescue efforts and help speed up rebuilding for the people affected.</p>
            <p>This morning, Chen Chi-mai went with Premier Cho Jung-tai to Liouguei District. They checked the road repair work for Baolai No. 2 Bridge and the search for a car that fell at the 81-kilometer mark on Provincial Highway 20. Chen then spoke to the media at the Baolai fire station of the Kaohsiung City Government Fire Department's Sixth Brigade. He said that the heavy rains badly damaged farm roads and forest roads. Also, fixing streams, mudslide warning areas, and large collapse warning areas will cost about NT$1 billion. He hopes the central government will help speed up rebuilding in the disaster areas.</p>
            <p>Chen explained that so far, 3,143 people have been moved to safety in Kaohsiung. There are about 10 places where the road has collapsed on Provincial Highway 20, between Baolai and Taoyuan District, showing much of the ground underneath. Also, the Talalalufo Bridge is now twisted. Its safety will be checked first. Chen hopes the central government will give special funds for rebuilding roads and bridges.</p>
            <p>Chen said that nearly 3,000 residents in Taoyuan District use the Southern Cross-Island Highway as their main road. The heavy rains caused serious damage. He hopes Provincial Highway 20 can be opened again quickly. Also, Provincial Highway 29 often has landslides and falling rocks during typhoons and heavy rains. The Minsheng Bridge was planned to start being rebuilt between 2027 and 2028. He hopes this work can start immediately after the disaster to make sure people in Namasia and Taoyuan districts can travel smoothly.</p>
            <p>Chen also suggested that the standards for mudslide and large collapse areas should be higher. Several mudslides and collapses happened in areas not marked as mudslide warning areas. He hopes the Ministry of Agriculture will make standards stricter and mark and monitor areas that might be at risk to keep people safe. He also hopes the Soil and Water Conservation Agency will check and expand the areas for protection based on the flooded or mudslide warning areas in Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung after this event, to prevent more disasters.</p>
            <p>For daily needs, Chen asked the Agriculture Bureau to work with local farmers' associations. They should send 500 kilograms of pork, fresh fruits, and vegetables to each area. They should use the break in the rain to send these supplies to the mountain communities as soon as possible. He also asked people not to use parts of Provincial Highway 20 where the ground has collapsed. These sections are only for supervised travel. Except for going to the hospital, helping with the disaster, or delivering daily supplies, no one is allowed to pass. If supplies need to be transported, the Baolai fire station can be used as a base, and the Taoyuan District Office will transport them more safely.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rains Hit Southern and Central Taiwan; Army Helps with Recovery in Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung</h1>
            <p>Recently, heavy rains caused damage in many parts of central and southern Taiwan. The Army's Fourth Combat Zone, which handles rescue and operations in the south, said today that troops have been sent to Tainan's Longci, and Kaohsiung's Liouguei, Namasia, and Maolin areas to clear mud and sand. The Fifth Combat Zone, which handles rescue in central Taiwan, has gone to Chiayi and other places to help with the disaster.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Combat Zone, which is in charge of military operations and disaster relief in southern Taiwan, stated in a press release that the strong rainfall caused by the southwest monsoon is expected to decrease, but local heavy rains might still happen in the mountains of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. Therefore, according to the local government's need for troops, the necessary people and machines for recovery after the disaster are ready. Troops have been sent to Longci in Tainan, and Liouguei, Namasia, and Maolin in Kaohsiung to clean up mud and sand and to help move people out before problems happen.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Combat Zone stated that they will keep working closely with local governments and private groups to clean and disinfect areas. They will also help people get back to normal life as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Also, the Fifth Combat Zone, which handles military operations and disaster relief in central Taiwan, also said in a press release that recent heavy rains caused a lot of damage in the Chiayi area. Some areas still need to be repaired. Today, 60 soldiers were sent to Shuiä¸Š, Puzi, and Chiayi City in Chiayi County to clear roads and remove fallen trees.</p>

            <p>London police said today that a man in his 40s died after falling from a high place at Wembley Stadium in London last night. He was at an Oasis concert.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, this famous British rock band is on a world tour, playing together again after many years. The Gallagher brothers, Liam and Noel, told the BBC that they were "shocked and sad" about the fan's death.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police in London said that they received a call around 10 PM local time last night. The call reported that someone was "seriously hurt" in the crowded stadium. Police and medical staff quickly arrived at the scene.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said the man, who was in his 40s, had clear injuries from a fall and was declared dead at the scene. Police are asking anyone who saw what happened to contact them.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Wembley Stadium also shared their sorrow with the family of the dead person. However, they said that the Oasis concert planned for tonight would still happen.</p>
            <p>Oasis broke up because the Gallagher brothers did not get along for many years. This is their first time playing together in 16 years. They are on a 41-show world tour, and tonight is the last show in London.</p>
            <p>So far, about 900,000 tickets have been sold for the tour. After London, they will play in Edinburgh, then go to countries like the United States, Japan, Australia, and Brazil.</p>
