        const text = `**Cambodia's Dark Past: Three Genocide Sites Become World Heritage**

Three places in Cambodia, known for torture and executions, have now become UNESCO World Heritage sites. Fifty years ago, the Khmer Rouge government did terrible things there, causing many deaths.

From 1975 to 1979, about 2 million people in Cambodia died. They died from hunger, forced labor, torture, or in mass killings.

The new World Heritage sites include two former prisons and a "killing field" where thousands of people were executed.

Cambodia's Prime Minister, Hun Manet, said that this new status should remind everyone to always protect peace. He added that they can learn from their country's darkest history to make a better future for everyone.

Two of the new sites are in the capital city, Phnom Penh: the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the Choeung Ek Genocide Centre. The third site, M-13, was an important early Khmer Rouge prison in the countryside of Kampong Chhnang province, but now it's just an empty field.

**Green Party Says Cash Handout is to Stop Recall Vote; Hou Yu-ih Says Government Should Understand People**

The Legislative Yuan in Taiwan has passed a special law for giving money to everyone. The Green Party says this is to save the KMT (Kuomintang) from a big recall vote. However, New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih said today that the ruling party should understand how hard people are working, instead of stopping helpful policies for political reasons.

Yesterday, the Legislative Yuan approved a special law proposed by the KMT. This law sets aside up to 545 billion New Taiwan Dollars for special projects, and it says that each person will get 10,000 New Taiwan Dollars.

Hou Yu-ih said that KMT lawmakers are working hard for the people, hoping to give money to more people who are struggling. He believes this will help the economy for those who need it. He added that when times are tough, the government should understand and be kind to people. He thinks everyone should work together, and not use political fights or recall votes to stop good policies.

About the big recall vote, Hou Yu-ih said that southern Taiwan is having "big power cuts and big floods," but the government is focused on "a big recall vote." He thinks this is not what people want, and people are tired of political conflicts, especially because recall votes waste a lot of effort and money. He hopes that people who disagree with the recall vote will ask others to vote "no" on July 26th, to show they are against the government's conflicts.

**After Exams: Experts Tell Parents How to Support Their Children**

The advanced subject tests have finished. Counselors are advising parents not to start by asking, "How do you think you did?" Other things not to say include blaming words like, "I told you so!" If a child feels sad or doubts themselves for more than two weeks, it's a good idea to seek professional help.

Today was the last day of the 2025 advanced subject tests. Some students will be happy with their results, and some will be sad. Lan Yi-feng, the head of the Taipei City Counseling Psychologist Association, said that students are feeling both worried and relieved right now, and they might not show their stress.

If parents want to ask about the exams, she strongly suggests not asking directly, "How did you do?" This might make it hard for the child to answer. Instead, parents can say "You worked hard," or "Now that the exams are over, is there anything you want to share with us?" These are more positive ways to ask.

Lan Yi-feng said it's important for children to feel supported and cared for. Some parents might not talk about the exams at all, which is okay, but they should let their children know that if they want to talk, their parents will listen. This helps children feel safe.

Lan Yi-feng also said that if a child says they didn't do as well as they hoped, parents might quickly say blaming things like, "I told you so!" This doesn't help the situation and might make the child feel even worse.

Children who didn't do well might feel sad, and this can affect their daily life. Signs to watch for include changes in sleep or eating habits (eating too much or too little, sleeping too much or too little), or becoming shy and not wanting to be with others. Some children might even have very negative thoughts or words, like feeling worthless or believing that failing the exam means they are a complete failure.

Lan Yi-feng emphasized that learning to deal with difficulties comes from experience. Life is long, and not doing well in one or two exams doesn't mean everything will be bad. Children need time and space to feel better. If their sadness lasts for more than two weeks, it's good to get help from a professional, like a counselor or a psychiatrist.
