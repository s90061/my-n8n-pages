            <h1>Miaoli Road Work Stops After Finding Old Objects</h1>
            <p>Miaoli County's road widening project between Zhunan and Toufen has stopped. Workers found old objects that might be from the Shanjia historical site. The county government's transport department said the work has stopped. They have sent a plan to dig up and save the old objects to a special committee.</p>
            <p>The areas of Zhunan and Toufen in Miaoli County are growing fast. More people live there, and more cars use the roads. This is because of the Hsinchu Science Park nearby. A road from Gongyi Road in Zhunan to Xinyi Road in Toufen is a quick way to the science park. But the old road was only 2.5 to 5.5 meters wide, which made it hard for cars to pass. Local people asked for the road to be made wider.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Che-chun, from the county's transport department, told the CNA news agency today that the road project is more than 600 meters long. It will become 12 meters wide. The total cost is 181.8 million New Taiwan dollars. The main government will pay 154.53 million, and the county will pay 27.27 million. The work started in August this year and was planned to finish by the end of next year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang explained that the road project is near the Shanjia archaeological site. When the project started, the law said they must check for old objects. Recently, during the work, a company hired to check found pieces of pottery and stone tools. These looked like they were from the Shanjia site. They told the county's culture department right away. The building company has now asked to stop the work for a short time.</p>
            <p>The transport department said they are now taking off the top 50 centimeters of soil to see how big the area with old objects is. After this, they will send a plan to dig up and save the objects to the cultural heritage committee. The next steps will depend on what the committee decides. But the road will certainly not finish on time now.</p>
            <p>The Shanjia site was first found in 1983 by Mr. Hsieh Chia-jung. He found pieces of pottery and stone tools. People who study local history were very interested. In 2021, a group called the Taiwan Ceramic Culture Association asked for the site to be protected.</p>
            <p>The county's culture department said they spent almost a year studying the Shanjia site. They looked at areas where experts had studied before. They also checked the ground for old objects and dug some small test holes. In these holes, they found layers from ancient times and old things like pottery and stone tools. This information will help with future studies and decisions about the site.</p>

            <h1>EU Countries Join Together for New Chip Law</h1>
            <p>Today, the government of the Netherlands announced that all countries in the European Union have joined a group called the "Semicon Coalition." This group, started by the Netherlands, is working to change a law about computer chips in the EU.</p>
            <p>News reports say that the Semicon Coalition was started in March this year by the Netherlands and eight other countries. Today, they gave their ideas to the European Commission.</p>
            <p>The Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Vincent Karremans, said that "all EU ministers today agreed that Europe's plans for industry must change because of growing problems around the world."</p>
            <p>People in the European Parliament, industry groups, and companies are working quickly to bring in "Chips Act 2.0." They want to fix problems and missing parts in Europe's plan for making computer chips.</p>
            <p>The Semicon Coalition thinks the EU needs to change its chip law. The old goal was to make 20% of the world's chips. The new plan should be more focused. It should make sure Europe has control over important technologies, make approval processes faster, and put more money into training and learning skills for the whole chip industry.</p>
            <p>The first chip law brought a lot of new investments. But it did not bring money for making very new and advanced chips. For example, Intel stopped its plans to build a big new factory in Germany.</p>
            <p>The International Semiconductor Industry Association (SEMI) announced today that more than 50 chip companies have also signed this plan.</p>
            <p>SEMI also said again that it wants the EU to have a special budget just for the chip industry. In May, SEMI suggested that the EU should spend four times more money on semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Companies that signed the plan include: Nvidia, ASML, Intel, STMicroelectronics, and Infineon.</p>
            <p>At the end of March this year, another EU group, the European Court of Auditors, said that the EU's goal to make 20% of the world's chips by 2030 is hard to reach if things continue as they are.</p>
            <p>The European Court of Auditors believes that by 2030, the EU will make 11.7% of the world's chips. This is only a small increase from 9.8% in 2022.</p>

            <h1>Volunteers Leave Hualien as Disaster Area Stays on Red Alert</h1>
            <p>A large amount of water flowed out from a blocked river in Hualien, causing a disaster. The main disaster center said today that 18 people have died, 6 are still missing, and 114 people are hurt. Many volunteers are now going home, so the train station is very busy. Police and other people helped with traffic. The disaster area is still on "red alert," which means it is very dangerous.</p>
            <p>Tonight, the disaster center for the Hualien river problem had its 21st meeting. Mr. Zhuang Ming-chi, a leader from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, led the meeting.</p>
            <p>A science group for disaster help said that fewer people are in Guangfu Township today. The highest number of people has passed. Now there are 31,168 people there. But more people are at the train station, which means volunteers are going back home.</p>
            <p>Later, they had a video call with the Hualien team working on site. Mr. Lai Chien-hsin, another leader from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said that the number of people in Guangfu Township is a little less than yesterday. Most people whose homes were damaged are still cleaning. They are putting rubbish on the roads. This will be an important job to clean up in the next few days. He also wants the water company to send more water to the damaged area.</p>
            <p>The team checking the disaster and looking for people said that by 5 PM, 18 people died, 6 are missing, and 114 are hurt because of the river problem.</p>
            <p>Also, the typhoon caused 807 problems across the country. 755 of these problems were in Hualien County.</p>
            <p>The team for farms and fishing said that new pictures from the air show that the lake water is still flowing out and washing away the ground. The hillsides that fell are still not safe. Rain from before is still adding water to the lake. So, the "red alert" stays.</p>
            <p>The team for water and electricity said they are working on the damaged river banks. Today, they built earth walls and put concrete blocks and big sandbags in place. They finished about 300 meters. The river has also been moved to a new path. They will keep building the river banks.</p>
            <p>Because it is the last day of the long holiday, many volunteers are going home. The traffic team said that today, the Taiwan Railways added 9 more trains. 13 trains stopped extra times at Guangfu Station. Also, a local train from Hualien will now go all the way to Guangfu Station and back once, stopping at Ji'an, Zhixue, Shoufeng, Fenglin, and Wanrong stations.</p>
            <p>At the same time, people can still stand on the Hualien-Taitung Express trains, and it is easier to enter Guangfu Station.</p>
            <p>The team for places to stay said that by 4 PM, there were 5 shelters open in Guangfu Township, Hualien. 352 people are staying there.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Defense said they plan to send 1,050 more soldiers tomorrow. This will make a total of 3,543 soldiers. They will help clean roads and give out things people need, following plans from the local team and government.</p>
            <p>Finally, Mr. Zhuang Ming-chi said that the disaster happened many days ago. He asked all teams to remember the needs of the people and the volunteers. Also, because the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday is coming, teams should plan for traffic. The main disaster center is still working at its highest level.</p>
            <p>The police explained after the meeting that today, 8,713 police and other people helped control and guide traffic. They set up 28 places to control cars to make sure traffic moved well. Rescue cars and cars bringing food can go through these areas first. They also told people about the traffic rules in many ways.</p>
            <p>News reporters asked if a new storm, which a weather expert Mr. Wu Der-rong warned about, would stop the work to fix the river banks. The Water Resources Agency said that three river banks were broken. They plan to fix them within two weeks. They will work faster to deal with any bad weather. All river offices in the country have sent help to Hualien to finish the work quickly.</p>
