            <h1>Songshan Airport Viewing Deck Finished, Reopens October 4th</h1>
            <p>The viewing deck at Songshan Airport has been fixed for almost two years. It is now finished. Today, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) announced that it will open again for visitors on October 4th.</p>
            <p>The Songshan Airport viewing deck has been fixed for nearly two years. It is now done and has new things like a wall with mascots and a big wall with plants for photos. This morning, Minister of Transportation Chen Shih-Kai said it could open during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.</p>
            <p>The CAA said in a press release that the Songshan Airport viewing deck will open on October 4th. Zheng Jian-zhong, who is the head of the Taipei International Airport Office, said that they will check all the things at the viewing deck in the next two days. It will open on October 4th, the first day of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. It will be open from 9 AM to 9 PM every day.</p>
            <p>Zheng Jian-zhong said that the viewing deck first opened in 2011. It quickly became a popular place to watch planes in northern Taiwan. It once had over 450,000 visitors in one year.</p>
            <p>The new viewing deck at Songshan Airport now has two more chipmunk mascots, "Song-Sang" and "Ai-Jiang", in addition to the original Songshan Airport mascot, "Lu-Cheng-Cheng". There is also a 3D painted wall with the mascots where visitors can take photos. Next to it, there is a large plant wall about 16 meters long and 3.5 meters high. It also has walls shaped like mountains, and seats shaped like pebbles and clouds. These designs are meant to remind people of planes flying in the sky.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Checks Indoor Air Quality, Costco Beitou and Another Store Fail</h1>
            <p>To keep people healthy when they breathe, the Taipei City Environmental Protection Department checked the air quality in 14 big stores. They found that Costco Beitou store and Carrefour Chongqing store had too much carbon dioxide. They asked these stores to fix the problem by a certain time. If they don't, they will have to pay a fine between NT$50,000 and NT$250,000.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Environmental Protection Department announced in a press release that big stores are places where many people gather indoors. Because of this, the level of carbon dioxide can easily become too high. When carbon dioxide levels are too high, it can make it hard to breathe. It can also cause headaches, make people sleepy, slow down their reflexes, and make them feel tired.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that from August to September, they checked the indoor air quality of 14 big stores to make sure people could shop safely. They found that both Costco Beitou store and Carrefour Chongqing store had carbon dioxide levels higher than the allowed limit. They have told the businesses to fix this problem by a certain date. For example, they should let more fresh air into their air conditioning systems, make sure air circulation is better, and control how many people come into the store.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that while they are fixing the problem, the businesses must put a sign at the entrance to show that they did not pass the check. If they do not fix the problem when checked again, they will have to pay a fine of NT$50,000 to NT$250,000.</p>
