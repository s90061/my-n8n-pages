            <h1>Russia Often Invades Airspace; Latvia Asks NATO to Make Air Defense Stronger</h1>
            <p>The President of Latvia, Edgars Rinkevics, asked NATO to make the Baltic countries safer. He said this because Russia has often flown into NATO's air space. Lithuania also asked for this before.</p>
            <p>Leaders in Europe said that Russia has flown into NATO's air space many times. This includes countries near the Baltic Sea and Poland. This month, about 20 Russian drones flew into these countries' air space. NATO planes had to shoot down some of them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rinkevics spoke at a NATO meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia. He said, "Russia continues to cause problems. Recently, they flew into the air space of Poland and Estonia without caring."</p>
            <p>He added, "We should change the air watch mission in the Baltic Sea. It should become an air defense mission with rules for fighting. This is very important now."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Lithuania's Defense Minister, Dovile Sakaliene, said earlier this month that Lithuania has a plan. It wants to change the mission and add more tools. These tools include air defense systems on land, sensors, and detectors.</p>
            <p>Russia said its planes did not fly into Estonia's air space. It also said its drones were not planning to attack anything in Poland.</p>
            <p>After the event in Poland's air space, NATO started "Operation Eastern Sentry." This operation is to make NATO's eastern side stronger. But officials from the Baltic countries said they still need more protection.</p>
            <p>NATO makes decisions when all 32 member countries agree. NATO has not yet replied to the request to change the mission. It also has not said anything about Mr. Rinkevics's words right away.</p>

            <h1>Russian Foreign Minister Says No Plan to Attack Europe, Warns of Strong Response if Attacked</h1>
            <p>Today, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, spoke at the United Nations. He told world leaders that Russia does not want to attack Europe. But he warned that if anyone attacks Russia, Russia will fight back strongly.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that in recent weeks, planes without permission have flown into NATO's air space. People believe Russia did this, and it made Europe very worried. The situation became more serious after NATO planes shot down a drone over Poland. Also, Estonia said Russian planes flew into its land and stayed for 12 minutes.</p>
            <p>Russia said its planes did not go into Estonia. It also said the drones were not aimed at Poland. Belarus, a country friendly with Russia, said that Ukraine's signal jamming caused the drones to go off course. But European leaders think these events were planned to make NATO unstable and see how NATO would react.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Lavrov insisted that Russia is the one facing threats.</p>
            <p>He said, "Russia has never wanted to attack Europe or NATO countries, and it doesn't want to now. However, if anyone attacks our country, we will respond strongly."</p>
            <p>This week, US President Trump said he thinks Ukraine can get back all the land Russia has taken.</p>
            <p>This was a big change in what the American leader said. Before, he said Ukraine needed to give up some things. He also said Ukraine might never get back all the areas Russia took since 2014 (Crimea) and 2022 (full invasion).</p>
            <p>Three weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia and the US "understand each other." He also said that the Trump government "is listening to us."</p>
            <p>Trump's new idea came after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly on the 23rd.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Questions Drone Crossing Border; Hungary Responds with Sarcasm</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy talked about an early military report. He questioned if a spy drone flew over the border from Hungary. He thought it might be trying to see Ukraine's factories in the west. Hungary's government in Budapest responded with a sarcastic comment.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zelenskyy mentioned this early military report a few days ago, but he did not say when it happened. After talking with Ukraine's top military leaders, he wrote on Telegram: "I have told people to check all the information. I also asked for reports right away for every event recorded."</p>
            <p>Later, in his regular speech, Mr. Zelenskyy also talked about "a very strange event" at the border with Hungary. He said he has asked for a "full investigation." He warned that if similar drones appear again, Ukraine will "take proper steps to protect our home."</p>
            <p>Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, wrote on X (a social media site): "President Zelenskyy has lost his mind because of his anti-Hungary feelings. Now he is starting to see things that are not there."</p>
            <p>Ukraine's military general staff also posted pictures online of what they thought was a drone entering their air space. They said Ukrainian drones are now flying in that area to watch it.</p>
            <p>Hungary is a member of the European Union and NATO. These two groups support Ukraine in the war with Russia. But the relationship between Ukraine and Hungary has always been difficult. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has always questioned Western countries helping Ukraine with weapons. He also has a friendlier relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
