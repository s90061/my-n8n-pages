            <h1>Netanyahu: Israel Plans Complete Military Control of Gaza</h1>
            <p>Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said today that Israel plans to have military control over all of Gaza. This is despite growing criticism both inside and outside the country about the war in Gaza, which has caused a lot of damage for almost two years.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Netanyahu was asked on Fox News if Israel would take over Gaza. He said, "We plan to do this. We do not want to keep it. We want to have safe borders. We do not want to govern there. We do not want to be the government there."</p>
            <p>He also said that Israel wants to give control of the area to Arab armies.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu spoke to Fox News before he met with a small group of senior ministers today. They were going to talk about the military's plan to control more of Gaza.</p>
            <p>Polls show that most Israelis want the war in Gaza to end with an agreement. They hope this agreement will lead to the release of the people currently held hostage by Palestinian armed groups, led by Hamas.</p>

            <h1>European Stocks Mostly Go Up Despite Trump's New Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Today, most European stocks closed higher. This happened even though new tariffs from U.S. President Trump started for many countries. The market felt better because the Kremlin announced that Trump and Russian President Putin will have talks in the next few days. This could make political tensions less strong.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went down by 63.54 points, or 0.69%, closing at 9100.77 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up strongly by 268.14 points, or 1.12%, closing at 24192.50 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 74.29 points, or 0.97%, closing at 7709.32 points.</p>

            <h1>Pacific Islands Forum Does Not Invite US, China, Taiwan; Foreign Ministry Calls for Keeping Old Ways</h1>
            <p>The Pacific Islands Forum will happen in September. China asked for Taiwan to be left out. So, the Solomon Islands, which is hosting the event, decided to invite only member countries. Today, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the final plan still needs to be announced by the host country. They asked for the old ways of working to be kept. They believe that Taiwan's involvement helps bring peace and wealth to the Pacific area.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) will be held in September in the Solomon Islands. After China pushed to exclude Taiwan, the Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, Jeremiah Manele, said on August 6th that 21 donor countries, like the United States and China, and also Taiwan's representatives, would not be invited to the meeting.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNA that they know the 54th PIF summit will be from September 8th to 12th. The Solomon Islands, as the host, decided not to invite all "Dialogue Partners" and "Development Partners" for now. This is because the PIF's system for ranking partners in its "regional organization structure" is not finished. Only member countries will attend this year's meeting. The host country will announce the exact final plan later.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that Taiwan has been involved in different PIF activities as a "Development Partner" since 1993. Taiwan has also attended the "Taiwan/Republic of China-Forum Countries Dialogue" meetings. These meetings are arranged by the PIF Secretariat and happen at the same time as the summit, allowing talks with member countries.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked for the existing ways of working to be continued. They also said that Taiwan's involvement in Pacific matters always follows "The Pacific Way," which means being diverse and inclusive, just like all PIF member countries. They believe that Taiwan's involvement can help build more cooperation with PIF, Pacific allies, and similar-minded countries. This will actively help bring peace, stability, and growth to the Pacific region.</p>
