**Swiatek Reaches Wimbledon Semifinals for the First Time**

Polish tennis star Iga Swiatek won her match against Liudmila Samsonova from Russia with a score of 6-2, 7-5. This victory means Swiatek has reached the Wimbledon women's singles semifinals for the very first time in her career.

Swiatek has won major titles on clay courts, like the French Open four times, and the US Open in 2022. However, playing on grass at Wimbledon has been more difficult for her. Her best result before was reaching the quarterfinals in 2023.

Swiatek is the eighth seed in this Wimbledon tournament. In her next match, she will play against Belinda Bencic from Switzerland. Bencic is an Olympic gold medalist and also reached the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time. She won her match today against Mirra Andreeva from Russia.

**X CEO Resigns, More Problems for Elon Musk's Companies**

Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X (the company formerly known as Twitter), has resigned today after two years in the role. X was bought by famous billionaire Elon Musk, and then in March this year, it was bought again by his artificial intelligence (AI) company, xAI.

Ms. Yaccarino said in a statement on X that she had "two wonderful years" leading the company through big changes. However, she did not say why she decided to leave. Her resignation comes after xAI's new chatbot, Grok, recently caused problems for saying things that praised Hitler and were rude to Islam.

Elon Musk bought Twitter in October 2022. He was the CEO himself until June 2023, when he hired Ms. Yaccarino. She was a senior advertising manager at NBCUniversal, and Musk hoped she could help X get advertisers back. She thanked the X team for a "historic business turnaround" but also suggested that X is starting a "new chapter" with xAI now being part of it.
