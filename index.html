            <h1>Trump's Second Son May Visit Japan in September to Grow Family's Crypto Business</h1>
            <p>Sources say that Eric Trump, the second son of U.S. President Donald Trump, plans to go to Tokyo in September. He will attend a meeting for shareholders of Metaplanet Inc., a Japanese company that holds Bitcoin. This visit is part of the Trump family's plan to make their cryptocurrency business bigger.</p>
            <p>People who shared this information did not want to be named because the details are not public yet. They said Eric Trump will be at Metaplanet Inc.'s shareholder meeting on September 1st.</p>
            <p>Metaplanet used to be a hotel company. But early last year, it changed to a company that holds Bitcoin. Now, it owns Bitcoin worth more than 2.1 billion U.S. dollars (about 64.2 billion New Taiwan dollars). In March this year, Eric Trump was hired as a strategy advisor for the company.</p>
            <p>After Bloomberg reported this news, Metaplanet's stock price in Tokyo, which had been going down earlier in the day, rose by 2.1% at one point today.</p>
            <p>The stock price has changed a lot. It has fallen by half since its highest point in mid-June. Even so, its value has increased by almost eight times in the last 12 months.</p>
            <p>Before going to Tokyo, Eric Trump will attend the Bitcoin Asia forum in Hong Kong from August 28th to 29th. At the shareholder meeting, Metaplanet's shareholders are expected to vote on new ways to get more money for the company.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Budget Increases to NT$41.5 Billion for 2026 to Boost "Glorious Nation Plan"</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's government has approved the budget for 2026. An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said today that MOFA's budget for 2026 will be about NT$41.5 billion. This is an increase of NT$10.9 billion compared to this year. In the future, MOFA will start the "Glorious Nation Plan" in countries that are Taiwan's allies and countries that share similar ideas. They will use an "economic diplomacy" plan to keep strong relationships with allied countries.</p>
            <p>The official also said that next year's MOFA budget is NT$10.9 billion more than this year's budget of NT$30.5 billion. This is a big increase of 35.7%, but it only brings the budget back to the same level as 2021. The difference between Taiwan's and China's diplomatic budgets is eight times. China is spending a lot more on diplomacy, so Taiwan needs to improve its own diplomatic efforts to respond. Therefore, with the support of President Lai Ching-te and the Executive Yuan, Taiwan's diplomatic budget has seen a big improvement.</p>
            <p>The official explained that China has a lot of money for its diplomacy. It uses its large economy to put pressure on Taiwan's friends, trying to reduce Taiwan's place and growth in the world. In recent years, as world politics have changed and supply chains have been rebuilt, countries have started to notice how China uses economic threats to harm democratic values. This has led countries that share similar ideas to act against China, especially in the technology industry, by building "non-red supply chains." Also, with U.S. President Trump possibly returning to the White House, "economic diplomacy" has become a very important topic in international relations.</p>
            <p>The official stated that MOFA is responding to world events. With support from President Lai and the Executive Yuan, MOFA created the "Executive Yuan Economic Diplomacy Working Group." This group is actively promoting the "Glorious Nation Plan" with allied countries, countries that share similar ideas, and countries that are important for Taiwan's strategy. Through real cooperation with these countries, Taiwan will also share its strong industries and create business chances.</p>
            <p>The official explained that since Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung started his job, he has used "economic diplomacy" to strengthen relationships with allied countries. He has also helped countries like Thailand start giving visa-free travel to Taiwanese people. MOFA continues to develop relationships with allied and like-minded countries in different regions and at international levels to expand Taiwan's international reach.</p>
            <p>The official mentioned that about NT$6.8 billion of the NT$10.9 billion extra budget for MOFA next year will be used for the "Glorious Nation Plan." MOFA will continue to work closely with its allies on areas like resilient semiconductor supply chains, reliable digital governance, smart park projects abroad, new energy and carbon credit cooperation, smart medical care, smart agriculture, sustainable tourism, and sovereign AI. Through these real cooperation projects, Taiwan aims to expand its diplomatic space.</p>
            <p>In addition, about NT$3 billion will be added to the fund of the International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF). This will gradually bring the fund back to the NT$30 billion approved by the Executive Yuan when ICDF was first established. This will make Taiwan's international development, investment, and aid efforts stronger and deepen relationships with partner countries. Also, because more international important people are visiting Taiwan, and Taiwan needs to take part in more international meetings and exchanges, the budget for international exchange activities and hosting guests has increased by about NT$800 million. This will strengthen Taiwan's international connections and deepen real cooperation with countries that share similar ideas.</p>

            <h1>7.5 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Drake Passage Near Antarctica, Tsunami Threat Is Over</h1>
            <p>A strong earthquake, with a magnitude of 7.5, happened today in the Drake Passage. This area is located between the southern tip of South America and Antarctica, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) later announced that there is no longer a tsunami threat.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that authorities in Chile had earlier issued a tsunami warning for some parts of Antarctica. However, NOAA stated that the tsunami threat has now ended. There were no immediate orders for people to leave their homes in Chile or Argentina, which are close to where the earthquake happened.</p>
            <p>According to the USGS, the earthquake occurred at 11:16 PM on August 21st, Argentina time (which was 10:16 AM on August 22nd, Taiwan time). The center of the earthquake was in the Drake Passage, about 710 kilometers southeast of Ushuaia, Argentina. The earthquake's depth was 10.8 kilometers.</p>
            <p>The Drake Passage is a far-away area between the southern end of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. It connects the South Atlantic Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean. So far, no reports of injuries have been received.</p>
            <p>Even though the Drake Passage does not experience earthquakes as often as other coastal areas in Chile, it is located on a very active earthquake zone and geological area.</p>
