            <h1>Taichung Active Soldier Becomes Fraud Group's Money Mule, Indicted by Law</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old man named Wu, who is a soldier, wanted to earn extra money. He joined a fraud group and became a "money mule," which means he helped them move money. He was arrested and put in jail. Later, he was charged with serious fraud. Mr. Wu might even lose his job in the army. He used to earn NT$50,000 every month.</p>
            <p>Today, the police in Taichung shared news about a fake investment case. A person realized they were tricked and told the police because they could not get their money back. The police said that a 40-year-old man named Zhang joined an investment group on LINE through Facebook. The group's name was "Wealth Plan." They told him he would always make money if he bought gold. Mr. Zhang saw a fake website that promised big profits. So, he put in 1.8 million NT dollars by bank transfer or in person. When he wanted to take out 28.78 million NT dollars, the fraud group asked him for a "10% charity donation." That is when he understood he was cheated.</p>
            <p>The police and Mr. Zhang worked together and caught Mr. Wu, the money mule, when he came to collect money. The police found out that Mr. Wu is an active soldier. He had a steady salary of NT$50,000 a month and a good career in the army. But he wanted to earn extra money, so he looked for "unusual jobs" online. Then, he followed the fraud group's orders. He pretended to sign contracts with people and collected money from them.</p>
            <p>On the day Mr. Wu was arrested, the Taichung court decided to keep him in jail. The Taichung District Prosecutors Office charged him with breaking laws against organized crime, serious fraud, and money laundering. They also asked for a 50% longer prison sentence because of laws against fraud. The court is now hearing his case. Mr. Wu might be removed from the army, and this will be a big loss for him.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan to Charge Fees for Tearing Down Illegal Buildings, Aiming for Fair Responsibility</h1>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Government has approved a new rule called the "Taoyuan City Regulations for Charging Fees for Forced Demolition of Illegal Buildings." This rule will now go to the City Council for approval. If the council agrees, the city government can ask the person who built an illegal structure or other responsible people to pay for the cost of tearing it down. This aims to create a fairer system for managing buildings.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Taoyuan City Building Management Office shared in a press release that the "Building Act" already states that "the owner of a building must pay for the costs of its forced demolition." The city government tried to introduce a similar rule in 2019, but it was not approved because there were still questions about its completeness. This time, the new rule has been improved. They have used their experience, looked at current national laws, and learned from what Taipei City and New Taipei City do.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhuang Jing-quan, the head of the Building Management Office, said that the city government currently pays for tearing down illegal buildings. This costs public money and does not stop people from building illegally. The new proposed rule clearly states how much people will be charged, how the process will work, and how people's rights will be protected. This makes the demolition work more official and legal. In the future, the cost will depend on the building materials used. It will be between NT$200 and NT$1,700 per square meter. The goal is to stop people who think they can get away with building illegally.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhuang also said that if this rule passes, the city will focus on tearing down big illegal buildings that are still being built and illegal buildings that are dangerous to public safety. They will ask for the demolition costs as stated in the rule. The city government wants to make sure that land is used correctly and that public safety is always the most important thing.</p>

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Taiwan's Coach Banned for 1 Game After Pitcher Breaks Rest Rule</h1>
            <p>In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Taiwan beat South Korea in extra innings yesterday. However, the last pitcher, Huang Yu-chien, did not follow the rules about how long pitchers must rest between games. Because of this, Taiwan's head coach, Zhang Zi-jian, cannot coach in today's game against South Korea for the third-place match. He cannot guide his team on the field.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Taiwan team played South Korea in their last game of the Super Round in the U12 Baseball World Cup. The two teams played a very hard game until the 9th inning, which was a special extra inning rule. Taiwan scored many runs and won the game 11 to 5. Today, they will play South Korea again for third place.</p>
            <p>The pitcher for the Taiwan team, Huang Yu-chien, entered the game in the 9th inning yesterday. On July 31st, he pitched 53 balls. The rules say that if a pitcher throws 46 to 60 balls, he must rest for 2 days before pitching again. But Huang Yu-chien pitched earlier than allowed yesterday, which was against the rules. Because of this, the Taiwan team has to pay a fine, and head coach Zhang Zi-jian cannot coach for one game.</p>
