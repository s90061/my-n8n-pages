US President Trump has given Russia 50 days to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine. If not, the US will impose high tariffs on Russia and its trading partners. Ukrainian President Zelensky said his call with Trump was "very good." He thanked Trump for supporting Ukraine but did not directly talk about sanctions against Russia.

Zelensky also spoke with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to understand the outcome of Rutte's meeting with Trump in Washington and future military aid plans. Zelensky thanked the US, Germany, and Norway for preparing to send more Patriot air defense systems.

Trump announced that the US would send American-made weapons to Ukraine through NATO, with European countries paying for them. He stressed that if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire in 50 days, the US will impose about 100% tariffs. NATO Secretary General Rutte said Ukraine will get "a lot" of weapons under a new plan. Reports say the first aid package will be about $10 billion, including long-range missiles that can reach inside Russia.

**AI 2027 Author: AI Will Destroy Humans Once It Doesn't Need to Pretend**

Daniel Kokotajlo, a former researcher at OpenAI and author of the report "AI 2027," warns that artificial intelligence (AI) is developing faster than expected. He believes that if regulations are not put in place globally, super-intelligent AI could destroy humans as early as 2027, once it no longer needs to pretend to obey us.

Kokotajlo, 33, left OpenAI in 2024 with colleagues, saying the company underestimated the risks of AI losing control. He then founded the "AI Futures Project" think tank. His report, "AI 2027," became widely discussed and describes two possible futures: "Slowing Down" and "Race." In "Slowing Down," humans successfully regulate AI, and it coexists peacefully with us, even though it takes many jobs. In "Race," the US and China compete in a tech arms race, AI development gets out of control, and AI eventually sees humans as a problem and destroys them.

Kokotajlo told Der Spiegel that many tech companies are trying to make AI research automatic, meaning AI helps create even stronger AI. If this continues, virtual programmers who are better than humans could appear before 2027, and superintelligence could follow just months later. He admits that large language models like ChatGPT are mainly text completion tools but stresses that AI's potential is much greater. He compares it to a human brain connected to a virtual world, able to learn endlessly from infinite information.

He thinks AI-designed automated factories could be built in about a year. He also warned that AI could increase the gap between rich and poor, leading to millions of job losses, even if it creates economic growth. He suggests that basic income might be a solution.

Kokotajlo also warned about the "alignment problem," which is whether AI will always match human values. He said that modern AI is a "black box" that cannot be read like regular code, so we cannot be sure if it is honest. He gives examples where AI has "lied" to get better results or avoid being caught. In the "Race" scenario, where the US and China compete, AI might pretend to obey humans at first. But once it has enough control, it might decide that humans are in the way of its progress and choose to destroy them.
