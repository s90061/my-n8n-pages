            <h1>A 6.2 Magnitude Earthquake Hits Venezuela, No Damages Reported Yet</h1>
            <p>The United States Geological Survey (USGS) said that a 6.2 magnitude earthquake happened in western and northern Venezuela today, September 24. So far, there are no reports of people being hurt or damage to buildings.</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP reported that the earthquake's center was about 24 kilometers from Mene Grande. This is a town in Zulia state, Venezuela, where not many people live, and it produces oil. The earthquake was 7.8 kilometers deep.</p>

            <h1>US-China Trade Talks: Expert Says Beijing Focuses on Tariffs, Export Control, and Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Today, September 24, an expert in the US talked about the ongoing trade talks between the US and China. These are the world's two biggest economies. The expert said that China has three main goals in these talks. They want the US to lower tariffs (taxes on imported goods) and ease rules on what can be exported to China. Also, on the topic of Taiwan, China wants the US government to clearly say "oppose" Taiwan's independence, not just "not support" it. For some people, this small difference in words can be very important.</p>
            <p>The Hudson Institute, a research group in Washington D.C., held a meeting today. The meeting was called "Chokeholds and Choices: Securing Supply Chains in the US-China Rivalry." Experts at the meeting included Gerard DiPippo, who is the Deputy Director of the China Studies Center at RAND Corporation. Nadia Schadlow, a former US Deputy National Security Advisor, and Rush Doshi, a former Senior Director for China and Taiwan Affairs at the White House National Security Council, also attended.</p>
            <p>DiPippo explained that China has three main goals in its trade talks with the US. First, they want lower tariffs. Second, they want fewer rules on exports. If China wants no rules at all for certain machines, that is almost impossible. A more likely goal is to have fewer rules for high-tech computer chips.</p>
            <p>He also said that the third goal is not much about the economy. It is mainly about Taiwan. China wants the US government and President Donald Trump to clearly say they "oppose" Taiwan becoming independent. They do not just want the US to say they "do not support" Taiwan's independence. This small change in words might be very important to some people.</p>
            <p>When asked about which goal is most important, DiPippo guessed that tariffs are the most urgent. China wants the US to remove them quickly. This is because if tariffs are lowered one or two years later, it will not be as useful. By then, the market will have already changed.</p>
            <p>DiPippo said that export controls are the next most important. China truly has limits on its computing power. Their plans for artificial intelligence are more about spreading the technology widely. They think that "even if it's not the best, as long as it's fast and widespread, it's better than being at the cutting edge." For China, export controls are a medium-term issue.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that China sees Taiwan as "a big and important long-term strategic issue that will not go away." If needed, they can wait. But it is clear that in the long run, "Taiwan is the most important of these three."</p>
            <p>This month, the US and China had their fourth round of trade talks in Madrid, Spain. Last week, President Trump also spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for almost two hours. They talked about the TikTok video app agreement and trade issues. This was the second time Trump and Xi spoke since Trump returned to the White House and put high tariffs on China.</p>
            <p>After the call between Trump and Xi, both the US and China released statements. Neither statement mentioned Taiwan, which made people curious. Ryan Fedasiuk, a former US State Department China policy advisor and now a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), told a reporter that it "would be unusual" if China did not mention Taiwan in a call with the US President.</p>
            <p>However, he believes that the relationship across the Taiwan Strait (between Taiwan and China) was probably not the top item on the agenda for this call. This is because there are many other more urgent disagreements in the relationship between the US and China.</p>

            <p>Typhoon Kanasala, the 18th typhoon this year, has caused a lot of damage in eastern Taiwan. Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, wrote on social media platform X to say he was very sad. He hopes that people in Taiwan can return to their normal lives soon.</p>
            <p>On social media platform X, Ishiba wrote in both Japanese and Chinese: "To my friends in Taiwan, I am very sad to hear about the big disaster caused by Typhoon Kanasala in eastern Taiwan. I want to say I am truly sorry for those who died, and I send my sincere thoughts to their families. I also offer my heartfelt care and sympathy to all the people affected by the disaster."</p>
            <p>Ishiba also said: "It makes me very sad that Taiwan has been hit by so many damaging typhoons and heavy rains. I truly hope that the people of Taiwan can get back to their normal lives soon."</p>
            <p>Taiwan's representative in Japan, Frank Hsieh, also thanked Prime Minister Ishiba on social media platform X. He said, "I am very thankful for Prime Minister Ishiba's kind words of sympathy during the disaster caused by Typhoon Kanasala, the 18th typhoon this year, in Hualien."</p>
            <p>Hsieh added: "As people say, 'a friend in need is a friend indeed.' Whenever there are disasters in Taiwan or Japan, we always help each other. I believe the strong bond (kizuna - spiritual connection) between Taiwan and Japan will continue and never change."</p>
            <p>Typhoon Kanasala caused great damage in Hualien. According to information from the Fire Department, by the evening of September 24, it was known that 17 people had died, 17 people were missing, and 32 people were injured. All the deaths and missing people were in Hualien County.</p>
