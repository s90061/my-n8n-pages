**Russian Foreign Minister Meets Kim Jong Un in North Korea, Both Countries Strengthen Cooperation**

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his visit to North Korea. A video from the Russian Foreign Ministry showed them shaking hands and hugging.

According to media from both Russia and North Korea, Lavrov will stay in North Korea until tomorrow. This visit is the latest in a series of high-level meetings between Moscow and Pyongyang. Russia and North Korea are making their military and political ties stronger, especially because of Russia's war in Ukraine.

North Korea has sent many soldiers to Russia's Kursk region to help Russian troops fight Ukrainian forces. They have also given Russia artillery shells and missiles.

Russia's state news agency TASS reported that Lavrov said North Korean officials have promised to fully support all of Russia's goals in its attacks in Ukraine. Lavrov also thanked the "brave" North Korean soldiers.

**UK Media: US Asks Japan and Australia About Their Role in a Taiwan War**

The British newspaper "Financial Times" reported today that the Pentagon (the US Department of Defense) is asking Japan and Australia to state what they would do if the US and China went to war over Taiwan. This request has made these two important US allies in the Indo-Pacific region unhappy.

Reuters reported that the Financial Times quoted sources saying that Elbridge Colby, a top official for policy at the US Defense Department, has been pushing this issue in recent talks with defense officials from Japan and Australia.

The Financial Times also said that this request surprised Tokyo and Canberra because the US itself has not promised to unconditionally defend Taiwan.

Reuters could not confirm the report, and the US Defense Department did not immediately comment.

Even though the US does not have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is Taiwan's most important supplier of weapons. China is putting more military pressure on Taiwan to support its claim over Taiwan, including holding military exercises. Taiwan rejects China's claim.

Colby used to be a deputy assistant secretary of defense under former US President Donald Trump, focusing on strategy and military power. He is known for saying that the US military should focus on competing with China and shift its attention away from the Middle East and Europe.

Japan's Ministry of Defense said it is "difficult to answer hypothetical questions" about a "Taiwan emergency." The ministry added that any actions taken would "depend on each specific case" and would follow "the constitution, international law, and domestic laws and rules." The Australian Embassy in the US did not comment.
