Many people today worry about how much time they spend on their phones. It's easy to get used to checking your phone all the time, but this can sometimes become a problem. Some signs that you might be too attached include feeling nervous if you don't have your phone, checking it first thing in the morning or late at night, or if it stops you from doing other important things.

Experts say that if your phone use makes you feel bad or stops you from living a normal life, it might be an addiction. To use your phone less, you can try turning off notifications, setting a specific time each day to be without your phone, or finding new hobbies. It's important to control your phone, not let your phone control you.

**How AI is Changing Our Work**

New computer programs, called AI (Artificial Intelligence), are starting to change how people work every day. Many companies are using AI tools to help employees do their jobs better and faster. For example, AI can write emails, summarize long documents, or help design new products. This means that some tasks that used to take a long time can now be finished quickly.

AI is not just for tech jobs; it is also used in many different industries, like customer service, healthcare, and finance. While AI can make work more efficient, it also means that workers might need to learn new skills. The way we work is changing, and understanding how to use AI tools will become more important for many jobs in the future.

**Sustainable Travel: Good for You and the Planet**

More and more travelers are thinking about how their trips affect the Earth and the places they visit. This idea is called "sustainable travel" or "eco-friendly travel." It means choosing to travel in ways that protect the environment and help local people.

For example, sustainable travelers might choose to use trains instead of planes for shorter trips, or they might stay in hotels that use less water and energy. They also try to support small, local businesses, like restaurants and craft shops, instead of big international chains. This helps the local economy. Also, they try to reduce waste, like plastic bottles, and respect local cultures. Choosing sustainable travel means enjoying your trip while also being kind to the planet and its people.
