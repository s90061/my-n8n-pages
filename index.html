Jabil, a company that provides electronics components, is planning to invest $500 million over the next few years. This investment will expand its facilities in the Southeastern United States to support customers building cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The company believes there will be a significant increase in demand for infrastructure to support AI.

This half-billion-dollar commitment will lead to new, large-scale manufacturing capabilities. Jabil is betting on the growing need for powerful data centers to handle the complex demands of AI technologies. This move highlights the rapid expansion of the AI industry and the need for specialized infrastructure to support its growth.

**Markets Remain Calm Amid Middle East Tensions and Economic Concerns**

Global financial markets showed surprising stability on Wednesday, despite ongoing developments in the Israel-Iran conflict, former President Donald Trump's comments, and the Federal Reserve's warnings about rising "stagflation" risks. Key prices for stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities mostly stayed steady.

This calm in the markets suggests that investors are currently processing the rapid changes and uncertainties without major panic. Even with significant geopolitical events and economic concerns, the market reaction has been subdued, indicating a cautious but not alarmed stance from investors.

**UK "Woefully Unprotected" Against Undersea Cable Sabotage by China and Russia**

A new report suggests that the United Kingdom is not adequately prepared to defend against potential sabotage of its undersea cables by China and Russia. The analysis indicates that both China and Russia are increasing their operations targeting these crucial underwater communication lines.

The report, from the China Strategic Risks Institute (CSRI), examined 12 alleged incidents of undersea cable sabotage between January 2021 and April 2025. In 10 of these cases, a suspect vessel was identified, and eight of those were directly linked to China or Russia, either by their flag registration or company ownership. This highlights a significant and growing threat to vital Western infrastructure.
