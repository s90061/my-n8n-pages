            <h1>Asian Youth Baseball: Hu Guan-wei Pitches 5 Innings, 6 Strikeouts, Fast Pitching as Highlight</h1>
            <p>Taiwan lost its first game against South Korea in the Asian Youth Baseball Championship. Pitcher Hu Guan-wei was a highlight. He pitched for 5 innings and got 6 strikeouts, giving up only 1 run. His pitches were getting faster, and his confident actions on the field made the atmosphere better. The head coach, Chiu Yao-yu, said that it's normal for players to be nervous in their first game, and he believes they will get better.</p>
            <p>The Asian Youth Baseball Championship started today at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. In their first game, Taiwan played against South Korea. In the bottom of the 2nd inning, Taiwan scored 3 runs and was ahead. But in the top of the 3rd inning, after a new pitcher came in, South Korea hit many long balls and scored 4 runs, taking the lead. South Korea scored one more run in the top of the 5th inning. Taiwan could not score more runs and lost the first game 3 to 5.</p>
            <p>Taiwan used three pitchers today: Ke Shao-jie, Lin Ya-lun, and Hu Guan-wei. TV showed that Lin Ya-lun and Hu Guan-wei both threw pitches up to 145 kilometers per hour. Hu Guan-wei pitched for 5 innings and gave up 4 hits. He got 6 strikeouts and allowed only 1 earned run. In the top of the 6th inning, he struck out three batters in a row. His performance was a key part of the game.</p>
            <p>After the game, Taiwan's head coach Chiu Yao-yu said in a TV interview that the players were too nervous playing at home and seemed a bit stiff. Coach Chiu also said that he had thought about letting Hu Guan-wei start as the pitcher, but Hu said he was a bit nervous. So, Ke Shao-jie started instead, but Ke also seemed nervous when he played.</p>
            <p>Coach Chiu talked about why he changed pitchers. In the bottom of the 2nd inning, Taiwan was leading by 3 runs. In the top of the 3rd inning, they put in Lin Ya-lun, a strong pitcher, hoping his fast pitches would stop the other team. But the players were too nervous. In a game where winning or losing is important, everyone felt a lot of pressure. The coaches on the side kept encouraging the players.</p>
            <p>Regarding adapting to the baseball field and the night lights, Coach Chiu said that playing at night was fine. The main thing was how they played in the moment. He said they actually played well today and he believes they will play better after this game.</p>

            <h1>Israel's plan for Gaza City residents to move south is called 'open deception' by Hamas</h1>
            <p>Today, Hamas, a Palestinian group, said that Israel's plan to move people from Gaza City to the south will cause "a new wave of genocide" and make them homeless.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hamas criticized Israel's claim that it will set up tents and other safe places in the southern Gaza Strip. Hamas called this "open deception."</p>
            <p>On August 16, the Israeli military announced that it is preparing to give tents and other things to people in Gaza. They plan to move people from war zones to the southern parts of Gaza to "make sure they are safe."</p>
            <p>Hamas released a statement saying that setting up tents while saying it's for humanitarian reasons is "open deception." They believe it is meant to "hide the cruel actions that the occupying army is about to do."</p>
            <p>In early August, the Israeli army said they plan to start a new attack to take control of Gaza City, which is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip.</p>

            <h1>Guitar Godfather Huang Chung-yue as Music Director, Accusefive Feel Reassured</h1>
            <p>The band Accusefive started their tour in their hometown Yilan. On August 16th and 17th, they performed in Taipei. These two concerts brought together 4,000 fans. Accusefive shared that they invited "Guitar Godfather" Huang Chung-yue to be their music director. The intense practice sessions made Accusefive feel very confident and ready.</p>
            <p>Accusefive performed two shows in a row at Legacy TERA in Taipei on August 16th and 17th. According to the press release, Yun-an was a little out of breath during the first talking part. Quan-ching joked, "Are you out of breath after only 3 songs?" Yun-an quickly explained that he can last a long time. Zhe-qian jokingly added, "He can keep going for 3 hours!" Accusefive loves their fans, so they let fans ask for songs. Fans used different ways to try and get Accusefive to choose their song.</p>
            <p>For this "Live House World Tour," Accusefive greatly invited Huang Chung-yue to be the music director. The band members said the intense practice before the tour felt like "summer special training." Zhe-qian revealed, "This is the most serious practice I've ever had!"</p>
            <p>Accusefive said, "The main point of this practice was not to think about how great we are, but to think about how to perform and express the band's songs. Teacher Chung-yue is like a 'reassuring person.' When he is there, we are more careful to adjust our schedule and attitude, and we try to improve even more."</p>
            <p>Accusefive will perform in Taichung at Legacy Taichung on August 30th and 31st. Then, on September 6th and 7th, they will go to LIVE WAREHOUSE in Kaohsiung.
