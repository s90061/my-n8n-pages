            <h1>Erya Publishing House: 50 Years of Supporting Literature, Yin Di Fears Good Works Will Be Lost</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Qiu Zuyin, Taipei, July 19th) Erya Publishing House has been open for 50 years. It has helped literature grow and brought comfort to many readers. The founder and writer, Yin Di, said today that for 50 years, he has been very careful about the books he publishes. He is afraid that good books will be forgotten and that no one will see them.</p>
            <p>Yin Di, who is almost 90 years old, attended an event today called "Not Just Old Memories, Classics Are Still Young: Erya Fifty, Classics Fifty." During the event, people like Wang Dewei, Xiang Yang, Pai Hsien-yung, Chen Fang-ming, Wang Rong-wen, and Ye Bu-rong gave awards to writers whose works were chosen for the "Fifty Classics." Many writers, old and young, were there, and the atmosphere was warm and touching.</p>
            <p>Yin Di spoke at the event. He said that recently, he has had trouble with his eyes, so he cannot write or read much. But his love for literature will always be strong.</p>
            <p>Yin Di shared that he still remembers how words first inspired and moved him. He also became a writer himself, always wanting more people to see good writing. He explained how he, as an editor, was very strict. He would give writers three chances when reading their work. If he read a good piece, he would "stand at attention" to read it carefully. If he read a piece three times and still didn't like it, he would put it in a "rest area" and read it again later.</p>
            <p>Feng Deping, the head of "Wenshun Magazine," which organized the event, spoke. She said she believes many people have been asked by Yin Di to write for him and have been moved by his spirit. She felt honored to plan this event for Erya, choosing 50 classic books. She also thanked the more than one hundred cultural people who helped make this important event happen. She said, "People who write are always young."</p>
            <p>Writer Pai Hsien-yung spoke and said that Erya has three main features. First, it has a strong love for literature. Second, it publishes the most poetry books, which is great for promoting modern poetry in Taiwan. He also liked Yin Di's poetry because it was "easy to understand." Third, Erya also publishes many yearly collections, keeping the best records for the literary world.</p>
            <p>Critic Wang Dewei said that in October 1997, Yin Di sent him a big box of books to edit. This collection was called "The Making of a Canon: A 30-Year Selection of Annual Novels." This work helped him understand how important Taiwanese literature is in the Chinese-speaking world. He wanted to show his respect to Yin Di.</p>
            <p>For this event, 100 cultural figures chose 50 books from 908 works published by Erya. Books like "Taipei People" by Pai Hsien-yung, "My Old Home" by Lin Hai-yin, and "Cultural Journey" by Yu Qiuyu were chosen. Wang Ding-jun alone had four works chosen: "Four Parts of a Memoir," "The Whirlpool of the Left Atrium," "Broken Glass," and "The Melody of Rivers."</p>
            <p>For the full list of 50 books, please see the Facebook page of "Wenshun Magazine." (Editor: Hsieh Ya-chu) 1140719</p>

            <h1>Actor Shih Ming-shuai Remembers Low Pay at Student Film Festivals, Joking "A Bento Box is Enough"</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hung Su-chen, Taipei, July 19th) Actor Shih Ming-shuai attended a press conference today for the Public Television Service (PTS) Student Film Festival's 20th anniversary. He remembered that back then, the budget was only 1.5 million NT dollars. Actors were paid very little, and he joked, "It was fine as long as there was a bento box." But he said these experiences were important for growth, like "a chance to practice after training at Shaolin Temple."</p>
            <p>PTS held a press conference today for the "PTS Student Film Festival's 20th Anniversary." Director Lin Chun-yang, and actors Shih Ming-shuai and Fu Meng-po were invited to share their experiences in film and TV production over the years.</p>
            <p>Shih Ming-shuai, who studied drama, said that he saw the student film festival as "a chance to practice after training at Shaolin Temple." He also called it a great link between school and the real work world.</p>
            <p>Shih Ming-shuai also shared how hard it was to be part of the student film festival, but they still wanted to make good films with limited money. He said there were no rules about working hours back then. They often worked without pay, saying "a bento box was enough." He also said, "It was really very tough! I once worked for 32 hours straight." He even fell asleep the moment he closed his eyes. He admitted that working at a convenience store paid more.</p>
            <p>Lin Chun-yang also said that during filming, people in the same industry helped each other. He once worked as a cameraman for another film team. He said, "If they gave me a little money, it was great." He was even surprised and happy when a film team had bento boxes, saying, "They actually have food!"</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiu-hua, the general manager of PTS, mentioned that student film festival works have become well-known internationally. The students' ideas are new and varied, which has helped them enter the international market. She said, "Many international or big companies are asking PTS if there are new student film projects," hoping to find ideas that can become TV series or movies. (Editor: Wu Su-jou) 1140719</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: Respecting Cabinet's Choice for "No" Side Representatives in Nuclear Power Plant Referendum Talks</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Su Szu-yun, Taipei, July 19th) A vote on restarting the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant will happen on August 23rd. The Central Election Commission (CEC) will hold five talks or debates. The "no" side will be represented by Lin Tzu-lun, Deputy Executive Director of the Executive Yuan's Energy and Carbon Reduction Office, and Tseng Wen-sheng, Chairman of Taiwan Power Company. Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said they have no special opinion on who speaks and will respect the choices made by the Executive Yuan and public groups.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said earlier that to let both sides of the nuclear power plant referendum share their views fully, they decided to hold five talks or debates. These will be on August 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, and 15th, shown on national TV channels. The Legislative Yuan will speak for the "yes" side. The Executive Yuan, or groups against the idea who have set up offices as allowed by Article 20 of the Referendum Act, will speak for the "no" side. Usually, these are talks, not debates, unless both sides agree to have a debate.</p>
            <p>Last night, the Executive Yuan said that after thinking about the knowledge from both schools and practical work, Lin Tzu-lun, Deputy Executive Director of the Executive Yuan's Energy and Carbon Reduction Office, and Tseng Wen-sheng, Chairman of Taiwan Power Company, will be the representatives for the "no" side.</p>
            <p>However, news reports said that for the nuclear power plant referendum talks, the Ministry of Economic Affairs did not want to choose a representative for the "no" side. They also asked the Executive Yuan not to choose a representative for the "no" side of the referendum. After the Ministry of Economic Affairs made its position clear, the Executive Yuan quickly chose Tseng Wen-sheng as one of the "no" side's representatives, which seemed to go against the Ministry of Economic Affairs' wishes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said today that all parts of the government have the same view on nuclear power. They have said many times that they are open to using nuclear power. But this can only happen if three main conditions are met: it must be safe, there must be a way to deal with nuclear waste, and society must agree.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that the Nuclear Reactor Facility Control Act began on May 23rd this year. According to Article 6, Paragraph 3 of this law, "If a facility wants to keep running after its license expires, the operator can ask the main authority. The facility can only continue to operate after the main authority confirms there are no safety concerns and agrees to give a new license."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that if the Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant is confirmed safe by the main authority and given a new license, the Ministry, as the group that carries out laws, must follow the rules in the Nuclear Control Act. In this case, it's not about being against or for it.</p>
            <p>As for the people chosen to speak at the referendum talks, the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that they have no special position and will respect the choices made by the Executive Yuan and public groups after their discussions. (Editor: Hsieh Chia-chen) 1140719</p>
