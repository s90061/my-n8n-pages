            <h1>Czech Republic's First Documentary to Compete for an Oscar Shows a Photographer's Life</h1>
            <p>The Czech documentary film "I'm Not Who I Want to Be Yet" will represent the Czech Republic at the 98th Academy Awards. It will compete for the Best International Film award. This movie is about a famous photographer from the 1980s. It shows the secret culture during the time of Czechoslovakia. It also talks about who a person is, being free, and fighting against rules from inside.</p>
            <p>The Czech News Agency reported that "I'm Not Who I Want to Be Yet" uses the private diaries and thousands of photos of Libuše Jarcovjáková, a well-known photographer from the 1980s in Czechoslovakia. She once made a dramatic escape to West Berlin and took pictures for top fashion people in Tokyo. The film shows how this great artist always stayed true to herself, no matter the time or situation.</p>
            <p>Libuše Jarcovjáková is now 73 years old. Her work shows real life. She recorded the secret culture during the communist time in Czechoslovakia, the gay community, people on the edge of society, and her own life. She had a special way of looking at things. In 2017 and 2019, she won the "Photographer of the Year Award" from the Czech Professional Photographers Association.</p>
            <p>"I'm Not Who I Want to Be Yet" was first shown in the world at the Berlin Film Festival last year. This year, it won Best Documentary at the Czech Lion Awards. The director of the film, Klára Tasovská, said, "This is the first time that the Academy members decided to send a documentary to the competition. We are very thankful. It is a big surprise for us to be chosen from so many good films."</p>
            <p>Before this, the Czech Republic had never chosen a documentary film to compete for an Oscar. They usually chose longer feature films. Tasovská said that this film will have the chance to compete in two categories: International Film and Documentary. She said, "We basically have two choices."</p>
            <p>Until now, three films from Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic have won Oscars. They are "The Shop on Main Street" in 1966, "Closely Watched Trains" in 1967, and "Kolya" in 1996. Also, six other films were nominated for an Oscar.</p>
            <p>In 2019, the Czech film "The Painted Bird" was chosen for the Oscar shortlist. In 2021, the Czech film "Charlatan" also reached the same level.</p>
            <p>The Czech Film and Television Academy (ČFTA) started in 1995. It gives out the Czech Lion Awards and chooses films for the American Oscars. It currently has 436 members. This time, 194 members voted.</p>

            <h1>Jiang Kai-jie Wins Gold in Powerlifting at World Games with Amazing Comeback</h1>
            <p>The Chengdu World Games are almost finished. Today, Taiwanese powerlifter Jiang Kai-jie had an amazing comeback in the men's equipped middleweight final. In his last try for the deadlift, he successfully lifted 342.5 kg. This gave Taiwan another gold medal.</p>
            <p>Jiang Kai-jie is 36 years old. He has often competed for Taiwan in international powerlifting events. Last year, he surprised everyone at the World Powerlifting Championships by winning second place. This also gave him a chance to compete at the World Games in Chengdu, China. Today, he competed in the men's equipped middleweight final. In the first two parts, the squat and bench press, he lifted 352.5 kg and 227.5 kg. He was only in 5th place at that time.</p>
            <p>Then came the last part, the deadlift. Jiang Kai-jie successfully lifted 315.0 kg and then 327.5 kg. For his third and final try, he decided to lift 15 kg more, aiming for 342.5 kg. Before he started, he kept telling himself he could do it. Not only did he succeed, but he also got a total score of 107.54 points. This was better than two Ukrainian athletes, Vitalii Kolomiiets and Mykola Barannik. He won the gold medal in a surprising way.</p>
            <p>Also, in the women's equipped middleweight category, Taiwanese athlete Huang Yen-tzu almost won a medal. But she could not lift 215 kg in her last deadlift attempt. In the end, she got 4th place with a total score of 108.86 points. Another Taiwanese athlete, Hung Hsiu-ching, got 7th place with a total score of 102.07 points.</p>
            <p>With one gold and one silver medal in powerlifting today, and a gold medal won by 21-year-old roller skater Liu Qiao-xi in women's freestyle speed slalom, Taiwan now has 3 gold, 5 silver, and 4 bronze medals. Taiwan is ranked 22nd among 76 countries competing. Tomorrow, famous powerlifters Tian Ji-sen and Yang Sen will compete in the men's equipped super heavyweight category, and they might win more medals.</p>

            <h1>IET-KY: If Semiconductor Products Are for Defense, Trump Should Make Them Tax-Free</h1>
            <p>Donald Trump, the US President, recently said again that he might put a "200% or 300%" tax on imported semiconductor chips. Kao Yung-chung, the leader of IET-KY, a company that makes special semiconductors, said that the US government's plan is not final yet. Right now, semiconductors do not have this tax. He believes that if the products are needed for national defense, Trump would probably find a way to remove the tax.</p>
            <p>News reports from outside the US said that Donald Trump recently stated he would announce new taxes on imported steel and semiconductor chips in the next two weeks. He said that at first, the tax rate would be low. This is to encourage companies to move to the United States. Then, as the US makes more products inside the country, the taxes would slowly go up, "maybe as high as 200% or 300%."</p>
            <p>Kao Yung-chung, the chairman of IET-KY, stated that the US government's policy is not yet decided. Right now, semiconductors are tax-free. He believes that if the products are needed for defense, Trump will find a way to make them tax-free.</p>
            <p>Kao Yung-chung pointed out that IET-KY already makes its products in the United States. However, they are now facing pressure from taxes because their raw materials come from different parts of the world. But currently, these taxes are not being collected, so it does not affect the company much yet.</p>
            <p>Kao Yung-chung said that IET-KY has already received 4 million US dollars from the Texas CHIPS Act. They have started building their factory. They are also trying to get money from the US federal CHIPS Act. But because the new US government wants more investment, including more defense products and machines made in the US, IET-KY has changed its plans a bit to try and get the federal money.</p>
            <p>Also, Kao Yung-chung suggested that companies that want to ask for money from the US government should have clear plans for how they will invest. It is also very important to hire good advisors.</p>
            <p>When talking about the good things about investing in Texas, Kao Yung-chung explained that North Texas is the biggest place for high-tech production in the United States. Texas Instruments also started in Texas. This has created many engineers and good systems for semiconductor companies in North Texas. This is a strong point for North Texas.</p>
            <p>Also, Kao Yung-chung explained that in Texas, companies are not required to have a workers' union, which makes it easier for businesses to operate. Texas also does not have a state income tax, and property is cheaper. This makes it a good place for companies to build their businesses. The airports are also very easy to use.</p>
            <p>But Kao Yung-chung stressed that investing in the United States is definitely more expensive than in Taiwan. The cost of workers is much higher, and building factories takes longer. Taiwanese companies that want to invest in the US must be well-prepared and check their own situation. Companies that open factories in the US can use the good points of Taiwanese companies, like controlling costs and caring about their employees' personal lives. But they must not treat US employees in the same way they treat Taiwanese employees.</p>
