The recent biology exam had some interesting questions. For example, one question was about where a frog's tongue is attached. Another asked students to identify a type of plant by looking at a picture of its cells.

Teachers said that the exam was not harder than last year's. They also said that the questions were clear and easy to understand. One teacher explained that a question about plant cells tested students' ability to think about how plants live in different environments, like in water.

Another question was about frogs. The teacher joked that some students didn't know what a frog was, even though information about frogs is in their textbooks. He explained that a frog's tongue is attached at the front of its mouth, which helps it catch food easily. People's tongues are attached differently, which is why they can't stick them out as far as a frog can.

**Taipower Asks for Understanding After Criticism**

A lawmaker from the KMT party said that photos of Taipower workers fixing power lines were like trying to make people feel bad. Taipower answered that their workers are working very hard day and night to fix the power, and they asked people not to criticize them. They said, "Please don't hurt Taipower anymore."

A strong typhoon called Danas hit southern Taiwan. It caused a lot of damage, especially in Tainan and Chiayi. Almost 2500 power poles fell down. Taipower said this was the worst power damage ever for Tainan.

By Thursday afternoon, 47,000 homes in Tainan and Chiayi still had no power. Taipower has sent more than 24,000 workers and many vehicles to fix things. They have fixed power for over 95% of homes in 16 areas, including Yunlin and Chiayi cities. They are now working hard to fix the main power lines in Tainan and Chiayi.
