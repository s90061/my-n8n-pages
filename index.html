            <h1>Kaohsiung's Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market Gets an Upgrade, New Entrance to be Unveiled</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung City's "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market" has been open for 10 years. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, there will be a thanksgiving event on August 30th. A new entrance design will also be shown to the public. On that day, if you spend NT$100 or more, you can join a raffle to win prizes like a Gogoro scooter.</p>
            <p>The "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market" is famous for selling all kinds of seafood and seafood snacks. It is a popular spot in northern Kaohsiung. To make the area better, the city government received NT$13 million from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They used this money to create a new market entrance and design more comfortable shopping and dining areas. This work was finished this year.</p>
            <p>Liao Tai-hsiang, the director of Kaohsiung City's Economic Development Bureau, said that the new entrance has a blue steel frame. This symbolizes a gateway to a "fisherman's home." Inside the market, blue and white roofs are put together to create a bright "seafood corridor." Near the port, a "port shared dining and rest area" has been added. This gives people a comfortable place to gather.</p>
            <p>Liao also said that with professional design, the fish market has not only improved the quality of shopping and resting but also become more attractive for tourists. It is moving towards being a place that combines culture, tourism, and community.</p>
            <p>The Economic Development Bureau announced in a press release today that to celebrate the 10th anniversary and its new look, the management committee will hold the "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market 10th Anniversary Thanksgiving Celebration" from 10 AM to 5 PM on August 30th. The new entrance design will also be officially revealed.</p>
            <p>Zheng Rui-yi, the general secretary of the Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market, said that if you spend NT$100 on that day, you will get one raffle ticket. Each person can only get one ticket per stall. The raffle prizes include a Gogoro, an iPhone 16E phone, home appliances, and cash red envelopes. There are over 50 big prizes in total, worth more than NT$500,000.</p>
            <p>Also, the event will have performances by Taiwanese singers like Qi Lang and Xie Jin-jing, along with local groups. There will also be a charity haircut event and a receipt donation activity. This will make the celebration lively and full of kindness.</p>
            <p>The Economic Development Bureau said that on the day of the event, there will be the usual holiday traffic control. The traffic control area will also be made larger to include parts of Dafu Road. They reminded people to follow the traffic rules and use public transport to get there.

            <h1>East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Holds Euro-Asian-African Plate Concert, Percussion Music Shows Earth's Heartbeat</h1>
            <p>A "Euro-Asian-African Plate Concert" will take place on October 11th at Yuli Township Civil Square in Hualien. It combines the local landscape, rhythm, and memories of the land. The Ju Percussion Group will play music that sounds like the Earth's heartbeat. They invite people to experience "Geological Music" where the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates meet.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration's East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration announced today that the concert's theme is "Whispers at the Plate Boundary." It is based on Yuli's special geology and location. The natural landscape will be the stage, and Earth's movements will become music rhythms. Through the strong power of percussion music, the audience will feel each drum beat as the heartbeat from deep inside the Earth.</p>
            <p>Hsu Tsung-min, the director of the East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration, said that to let more students from colleges and younger schools experience the exciting sound of percussion instruments, the group will offer a free 30-minute percussion experience before the main show. Musicians will teach about instrument parts, rhythm, basic playing, and how to play together. This will let interested children feel the magic of percussion music up close.</p>
            <p>The East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration also said that besides the "Euro-Asian-African Plate Concert," there will be a market with special local products and handicrafts from Hualien and Taitung.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is a "Walking Through the Valley Plate Cycling" event that combines sports and geography. On the second day (October 12th) morning, cyclists will start. There are two routes based on difficulty: the Batongguan Ancient Trail Cycling Challenge (34k) and the Euro-Asian-African Plate Leisure Ride (20k). Riders can explore where the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates meet, the Batongguan Cross-Island Ancient Trail, and Yuli Township. Information about the event and how to sign up can be found on the East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration's official website and fan page.</p>

            <h1>Fraud Group Uses High-Speed Rail Ticket Refund System to Launder Money, Yunlin Prosecutors Charge Malaysian Suspect</h1>
            <p>A fraud group used the High-Speed Rail (HSR) refund system to launder money. A Malaysian man, who acted as a money mule, was arrested at Yunlin HSR Station. He was canceling many tickets to get cash. The Yunlin District Prosecutors Office has finished its investigation and will charge him with fraud and other crimes.</p>
            <p>The Yunlin District Prosecutors Office released a statement today. It said that on June 26th this year, the Huwei Police Precinct received a report. It was about a 42-year-old Malaysian man named Chen. He was canceling a large number of tickets at Yunlin HSR Station to get cash, which looked like money laundering.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors stated that the police went to the station and questioned the man. They believed Chen was a money mule. They arrested him on the spot and took NT$114,000 in cash. The investigation showed that Chen came to Taiwan on a tourist visa on June 24th. On his third day, he started using the ticket refund machine at HSR stations.</p>
            <p>Using HSR ticket refunds for money laundering is very unusual. So, the police asked the Yunlin District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. Prosecutor Ye Qiao-jun was in charge.</p>
            <p>After questioning, prosecutors believed Chen was involved in organized crime, fraud, and money laundering. These were serious crimes, and they thought he might try to connect with other criminals. So, they asked the Yunlin District Court to hold him, and the court agreed. The case is now finished, and he has been charged according to the law.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors found that the fraud group first pretended to be a man named Lin, who knew nothing about it. They told victims they had "won a prize but needed to pay a handling fee." When the victims believed them, the group members pretended to be Mr. Lin. They used the internet many times to buy 10 business class tickets from Nangang to Zuoying (total value NT$25,000) from Taiwan High-Speed Rail. Then, the group used "Taiwan Pay" to create a payment QR Code. They sent this to the victims to scan and pay the "handling fee." After that, they told Chen to go to Tainan and Yunlin HSR stations. He used the stolen identity information to get cash refunds for the tickets. This completed the fraud and money laundering.</p>
            <p>After this incident, the HSR company immediately put an announcement on its official website. It said that the QR code payment function for online ticket booking would be stopped right away. During the system improvement, "Taiwan Pay" cannot be used for payment. Passengers should use online credit card payment instead.</p>
