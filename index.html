            <h1>Chen Ruei-an Wins Bronze in Women's Gymnastics All-Around at Universiade, First for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Chen Jung-chen, Taipei, July 26) Chen Ruei-an, a 21-year-old gymnast, won a bronze medal today. She moved from Sweden to Taiwan. She got 52.065 points in the women's all-around artistic gymnastics final at the Rhein-Ruhr Universiade. This makes her the first female gymnast from Taiwan to win a medal in artistic gymnastics at the Universiade. She has made new history.</p>
            <p>The Rhein-Ruhr World University Games are happening in Germany. Chen Ruei-an (Tonya Helene Paulsson) is a 21-year-old gymnast with mixed heritage.

            <h1>Taiwan Water Corporation Works with Companies to Offer Custom Water Services, Hopes to Earn More Money by Year-End</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Tseng Chih-yi, Taipei, July 26) Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) wants to earn more money, not just from water bills. So, TWC will work with companies that make water purification equipment. They will offer "customized water supply services." They will do this through a program called "TWC Select" which means they will help make products for other companies. This service will meet the different needs of various users, such as homes, chain restaurants, and technology factories. The process to choose these companies will start soon. TWC hopes to begin offering the service by the end of the year. TWC also hopes this will help more Taiwanese companies that make water purification equipment grow and become stronger.</p>
            <p>In the future, if people or businesses in Taiwan need special water services, they can contact TWC. TWC will send staff to test the water and give advice. Then, they will install water purification equipment. Generally, this will be a one-time payment. Also, TWC will provide reports about the water quality. These reports will be checked by special organizations. TWC will also test the water regularly.</p>
            <p>The price of water in Taiwan has not changed for 31 years. For every cubic meter of water sold, TWC loses more than NT$2. Changing water prices can affect the prices of other things people buy. So, the Ministry of Economic Affairs told TWC to first see if they can save money. Or, they should offer new services to earn more. For example, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, suggested earlier this year that water could be charged based on its quality.</p>
            <p>It is known that TWC has started planning the "customized water supply service." They will work with companies that provide water purification equipment for homes or businesses. Using the "TWC Select" OEM method, they will offer special water quality based on what users need. The service will be for general homes, chain restaurants, food processing companies, semiconductor factories, medical places, builders, and other chain restaurants.</p>
            <p>People involved in this project say that the water TWC provides already meets the standards for drinking water sources and drinking water quality. Taiwan's water quality standards are even better than those from the World Health Organization (WHO). However, some users need special water quality. For example, some people think the water is too hard. They can install water purification equipment to make the water less hard. Also, technology factories need very high water quality for their advanced processes. These are all possible customers.</p>
            <p>TWC will soon choose one or two companies through an open selection process. For how they will work together: TWC will mainly check the filter materials, water quality standards, and give technical support. The selected companies will be in charge of making the equipment, installing it, giving custom advice, and providing after-sales service. TWC will then receive money for its technical services. They expect to earn between NT$30 million and NT$50 million over six years.</p>
            <p>People involved also said that smaller companies hope to work with TWC, which is a state-owned company. This can help them become more known and save money on advertising. It can also give them an advantage when trying to get work in other countries. TWC also wants to help more companies grow and compete around the world.</p>
            <p>Experts in the industry say that about 40% of homes in Taiwan have water purifiers. This means nearly 60% of homes do not have a home water purifier. The good thing about TWC offering this service is that TWC has its own equipment and skills to test water quality. This means they can make sure the water quality is better after a user installs a purifier. If a regular family installs a purifier themselves, it can be hard for them to know if the water quality has truly improved.</p>
            <p>An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the "customized water supply service" is the most possible plan TWC found after looking at different ideas. TWC had also looked at other projects before. But those projects had their own problems. For example, deep-sea water needed a very large investment at the start. And small-molecule water had legal limits. (Editor: Chang Liang-chih) July 26, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Water Corporation Still Losing Money in First Half of Year; Leak Reduction Plan of Over NT$70 Billion Adds Financial Pressure</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Tseng Chih-yi, Taipei, July 26) In recent years, Taiwan Water Corporation (TWC) has been borrowing more money to pay for water projects. This means they have to pay more interest, and their equipment becomes less valuable over time. These things have made their losses bigger each year. TWC expects to lose another NT$5.9 billion this year. According to TWC's financial report, they have already lost about NT$2.4 billion in the first six months (January to June). Also, they have a plan to reduce water leaks that will cost over NT$70 billion. TWC needs to find this money themselves. All these things together will make their money problems worse.</p>
            <p>TWC keeps working on many water supply projects. Their total debt is now more than NT$100 billion. They pay a lot of money in interest every year. TWC has been losing money for two years in a row, and the amount of loss is still growing. This year, they expect to lose about NT$5.9 billion more. As of June this year, they had lost NT$2.432 billion before taxes. Their debt ratio is 47.71%.</p>
            <p>The situation for running the company is becoming harder. Starting this year, TWC will begin an 8-year "Leak Reduction Plan." This plan will cost a total of NT$80.77 billion. For the first four years, the government will give NT$2 billion each year, totaling NT$8 billion. TWC needs to find the remaining NT$72.774 billion themselves. When they complete these projects, the value of their fixed assets will go down over time, which means more financial costs. Also, the average interest rate on their loans is going up, and their operating costs continue to rise. So, it is clear that their financial pressure will get heavier.</p>
            <p>The 8-year leak reduction plan will use smart ways to manage and fix water leaks. They will use big data to find areas where leaks happen most often. They will also investigate leaks and replace old pipes. The plan will focus on taking care of the entire pipe system. After the plan is finished, the leak rate should go down from 11.99% at the end of 2024 to 9.77% at the end of 2032. This means they will save about 59.1 million cubic meters of water each year. This amount is about the same as 1.17 times the usable water storage of the Hushan Reservoir.</p>
            <p>Besides the leak reduction plan, TWC has also recently reviewed and improved its response to water outages after Typhoon Danas. One important task is to create standard procedures for pumping stations that do not have permanent generators. They have also prepared measures for areas where the ground is weak. These steps include moving portable generators to these areas in advance. They also rent generators based on agreements with companies to make sure power supply does not stop. For some pumping stations that are on the side of the road and have little space, TWC will use water trucks and water buckets.</p>
            <p>Also, TWC will work with Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) to get power restored first at important sites. This is to reduce the impact on water supply for people's homes. TWC is also planning to ask Taipower for advice. This is based on instructions from Lai Chien-hsin, the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs. TWC wants to learn about Taipower's disaster response teams and how they manage things during a disaster. TWC will then try to use these good ideas to make its own disaster response much better.
