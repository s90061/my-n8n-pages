The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to significantly boost the adoption of co-packaged optics (CPO), which will benefit many chip and component suppliers, including Broadcom and Nvidia. This information comes from a J.P. Morgan report.

According to J.P. Morgan's analyst, Samik Chatterjee, while challenges like managing heat and easy repair still exist, progress in these areas and the pressure on current technologies have started to make people more positive about CPO.

**Nvidia Could Reach $5 Trillion Value as Analysts Raise Price Targets**

Nvidia is receiving new optimistic predictions after its shares rapidly increased over the past five years. Analysts are now suggesting that the chipmaker could grow into a company worth $5 trillion. The company's stock has already seen significant gains, and this new forecast suggests a continued strong performance in the coming years. This positive outlook is largely due to Nvidia's leading position in the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market and its strong financial results.

**Taiwan Adds Chinaâ€™s Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List**

Taiwanâ€™s Commerce Ministry has added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list. This decision is part of ongoing trade and technology tensions with China.

The move means that certain advanced technologies and products can no longer be sold to these Chinese companies without special permission from the Taiwanese government. This action by Taiwan aligns with similar measures taken by the United States, which has also imposed restrictions on Huawei and SMIC to limit Chinaâ€™s access to critical technologies, especially those related to advanced semiconductors.

This new control measure is expected to impact the global technology supply chain, as Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors. The decision reflects Taiwan's efforts to protect its technological advantages and align with international partners on strategic trade policies.
