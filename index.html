            <h1>Lee Sinje Says Watching Videos of Abused Daughters Makes Any Mother Understand the Pain</h1>
            <p>A new TV show called "The Soul Resurrection Plan" showed its first look today. In the video, actresses Shu Qi, Lee Sinje, and Alyssa Chia talk about how mothers feel when they want revenge. Lee Sinje said that the hardest part for her was going into a room where dead bodies are kept to identify a body. She also had to watch videos of her daughter being hurt. She said, "Any woman who is a mother will understand that kind of pain."</p>
            <p>The TV show "The Soul Resurrection Plan" is about a kidnapping and fraud case. It looks at how mothers bring a fraud boss, who was sentenced to death and died, back to life. They then go on a dark journey of hate and trying to find peace. Today, the show released a video about "A Mother's Revenge." In the show, Shu Qi's daughter is kidnapped. She lives, but she can no longer move or speak. Shu Qi shared in a press release that her character is a mother who accepts what happens to her. She struggles with revenge until she meets Lee Sinje, and then she decides, "I must help my good friend do this."</p>
            <p>In the video, Lee Sinje treats the person who was sentenced to death, Fu Meng-po, very harshly. She shows a tough side that cannot be messed with. Lee Sinje said she had been waiting for a role that felt strange, far away, and a bit scary, but also very real. She also remembered reading the script, and one scene was hard for her to forget. Her character goes into a room to identify a dead body, and then she has to watch videos of her daughter being hurt. Lee Sinje said, "Any woman who has been a mother will truly understand that pain in their heart." She said her character is a woman who can change into someone she never imagined for the people she loves.</p>
            <p>Alyssa Chia plays a mother and a lawyer in the show. Her daughter survived the case. At first, Alyssa Chia helped Shu Qi and Lee Sinje try to get justice. But as the case became more difficult, the three mothers started to trust each other less. This was her first time working with the two famous actresses, Lee Sinje and Shu Qi. Alyssa Chia, who is also a famous actress, said she felt a special connection when acting with them. As a mother herself, she felt the sadness of the three daughters in the show and the pain of being a victim's mother. She said, "When motherhood and revenge come together, that power is very, very, very strong."</p>

            <h1>To Deal with US Tariffs, Financial Watchdog Extends Special Insurance Loan Plan Until August End</h1>
            <p>Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that life insurance companies will let people apply for a special loan offer on their insurance policies for longer. This is to help people who are having financial problems because of US tariffs. Usually, this offer is only available from January to March each year. But this year, it has been opened again from June 1 to August 31. The FSC also asked companies to take care of their customers.</p>
            <p>On August 18, the Ministry of Labor announced that 3934 people had to work fewer hours because of the economy. The Ministry of Labor said that 2388 of these people were affected by the US tariffs, mostly in factories that make metal and electrical machines. News reporters asked if the FSC had plans to help businesses if more people lost work hours because of the economy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Huo-yen, who is a deputy director at the FSC's Insurance Bureau, explained that because of the US tariffs, they sent a letter on April 18. This letter asked insurance groups to tell their member companies to help businesses and customers in Taiwan who are affected by the tariffs. They suggested that insurance companies could allow people to pay back old loans later or offer lower rent.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai also said that the special loan plan for people with financial difficulties started in July 2021 and became a regular service in 2022. Every year, from January 1 to March 31, people who qualify can apply. This helps people who are struggling get help quickly. During the time of the pandemic, they also asked insurance companies to let people pay their next insurance payment later. In May this year, the FSC asked life insurance companies to offer the special loan plan on insurance policies again. They extended the time to apply from June 1 to August 31.</p>
            <p>Figures show that from January to March this year, 1878 people applied. They approved loans worth 164 million New Taiwan Dollars. The special interest rate for these loans this year is 2.165%. Mr. Tsai said that this means there are three extra months to apply this year. The second round of applications is still open, and 21 life insurance companies are part of this plan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hou Li-yang, a deputy director at the FSC's Banking Bureau, explained that to deal with the US tariff policy, the FSC, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Bankers Association started working together on April 4. On April 18, they also asked the Bankers Association to suggest ways banks could help financially. These included letting people extend old loans until the end of this year, quickly checking new loan requests, and asking banks to have one main contact person. In May, they also asked the Bankers Association to tell its member companies to help private businesses affected by US tariffs. By the end of June, the percentage of bad loans for local banks was 0.16%. This percentage has not gone up much in the last three years, and they will keep watching how good the banks' assets are.</p>
            <p>For people who work fewer hours, Mr. Hou said that if a company has financial problems that cause people to work fewer hours or cannot pay back loans, the Ministry of Economic Affairs helps businesses talk with banks about their debts. The Bankers Association also helps individuals talk about their debts. Now, they are also letting people extend their debt payments, similar to what they did during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Hou-ming, a deputy director at the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that if listed companies make people work fewer hours and this greatly affects their money and business, they must quickly tell the public. He also asked the TPEx and Taiwan Stock Exchange to make sure listed companies follow the rules.</p>

            <h1>China and India Talk About Border Problems, Look for Fair Answers</h1>
            <p>Today, China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, and India's National Security Advisor met in New Delhi. This was their 24th meeting about the border problems between China and India. China's news agency, Xinhua, said that both sides agreed to find solutions for the border issue that are fair and that both countries can agree on. They also said they would control the border better all the time.</p>
            <p>According to the report, Wang Yi and Ajit Doval talked deeply and well about the border problems and how China and India work together. They also shared ideas about important world and regional issues. They decided to have their 25th meeting in China next year. Wang Yi came to this meeting as the head of the office for foreign affairs in China.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi said that this year, the relationship between China and India has been getting better, and the border area has been more peaceful. He said that China and India are two big countries that are neighbors and still growing. They "think in similar ways and have many shared interests." He added that they should trust and help each other. "This is how two new big countries should be," he said.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that China thinks it is very important that India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, will go to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting in Tianjin. China hopes India will help make the meeting a success.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also said that both sides should follow a plan where they do two things at once, help each other, and create a good cycle. This means they should look at and deal with their relationship and border issues this way. They should talk to each other to trust each other more and work together more. They should also agree on things, decide on directions, and set goals for controlling the border, talking about the border line, and having exchanges across the border. This will help them solve problems and make good progress, making things better for both countries.</p>
            <p>The report also says that Doval stated that the border area between India and China is currently calm and peaceful. He added that the relationship between the two countries has made great improvements. He noted that the world is unstable now, and India and China face many of the same challenges. It is important to "understand each other more, trust each other more, and work together more." This is good for the people in both countries and for peace in the world.</p>
            <p>Doval said that this year marks 75 years since India and China started official relations. Prime Minister Modi hopes to go to the SCO meeting in Tianjin. He believes this will help the relationship between India and China grow even more. India wants to keep talking with China in a positive way to create the right conditions for finally solving the border problem.</p>
            <p>According to the report, Wang Yi and Doval talked about the first steps they have taken in their border talks. They repeated that they will use their special meeting system. They will follow the rules they agreed on in 2005, respecting each other and understanding each other. They will look for solutions that are fair and that both sides can agree on. At the same time, they will control the border better all the time and work together to keep the border area peaceful.</p>
