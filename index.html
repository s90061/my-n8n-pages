            <h1>Reuters Poll: Most Americans Think Countries Should Recognize Palestine</h1>
            <p>According to a new poll by Reuters and Ipsos, more than half of Americans, 58%, believe that countries belonging to the United Nations should recognize Palestine as an independent state. 33% of people asked did not agree with this, and the rest, 9%, did not answer.</p>
            <p>Reuters and Ipsos conducted this online poll over six days. They collected answers from 4446 adults across the United States. The results are accurate to about 2 percentage points, plus or minus. The poll found that Americans are clearly divided on the issue of recognizing Palestine, based on their political party.</p>
            <p>A large number of Democrats, 78%, support recognizing Palestine. This is much higher than Republicans, where only 41% support it. More than half of Republicans, 53%, do not agree that all UN member countries should recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>The poll also showed that about 65% of the people surveyed said that the United States should help people in Gaza who are suffering from hunger. 28% of those asked did not agree with this idea, and 41% of them were Republicans.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the poll found that 59% of Americans think Israel's military actions in Gaza have been too extreme. 33% of the people surveyed did not agree with this view.</p>

            <h1>CNBC: Intel Discussing New Investments at Lower Prices with Big Investors</h1>
            <p>The American business news channel CNBC has reported that Intel, the well-known technology company, is talking with other large investors. These talks are about the possibility of these investors buying more shares in Intel at a cheaper price, according to people who know about the discussions.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan announced that it would invest 2 billion US dollars in Intel. There have also been rumors that the US government is thinking about investing in Intel in different ways. After these reports, Intel's stock price went up for a short time. However, today, the stock price went down by more than 7%.</p>
            <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick spoke to CNBC yesterday. He said that the US government should get a part ownership in Intel in return for giving money from the "CHIPS Act."</p>
            <p>People who are familiar with the situation say that Intel is now looking for other big investors, apart from SoftBank, to get more money for the company.</p>
            <p>Intel has had lower sales and a smaller share of the market for several years. The company is now trying to change its business and become strong again.</p>
