            <h1>Yageo: Shibaura Electronics now supports the takeover offer, and the deadline is moved to October 3.</h1>
            <p>A big company that makes electronic parts, Yageo (stock code 2327), has made good progress in its plan to buy Japan's Shibaura Electronics. Japanese media reported last night that Shibaura Electronics supports Yageo's offer to buy the company. Yageo said in a press release last night that they are thankful for Shibaura Electronics' official support and for telling its shareholders to take part in the offer.</p>
            <p>Yageo explained that because of Japanese laws, if there are big changes to the deal, the takeover process must be extended by 10 days until October 3. This gives shareholders enough time to carefully think about this good news and finish the process.</p>
            <p>Japanese media said that Shibaura Electronics announced yesterday its support for Yageo's offer. Shibaura Electronics believes this takeover can help them in many ways, such as making their business stronger in other countries and having more products. Today, Shibaura Electronics also officially announced its support for Yageo's takeover plan.</p>
            <p>Japanese media also reported that Yageo and Shibaura Electronics agreed yesterday that after Yageo buys the company, Shibaura Electronics will remain a separate legal company. Yageo will respect Shibaura Electronics' independence in running its business as much as possible. Both companies also agreed that Shibaura Electronics will keep all its current employees.</p>
            <p>Yageo said last night that, as Shibaura Electronics stated in its announcement, they had many talks and positive meetings over the past few months. These talks were important in changing Shibaura Electronics' decision to support the offer.</p>
            <p>Yageo is happy that Shibaura Electronics fully agrees that both companies can achieve good results together. Yageo strongly believes that this cooperation will create a better future for Shibaura Electronics and its employees.</p>
            <p>Yageo officially started its offer to buy Shibaura Electronics' shares for 6200 Japanese Yen per share on May 9. During this time, Yageo changed the deadline for the offer several times. Because of competition from Japan's Minebea Mitsumi, Yageo announced on August 23 that it would increase its offer price for Shibaura Electronics shares to 7130 Japanese Yen per share.</p>
            <p>On September 2, Yageo said that it had received approval from Japan for foreign direct investment (FDI). They expect to finish the deal by the third quarter of this year.</p>
            <p>According to information, Shibaura Electronics mainly makes NTC thermistors (parts that sense temperature) and also makes and sells sensors for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</p>

            <h1>Badminton Player Chi Yu-jen Wins Big After Being Behind in China Masters Tournament</h1>
            <p>In the BWF Super 750 China Masters badminton tournament, Taiwan's good player Chi Yu-jen had a surprising comeback today in the final game of his first match in men's singles. He was behind by 6 points but fought back and beat Japan's Yushi Tanaka. He now moves on to the next round.</p>
            <p>Chi Yu-jen is ranked 28th in the world. Today, he played against Yushi Tanaka from Japan, who has a similar rank, in the first round of men's singles. Chi Yu-jen has always played well against Yushi Tanaka. In their past four matches, Chi Yu-jen won all of them in two straight games. He is known as Tanaka's "biggest challenge."</p>
            <p>After two months, they played again. In the first game, Chi Yu-jen played very strongly. He was ahead for almost the whole game. After a short break, he got even more points and won the first game 21-12 easily. But in the second game, Chi Yu-jen did not keep up his strong play. He suddenly started playing badly, and Yushi Tanaka began to control the game. So, Chi Yu-jen lost the second game 14-21, and the match was tied.</p>
            <p>In the third and final game, Chi Yu-jen still could not play his best. He was 5 points behind at the start. After another short break, he was even further behind, 10-16. It looked like he would lose the match. But Chi Yu-jen suddenly started playing well again. He won 8 points in a row to get ahead. Even though Tanaka quickly caught up, Chi Yu-jen then won 3 more points in a row. He won the game 21-18 in a very close match.</p>
            <p>After this tough match, which lasted over an hour, Chi Yu-jen has still never lost to Yushi Tanaka. He also moved on to the next round in men's singles. In his next match, he will play against Nhat Nguyen, a player from Ireland with Vietnamese family. Chi Yu-jen will try to win and get into the top 8 players.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan's female singles player Chiu Pin-chien played against Indonesia's new player, Putri Kusuma Wardani, who is the 7th ranked player. But Chiu Pin-chien lost in just 37 minutes, with two scores of 15-21. She did not move on to the next round in women's singles.</p>
