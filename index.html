The cost of living in the UK is growing slower, which is good news for many families. Official figures show that the rate of inflation has fallen to 2.3%. This means that prices are still going up, but not as quickly as before. This is the lowest inflation rate in almost three years. Energy bills, especially gas and electricity, have become cheaper, which is a big reason for this change. Food prices are also increasing less quickly.
However, some prices are still rising faster. For example, prices in restaurants, hotels, and for transport are still going up more quickly than the average. This change in inflation could mean that the Bank of England will decide to lower interest rates soon, which would make borrowing money cheaper. This would help people who have loans or mortgages. While the news is positive, many families still find things expensive, and their wages haven't increased as much as prices did in the past.

**New Study Suggests AI's Impact on Jobs Might Be Less Harmful Than Feared**

Many people worry that artificial intelligence (AI) will take away a lot of jobs. However, new research suggests that this might not be as big a problem as some imagine. The study, from a group of universities, looked at how AI could change different jobs. It found that while AI will definitely change how we work, it's not likely to lead to huge numbers of people losing their jobs.
Instead, the study believes that AI will mostly change the tasks we do in our jobs. This means that people might need to learn new skills to work alongside AI. For example, AI could help with routine tasks, allowing people to focus on more creative or complex work. The research encourages governments and companies to invest in training programs. This way, workers can adapt to the new technologies and use AI to improve their work, rather than be replaced by it.

**Italy Struggles with "Overtourism" as Visitor Numbers Rise**

Italy, a popular country for tourists, is facing a growing problem called "overtourism." This means that too many tourists are visiting certain famous places, which can cause problems for local people and the environment. Recently, the number of visitors to Italy has gone up a lot, even more than before the pandemic. Cities like Venice and Florence, and beautiful areas like the Cinque Terre, are feeling the pressure the most.
When too many tourists come, it can make daily life difficult for residents. For example, rents go up, and local shops might be replaced by souvenir stores. It can also damage historical sites and nature. Local governments in Italy are trying to find ways to manage the large crowds. Some ideas include limiting the number of visitors, making tourists pay a fee to enter certain areas, or encouraging people to visit less famous places. The goal is to protect Italy's beauty and culture while still welcoming visitors.
