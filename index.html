OpenAI has announced important new updates to its artificial intelligence (AI) models. They launched GPT-4o, a new AI that is much faster and can understand and generate content using text, sound, and even images. This means users can have more natural conversations with the AI, asking questions by voice and getting spoken answers, or showing it pictures and discussing them. The "o" in GPT-4o stands for "omni," meaning it works with everything.

To make this technology easier to use, OpenAI also released a new desktop application for macOS computers. This app allows users to access the AI directly from their computer's desktop, making it simple to ask questions or get help without opening a web browser. A version for Windows computers will be released later this year. The company's goal is to make advanced AI tools available to everyone, helping them in their daily lives and work.

**The Growing Trend of the Four-Day Work Week**

Across the world, more and more companies are experimenting with a four-day work week. This new way of working usually means employees work only four days a week instead of five, but still get paid the same salary. The idea is that working fewer hours can make employees happier and more focused, leading to the same or even better productivity.

Several trials in different countries, such as the UK, Iceland, and the United States, have shown positive results. Companies reported that employees were less stressed, took fewer sick days, and were more motivated. Businesses also noted that they could attract and keep talented staff more easily. While there are still challenges, like coordinating with clients and managing workloads, the four-day week is becoming a serious option for the future of work.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers**

The popular Italian city of Venice has started charging a fee for day visitors. This new rule, which began in April, requires people who visit for just one day to pay a â‚¬5 charge. The main reason for this decision is to help manage the very large number of tourists who visit the city, especially during busy times of the year. Over-tourism has put a lot of pressure on Venice's delicate environment and historic buildings.

Visitors who are staying overnight in Venice, residents of the city, and some other groups do not have to pay the fee. People who need to pay must book their visit online beforehand and get a QR code. This trial program aims to encourage tourists to visit during less busy periods and to protect the city's unique culture and infrastructure for future generations.`;
