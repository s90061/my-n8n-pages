            <h1>Taiwanese-American Player Fairchild Moves to Rays, Continues Major League Opportunity</h1>
            <p>(CNA News by Lin Hong-han, Los Angeles, July 22) Taiwanese-American baseball player Stuart Fairchild, who plays in the outfield, was removed from the Atlanta Braves' 40-man roster. This means he lost his place on the team. Today, the Tampa Bay Rays picked him up, giving him another chance to play in Major League Baseball.</p>
            <p>Fairchild is 29 years old. He might play for Taiwan in the 2026 World Baseball Classic (WBC) as an outfielder. He has played in Major League Baseball for five seasons. He is a very good fielder and runs very fast. During spring training this year, he told CNA that he wanted to play for the Taiwan team.</p>
            <p>This year, Fairchild played for the Braves as a backup outfielder. He was still trying hard to stay in Major League Baseball. Yesterday, the Braves announced they would remove him from their 40-man roster. This is called "Designated For Assignment" (DFA). Now, he might have to play in the minor leagues or move to another team.</p>
            <p>Today, the Tampa Bay Rays announced they got Fairchild in a cash deal. He will wear jersey number 20. Today, the Rays played against the Chicago White Sox at home. Fairchild did not start the game, but he was on the list of players who could play.</p>
            <p>This year, Fairchild did not get to play much for the Braves. At the end of May, he hurt his right pinky finger while sliding. He could not play for more than two weeks. This season, he played in 28 games. He had 51 chances to hit and got 11 hits. His batting average was .216. He did not hit any home runs. (Edited by Chang Chih-hsuan) July 23, 2025.</p>

            <h1>US Government May Punish Mexico's Airlines for Flight and Cargo Rules</h1>
            <p>(CNA News by Lee Teng-wen, Guatemala City, July 22) The Mexican government has had unfair rules for US cargo airlines since 2022. These rules include where planes can land and take off. Because of this, the US government recently warned that if Mexico does not fix the problem right away, they will punish Mexican airlines more. This could affect Mexican flights to the US.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Transportation said that the Mexican government, under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, ordered US cargo airlines to move their main operations. They had to move from Mexico City International Airport (AICM) to Felipe Angeles International Airport, which is outside the city center. Also, some flight times were canceled by force. The US believes this hurts fair competition in the airline market.</p>
            <p>Mexican newspaper "EL FINANCIERO" reported on July 22 that US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said Mexico "broke its promises, changed the market unfairly, and hurt American businesses." He said the US will not accept such actions from Mexico anymore. Future punishments are also part of President Trump's "America First" policy. Duffy also gave similar warnings to European airlines, not just Mexican ones.</p>
            <p>The US said that American airlines have complained to the Mexican government many times. Being forced to use an airport far from the city center makes it more expensive to operate. Also, the Mexican government stopped US cargo airlines from landing and taking off at different places in Mexico to carry more international goods. The US government and airlines have complained and talked about this many times, but they have not received any answers.</p>
            <p>The report said that the US government might punish Mexico in several ways. This could include: asking Mexican airlines to share all their flight plans in the US before flights, making all large charter flights for people or goods get approval from the US Department of Transportation first, and ending a special agreement between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico. This special agreement allowed these two companies to work together on ticket prices and flight routes. If it ends, they cannot do that anymore.</p>
            <p>The report also said that flights between the US and Mexico are some of the busiest in the world. If the special agreement between Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico ends, Aeromexico will lose its ability to work with Delta on routes and prices. This will cause them to lose money. The US Department of Transportation also warned that if the Mexican government does not change its rules soon, the US might not allow Mexican airlines to apply for new flights in the future.</p>
            <p>About the US government's claims, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and officials from the Ministry of Transport defended the former president's policy. Sheinbaum said that moving US cargo airlines from Mexico City International Airport to Felipe Angeles International Airport outside the city center was a technical decision. The main reasons were to reduce too much traffic at Mexico City International Airport and to make flights safer and more efficient.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum said that these rules are good for everyone and that companies have slowly gotten used to them. She said there is no reason for the US to punish Mexico.</p>
            <p>The report said that the bad feelings between the US and Mexico have grown. It started with changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, then came higher taxes on goods, and now it's about air travel. The future of this situation is worrying.
