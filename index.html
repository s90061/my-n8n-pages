<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia has reportedly secured all the production capacity at Wistron's newly opened server facility in Taiwan until 2026. This move is to meet the high demand for AI servers.

The facility in Zhubei, Taiwan, will be used to produce Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. These orders, which run through 2026, show Nvidia's strong effort to get enough AI infrastructure capacity because demand is much higher than what is available.

The plant started operating this quarter and officially opened on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production are already set for at least a year. According to *Economic Daily* and *Commercial Times*, Nvidia has effectively reserved all future output from this plant.

Wistron's total operations are expected to produce about 240,000 Blackwell-based systems every three months. The company has warned that its current capacity might not be enough to meet future demand by 2026. To fix this, Wistron has secured a nearby building to become a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its production in Taiwan.

AI server shipments are a main driver of growth not only for Wistron but also for other companies like Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is also expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By booking full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is making sure that its cloud and system partners get the necessary AI servers, while competitors might face tighter supply limits. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity shows its plan to lead the AI hardware industry.

**Emerging Currencies Pare Drop as Dollar Wavers on Fed, Mideast**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emerging-assets-drop-us-strike-045157182.html">News Link</a>

Developing-nation currencies recovered some losses as investors considered the future steps for U.S. interest rates and rising tensions in the Middle East.

The MSCI index for emerging market currencies had fallen to its lowest point since February, mainly due to the U.S. dollar strengthening. This happened after Federal Reserve officials suggested that borrowing costs might stay higher for longer. However, the index later reduced its losses, and Asian currencies strengthened against the dollar. The euro also rose as bond yields increased after reports that the European Central Bank might hint at more interest rate hikes.

Geopolitical risks in the Middle East have pushed oil prices higher, adding to concerns about global inflation. These worries are making investors cautious about how quickly central banks, including the Federal Reserve, will cut interest rates this year. Currently, traders expect fewer rate cuts from the Fed than they did earlier this year.

In emerging markets, the South African rand led the gains, while the Chilean peso, Brazilian real, and Mexican peso also showed strength. In other news, the Bank of Korea decided to keep its policy interest rate unchanged, matching analysts' predictions.
