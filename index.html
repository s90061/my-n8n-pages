Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing our daily lives, and now it might become your personal coach, teacher, or even therapist. Companies are developing AI programs that can help you improve your health, learn new skills, or manage your feelings. For example, some AI tools can offer advice on fitness, create study plans, or guide you through meditation exercises.

People are starting to use these AI tools because they are often easy to access and less expensive than human professionals. They can provide support at any time, which is helpful for busy schedules. However, there are also some important things to consider. Experts are worried about the privacy of personal information shared with AI, and whether the advice AI gives is always correct or safe. There are also questions about how emotional support from AI compares to support from real people. As AI becomes more common, it's important to make sure these tools are used responsibly and safely for everyone.

**Global Job Market Expected to Slow Down, But Stay Strong**

The world's job market is expected to grow more slowly this year, according to a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO). While the number of jobs might not increase as fast as before, the overall job market is likely to stay strong. This means that even with slower growth, there should still be many jobs available for people.

The report suggests that global unemployment will be around 4.9% in 2024, a small decrease from last year. This positive outlook is due to several reasons, including steady economic conditions in many countries. However, the ILO also pointed out some challenges. They said that wages might not increase as much as prices, meaning people's buying power could drop. Also, there are still many people, especially in developing countries, who don't have good quality jobs or work long hours for low pay. The ILO wants governments and businesses to work together to create more good jobs and improve working conditions worldwide.

**Kyoto to Stop Tourists From Entering Private Geisha Alleys**

Japan's city of Kyoto, famous for its traditional culture, will soon ban tourists from entering certain private streets in its geisha district. This decision comes because of problems caused by too many tourists, a situation often called "overtourism." For a long time, local residents have complained about visitors bothering geisha, taking photos without permission, and acting disrespectfully in these narrow alleys.

Starting in April, signs will be put up to tell tourists that these private streets are not open to the public. If tourists ignore these signs, they could face a fine of 10,000 yen (about $66). While the main public streets of the Gion district will remain open, the new rule aims to protect the local residents' peace and the geisha's privacy. Many locals hope this step will encourage tourists to be more respectful of traditional Japanese customs and private spaces. This action by Kyoto highlights how popular travel spots are trying to manage large numbers of visitors and protect their unique local way of life.
