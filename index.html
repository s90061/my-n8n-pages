            <h1>Tall Building in Gaza City Destroyed by Airstrike; Israeli Army Says Hamas Used It to Watch Troops</h1>
            <p>On September 6th, Israel attacked a tall building in Gaza City from the air. This was the second tall building hit in two days. The Israeli army had told people to move south to a "humanitarian area." This was because they were planning an attack on the center of Gaza City.</p>
            <p>News reports say that for many weeks, Israel has been warning about new attacks on the largest city in the Palestinian area. However, they did not say when these attacks would happen.</p>
            <p>Israel has increased its air attacks and ground actions in the areas outside Gaza City. People are worried that this will make the already bad situation even worse.</p>
            <p>People who saw what happened and reporters said that Israeli planes dropped thousands of leaflets in several western parts of Gaza City today. These leaflets told residents to leave.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for Gaza's civil defense, told reporters that 24 Palestinians died today because of Israeli attacks. Five of them died near a place where help was given out, west of Khan Yunis.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said today that they attacked a tall building in Gaza City. They said that Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, was using the building to "watch" Israeli troops. They also said they took "steps to reduce harm to civilians."</p>
            <p>People who saw the building said it was the "Sussi" residential building. They said the building was completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>Israel's Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, shared a video. It showed the building, which was about 15 stories high, falling down in dust.</p>
            <p>Hamas said the attack was wrong. They also said they do not use homes or buildings for civilians for military reasons.</p>

            <h1>Red Bull Gym Clash: Tumaz Strong Gym Wins Taiwan Championship, Moves to World Finals</h1>
            <p>On September 6th, a new fitness competition called Red Bull Gym Clash had its Taiwan final. Tumaz Strong Gym won the championship for Taiwan. They will go to the world finals from October 2nd to 5th. There, they will compete to be known as the strongest gym.</p>
            <p>Red Bull Gym Clash is a fitness competition held all over the world. This new team fitness competition is different from typical individual sports. Teams have two men and two women. They have to lift heavy weights one after another. They also need to run and lift dumbbells over their shoulders, all within 23 minutes. This competition tests not only how strong the athletes are but also how well the team works together, how precise their movements are, and how well they talk to each other under pressure.</p>
            <p>In today's Taiwan final, strong athletes from gyms in northern, central, and southern Taiwan came to compete. Tumaz Strong Gym won first place out of 8 teams. Their team lifted a total of 410 kilograms and finished in 27 minutes and 33 seconds. They will go to Athens, Greece, from October 2nd to 5th, for the world finals. They will try to win the title of the strongest gym.</p>
            <p>A female athlete named Zhuo Jiayu, who represents Fitness Factory Yonghua branch, made an Asian squat record in the 2023 Asian Powerlifting Championship. This year, she will also compete for Taiwan in the World Powerlifting Championship.</p>
            <p>Zhuo Jiayu is a pharmacist. Before the competition, she told reporters that she usually only has small amounts of time to train. Because of this, she has also gotten better at not putting things off. She said managing time is very important.</p>

            <h1>UN: Mail Sent to US Drops by 81% After Washington Stops Tax-Free Small Packages</h1>
            <p>On September 6th, the Universal Postal Union (UPU), which is part of the United Nations (UN) and helps countries work together on mail, said something important. After the United States stopped allowing small packages to enter without extra taxes at the end of August, the amount of mail sent to the US dropped by 80%. Also, 88 postal companies around the world have stopped some or all of their mail services to the US.</p>
            <p>News reports say that at the end of July, the government announced that starting from August 29th, small packages sent to the US would no longer be tax-free. After this, many postal companies in countries like Australia, the UK, France, Germany, India, Italy, and Japan said they would stop accepting most packages going to the US.</p>
            <p>The Universal Postal Union said that they looked at data shared by postal companies through their online system. This data showed that on August 29th, the amount of mail sent to the US was 81% less than it was one week before.</p>
            <p>Also, 88 postal companies told the Universal Postal Union that they have stopped sending some or all mail to the US. They will not start again until a solution is found. These companies include Deutsche Post from Germany, Royal Mail from the UK, and two postal services from Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
            <p>Masahiko Metoki, the Director General of the Universal Postal Union, said in a statement that they are working hard to create a technical solution quickly. This solution will help packages be sent to the US again.</p>
