            <h1>Taiwanese Moon Lute and Portuguese Guitar Meet in Canada</h1>
            <p>What do Taiwan and Portugal have in common? A lecture at TAIWANfest in Toronto showed that the traditional Taiwanese instrument, the "moon lute," and the traditional Portuguese "Fado guitar" both look round. They are a great way for both cultures to learn about each other and connect.</p>
            <p>This year, TAIWANfest in Canada used Portugal as a starting point. They talked deeply about history, literature, music, government policies, and art.</p>
            <p>Ada (real name Jiang Yu-da), the leader of Taiwan's "Rural Armed Youth Band," and Simon Arruda, a Portuguese-Canadian Fado guitar player from Toronto, both shared how they started playing their traditional string instruments again. Ada plays the Taiwanese moon lute, and Arruda plays the Portuguese guitar. This happened at the "Forum of Hope" lecture at the Toronto Harbourfront Centre yesterday. People who attended were surprised to see how similar the two instruments are when they heard them play and learned about them.</p>
            <p>Ada is the main person in the Rural Armed Youth Band. He writes songs, sings, and plays guitar and the moon lute. In the past, the band used folk music and punk rock ideas to support many social movements.</p>
            <p>Ada said that the moon lute is about 300 years old. It was called the "beggar's lute" because it was used by poor people in Taiwan to sing and play music to make a living. When you play the moon lute, which only has two strings, there is no set rhythm. The player needs to know how to practice very well to find "freedom." It is a true Taiwanese instrument, but it almost disappeared after 3 generations of political and cultural control.</p>
            <p>Arruda is one of only four musicians in the Greater Toronto Area who publicly plays traditional Portuguese guitar music. He is also said to be the youngest. He said that the Portuguese guitar has 12 strings and is the main instrument used to play Fado, a traditional music from Lisbon, Portugal. It is about 250 years old. Fado songs are often about sailors going to sea or about a hard life.</p>
            <p>Arruda said that from 1933 to 1974, when Portugal was under a strict government, Fado music often showed sadness or disagreement. The government made it a rule that Fado music had to be checked before it could be sung. In 1974, a special Fado song was played on the radio, calling everyone to protest in the streets. This music "uprising" eventually led to the government falling in 1975.</p>
            <p>After the lecture, Arruda told CNA that he used to play regular guitar or jazz guitar. Five years ago, he started practicing a traditional Portuguese guitar that his father had bought for him a long time ago. He found a new sense of who he was through it. He even started to learn more about Portuguese language and culture and does not want to stop playing it now.</p>
            <p>When talking about what the moon lute and traditional Portuguese guitar have in common, Arruda said he was very surprised that both instruments strongly express the feelings of everyday people through music. Also, both can be played with singing or alone.</p>
            <p>Ada told CNA that he started learning the moon lute 10 years ago and dreamed of one day taking it abroad to perform. He is very happy and feels this chance to do so is very meaningful.</p>
            <p>Ada also said that before coming to Canada, he knew nothing about Fado music and the traditional Portuguese guitar. Because of this, he listened to many Fado songs and watched videos. Through talking with Arruda beforehand and sharing ideas at the lecture, he was very surprised that Portugal also had a long period of "white terror" (political repression) and how important Fado music was in bringing political change to Portugal.</p>
            <p>When talking about passing on moon lute culture, Ada said that 15 or 20 years ago, when teachers like Chen Ming-chang started playing the moon lute, its culture was almost gone. In recent years, more people have slowly started to bring the moon lute back. Hengchun is now teaching it in elementary schools, and teacher Chen Ming-chang has been holding a moon lute folk song festival in Beitou for more than 10 years. "People of all ages are slowly connecting," he said.</p>
            <p>Ada laughed and said, "My teacher's wife often tells me: 'It's your generation's turn now, you need to take over and pass it on to the next generation.'"</p>

            <h1>US Stocks Mostly Down, TSMC ADR Slightly Up; Advisors Say Watch Nvidia's Earnings</h1>
            <p>Most US stock markets closed lower, but Nvidia and TSMCâ€™s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) both went up by more than 1%. On August 25, the Taiwan stock market went up by 512.91 points, closing at 24277.38 points. Nvidia also launched its new robot brain called Thor. Investment advisors say that the US Federal Reserve might lower interest rates slowly, which could bring more money into the market. The positive feeling in the Taiwan stock market is still strong, and it might reach new high points. Everyone is watching for Nvidia's earnings report.</p>
            <p>Most major US stock indexes went down as investors waited for AI chip giant Nvidia to release its earnings report later this week.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 349.27 points, or 0.77%. The S&P 500 Index went down a little by 27.59 points, or 0.43%. The Nasdaq Index dropped by 47.25 points, or 0.22%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up slightly by 1.84 points, or 0.03%.</p>
            <p>Nvidia, a big company that makes AI chips, announced that its Jetson AGX Thor developer kit and production module for AI robots are now available. These use the Blackwell Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). They are 7.5 times faster at AI calculations and 3.5 times more energy-efficient than the previous version. This will help the age of general-purpose robots come faster.</p>
            <p>Experts in the market said that Nvidia will release its earnings report on August 27 in the US. This report will be a key sign for the whole AI market and is something everyone is watching.</p>
            <p>Nvidia's stock price went up a little by 1.02%, closing at USD 179.81. TSMCâ€™s American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) went up by 1.12%, closing at USD 235.59.</p>
            <p>On August 25, the Taiwan stock market went up by 512.91 points, closing at 24277.38 points. The total value of trades was NTD 417.833 billion. Major institutional investors bought a total of NTD 33.07 billion more than they sold.</p>
            <p>After the market closed, the Taiwan stock index futures went down by 75 points, closing at 24180 points, a drop of 0.31%.</p>
            <p>US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hinted on August 22 that interest rates might be lowered as early as September. This made oil futures go up because people think that lower interest rates will help the US economy and increase the need for oil. International oil prices continued to rise.</p>
            <p>Hon Hai announced that it is investing an extra NTD 5.1 billion in Mexico. Market experts think this is mainly to make more AI server products for customers in North America.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-ching, the deputy general manager of Taishin Securities Investment Advisory, told CNA that the market hopes the US Federal Reserve will slowly lower interest rates over time. This could bring more money into the Taiwan stock market. The Taiwan stock market closed above its monthly average on August 25, showing a positive trend. The index might try to reach its previous high of 24551 points. The market is waiting for Nvidia's second-quarter earnings report. If the report is better than expected, it could further boost AI-related stocks and push the index higher.</p>

            <h1>Trump Meets Lee Jae-myung, Suggests 'Land Ownership' for US Bases in Korea</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that he wants the United States to own the land where US military bases are in South Korea. He also asked South Korea to pay more money for the approximately 28,500 American soldiers stationed there.</p>
            <p>According to news from AFP and Yonhap, Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House today. When asked about US troops in South Korea, Trump said he wants to ask Seoul to give the United States "ownership" of the land it rents to the US for military bases.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Maybe one of the things I'd like to do is ask them to give us ownership of that land for the time we have that base. We spend a lot of money building a strong base, and South Korea also helps."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "But I want to see if we can get rid of the lease and get ownership of the land where our large military base is."</p>
            <p>When asked if his government would reduce the 28,500 US troops in South Korea, Trump said he did not want to talk about that "now." He said, "Because we have always been friends, and we are still friends now."</p>
            <p>People keep guessing that Washington is thinking about changing the size, structure, and role of US forces in South Korea. This would be to better stop the "urgent threat" from a stronger China.</p>
