            <p>The agreement between the two companies states that if Microsoft needs more services, the total value of the contract could increase to 19.4 billion US dollars.</p>

            <h1>After Jerusalem Shooting, Israel Air-Attacks Qatar to Target Hamas Leader</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a shooting in Jerusalem caused 6 deaths. Today, a military group linked to Hamas, a Palestinian organization, said they were responsible for the attack. On the same day, the Israeli army announced that it tried to kill a top Hamas leader in Doha, the capital of Qatar.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, which is a military group of Hamas, said in a message on the Telegram app: "The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades claims responsibility for the shooting that happened yesterday morning."</p>
            <p>This afternoon, several explosions were heard in Doha, Qatar. Smoke was seen rising from an area where some embassies are located. The Israeli army made a statement, saying they had attacked Hamas officials in Doha.</p>
            <p>Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, are still fighting. A source from Hamas told Al Jazeera that Israel's attacks today were aimed at Hamas's group for talks. These attacks happened while Hamas negotiators were meeting to discuss the newest ceasefire plan suggested by the United States.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the attack "clearly breaks all international laws and rules, and it seriously threatens the safety of Qatari citizens and people living in Qatar."</p>
            <p>Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the US White House, told Al Jazeera that the US government would not comment on Israel's attack in Doha at this time.</p>
            <p>The US Embassy in Doha was the first to officially speak about the attack. They said they had heard "reports of missile attacks in the Qatari capital." The embassy also posted on social media that it had told its staff to stay in a safe place. It also advised American citizens in Qatar to find a safe place to stay.</p>
            <p>Later, Qatar's Interior Ministry posted on social media, saying that "the situation is currently safe."</p>
            <p>The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel's attack on Hamas leaders today was a "completely separate" action. They stated it was "started by Israel, carried out by Israel, and Israel takes full responsibility."</p>
            <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticized Israel's attack on Qatar today. He called it a "clear violation" of Qatar's independence.</p>
            <p>Guterres said at a press conference: "We just learned about the Israeli attack on Qatar. Qatar has been very active in helping to achieve a ceasefire and release all hostages. I strongly disapprove of this clear violation of Qatar's independence and its territory."</p>

            <h1>Poland Closes Border with Belarus as Russia and Belarus Plan Joint Military Drills</h1>
            <p>Today, Polish Prime Minister Tusk announced that Poland will close its border with Belarus. This is happening because Russia and Belarus are planning to hold joint military exercises soon.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Belarus used to be part of the Soviet Union and is an important friend to Russia. When Russia attacked Ukraine in February 2022, it used land in Belarus to start its invasion. The joint military exercises, named "Zapad-2025," will take place from September 12th to 16th this month.</p>
            <p>Donald Tusk said at a press conference: "For reasons of national security, we will close our border with Belarus, including the railway connections. This is related to the 'Zapad' military exercises starting at midnight on the 12th."</p>
            <p>He also added that in response to these joint military exercises, Poland and its allies will also hold military training exercises inside Poland. About 30,000 soldiers are expected to take part.</p>
            <p>Tusk explained that the "Zapad" military exercises by Russia and Belarus are meant to practice taking over what is called the "Suwalki Corridor." This is a narrow piece of land along the border between Poland and Lithuania. On its other sides, it is surrounded by Belarusian land and Kaliningrad, which is a part of Russia separate from the main country.</p>
            <p>The Suwalki Corridor is often seen as a "weak point" for NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). If Russia were to attack, this area might be the first target.</p>
