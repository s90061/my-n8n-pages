President Lai Ching-te is giving ten speeches about bringing the country together. For his third speech, he talked about the constitution. Taichung City Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that many people want the President to talk about the economy. She suggested that the President should offer solutions for economic problems.

Mayor Lu mentioned a recent survey. It showed that nearly 70% of people want the President to discuss the economy. She asked the President to talk about economic issues if he has more speeches.

Lu Shiow-yen said that Taiwan's economy is facing big challenges right now. The New Taiwan Dollar has gotten stronger, which hurts businesses that sell goods to other countries. This year is very difficult for the economy. Life insurance companies are also losing a lot of money because the currency is stronger. Lu hopes the President will answer questions about the economy and people's daily lives. She also mentioned issues like exchange rates, exports, taxes, energy, and natural gas supply. She wants the President to share plans to solve these problems and make people feel better.

**Nikkei: Taiwan's Second-Biggest Chipmaker UMC Aims for Advanced 6nm Process**

Nikkei Asia has learned that UMC, Taiwan's second-largest company that makes computer chips, is thinking about making more advanced chips. Currently, TSMC, Samsung, and Intel are the main companies doing this.

Four sources said that UMC is looking for new ways to grow, possibly by making 6-nanometer (nm) chips. These 6nm chips can be used for Wi-Fi, radio frequency (RF), and Bluetooth, as well as for AI accelerators and main processors in TVs and cars.

Sources also mentioned that UMC is looking into working more with Intel, a US chipmaker, on 12nm chip production. They plan to start this work in Arizona, USA, by 2027, including 6nm technology. UMC's finance chief, Liu Chien-tung, told Nikkei Asia that UMC is always looking into more advanced technology. However, he said that working with partners would be important to reduce costs.

**TSMC Shares Fall by NT$20 at Close, Market Value Below NT$28 Trillion**

TSMC's stock price dropped sharply today in the last few minutes of trading. More than 10,000 shares were traded, pushing the price from NT$1075 to NT$1060. The stock closed down NT$20, and the company's total market value fell below NT$28 trillion. Analyst Wang Chao-li said that foreign investors have a large number of "sell" positions in futures, over 50,000. Besides TSMC, other big companies like MediaTek and Hon Hai also saw their stock prices drop at the end of the day, showing a clear intention to lower the overall stock index.

TSMC's American shares went up by over 2% on June 27, reaching a new high. However, TSMC's stock in Taiwan fell today. It opened at NT$1075, down NT$5. In the last minute of trading, 10,863 shares were traded for about NT$11.5 billion, pushing the price down by NT$15 to NT$1060.

This drop in TSMC's stock price affected the overall market index by about 120 points. TSMC closed down NT$20, and its market value went down to NT$27.48 trillion, impacting the market index by about 161 points. Wang Chao-li explained that Hon Hai, MediaTek, and Delta Electronics also saw large numbers of shares traded at the end of the day, causing their prices to fall. This suggests that foreign investors are trying to lower the market index.
