            <h1>KMT Criticizes Withdrawal of Disaster Reconstruction Report; Kuo Kuo-wen Says Executive Yuan Will Propose Special Law</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in southern Taiwan. Legislator Kuo Kuo-wen and others from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suggested inviting the Premier to the Legislative Yuan to give a special report on disaster recovery. But today, Mr. Kuo decided to take back his suggestion. The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) criticized this. They said it might be because the recovery work is too slow, or because the US tariffs on Taiwan are already decided, and the government doesn't want to face it.</p>
            <p>DPP Legislator Kuo Kuo-wen said he withdrew the suggestion because the Executive Yuan will propose a special law this week. He also criticized the TPP for not doing their research and acting like they found a big secret, calling it "shameful."</p>
            <p>DPP Legislators Kuo Kuo-wen and Lin Chun-hsien suggested that because Typhoon Danas caused severe damage in the south, the Legislative Yuan should invite the Premier and other related ministers to the Legislative Yuan. They should give a special report on disaster recovery and answer questions. The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met today to set the agenda for the meeting on the 9th. The TPP wanted to put Mr. Kuo's suggestion as the third item. But the staff announced that Mr. Kuo had already withdrawn his suggestion. This surprised the KMT and TPP legislators present.</p>
            <p>After the Procedure Committee meeting, Chen Chih-han, the head of the TPP group, wrote on Facebook. She said that Mr. Kuo Kuo-wen, Mr. Lin Chun-hsien, and 19 other legislators made a suggestion yesterday. They said that due to the heavy damage from the typhoon and rain in Tainan and Chiayi, they wanted the Premier to come to the Legislative Yuan to give a special report on disaster recovery. The TPP agreed with this, so they decided in their morning meeting today to make it one of the first three items.</p>
            <p>Chen Chih-han pointed out that when the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met today to discuss the agenda, the staff announced that Mr. Kuo Kuo-wen and Mr. Lin Chun-hsien had withdrawn their suggestion. She thought there might be three reasons. First, the recovery after Typhoon Danas is slow, and the cooperation between central and local governments is not good. She thought Premier Cho Jung-tai's report would look bad, so the Executive Yuan asked the DPP legislators to withdraw it. Second, the 20% US tariffs on Taiwan are not temporary but "already decided." The government does not want to face this, so they want Premier Cho Jung-tai to avoid the discussion. Third, she thought all of these reasons could be true.</p>
            <p>In response, Mr. Kuo Kuo-wen wrote on Threads. He said that the TPP, who claims to care most about the "Special Law for Disaster Reconstruction," did not know that the Executive Yuan would propose it this week. Then, when the special budget is proposed, Premier Cho Jung-tai will have to come and answer questions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo Kuo-wen said that the TPP was trying to confuse people and even questioned why he suggested something and then withdrew it. But the reason is simple: the Executive Yuan will propose a special law this week. After the special law passes, when the Executive Yuan proposes a special budget, Premier Cho Jung-tai will have to answer questions in the Legislative Yuan. He does not need to answer questions on the same topic twice, so he withdrew his suggestion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kuo criticized Chen Chih-han, saying that this is how the Legislative Yuan normally works. He said Chen Chih-han did not do her research and thought she found a big secret, and "honestly, it's very embarrassing."</p>

            <h1>NTUT Student Racing Team Wins FST Taiwan Cup, Completing Endurance Race Fastest</h1>
            <p>The National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) student Formula Racing Team took part in the 5th FST Taiwan Cup Student Formula League. Even with heavy wind and rain, their 8th generation electric race car set the fastest lap time of 1 minute and 12 seconds. They were also the first team to finish the 30-lap endurance race, winning first place for the year.</p>
            <p>National Taipei University of Technology announced today that their student Formula Racing Team was formed in 2014. In 2019, they created their first electric race car and built Taiwan's first student Formula race car with a single-piece cockpit. Last year, their 8th generation electric race car won the Best Vehicle Inspection Award at the Australian Student Formula. They also got 6th place in energy efficiency, 8th in figure-eight slalom, and 10th in lap timing. This made them the first Taiwanese team to finish a race in Australia, and their team ranked among the top 100 in the world.</p>
            <p>The NTUT racing team said that the idea behind the 8th generation car was to finish the race steadily. The car body uses RTM carbon fiber technology and has improved aerodynamic parts. For power, they made many improvements and used data recorders to check the car's performance. This helped them make the car settings and plans better. For the chassis, they used a "Heave-Roll" suspension design, which lets them adjust the car's up-and-down and side-to-side movements separately.</p>
            <p>The NTUT student Formula Racing Team recently joined the 5th FST Taiwan Cup Student Formula League. Before the race, the team members practiced the car inspection process many times. This made sure they knew the rules very well. On the race day, they were the fastest to pass the rain and brake tests and the first team to start the dynamic race.</p>
            <p>On the last day of the race, the rain got heavier for a while, and the track became slippery. But the NTUT student Formula Racing Team still finished the endurance race steadily. They became the first team to complete the 30-lap endurance race and won their first FST Taiwan Cup championship in the team's history.</p>
            <p>Chiang Hsin-han, one of the advising teachers for the NTUT racing team, said that the team's great results were not by chance. To find the key to winning with electric race cars, the team members put a lot of effort into new designs and manufacturing. They also gave up sleep and holidays to test and adjust the car many times, making its performance better. They were able to overcome all challenges, whether it was making cars very light and efficient for eco-friendly car competitions, or dealing with typhoons and track changes during the FST race.</p>
