The United States is increasing its control over chip technology in China by planning to cancel existing permissions. These permissions currently allow foreign chipmakers like Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC to use American technology in their factories in China. These special permissions were given after the US first put strict export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022, offering some flexibility to important allies. China is still the world's biggest market for semiconductors, and having production in China is crucial for South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies financially. The decision to end these technology permissions for allied companies in China is a very important moment for US tech policy.
