            <h1>Taichung Soldier Charged for Working as Scam Group's Money Collector</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Zhao Liyan, Taichung, August 3rd) A 22-year-old man named Wu, who was a soldier, wanted to earn more money. He was a soldier with a good monthly salary of NT$50,000. But he joined a scam group and became a person who collects money for them. After he was caught, he was put in jail. Later, he was charged with serious fraud and other crimes. Mr. Wu might even be forced to leave the army.</p>
            <p>Today, the Daya Police Station in Taichung shared some news. They had a case about a fake investment scam. The victim tried to get his money back many times but could not. He then realized he was cheated and called the police. The police said that a 40-year-old man named Zhang joined an investment group on LINE through Facebook. The group's name was "Wealth Plan." A customer service person told him he would "always make money" if he bought gold to earn profit. Mr. Zhang saw a fake website that promised high returns. So, he put in a total of 1.8 million NT dollars by sending money or giving it to someone in person. When Mr. Zhang wanted to get his profit of 28.78 million NT dollars, the scam group asked him for a "10% charity donation." That's when he knew he was tricked.</p>
            <p>The police and Mr. Zhang worked together and caught Mr. Wu, the money collector. The police found out that Mr. Wu was an active soldier. He had a steady monthly salary of NT$50,000 and a good future in the army. But he wanted to make extra money. So, he looked for "unusual jobs" online. Then, he followed the scam group's orders to sign fake contracts and collect money from different victims.</p>
            <p>On the day Mr. Wu was caught, the Taichung District Court ordered him to be held. The Taichung District Prosecutor's Office charged him with breaking laws about organized crime, serious fraud, and money laundering. They also asked for a 50% longer sentence based on laws about preventing fraud. The court is now looking at his case. Mr. Wu might be removed from the army. This means he will lose more than he gained.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan Sends New Rule for Tearing Down Illegal Buildings for Review, Hopes for Fair Costs</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Wu Ruiqi, Taoyuan, August 3rd) The Taoyuan City Government has approved a new proposed rule called the "Taoyuan City Regulations for Charging Fees for Forced Demolition of Illegal Buildings." This proposal will now go to the City Council for review. If the council agrees, the city government can ask the owners of illegal buildings, or other people responsible, to pay for the cost of tearing down these buildings. This will help create a fairer way to manage illegal buildings.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Government's Building Management Office released a statement this morning. They said that the "Building Act" already states that "the owner of a building must pay for the cost when a building is forced to be torn down." The city government tried to propose a similar fee rule in 2019, but it was not approved because there were still some concerns about its details. This time, they have changed and improved the rules. They used their experience from real cases, looked at new central government laws, and also checked how Taipei City and New Taipei City handle these things.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhuang Jingquan, the head of the Building Management Office, said that the city government currently pays for tearing down illegal buildings. This costs public money and does not stop people from building illegally. This new proposed rule clearly states how much to charge, how to do it, and how to protect people's rights. This makes the demolition process clearer and legal. In the future, the cost will be calculated based on the building materials used for different types of demolitions. It will cost between 200 NT dollars and 1700 NT dollars per square meter. They hope this will stop people who try to break the rules.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhuang Jingquan said that if this rule is passed, the Taoyuan City Government will give priority to tearing down "large illegal buildings that are still being built" and "illegal buildings that are dangerous to public safety." They will then collect the demolition fees according to the new rule. This will help the city government make sure that land use follows the rules for land control and that public safety is always the most important thing.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's U12 Baseball Coach Suspended One Game Because Pitcher Did Not Follow Rest Rules</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Tainan, August 3rd) In the U12 Baseball World Cup yesterday, Taiwan won against South Korea in the 9th extra inning. However, the last pitcher, Huang Yu-chien, did not follow the rule about resting between games. Because of this, Taiwan's head coach, Chang Tzu-chien, was suspended for one game. So, he could not lead the team in today's third-place game against South Korea.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Taiwan team played against South Korea in their last game of the Super Round at the U12 Baseball World Cup. Both teams played a hard game until the 9th inning, which was a tie-breaking inning. Taiwan's team scored many runs and won the game 11 to 5. Today, they are playing South Korea again for third place.</p>
            <p>The pitcher for the Taiwan team, Huang Yu-chien, who played in the 9th inning yesterday, had pitched 53 balls on July 31st. The rules say that if a pitcher throws between 46 and 60 balls, they must rest for two days before playing again. But Huang Yu-chien played earlier than he should have yesterday, which was against the rules. So, the Taiwan team was fined, and head coach Chang Tzu-chien was suspended for one game.</p>
