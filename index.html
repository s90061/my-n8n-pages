Billionaire Elon Musk has started a new political party called the "America Party." This happened after he had problems with US President Donald Trump. However, Trump said today he is not worried about Musk's new party. He believes it might even help him. Trump said, "A third party has always helped me."

Musk started his new party because he strongly disagreed with a big tax and spending law that Trump signed. Musk's new party wants to challenge the usual two-party system in the US.

Trump had previously called Musk's plan "ridiculous." But some experts say Musk could be a problem for the Republican Party, which has only a small lead in Congress. Musk has a lot of money and is liked by many young men. He plans for his party to join next year's elections, trying to win some seats in Congress.

**Ukraine to Talk More with US About Air Defense After Trump's Weapon Promise**

After US President Donald Trump said he would send more weapons to Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced today that Ukraine will "strengthen" its talks with the US about air defense.

Zelenskyy said he told his defense minister and army chief to improve all contact with the US. He added that they now have important political decisions and plans that need to be done quickly to protect Ukrainian people and areas. He stressed that this is mainly about air defense.

Trump said yesterday that the US would send more weapons, mainly defensive ones, to help Ukraine against Russia. Zelenskyy said the current focus for weapons is "air defense and other supplies from the US." He expects good results from these talks soon.

**Sabalenka Wins Tough Match at Wimbledon, Reaches Semi-finals**

World number one Aryna Sabalenka almost lost her match at Wimbledon today. But she fought hard and won against Germany's Laura Siegemund with scores of 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. This win puts her into the semi-finals.

Sabalenka was very close to losing in the last part of the match, only two games away from being out. But she made a big comeback and won after playing for almost three hours.

This is the third time the 27-year-old top player has reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon. She won the US Open last year and hopes to reach her fourth Grand Slam final in a row. Sabalenka will now play against either Amanda Anisimova from the US or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova from Russia for a spot in the final.
