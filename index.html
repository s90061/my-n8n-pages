            <h1>Hong Kong Man Sentenced to 8 Years for Bringing 20 Bags of Marijuana into Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A man from Hong Kong named Mr. Wu was caught bringing 20 packages of marijuana into Taiwan from Thailand. He did this to get 100,000 Hong Kong dollars to pay off his debts. The marijuana was worth about 14.35 million New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu told the police about the people who gave him the drugs, hoping for a lighter sentence. But the Kaohsiung District Court said he carried a lot of drugs. So, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for drug trafficking. He can appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>During the trial, Mr. Wu admitted his crime. He also told the court the names of the people above him, "A-Wei" and "A-King," and gave information to help the police find them. He asked for a 3-year sentence. However, the judge said that because Mr. Wu admitted his crime during the investigation and trial, his sentence could be less according to a certain law. This made the lowest possible sentence much lower.</p>
            <p>The judge thought about the large amount and value of the drugs Mr. Wu carried. This crime has a big impact on public safety, so he should not be let off easily. Based on this, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison for trafficking Class 2 drugs. He can appeal.</p>
            <p>The court decision said that in March this year, Mr. Wu from Hong Kong had many debts. Two men named "A-Wei" and "A-King" asked him to help bring drugs into Taiwan. If he succeeded, he would get 100,000 Hong Kong dollars (about 393,000 New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu agreed. He received 10,000 Hong Kong dollars for plane tickets and accommodation. On March 24, he flew from Hong Kong to Thailand and stayed in a hotel in Bangkok. When he arrived, "A-King" told him to pick up a suitcase in the hotel lobby. The suitcase had 20 packages of marijuana inside (weighing about 9957 grams). On March 26, Mr. Wu flew to Taiwan at noon.</p>
            <p>But when Mr. Wu arrived at Kaohsiung International Airport, officers checked his luggage and found something strange. They worked with investigators to search. They found marijuana worth about 14.35 million New Taiwan dollars hidden in the suitcase.</p>

            <h1>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein Ask Congress to Make All Related Files Public</h1>
            <p>Victims of Jeffrey Epstein, who was found guilty of sex crimes, asked the US Congress to pass a law today. This law would make all government files about him public, as long as they are not secret. These files are currently held by the Trump government.</p>
            <p>Anouska De Georgiou, a former model and actress, said, "This is to stop the secret way of doing things that happens when power is used badly." She was one of about 10 women who said they were Epstein's victims. They held a press conference outside the US Capitol building.</p>
            <p>Marina Lacerda, who moved from Brazil, said, "I am here today only because I feel that important people in this country are finally ready to listen to us." She remembered meeting Epstein when she was 14. A friend told her she could earn hundreds of dollars by giving an older man a massage.</p>
            <p>These women support a bill in the House of Representatives. It is called the "Epstein Files Transparency Bill." This bill asks for files to be made public, including documents from the FBI and the US Attorney's office.</p>
            <p>De Georgiou spoke at a press conference with two members of Congress: Thomas Massie (Republican from Kentucky) and Ro Khanna (Democrat from California). She said, "Survivors need protection, help, and legal support. If this Congress truly cares about fairness, please show it by giving victims the legal help they need." These two members of Congress are working to get the bill voted on.</p>
            <p>Republican leaders in the House tried to stop a difficult discussion among their members about this. Trump said the bill would not show anything important and was just a political trick.</p>
            <p>Trump said in the White House today, "Thousands of pages of documents are already public. This is a complete trick by the Democrats."</p>
            <p>The Department of Justice did not want to make Epstein's files public. This caused problems for Trump all summer. Some of his main supporters also wanted the files to be public.</p>
            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson offered a different idea. He suggested a vote that would show support for the Epstein investigation. This investigation is already being done by a House committee.</p>
            <p>Massie criticized this. He called it "the oldest trick in Washington... When you want to stop an issue, you offer a small alternative bill that does nothing. Then you try to trick the American people... but it won't work this time."</p>
            <p>Late last night, a group in the House, controlled by Republicans, made more than 33,000 pages of files about Epstein public. Epstein killed himself in prison in 2019 after being found guilty of sex crimes.</p>
            <p>However, Massie and Khanna want more information.</p>
            <p>They are trying to force a vote on the bill in the House. They are using a difficult process called a "discharge petition," which usually does not work.</p>
            <p>At least 218 members of the House need to sign this petition to force a vote. If all 212 Democratic members support it, Massie still needs at least 5 Republican members. As of today, he has 3 Republican supporters: Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, and Marjorie Taylor Greene.</p>
            <p>If Massie and Khanna's plan gets at least 218 signatures, it will test Speaker Johnson's leadership. It will also test Trump's power in his party. It will show if enough Republicans will go against their party and vote for the bill.</p>

            <h1>China Uses Universities and Private Companies to Put AI into Military Development</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that China has been working with hundreds of private companies and non-military universities. These are civilian groups. They are trying to put Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their fighting methods and weapons. China is doing this in a more organized way than the US. This might give China an advantage in using AI for its military.</p>
            <p>On September 4, the Chinese version of the Wall Street Journal reported this. A group called the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) at Georgetown University looked at almost 3,000 contracts related to AI from the Chinese military in 2023 and 2024. They found that over 300 companies won these contracts many times.</p>
            <p>Among these companies, more than 85% were private companies, non-military universities, and other groups. These are not usually seen as part of China's defense industry. They received most of the contracts. Most of these companies are not on any US list that stops them from trading.</p>
            <p>For example, Shanghai Jiao Tong University published some research last year. It showed how AI could be used to put weapon systems into automated "killing nets." These "killing nets" can change quickly during sea battles. Six days later, the Chinese military said the university won a defense contract to make this idea real.</p>
            <p>This was the 7th public defense contract Shanghai Jiao Tong University signed since early 2023 to create or fix AI-related systems. Before the end of 2024, the university won 7 more contracts. Besides the "killing net" project for the sea, the university was also asked to help the military use AI models to track fast-moving targets. They also help to quickly design underwater drones and make drone swarms more sensitive to changes in radio signals.</p>
            <p>The report says that China has been using the idea of "military-civilian fusion" in recent years. This means using the knowledge and new technology from universities and private companies to put AI into its fighting methods and weapons. Compared to the US, the Chinese military can do this in a more organized way. Experts who study security say this gives China a possible advantage in using AI for its defense.</p>
            <p>Cole McFaul, a senior research analyst at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown University, said that the wide range of these technologies shows something important. It shows that the US has limited power to effectively stop or slow down China's military from becoming more modern.</p>
            <p>During the recent military parade on September 3rd of the Chinese Communist Party, China showed unmanned fighting units. These included air attack drones, unmanned ships, and robot dogs. Military researchers believe that these types of equipment will play a big part in future fights that are managed by AI.</p>
