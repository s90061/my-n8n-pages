**Warning: Cheap Phone Cases from China May Contain Too Much Lead**

After a lead poisoning event in a kindergarten in China, media are warning people about cheap phone cases sold online. Some of these cases have unsafe levels of lead. These inexpensive phone cases, costing about 9.9 Chinese Yuan (around 40 NT dollars) with shipping, often smell strongly of plastic. This smell can mean they have harmful chemicals. If people use these cases for a long time, it could cause slow poisoning.

A study in Zhejiang province checked 20 phone cases and found that some cheap ones had 30 times more lead than allowed. High lead levels can hurt body cells, damage bones, and cause kidney problems. Experts suggest buying phone cases made of liquid silicone or TPU. These materials usually don't smell bad and are flexible. Also, avoid buying cases that are very colorful or too cheap. Before using a new phone case, it's a good idea to wash it with water and leave it in a well-aired place for a week.

**Jiantai High School Pays for Exam Fees After Registration Mistake**

Jiantai High School in Miaoli County made a mistake when registering students for their subject exams. On July 13, the school held a meeting with parents and promised to pay for all exam and university application fees for the 23 students affected. For students who want to retake the exams next year, the school will pay for their registration fees then too. They will also provide special help with studies and career advice.

The school announced that they are already helping students with their university applications based on their individual situations. Most students will continue with their original plans for choosing universities. The school will fully cover the exam and application fees for all 23 students. For those who choose to retake exams in a year, the school will assign a special person to guide their studies and offer career advice. If students want to go to a cram school, the school will help them find one and pay for next year's exam fees. The school plans three events to help students: a career talk on July 15, an application guidance session on July 29, and one-on-one help with applications on July 30. The school also said it will review its processes to prevent similar mistakes in the future.
