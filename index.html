            <p>Hundreds of generals from all over the world met in Virginia, USA, today. President Trump told them that America is fighting a "war from inside."</p>
            <p>News from AFP and The Hill said that Trump spoke to the US military leaders at a meeting in Quantico, Virginia. He said, "Together, we wake up our fighting spirit. This spirit led us to victory and built this country."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "In the coming years, we will work together to make our military stronger, tougher, faster, braver, and more ready to fight than ever before."</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that using the National Guard in some US cities to control situations was important work for some of the people there. He called this an "internal war."</p>
            <p>Trump also told the generals that if Hamas, a Palestinian group, does not accept the peace deal for Gaza, they will face serious problems.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Secretary Calls Generals to End "Woke Culture" in the Military</h1>
            <p>Today, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke at a special meeting of US military generals near Washington D.C. He strongly criticized past rules in the military that promoted diversity and inclusion. He said these rules caused "decades of decline."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hegseth called together top US generals from all over the world to meet in Quantico, Virginia, this week. The reason for the meeting was not clear at first.</p>
            <p>These senior military leaders wore their uniforms and sat in the auditorium of the Marine Corps University. They listened to Hegseth speak from the stage.</p>
            <p>He began by saying, "Foolish and careless political leaders led us astray. We lost our way and became the 'Woke Department.' But this will not happen anymore."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump was also expected to speak to these generals later today. He had said before that he would use this chance to tell them, "We love them."</p>
            <p>Behind the stage where the senior military officers sat, there was a large American flag. There was also a podium, and a sign in front of it read, "Strength, Service, America."</p>
            <p>In his speech, Hegseth also criticized the idea of military members being overweight. He said, "It is completely unacceptable to see fat generals in the Pentagon hallways."</p>
            <p>Hegseth stated that in the future, all US military fitness tests will follow men's standards. He also said that looking professional is very important, "The time for unprofessional looks is over. You will not see people with big beards anymore."</p>
