            <h1>Trump says US Government Will Own 10% of Intel</h1>
            <p>President Trump announced today that the US government will own 10% of the chip company Intel. This agreement is a new and unusual way for the US government to be involved in a company's business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Intel did not want to comment on this news. During the day, Intel's stock price went up by more than 6%.</p>
            <p>Just a few weeks ago, Trump asked Intel's new CEO, Chen Liwu, to resign. Trump said this was because Chen Liwu had a big "conflict of interest" with Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Earlier, SoftBank Group put 2 billion US dollars into Intel. This was a big sign of trust for Intel, which has been having problems and is changing.</p>
            <p>Experts say that the government's support for Intel might give it more time to improve its chip-making business, which is losing money. However, Intel still has many problems. For example, its product plans are not strong, and its new factories are not getting enough interest from customers.</p>
            <p>Trump met with Chen Liwu on August 11th. Trump is using new ways to deal with national security. He has made the US government work with companies in the semiconductor and rare earth industries, giving billions of dollars. For example, the government has a "pay-to-play" agreement with Nvidia and a deal with MP Materials, a rare earth producer, to make sure it gets important minerals.</p>
            <p>Chen Liwu became Intel's CEO in March this year. He wanted to help the big chip company get better. In 2024, Intel lost 18.8 billion US dollars. This was the first time Intel lost money like this since 1986.</p>

            <h1>Fed Chairman Gives Hope for Lower Interest Rates Despite Trump's Pressure</h1>
            <p>Today, Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank (the Fed), gave a very important speech. In his speech, he said that there might be a chance to lower interest rates. He said this even though US President Trump is putting more and more pressure on him to do so. The market now thinks there is a 91% chance that interest rates will be cut in September.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that last year, Powell suggested that it was time to lower interest rates at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium. But after his speech this year, things seem less clear.</p>
            <p>Trump really wants the Fed to cut interest rates. However, the economic information is mixed. This has made Powell be more careful about interest rates.</p>
            <p>Today, Powell warned that there are growing risks of rising prices and a weak job market. These two problems together make the situation difficult.</p>
            <p>Powell said in his speech, "The risk of the job market getting weaker is going up." He added that these problems could quickly lead to people losing their jobs.</p>
            <p>Powell pointed out, "The job market looks balanced, but it's a strange balance. It's because both the demand for workers and the number of available workers are slowing down a lot."</p>
            <p>Powell also said, "The effect of tariffs on consumer prices can now be clearly seen." He expects this effect to become even clearer in the next few months.</p>
            <p>He believes it is very unclear when and how much tariffs will affect things.</p>
            <p>But he promised, "We will not let a one-time rise in prices turn into a long-lasting problem with inflation."</p>
            <p>This was the last time Powell will give a speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium as the Fed Chairman. His term will finish in May 2026.</p>
            <p>After Powell's speech, the CME FedWatch tool showed that the market believes there is a 91% chance the Fed will cut interest rates in September. This is a big increase from before.</p>

            <h1>European Stocks Go Up Because US Interest Rate Cut is Expected</h1>
            <p>Today, European stock markets finished higher. This happened because people expect that the US will soon lower its interest rates. Also, Asian stock markets, led by China, showed strong growth, which helped too. European markets became stronger after midday.</p>
