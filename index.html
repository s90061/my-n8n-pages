Even though prices are not rising as quickly as before, many families still find it hard to pay for daily needs. Things like food, electricity, and rent are still much more expensive than they used to be a few years ago. This means that while inflation, which is the rate at which prices go up, has slowed down, the actual cost of living remains high. People are spending more money on basic items, leaving less for other things. Experts say it will take time for wages to catch up with these higher prices, meaning the struggle for many households will continue for a while.

**AI Tools Are Changing How We Work**

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming very common in workplaces around the world. New information shows that many companies are using AI to help their employees with different tasks. For example, AI can help write emails, analyze large amounts of data, or even manage project schedules. This helps people finish their work faster and more effectively. While some people worry about AI taking jobs, many experts believe it will mostly change how jobs are done, making workers more productive. Companies are now looking for ways to train their staff to use these new technologies well.

**Smart Travel: Avoiding Crowds in Popular European Cities**

Popular European cities like Paris, Venice, and London are attracting huge numbers of tourists, especially during peak seasons. While these cities are beautiful, the large crowds can sometimes make the travel experience less enjoyable. Many travelers are now looking for ways to see these famous places without getting caught in tourist traps. One tip is to visit during the off-season, when there are fewer people. Another idea is to explore neighborhoods that are not as well-known but still offer great local experiences. Instead of just seeing the main sights, trying local restaurants and walking around less famous areas can provide a more authentic and pleasant trip.
