            <h1>Taiwanese Students Win 1 Gold, 3 Silver at 36th International Biology Olympiad</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Lin Xingjian, Manila, July 27) The 36th International Biology Olympiad was held in the Philippines. Four students from Taiwan took part. Among nearly 300 top students from all over the world, they won 1 gold medal and 3 silver medals. After the award ceremony, the whole team went on stage with the Republic of China flag for a photo.</p>
            <p>The International Biology Olympiad took place at Ateneo de Manila University in Manila from July 20th to 27th. Nearly 80 countries participated, with over 300 students competing.</p>
            <p>The organizers held the award ceremony on the evening of July 26th. Chen Chun-ying, a student from Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School, won a gold medal. Lin Po-chen from The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University, Hung Tzu-chin from Taipei First Girls High School, and Kuo Che-yu, also from Jianguo High School, each won a silver medal.</p>
            <p>Kuo Che-yu could not receive his award in person because he had flown to Thailand for another competition.</p>
            <p>Lee Shih-ping, head of the education division at Taiwan's representative office in the Philippines, also attended to congratulate the Taiwanese athletes. He also shared a congratulatory message from Minister of Education Cheng Ying-yao.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-ying explained that the competition had two parts: theory and practical tasks. The questions were very difficult. He did well by using his experience from past exams and following his teachers' advice on how to answer questions.</p>
            <p>Lin Po-chen said that his trip to the Philippines showed him many things he had imagined about Southeast Asia. He especially liked the local culture and customs of the Philippines. He felt that the people were very friendly, similar to people in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Hung Tzu-chin said she was very happy to have the chance to compete. She learned a lot during the journey and also found out what she needs to improve. She will continue to work hard.</p>
            <p>At the award ceremony, Ateneo de Manila University also invited the famous Bayanihan Dance Company from the Philippines. They performed traditional Filipino dances, like the candlelight dance and the bamboo pole dance.</p>
            <p>Besides the competition, the organizers also took the students to the countryside. There, they could see and learn about biodiversity in real life.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Education's rules for students who do well in international math and science competitions and science fairs, students who win gold, silver, or bronze medals can enter any university department without taking an exam, or they can be recommended to any university department. They also receive scholarships of NT$200,000, NT$100,000, and NT$50,000, respectively. (Editor: Chang Chih-hsuan) 1140727</p>

            <h1>All 25 Recall Cases on July 26 Fail; Yoshiyuki Ogasawara: KMT Wins Completely</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Dai Yaxin, Tokyo, July 27) Yesterday, votes were cast for the first group of 24 KMT (Kuomintang) lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an in recall elections. All of these recall attempts failed. Yoshiyuki Ogasawara, an honored professor at Taiwan's National Tsing Hua University and a Japanese scholar, said that the results show a complete victory for the KMT. He added that the Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) policy of resisting China and protecting Taiwan was rejected. In the future, China's influence in Taiwan might grow stronger.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara told the "Sankei Shimbun" newspaper that private groups started these recall efforts, and the ruling DPP supported them. In early June, it seemed that the groups pushing for recalls were winning. The KMT had planned to use "recalls against recalls" but did not get enough signatures. Also, the party's leaders did not provide strong guidance. This made the situation very difficult for the KMT. However, KMT lawmakers began to act, holding small meetings against the recalls and getting back on track.</p>
            <p>He said that President Lai Ching-te started a tour around Taiwan in late June, talking about "national unity." But one of his statements was understood by some people as "opposition parties are like dirt and should be filtered out." This made opposition supporters angry and gave them a chance to fight back.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara pointed out that the voting results were a turning point in the whole situation. As the final stage began, the KMT slowly fought back, and the groups supporting the recalls started to lose their power.</p>
            <p>He said that the groups wanting recalls hoped to remove at least 6 people, or ideally 10. If not, they would have a very hard time in the follow-up elections. Now, zero people were recalled. So, there will be no new elections. This means the recall groups completely lost. Although there will be another recall vote for 7 KMT lawmakers on August 23rd, it was hard to get enough signatures for these recalls at the start, so they are not likely to succeed.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara explained that public opinion in Taiwan currently shows a "M-shaped" split. This means support for and against President Lai, and for the ruling party and opposition parties, are almost equal. The result of this recall vote depended on which group of "M-shaped" voters was encouraged to vote.</p>
            <p>He noted that at the events, the recall supporters seemed more energetic, and it looked like more of them would vote. On the other hand, many voters were unsure if it was right to try and remove lawmakers who were just elected last January. It was hard to know until the end if these unsure voters would go to the polls. The KMT successfully reached these people and made them vote against the recalls.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara stated that the KMT believes if the DPP gets more than half of the seats in the Legislative Yuan again, they will lose the ability to oversee the government, making the DPP more controlling. Supporters of the KMT and the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) even openly called the Lai Ching-te government "dictatorial." From outside Taiwan, some question if it is right to use the word "dictatorship" so easily in a democratic country like Taiwan. However, many opposition supporters think the DPP government has become too controlling and even uses the legal system to stop people who disagree, moving towards a dictatorship.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara pointed out that this recall effort covered 24 voting areas, which was almost like a "small election for lawmakers." Those who supported the recalls made two main arguments. First, they believed the actions of the opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan were harming democracy. Second, they felt that if these "pro-China" lawmakers were not recalled now, Taiwan would be in trouble. They had a strong sense of danger. However, even with such clear arguments, none of the recalls passed. This means Taiwanese voters did not agree with their ideas. This will have a big impact and is a very difficult situation for Lai Ching-te's government.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara said that because no one was recalled, we must admit that most voters did not agree with the idea that "KMT lawmakers are pro-China." Some people think that the failure of the recalls just means "everything goes back to how it was." But Ogasawara does not think so.</p>
            <p>He noted that looking back at Taiwan's politics, last year's presidential and legislative elections showed that the DPP's strong position, which lasted for 10 years since the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement, has ended. With the rise of Ko Wen-je, who started the Taiwan People's Party, the DPP's leading position was shaken. This latest result further confirms the end of the DPP's strong era. It is expected that this change will greatly affect next year's local elections and the 2028 presidential election.</p>
            <p>He stressed that even though the DPP is no longer in a strong position, the "Taiwanese identity" in Taiwanese society has not changed. According to the latest survey by National Chengchi University, Taiwanese people's self-identity and their wish to keep things as they are have not changed. What has truly changed is that the political parties are now more equally balanced.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara pointed out that one reason for the DPP losing its strong position is that Taiwanese society now agrees that "one political party ruling for a long time has risks." Currently, young people are the most critical of the DPP. They do not identify with China and clearly do not want to unite with China. However, they question the DPP's way of using the "resist China and protect Taiwan" message to control politics and gain power.</p>
            <p>He said that young people who support Ko Wen-je are unhappy that the DPP has not solved problems like low salaries, unstable jobs, and high housing prices. They generally believe, "Even though we don't want to unite with China, we need to talk with China. We also don't think China will attack Taiwan right away. Instead, the situation is tense because the DPP government is tough on China." Of course, many young people also support the Lai government's decision to "never give in to China." This shows that young people themselves are divided.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara warned that the DPP's "resist China and protect Taiwan" policy was, in a way, rejected in this recall vote. For China, this will be a very good situation. In the future, the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to influence Taiwan might grow stronger. (Editor: Chen Yen-chun) 1140727</p>
