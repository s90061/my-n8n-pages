        const text = `**Australian Journalist Cheng Lei Publishes Memoir About Her Difficult 3 Years in Chinese Prison**

Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist, has written a book about her experience after being held in China for three years. She told Nikkei Asia that she was treated very harshly without reason during her time in prison. She hopes her book will show what the Chinese authorities did wrong.

Cheng Lei used to be a news anchor for CGTN, a Chinese TV channel, where she reported on China's economy. In August 2020, Chinese authorities arrested her, saying she illegally shared state secrets with other countries. She was released in October 2023 and went back to Australia.

Now, Cheng Lei is sharing her story through public talks and her new book, "Cheng Lei: A Memoir of Freedom." The book talks about her difficult time in the Chinese prison system. She was kept in a detention center in Beijing and was called prisoner number 21003. She told Nikkei Asia, "During that time, it felt like my mouth was always covered. There were many things I couldn't ask or say, and I had no pen to write."

For six months after her arrest in August 2020, Cheng Lei was held in a small cell. This was part of a secret system run by China's national security police for people accused of threatening national security. People could be held for up to six months without being charged and couldn't see their families or lawyers.

Cheng Lei said she faced "unnecessary cruel treatment." For example, she had to sit on her hard bed for 13 hours every day. This made her lower back hurt a lot and caused hard skin on her hips. Also, two guards watched her from just 40 centimeters away, even when she was showering. She was also questioned for many hours several times, as officers looked into text messages she had sent.

Cheng Lei believes this treatment was meant to be cruel. She said, "They want to break you, they want you to confess, they want to push you to the edge of madness and suicide to get a confession you can't change."

Cheng Lei admitted that when she felt hopeless, she thought about ending her life. One month after being held, she thought about hitting her head on the bathroom tiles, which was the only way she could think of to end her life in the cell.

To cope with this, Cheng Lei kept thinking about her friends and family, especially her two young children. She said, "I would use my imagination, like looking through my phone, remembering all the happy times in my life."

In February 2021, Cheng Lei was officially arrested for "illegally providing state secrets to foreign countries." Her case was heard in a secret trial in March 2022. After her initial detention ended, she was happy to move to another prison where she shared a bigger cell with three other female prisoners. This finally gave her the human contact she had wanted.

During her 32 months in this prison, she tried to make the sad days more fun. She once made a birthday cake for a fellow prisoner using steamed buns. She also created secret codes by tapping on the wall with a prisoner in the next cell. She taught her fellow prisoners about poems and the meanings of English songs.

Even though Cheng Lei had good reasons to be angry about what happened to her, she chose to focus on the good side of people. She even felt sympathy for some of the prison guards. She said these guards sometimes showed "human kindness," like letting prisoners watch the World Cup soccer games or giving her shampoo when she asked for it.

Cheng Lei said, "These guards are young, and they are not really part of this system. ... I think all humans can feel a lot of sympathy and understanding. The real evil is when a system tries to take away all human feelings from its people."

Cheng Lei believes she was targeted by China because Beijing wanted to get back at the Australian government. In April 2020, Australia asked for an independent investigation into COVID-19, which started in China. Because Cheng Lei grew up in Australia and, as a journalist, had contact with foreign diplomats, Chinese national security officers targeted her.

Cheng Lei's memoir tells about the different people she met while in prison. She hopes this book will not only show the bad things about China's national security system but also the great power of kindness, even in the hardest situations.
