            <h1>Important Vegetable Areas Recovering, Prices Expected to Stabilize Early September</h1>
            <p>Recent typhoons caused vegetable prices to change a lot. The Deputy Premier, Cheng Li-chun, held a meeting today to discuss keeping prices stable. The Ministry of Agriculture said that the weather is now getting better. Important areas in central and southern Taiwan where vegetables are grown are recovering well. They expect that in early September, there will be more vegetables, and prices will become stable.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun held a meeting today. After the meeting, the Executive Yuan announced that since July, typhoons Danna and Yangliu, along with heavy rain, damaged leafy greens and fruit vegetables in central and southern Taiwan. This caused vegetable prices in stores to go up a lot for a short time. At the meeting, Cheng Li-chun asked the Ministry of Agriculture to quickly help farmers recover and start producing again. They should use a "generous, simple, fast" approach for helping with disaster relief. They should also stay in close contact with local farming groups to understand the situation and give help when needed. This is to make sure the market gets enough vegetables and prices become stable again soon.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture said that the weather is becoming stable. Important vegetable-growing areas in central and southern Taiwan are recovering well. From early September, more vegetables are expected to be available, and prices will become stable. During the recovery period, they have helped farmer groups to sell stored vegetables when needed by the market. They have also worked with customs to make it faster to bring in imported vegetables, to make sure there are enough vegetables in the market.</p>
            <p>For stores, the Ministry of Agriculture said they have helped farmer groups work with big supermarkets like PX Mart, Da Quan Lian, and A-Mart. Starting from the 15th, these stores have special areas for cheap cabbage. Also, all PX Mart stores have special areas for affordable vegetables for people to buy.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chun also said that since the rainy season started, the supply of some farm and animal products has gone down, and prices have changed, because of unstable weather. Especially, the amount of pork has gone down because of hot summer weather. Also, the Mid-Autumn Festival is coming, so more pork will be needed. The Ministry of Agriculture should keep watching the prices and supply of pigs and pork in the market. They should ask Taiwan Sugar Corporation to supply more and improve ways to control the supply to make sure there is enough.</p>
            <p>Also, for homes damaged by storms and heavy rain, Cheng Li-chun thanked everyone for their kindness and the companies that helped. This made it easier to fix things after the disaster. She also asked the Public Construction Commission to watch building material prices closely to make sure construction costs are fair and stable.</p>

            <h1>China Discourages Buying Nvidia's H20 Chips, Citing "Insulting" US Comments</h1>
            <p>Beijing is telling its tech companies not to buy Nvidia's H20 AI chips. These chips were made especially for China. The Financial Times reported today that this happened because Chinese officials think what the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said about controlling chip exports was "too insulting."</p>
            <p>The Financial Times said that several Chinese government groups have been trying to stop local tech companies from buying H20.</p>
            <p>Sources said that groups like the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) took action because of Lutnick's comments last month.</p>
            <p>In April, Washington stopped Nvidia from selling H20 chips to China, but then lifted the ban last month. On July 15, the day after the H20 export ban was removed, Lutnick told CNBC, a US financial news channel: "We will not sell them our best products, not even the second best, and not even the third best."</p>
            <p>He also said: "The idea behind this is to sell China enough products so that their developers will rely on American technology."</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the situation said that some high-level Chinese officials found these comments "too insulting." This made leaders try to limit their local tech companies from buying H20.</p>
            <p>These sources also said that because of this, Chinese tech companies have delayed or greatly reduced their orders for H20 chips.</p>
            <p>China's actions show how important high-performance chips are for AI. They are now a main reason for tension between the US and China, the two biggest economies in the world.</p>
            <p>These actions have hurt Nvidia. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's CEO, visited Beijing last month. Sources said that Huang's visit was positive. Nvidia got enough orders from Chinese customers and told TSMC, its production partner, to start making H20 chips again.</p>
            <p>Someone close to China's leaders said: "Lutnick's comments gave the government groups more reason to push tech companies to use Chinese chips."</p>
            <p>The Cyberspace Administration of China gave "unofficial guidance" to big tech companies like ByteDance and Alibaba. This was an informal notice telling them to stop buying H20 chips from Nvidia because of national security worries.</p>
            <p>On July 31, the CAC also called Nvidia executives for a meeting, saying there were "serious security issues."</p>
            <p>The CAC said in a statement that US AI experts showed that Nvidia chips can track location and be turned off remotely. Nvidia strongly said this was not true.</p>
            <p>Sources said that the MIIT, which manages telecommunications and software, also had informal talks with Chinese tech company leaders. They repeated the CAC's position. The NDRC, which works to make technology more independent, gave guidelines telling tech companies to stop buying all Nvidia chips, including H20.</p>
            <p>The CAC's involvement puts more pressure on large Chinese tech companies. Even though these instructions are not official, if they are punished by the government, it will greatly affect their daily business.</p>
            <p>Some US officials and members of Congress want to make chip export limits stronger. However, US President Donald Trump said that besides H20, he might allow a simpler version of Nvidia's Blackwell chip to be exported to China.</p>
            <p>Sources said that some Chinese tech companies paused their H20 orders because they are waiting to see if a Blackwell chip made for China will be allowed.</p>
            <p>The report also said that a person who recently met with leaders in Beijing mentioned that some officials want to completely ban foreign "inference chips." These chips are a large part of what AI needs.</p>
            <p>This plan is probably not possible in the short term because there are not enough Chinese-made chips. Beijing hopes to solve this problem next year when several new advanced production lines start working.</p>

            <h1>Hsiao Huang-chi to Help Lee Ping-hui with New Album and Shared Earnings</h1>
            <p>Singer Hsiao Huang-chi held a press conference today for his new album "Be a Warm and Kind Person." He invited singer Lee Ping-hui as a special guest. Hsiao Huang-chi said, "From now on, I will let him sing at my events." He hopes to talk to companies about sharing his pay with Lee Ping-hui to really help him.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Huang-chi's new album will be available on August 26. For this album, he worked with many musicians from different generations. This includes his old partners, Wu Hsiung and Huang Ting, who he has worked with for over 20 years. He also invited singer Lee Ping-hui, singer Waa Wei, and Lin Yi-shuo, the lead singer of Lilium. Lee Ping-hui came to the press conference today as a guest and played a claw machine game with Hsiao Huang-chi.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Huang-chi said he wants to find ways for Lee Ping-hui to perform again. For example, he can write songs for him or take Lee Ping-hui to perform in different places. Or, he can talk to companies for business performances so that they don't have to pay extra, but instead use some of the budget to invite Lee Ping-hui to perform together. They already know about at least 10 events before the end of the year. He hopes this will give Lee Ping-hui longer-term help with his life.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Huang-chi also said that Lee Ping-hui has difficulty walking after his stroke. Also, he is old now. Hsiao Huang-chi doesn't want to see him earning little money on the street anymore. He hopes to help Lee Ping-hui reduce his stress in life. "He is still singing on the streets of Tamsui. At his age, he really should be enjoying his life," Hsiao Huang-chi said.</p>
