            <h1>Fishing Boat Involved in Smuggling 1.6 Tons of Drugs; Main Suspect Sentenced to 13 Years</h1>
            <p>The "Man Ruey Fu" fishing boat carried over 1.6 tons of drugs in the waters near the Dongsha Islands in March. On October 15, the Hsinchu District Court sentenced Chen Chih-chung, one of the main people involved, to 13 years in prison. The crew members and captain received sentences from 5 years and 2 months to 10 years. Another main suspect, Chen Tsai-sheng, has left the country and is wanted by the police.</p>
            <p>The Zhubei Investigation Team of the Hsinchu County Police Department received a tip. Someone was suspected of using the "Man Ruey Fu" fishing boat, registered at Badouzi Fishing Port in Keelung, to smuggle drugs. Checks showed that the boat had not left port for over six months but applied to go out in March of this year. The police then watched the boat. At the end of March, it was seen in the waters near the Dongsha Islands, meeting with another suspicious boat. A special team quickly went to the open sea and boarded the boat for inspection.</p>
            <p>The special team said that they did not find any fish after boarding. However, they found many sealed bags of what looked like tea leaves. After initial tests, these included 20 bags of methamphetamine and 1514 bags of ketamine. The total weight was over 1.6 tons, with an estimated market value of more than NT$2 billion (about US$62 million).</p>
            <p>According to the Hsinchu District Court's judgment on October 15, Chen Tsai-sheng (also known as "Brother-in-law" or "Stone," and currently wanted after leaving the country) and Chen Chih-chung planned together. They bought the "Man Ruey Fu" fishing boat to transport drugs. They hired Chen Chun-hsiung as the captain and Indonesian nationals Su Heng-li and Da Hsi as crew members. Chou Hung-kan was paid NT$500,000 to be the registered owner of the fishing boat, but not the real owner.</p>
            <p>The judgment stated that on the evening of March 25, the "Man Ruey Fu" sailed to the sea southeast of Dongsha Island. It met with an unknown boat at night with its lights off. Su Heng-li and Da Hsi followed Chen Chun-hsiung's orders and moved the drugs, packed in tea bags, onto their boat. On March 28, the Coast Guard Administration's Fleet Branch found the boat in that area. Later, the people and the boat were brought back to Hsinchu Fishing Port.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu District Court believes that Chen Chih-chung was involved in buying the boat, hiring the crew, and getting the boat ready. He was a very important part of the crime, so he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Captain Chen Chun-hsiung knew why they were going out to sea and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>
            <p>Even though the Indonesian fishermen, Su Heng-li and Da Hsi, said they did not know, the court decided that they likely knew the boat would be used for drug transport. They still helped, so both were sentenced to 5 years and 2 months in prison. They will be sent out of the country after finishing their sentences. Chou Hung-kan, who acted as the fake owner, was sentenced to 5 years and 4 months in prison. The NT$180,000 he received from the crime was taken away. They can appeal this decision.</p>

            <h1>Li Sichuan Again Asks Shin Kong Life Insurance to Find a Third Party to Value Property and Agree on Contract Termination Terms</h1>
            <p>Taipei City Deputy Mayor Li Sichuan spoke again to Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., Ltd. today, October 17. He asked them to work together with the city government to find a third-party group, such as an accounting firm, a valuation firm, or a bar association. This group would value the property and suggest how much money should be paid and what conditions are needed to end their contract. This would help move forward the plan for NVIDIA to set up its headquarters at the T17 and T18 sites in Beitou Shilin Technology Park.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA Taiwan's main office was planned for the T17 and T18 sites in Beitou Shilin Technology Park. However, Shin Kong Life Insurance already has the rights to use this land. The Taipei City Government wants to end this contract by agreement so they can then give NVIDIA special rights to use the land. On October 13, the city government sent a letter to Shin Kong Life Insurance asking to end the contract by agreement.</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun, the General Manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding Co., Ltd., said yesterday that NVIDIA has agreed to pay money to Shin Kong Life Insurance so that Shin Kong can give its land development rights to NVIDIA. Even though their agreement (MOU) ended in September, he said it would not be hard to talk about it again.</p>
            <p>Before a press conference about a "Neihu Science Park Commute Transformation Promotion Plan," Li Sichuan spoke to reporters. He said that since May, the Taipei City Government, Shin Kong Life Insurance, and NVIDIA have discussed many plans. They even talked about a contract between all three parties. But the biggest problem is that NVIDIA cannot pay two different parties just to buy one piece of property.</p>
            <p>He said that Shin Kong Life Insurance knows the real difficulties very well, and NVIDIA has also clearly stated its position. What NVIDIA can accept now is for Shin Kong Life Insurance to end its contract with the city government, dealing only with the city government and not with Shin Kong Life Insurance. However, Shin Kong Life Insurance keeps insisting on its own plan. Li Sichuan said, "I don't know why it is like this."</p>
            <p>Li Sichuan asked Shin Kong Life Insurance to suggest the terms and amount for ending the contract by agreement. He wants them to work with the Taipei City Government to get a third-party group, like an accounting association, a valuation association, or a bar association, to value the property. He said this would give a clear basis for discussions in the Taipei City Council and Shin Kong Life Insurance's board meetings. It would also prevent problems with breaking trust and allow the matter to move forward.</p>
            <p>When asked by the media if the Taipei City Government would give in if Shin Kong Life Insurance still refused to end the contract by agreement, Li Sichuan said that no one is backing down. He said everyone hopes NVIDIA will come to Taiwan, and the people of Taipei especially want NVIDIA to move into Taipei. He added that the city government is now working to find a solution that everyone can agree on.</p>
            <p>Li Sichuan said that NVIDIA has already sent letters to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taipei City Government to look for other options. This shows that NVIDIA does not only want the T17 and T18 sites in Beitou Shilin Technology Park. If the city government does not hear back from Shin Kong Life Insurance by October 24, it will offer NVIDIA other good alternative sites to choose from.</p>
