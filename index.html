            <h1>Young Wood Carving Camp in Sanyi Passes on Skills, Theme Shows Beauty of Change</h1>
            <p>The Miaoli County Government is holding its 18th Asian Youth Wood Carving Art Camp. This year's theme is "Hua Shi," which means the beauty of growth and change in art and life. A special event was held today at the Sanyi Wood Carving Museum to pass on these skills. This helps make sure that Taiwan's wood carving art continues for many generations.</p>
            <p>Sanyi Township in Miaoli County is a very important place for wood carving art. The "Sanyi Wood Carving Museum" is the only public museum in Taiwan that is only about wood carving. Since 2006, the county's Culture and Tourism Bureau has held summer wood carving camps. These camps attract children of wood carvers and students from art schools. In 2018, the camp became bigger and was called the Asian Youth Wood Carving Art Camp.</p>
            <p>Today, the Culture and Tourism Bureau held a press conference and the skill-passing event for the 2025 Asian Youth Wood Carving Art Camp at the Sanyi Wood Carving Museum. Twenty-four young students are taking part, including some from Malaysia and students from different art schools in Taiwan. The camp runs from July 1st to August 8th. It has two groups: "Contemporary Figurative Wood Carving Creation Camp" and "Traditional Wood Carving Skills Inheritance Camp," and it runs in two parts.</p>
            <p>Lin Yen-fu, the head of the Culture and Tourism Bureau, said that this year's camp theme, "Hua Shi," comes from an old saying "Chun Hua Qiu Shi," which means "spring flowers, autumn fruits." This theme shows the beauty of life changing and becoming mature during the creative process. The classes are small, so students can live and learn together closely. This helps them improve their skills, develop new ideas, and understand art and culture better.</p>
            <p>Lin Yen-fu thanked Professor Yang Bei-chen from National Taiwan University of Arts and Lecturer Luo You-rui from National Kaohsiung Normal University. They are the project leaders. He also thanked six excellent professional teachers who put in a lot of effort and resources to give the students strong and rich learning content.</p>
            <p>The Culture and Tourism Bureau pointed out that the camp has been running for 18 years. This year, the Sanyi Wood Carving Association team, which is running the event, includes many second-generation wood carvers from Sanyi and former students of the camp. Through the hard work of the government, schools, and industry, a system is being built to train new wood carving artists. Expert artists share their knowledge and guide students. The camp combines school art studies with wood carving skills from the industry. This helps wood carving art continue and grow with new energy.</p>

            <h1>Hsinchu County's Historic Building, Dongping Wenlitang in Zhubei, Gets New Roof Beam, Hopes to Look Great Again</h1>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Cultural Affairs Bureau said that today, there was a special ceremony for putting the main roof beam back on Dongping Wenlitang in Zhubei. This historic building is being repaired and made ready for new uses. The repair work uses old building methods. The project also includes fixing the whole area around the building. It is expected to be finished by December next year. The hope is that the building will look beautiful again.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Government held the roof beam ceremony today for the repair and new use project. Dongping Wenlitang was built in 1934 and became a historic building in 2007. The repair work has two parts. The first part started on November 8th last year. It includes fixing the roof, the main wooden parts, doors and windows, walls, and floors.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chu Shu-min, the director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, told CNA reporters that the second part of the project will start soon. This part includes fixing the right side wing of the building and the overall outdoor areas. It also includes making the building easy to access for everyone and adding electrical systems inside and outside. This part is expected to start by the end of this year and be finished for the whole area by December next year.</p>
            <p>She said that they hope the building will be used again in the future. It will become a place where people can learn about culture, nature, history, and daily life. They hope it will show its historical beauty again.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang Chuan-hsing, a master carpenter, wrote that during the repair work, they are following old building steps and methods. Most of the work uses tools like chisels and planers to fix things carefully, piece by piece. They hope to protect this historic building.</p>

            <h1>Hualien's KMT Party Says Free Buses for Voters Are Vote Buying, DPP Party Says "Please Report It"</h1>
            <p>The first round of recall votes for lawmakers will happen on July 26th. Today, the KMT (Kuomintang) party in Hualien accused Ms. Chang Mei-hui, a DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) county council member, of offering free bus rides to voters to come back home and vote. Ms. Chang Mei-hui said that if anyone rode on a free bus paid for by her, she would give them a reward of NT$100,000 for reporting it.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Lin Hsing-erh, the deputy head of the KMT's Culture and Communications Committee and a Taipei City council member, along with Hualien County council members Wu Chien-chih and Lin Cheng-fu, and their supporters, went to the Hualien District Prosecutors Office. They carried flags against the recall and reported Ms. Chang Mei-hui.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsing-erh said that giving free bus rides or helping with bus fares is a form of vote buying, even if it is an agreement. She explained that if there is a direct or indirect link to how people vote, it is like trading votes. Even though Ms. Chang Mei-hui said she did not take a side, the DPP is the party that wants the recall. So, paying for buses for young people to come back and change their vote is very clear.</p>
            <p>Wu Chien-chih said that in the past, "homecoming trains" were only for holidays like Chinese New Year, Mid-Autumn Festival, or Dragon Boat Festival. There was no history of using them to get people to vote. Now, the DPP and the recall group are working together. They are using private or unknown money to pay for tour buses for people to come home. They say it is "buying seats," but it is actually a way to get people to vote and buy votes.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chang Mei-hui talked to reporters and said that the Hualien youth group "Huilai Qicheng" has been teaching about civic duties for many years. For every election, they have offered "homecoming trains" to encourage young people living away from home to come back and vote. People had to pay for these rides themselves. She said that the KMT is wrongly twisting these long-standing activities.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chang Mei-hui said that if people truly rode on a "free bus paid for by Chang Mei-hui for returning to vote," they are welcome to report it with their real names. She is willing to give a NT$100,000 reward for reporting vote buying if it is proven. She also added that if anyone finds proof of vote buying by Fu Kun-chi, she will give an extra NT$100,000 reward, in addition to the NT$500,000 reward from the District Prosecutors Office.</p>
