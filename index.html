        const text = `**Magnitude 5.5 Earthquake Hits Pakistan, 10 Kilometers Deep**
<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290016.aspx">https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290016.aspx</a>

A shallow earthquake happened in central Pakistan today. The German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) reported it was a magnitude 5.5 earthquake. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured it as 5.3.

Agence France-Presse said that there are no reports of injuries or damage yet.

The U.S. Geological Survey stated that the earthquake happened around 3:30 AM (6:30 AM Taiwan time). Its center was about 60 kilometers north-northeast of Barkhan, a city in Pakistan's mountainous Balochistan province.

When there are crises in this area, rescue work can be very difficult. In 2015, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan and Afghanistan, and nearly 400 people died. The difficult land there made rescue efforts hard.

Reuters, using data from the German Research Centre for Geosciences, said that this earthquake was shallow, with a depth of only 10 kilometers.

**Mostly Cloudy to Sunny and Hot, Watch Out for Afternoon Thunderstorms**
<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290015.aspx">https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290015.aspx</a>

The Central Weather Administration said today that southern and eastern Taiwan will have occasional short rain or thunderstorms. Other areas will be mostly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, there might be local, short thunderstorms in western Taiwan and other mountainous areas. The mountains in western Taiwan might even get heavy rain.

The Weather Administration warned that there will be more moisture around Taiwan today, so people should be ready for changes in the afternoon weather and bring an umbrella just in case.

The Weather Administration also said that the weather will be hot, with temperatures generally between 31 and 35 degrees Celsius across Taiwan. The greater Taipei area, as well as areas near the mountains in Changhua, Yunlin, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung, might have local temperatures above 36 degrees. The UV index will be strong around noon, so people should protect themselves from the sun and drink plenty of water to avoid heatstroke. The lowest temperatures across Taiwan will be about 25 to 27 degrees.

For the outlying islands, the Weather Administration said that Penghu will be sunny with some clouds, with temperatures between 27 and 32 degrees. Kinmen will be cloudy with sunny periods, with temperatures between 27 and 32 degrees. Matsu will be sunny with some clouds, with temperatures between 26 and 31 degrees.

**In Response to China's Threat, US Think Tank Calls for Indo-Pacific Cyber Shield and Expanded Cooperation with Taiwan**
<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290014.aspx">https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290014.aspx</a>

A report from a Washington think tank says that China has greatly increased its cyberattacks in recent years, and fast-developing artificial intelligence might give attackers an advantage in cyberspace. To deal with these growing threats, the report asks the U.S. to create an "Indo-Pacific Cyber Shield" plan, strengthen joint efforts against bad cyber actions, and work more with Taiwan.

The Center for a New American Security (CNAS) recently released a report called "Cyber Crossroads in the Indo-Pacific." It looks at how Washington and its friends and partners in the Indo-Pacific can handle challenges in an increasingly unstable and dangerous cyber environment. The report was written by CNAS senior fellow Vivek Chilukuri and others.

The report points out that the Indo-Pacific region is at a "cyber crossroads." One path is stronger military, intelligence, and economic ties between Washington and its main friends and partners in the Indo-Pacific. The other path is growing cyber threats from China, North Korea, and Russia, as well as more serious cybercrime and hacking. These actions damage important systems, make data less safe, and weaken democratic governments.

The report says that in recent years, China has greatly increased its cyberattacks. These attacks combine traditional spying, stealing intellectual property, and data leaks with spreading false information, influencing operations, and setting up systems in important infrastructure. The fast development of artificial intelligence (AI) might also give attackers an advantage in cyberspace.

Taiwan's National Security Bureau said in April that China's cyber army keeps attacking Taiwanese government agencies, important systems, and technology companies to hack and steal information. From last year until now, Taiwan's government service websites have been attacked about 2.19 million times each day, mostly by China's cyber army. China also uses hacking combined with cybercrime to try to affect Taiwan's daily life and social order.

To keep up with the growing cyber threats, this CNAS report gives several policy ideas for the U.S. and for Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines.

First, the report urges the U.S. government to start an "Indo-Pacific Cyber Shield" plan. This plan would help friends work together more, share resources, and fight against bad government-backed cyber attackers. Other ideas include greatly increasing military cyber involvement and building abilities; clarifying legal and policy rules to allow more actions in the Indo-Pacific; creating a combined plan to help safe and strong information and communication technology (ICT) systems in the Indo-Pacific; and working more with Taiwan on military cybersecurity.

Additionally, the report suggests that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Philippines make it mandatory for government departments to use best cybersecurity practices. This includes things like two-step verification and not using personal devices for work. They should also spend more on defense to improve cybersecurity and use advanced AI and cloud-based cyber defense systems. They should also work more closely with technology companies at home and abroad.

Other ideas include clarifying legal and policy rules to allow the U.S. Cyber Command to send teams to take action; combining intelligence, cyber, diplomatic, and economic tools to fight against foreign bad influence; and slowly stopping the use of harmful ICT hardware, software, and systems made by companies connected to unfriendly countries.

The Center for a New American Security was started in 2007 by former U.S. Under Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and former Under Secretary of Defense MichÃ¨le Flournoy.`;
