Researchers found that taking a few minutes every hour to stand up, walk around, or do something relaxing can make you feel more focused and less tired. These short breaks give your brain a rest and help you concentrate better when you return to your work. So, don't feel guilty about taking a short break â€“ it's actually good for your job!

You can also try dancing while you cook or doing some stretching while you watch TV. Small changes like these can make a big difference in your overall fitness.
