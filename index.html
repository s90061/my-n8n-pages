Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., is looking to collaborate with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) on a massive project: a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona dedicated to building robots and artificial intelligence. This ambitious plan, code-named "Project Crystal Land," aims to bring high-tech manufacturing back to the U.S. SoftBank officials are seeking tax breaks and have been discussing the project with federal and state government representatives. While TSMC, a key maker of advanced AI chips for Nvidia Corp., already has plans to invest $165 billion in the U.S. and has started production at its first Arizona factory, SoftBank is keen for them to play a significant role. Son has also identified several SoftBank Vision Fund companies that might participate in this Arizona manufacturing hub.

**US Added Over 1,000 Millionaires a Day Last Year**

According to a report published by UBS on Wednesday, the United States experienced a remarkable surge in wealth last year, adding over 379,000 new U.S. dollar millionaires. This amounts to more than 1,000 new millionaires every single day, a higher rate than any other global market. The report, which analyzed individual wealth across 56 markets, highlighted that North America, particularly the U.S., accounted for over half of the personal wealth in these regions. UBS attributed this strong wealth growth in North America in 2024 largely to a stable U.S. dollar and positive financial market performance. While the U.S. led in the number of new millionaires, Switzerland and Luxembourg had the highest concentration of U.S.-dollar millionaires per person, with more than one in seven adults in these countries being a millionaire.

**Taiwan Adds Chinaâ€™s Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List**

Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has officially added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list. This move comes as trade and technology tensions between Taiwan, China, and the United States continue to escalate. Both Huawei and SMIC have previously faced sanctions from the U.S. The decision follows the discovery of TSMC-made chips in Huawei products last year, which prompted Taiwan to review its existing oversight mechanisms to prevent indirect supply chain loopholes. This action aligns Taiwan with Washington's efforts to restrict companies involved in Beijing's artificial intelligence ambitions, as these two Chinese companies are currently developing China's most advanced self-developed AI chips, aiming to compete with U.S.-based Nvidia and supply Chinese tech firms despite export restrictions.
