            <h1>India Allows Chinese Tourists Again as Relations Get Better</h1>
            <p>The Indian Embassy in China announced today that starting tomorrow, Chinese citizens can get tourist visas again. This is the first time in five years. This news comes as India and China are working to fix their relationship.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, the relationship between India and China became bad after a fight happened in 2020 near the Himalayas, where both countries claim land. After that, India put limits on Chinese businesses investing there. They also banned many popular Chinese apps and stopped many flights between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Around the same time, China stopped giving visas to Indian citizens and other foreigners because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But in 2022, China started giving visas again for students and business travelers.</p>
            <p>China kept tourist visa rules for Indian citizens until March of this year. At that time, both countries agreed to start direct flights again.</p>
            <p>As their relationship slowly improved, India and China had several high-level meetings last year. This included a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Russia last October.</p>
            <p>India and China share a long border of 3800 kilometers. Both countries have argued about this border since the 1950s. In 1962, they had a short but serious war because of the border dispute. They are still talking to solve the problem, but it is moving slowly.</p>
            <p>This month, India's Foreign Minister told China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, that both countries must solve the border problems and remove their soldiers. He also said they should stop "trade restrictions" to make their relationship normal again.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Defense Cancels Contract After Former Official Joins Winning Company</h1>
            <p>The leader of the Taiwan People's Party, Huang Kuo-chang, said that a former official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, named Hung Sung-hui, was part of a group that chose a company for an army project. Later, this same official became a special director for the company that won the project. Today, the Ministry of National Defense said they found out about this in June. They stopped the contract process and canceled the first selection. They will now restart the process to find a new company according to the law.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang wrote on Facebook that a company called Singcare Industry became the best choice for the "Military Uniform Supply Station Operation Project." But after they were chosen, the winning company changed its board of directors. Hung Sung-hui, the former Ministry of Economic Affairs official who helped choose the company, then became a special director for Singcare.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense sent out a press release this evening. It said that for the army's project, a member of the selection committee became a special director for the winning company. When the Ministry of National Defense learned about this in June, they immediately stopped signing the contract. They also canceled the first selection results. The Ministry of National Defense will now start the buying process again, following the law.</p>

            <h1>Mpox Outbreak in Gambia, More Cases in West Africa</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Gambia, a country in West Africa, reported an outbreak of Mpox, finding one case. Many nearby countries have also recently reported more people getting sick.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that because there are more cases in West Africa, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that Mpox is still a global public health emergency.</p>
            <p>Gambia's Ministry of Health said in a statement that they "found one case of Mpox through their regular health check system." They added that this case was found on July 18.</p>
            <p>The statement said: "Finding even one case of Mpox in a country where it is not usually found means there is an outbreak. We must take action right away."</p>
            <p>Gambia's Ministry of Health said they are actively looking for more cases, checking people who were close to the sick person, and telling people in the community how to stop the disease from spreading.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health said they are doing special tests to find out the type of virus found in Gambia.</p>
            <p>From January to the end of May this year, Sierra Leone, a nearby country, reported 3350 cases of Mpox. 16 people died there.</p>
            <p>Liberia's National Public Health Institute said that by early June, about 71 people in their country had Mpox.</p>
            <p>Guinea reported last week that they have had over 200 cases of Mpox since September of last year.</p>
            <p>According to the WHO, thousands of Mpox cases have also been reported this year in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda, and Burundi.</p>
