Airbnb is introducing new technology to prevent unauthorized parties from happening in its rental properties. This system analyzes factors like the guest's age, length of stay, and the type of property being booked. If the system identifies a high risk of a party, the guest will be blocked from booking the entire home. Instead, they may be directed to book a single room in a hotel or a different Airbnb listing.

This initiative is part of Airbnb's ongoing effort to improve community safety and be a good neighbor. The company has already implemented several policies aimed at reducing disruptive events, including banning parties in listings and establishing a 24/7 neighborhood support line. This new technology builds on these existing measures, providing an additional layer of protection for hosts and their neighbors. Airbnb hopes this will discourage large, unauthorized gatherings, contributing to a more positive experience for everyone.

**Article 2: The Rise of "Quiet Quitting" Reshapes Workplace Culture**

"Quiet quitting," a term that describes doing only what your job description requires, has gained popularity, reflecting a shift in attitudes towards work. Instead of going above and beyond, employees are focusing on fulfilling their basic responsibilities and setting boundaries to prevent burnout. This doesn't necessarily mean they're unhappy or disengaged, but rather that they're prioritizing work-life balance.

Experts suggest that quiet quitting isn't laziness, but a response to unreasonable expectations and a lack of recognition. Many employees feel pressured to constantly be "on" and available, leading to stress and exhaustion. By scaling back their efforts to match their compensation and job requirements, workers are reclaiming their time and energy. This trend is forcing companies to reconsider their workplace cultures, encouraging them to provide better support for employees' well-being and to clearly define job expectations.

**Article 3: Iceland's Sustainable Tourism Model Attracts Global Attention**

Iceland has become a popular tourist destination, drawing visitors with its stunning natural landscapes, from glaciers and volcanoes to geysers and waterfalls. However, the country is also committed to sustainable tourism practices, aiming to minimize the environmental impact of increased tourism. This involves implementing policies to protect natural resources, promoting responsible travel behavior, and investing in eco-friendly infrastructure.

Iceland encourages visitors to respect the environment by staying on marked trails, properly disposing of waste, and supporting local businesses that prioritize sustainability. The country is also working to diversify its tourism offerings, encouraging visitors to explore less-visited regions and engage in activities that have a low environmental footprint. By balancing economic growth with environmental protection, Iceland is positioning itself as a leader in sustainable tourism, offering a model for other destinations seeking to manage the impact of tourism on their natural and cultural resources.
