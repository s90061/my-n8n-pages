            <h1>DPP Says Reports About a "Thank You Party" Are False</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 29, Central News Agency reporter Yeh Su-ping) A news report said, "Southern Taiwan is flooded! Lai Ching-te is expected to give an important speech tomorrow and hold a thank you party." Today, Ms. Dai Wei-shan, the spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), strongly denied this. She said that these statements are completely untrue and do not match the facts.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, a senior journalist said that President Lai Ching-te would give an important speech at tomorrow's Central Standing Committee meeting. He would also openly ask that the August 23rd event not fail. The journalist also said a thank you party might be held.</p>
            <p>Today, Ms. Dai Wei-shan repeated that these statements are completely untrue and do not match the facts.</p>
            <p>Ms. Dai Wei-shan stated that the ruling team is carefully checking what happened after the recall vote. They are not planning what the report said. Also, the government team quickly understood the situation of possible damage from the heavy rain in southern Taiwan. They sent government members to help with the rescue work immediately. She asked media and other people not to report things that are not checked at this time, as this can confuse the public. (Editor: Su Lung-chi) 2025/07/29</p>

            <h1>US Experts Say Failed Recall Votes Won't Hurt Taiwan-US Relations, but Trust Must Grow</h1>
            <p>(San Francisco, July 28, Central News Agency reporter Chang Hsin-yu) On July 26, all 25 recall proposals failed. Kharis Templeman, a political expert from the US, believes this result will not greatly change how Taiwan and the US interact. However, both sides must continue to build stronger trust. David Sacks, another expert, looked at the issue from a national security point of view. He said the recall results bring some uncertainty. If Taiwan's defense budget faces problems, it could harm the relationship between Taiwan and the US.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's "big recall" votes did not pass. Today, David Sacks, a researcher at the US think tank Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), wrote that this result will affect Taiwan's future defense budget. Former US President Donald Trump once said that Taiwan's defense budget should be 10% of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). President Lai Ching-te wants to increase the defense budget to 3%. If this plan is stopped, it could seriously damage Taiwan-US relations.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sacks pointed out that if this happens, others might think Taiwan is not serious about protecting itself. A weaker Taiwan could encourage China to act more aggressively.</p>
            <p>The first group of 24 recall proposals against Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an all failed in the votes on July 26.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sacks said that after President Lai was elected last January, many Chinese experts tried to say his election was not proper. If the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gets most of the seats in the Legislative Yuan, Beijing might rethink these ideas. Now, Chinese observers might conclude that Taiwanese voters prefer a divided government. This could make Beijing increase its pressure on Taiwan and try to weaken President Lai's government.</p>
            <p>A divided government means that different political parties control the executive and legislative parts of the government.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sacks believes that President Lai must make changes. He needs to show voters that he is willing and able to work with opposing parties to solve the big problems Taiwan faces. Taiwan's safety will depend on whether the government and the KMT can agree and work together.</p>
            <p>Kharis Templeman, an expert from the Hoover Institute at Stanford University, said in an interview with the Central News Agency today that political differences will surely lead to conflicts. Some laws proposed by the opposition parties are unpopular with some voters. On the other hand, President Lai's government must try to find a way to agree with the opposition parties. If the opposition blocks budget plans or rejects the president's choices for Supreme Court justices, it will be very costly. Both sides must find ways to work together for the country's benefit.</p>
            <p>Mr. Templeman thinks that in these recall votes, Taiwanese voters showed their opinions in a legal way, which is good for democracy. The results of the recall votes show that Taiwanese people are not extremely divided on issues related to China. They cannot be simply put into "pro-China" or "anti-China" groups.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether the recall results will affect Taiwan-US relations, Mr. Templeman believes it will not change the basic nature of how Taiwan and the US interact. What is more important is that both sides continue to build deeper trust. Both presidents have not been in office for too long, so there is still room to improve in this area.

            <h1>Fontrip Gets NT$180 Million More Money, Lion Travel Continues Support</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 29, Central News Agency reporter Chiang Ming-yen) Fontrip Technology (FONTRIP), a company that provides electronic ticket systems, announced that it has finished raising an additional NT$180 million. Its original investors, Lion Travel and Klook, have put in more money. This money will be used to grow in international markets, improve its technology systems, and add AI tools. The goal is for Fontrip to become a major platform for managing travel resources in Asia.</p>
            <p>Today, Fontrip Technology (FONTRIP) announced it completed the NT$180 million capital increase. This round of funding was led by New Venture Development Fund, which is part of China Development Financial. Other investors like ITIC Innovation's Taiwan-Japan Fund and EID Partners also joined. The original investors, Lion Travel and Klook, continued to give more support.</p>
            <p>Fontrip Technology started in 2015. It was developed by the Industrial Technology Research Institute and received investment from Lion Travel. The company focuses on electronic ticket platforms and systems for managing travel resources at different places. Right now, it has about 80% of the market share for electronic travel packages in Taiwan. In 2024, its income was NT$680 million, and it expects to double its growth in the next three years.</p>
            <p>Fontrip Technology works with over 1,000 partners. These include famous places like the National Palace Museum, Taipei 101, Sun Moon Lake and Alishan National Scenic Areas, Leofoo Village Theme Park, and forest recreation areas. It also connects with over 60 sales channels both in Taiwan and overseas. This has helped them create a large-scale electronic ticket solution for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Lion Travel said that in recent years, Fontrip Technology has been working hard to expand its business outside Taiwan. It has taken its experience from Taiwan to Okinawa, Japan. There, it successfully tested a business model that combines City Pass and electronic bus tickets. The market has accepted this. In the future, Fontrip sees good chances for growth in Asia. These include making tourism areas digital, having cashless travel, and building smart places. Fontrip plans to use the Okinawa model as a first step to enter other overseas markets. It aims to develop in popular tourist areas like Kyushu and Hokkaido in Japan, and Hong Kong. It is also looking at chances in South Korea and Southeast Asia to make its presence in Asia even bigger.
