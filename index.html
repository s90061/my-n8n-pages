The US government has charged six people from China, two from Taiwan, and one from the US. They are accused of helping North Korean IT workers get jobs at over 100 American companies. These jobs helped North Korea earn at least 5 million US dollars, which was used for their weapons programs.

North Korea sends many skilled IT workers around the world. These workers pretend to be Americans to get online jobs. This helps North Korea get money for its weapons. The US Justice Department said that some bank accounts, websites, and laptops used in this scheme have been taken by the police.

Some big American companies, including one that works on defense, were tricked into hiring these workers. These companies thought the workers were in the US, but most were in North Korea or China. The money they earned went to accounts linked to North Korea.

**Countries Worried as Trump's Tariff Deadline Nears**

The 90-day period when former US President Trump stopped putting high taxes (tariffs) on goods from other countries is ending on July 9th. Many countries are worried that taxes on important goods like wood, cars, minerals, and electronics might go up because of US national security.

The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, said that many countries are willing to talk about trade. But they need to know that if talks don't go well, the high taxes from April 2nd might come back. He also said that some specific goods, like wood, are not part of these talks and have their own tax rules.

These specific taxes are based on a law from 1962. This law is meant to make sure the US can make important products on its own, especially during wars or when there are shortages. Countries like India, Vietnam, Japan, Malaysia, and the EU are trying to make deals with the US to avoid these high taxes. However, they are worried about new taxes on certain industries that the US sees as important for national security.

**Oil Prices Fall as Middle East Tensions Ease**

World oil prices dropped slightly today. This happened because people are guessing about how much more oil a group of oil-producing countries (OPEC+) will make. Also, worries that problems in the Middle East would stop oil from getting to other parts of the world have gone down.

This small drop in prices comes after oil prices had their biggest weekly fall in two years. In New York, West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August went down by 41 cents, making it $65.11 per barrel. In London, Brent crude oil for August went down by 16 cents, making it $67.61 per barrel.
