About 39,000 students have signed up for the 2025 Subject Ability Test. This number is a little less than last year. The test will happen on July 11th and 12th. This year, a new subject, Mathematics B, has been added.

On the first day, students can take Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics A, and Biology. On the second day, they can take History, Geography, Mathematics B, and Civics and Society. Students can choose which subjects they want to take. Most students, about 61%, chose Mathematics A. About 16,955 students chose Mathematics B.

Many students chose to take four subjects this year. About 41% of students chose four subjects. Last year, most students chose three subjects. Only a small number of students, about 6%, chose all eight subjects.

**EU Close to a Deal, May Avoid New Tariffs from Trump**

Sources from the European Union (EU) told Reuters that the EU will likely not receive a letter from the United States about higher tariffs. The EU is working to make sure some of its products are not included in a new 10% tariff from the US.

The US government under Trump has already sent letters to other countries like Japan, South Korea, and Myanmar about new tariffs starting on August 1st. However, the EU is close to an agreement with the Trump government.

Three sources familiar with the talks said that the EU might agree to a 10% tariff on certain items like airplanes, some medical equipment, and alcoholic drinks. Two sources also said that the EU is looking at a plan that would let European car makers, who have big factories in the US, bring more European cars into the US with a lower tariff than the current 25%. This would help German car companies.

The European Commission told EU countries that they have to choose between an agreement that might not be fair, or more uncertainty. They also said that there is no guarantee that the Trump government will not add more tariffs later or ask for more from the EU.

**73-Year-Old Woman Finds It Hard to Read Religious Texts, Doctors Discover Cataracts**

A 73-year-old woman, Mrs. Hong, often reads religious texts every morning and evening. Last year, she started to notice that the words were blurry and hard to see. She went to the doctor and found out she had cataracts. This means the natural lens in her eye had become old and cloudy. After a special eye surgery that put in a new lens, she can now see clearly again.

Dr. Lin Geng-hong, an eye doctor at Asia University Hospital, said that if you start to see things blurry, like looking through frosted glass, or if bright car lights bother you at night, it could be a sign of cataracts. If not treated quickly, cataracts can cause blindness. But if found early, they can be treated, and people can see clearly again.

Dr. Lin explained that the eye's lens is like a camera lens; it focuses light onto the retina so we can see. When this lens becomes cloudy because of age, sickness, or injury, light cannot pass through well, making vision blurry. This is a cataract. Older people are more likely to get cataracts because their lenses get old. However, more young people are getting them now because they use electronic devices a lot.

Dr. Lin used Mrs. Hong as an example. She said she used to have perfect vision. But recently, her vision became blurry, colors looked dull, and bright light bothered her. She had to really stare at her religious texts and sometimes felt bad for reading them wrong. After an eye exam, doctors confirmed she had severe cataracts. The surgery made her vision much better, and she said she doesn't even need to turn on all the lights in her house anymore.
