            <h1>Bonnie Glaser says anti-American feelings are growing in Taiwan, worries China will use this to push for unification.</h1>
            <p>A scholar from the United States, Bonnie Glaser, has used survey data to warn that the idea of "doubting America" is getting stronger in Taiwan. If this idea spreads, it could harm America's interests and make its friends in the Indo-Pacific region trust America less. It could also give China a chance to tell people in Taiwan that "unification might be the best or only choice."</p>
            <p>Today, the German Marshall Fund (GMF), a think tank in Washington D.C., published an article. It was written by Bonnie Glaser, who leads the GMF's Indo-Pacific program, and Lan Li-ya, an intern. The article is called "Taiwan's Growing Distrust of the United States."</p>
            <p>They wrote that people in Taiwan feel less positive about the United States. When Russia fully attacked Ukraine in 2022, the Biden government chose not to send soldiers to help. This made some people question if America could be trusted.</p>
            <p>Now, this feeling is coming back and spreading. People in Taiwan are worried that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) building more factories in the U.S. will make Taiwan less important for its safety. They also think it might increase the risk of China attacking Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Several surveys show that people in Taiwan feel more negative and distrustful towards the United States. Also, fewer people believe that the U.S. would help Taiwan if there was a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>A report from the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington D.C., looked at surveys done in Taiwan from February to April. It found that 40.5% of people surveyed had a negative view of the United States. This is more than the 24.2% who felt that way in July 2024.</p>
            <p>The report also said that the number of people who think the U.S. is not a trustworthy friend went up by 13.9 percentage points.</p>
            <p>A survey called "American Portrait" by the Institute of European and American Studies at Academia Sinica in March this year showed that 59.6% of people surveyed do not trust the United States. This is almost 10 percentage points more than last year. In both surveys, more than 40% of people said they think the U.S. would probably not or definitely not get involved if there was a war in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Glaser and Lan Li-ya said that Trump's decision to put matching taxes (tariffs) on Taiwan might be the main reason America's image got worse. A survey by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation in mid-April showed that 81.9% of people thought these taxes were not fair. As many as 86.4% believed these taxes would hurt Taiwan's economy a lot or a medium amount.</p>
            <p>The article says that many people think the Trump government pushed TSMC to build six chip factories in the U.S. This was seen as a way to hurt Taiwan's strong position in making computer chips for the world. This also damaged America's good name. A survey by Global Views Research in March showed that most people in Taiwan believe TSMC's choice to make advanced chips in the U.S. makes Taiwan's "silicon shield" weaker. This "silicon shield" helps protect Taiwan from attacks by China.</p>
            <p>The article warns that if public opinion in Taiwan keeps changing or gets worse, it could harm America's interests. This growing feeling of worry might lead to disappointment about the future. This gives China a chance to move forward with its long-term plan: to convince people in Taiwan that the best, or even only, choice is to unite with China on Beijing's terms.</p>
            <p>This feeling of sadness and worry might also make China take more risky actions to force unification. For example, it might question Taiwan's control over nearby waters, start a blockade, or take over small islands.</p>
            <p>Also, America's friends in the Indo-Pacific region, like Australia, Japan, and the Philippines, are watching closely to see if America can be trusted on issues related to Taiwan. They see this as a way to know if America will keep its promises to protect them. If people in Taiwan lose faith in America, these friends might also start to doubt if America will keep its word.</p>
            <p>At the end of the article, Glaser and Lan Li-ya gave several suggestions for the U.S. These include: talks between the U.S. and China should not lead to results that put Taiwan's safety or wealth at risk. The U.S. should clearly state that Taiwan is very important to it. For example, the President could give an important speech to get support from American people to defend Taiwan if it is attacked.</p>
            <p>Other suggestions include: approving and making sure that special weapons (asymmetric weapons) are given to Taiwan quickly. Also, making it easier for Taiwan's president to travel through the U.S. instead of setting limits. This would calm the worries of people in Taiwan about China's efforts to isolate Taiwan diplomatically. Furthermore, regarding the issue of Taiwan's president traveling through the U.S., the U.S. government has always followed the rules of "safety, comfort, convenience, and respect." This practice should continue.</p>
            <p>The article also says that the U.S. should continue to send groups of Congress members to visit Taiwan. This would show again America's promise to support Taiwan's democracy, wealth, and safety.</p>

            <h1>Zelensky: Ukraine is ready to hold elections if the war ends and it is safe.</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said today that he is willing to hold elections in his country. But this can only happen if the war with Russia ends and if it is safe to have elections.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelensky said this at a press conference in the Oval Office. This was before his important meeting with U.S. President Trump. They talked about how to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. This war started when Russia fully attacked Ukraine and has been going on for three and a half years.</p>
            <p>When a reporter asked if he would hold elections, a question Trump had asked many times, Zelensky said: "Yes, of course, we are willing to hold elections, yes. We must keep things safe, and we must do some work in the parliament, because during a war, you cannot hold elections."</p>
            <p>Zelensky also said that the war must stop (have a ceasefire). This way, people in Ukraine can take part in elections that are democratic, open, and fair.</p>
            <p>Right now, Ukraine has stopped holding elections because of martial law (a special rule during war).</p>
            <p>When speaking to the media, both leaders were polite. This was different from their heated meeting in the Oval Office in February. But at one point, Trump made Zelensky feel uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>Trump stopped Zelensky and said: "So you are saying that you cannot hold elections during a war?"</p>
            <p>He smiled and then said: "So, let me put it this way, after three and a half years, you mean if we happen to be fighting someone, there will be no more elections?"</p>
            <p>Zelensky immediately smiled and added: "No, that's not what I mean."</p>

            <h1>US Secretary of State Rubio has canceled 6,000 student visas in 7 months.</h1>
            <p>The U.S. State Department said today that since Secretary of State Marco Rubio took office seven months ago, 6,000 student visas have been canceled.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Rubio used a part of the law that is not very clear to deal with students. This law lets him cancel visas for people who are believed to be against America's foreign policy goals. He did this to please President Trump's strong supporters.</p>
            <p>The Trump government also wanted to send many people who were in the U.S. without permission back to their home countries.</p>
            <p>An official from the State Department said: "The State Department has canceled over 6,000 student visas. The reasons were staying longer than allowed and breaking laws. Most of these were because of assault, drunk driving, theft, and supporting terrorism."</p>
            <p>The official said that about 4,000 of these visas were canceled because the students broke the law.</p>
            <p>The State Department did not cancel visas based on what country the students were from. But Rubio had promised to focus on students from China.</p>
            <p>In March, Rubio told the media that he cancels student visas every day. When talking about very active students, he said: "Every time I find anyone from this group of crazy people, I will cancel their visas."</p>
            <p>Rubio specially mentioned students who took part in protests against Israel. He said they were acting against Jewish people. But those students have said they did not do anything wrong.</p>
