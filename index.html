A recent study shows that younger people in America, including Gen Z and Millennials, are choosing to use debit cards more often than credit cards. This is a change from older generations, who still tend to use credit cards more.

The survey by Bankrate found that over half of younger adults (ages 18-43) mostly use debit cards for their everyday spending. Many say they prefer debit because it helps them manage their money better and avoid debt. When you use a debit card, you spend money directly from your bank account, so you can't spend more than you have. This helps avoid interest payments and fees that can come with credit cards.

While credit cards offer benefits like rewards and help build a credit history, younger people are more careful about borrowing money. This trend suggests a growing desire among young adults to control their finances and stay out of debt.

**Using AI Will Be Key for Future Jobs, Says IBM CEO**

The CEO of IBM, Arvind Krishna, recently shared his thoughts on how Artificial Intelligence (AI) will affect jobs. He believes that AI will not completely take away jobs. Instead, he says that workers who learn how to use AI tools will be more successful than those who do not.

Krishna explained that AI will change many jobs, not destroy them. For example, some tasks that people do now might be done by AI in the future. However, new tasks and new types of jobs will also appear, requiring people to work *with* AI. He stressed that employees need to adapt and gain new skills related to AI.

This means that if you learn how to use AI in your work, you will have a stronger position in the job market. Businesses will look for people who can work effectively with these new technologies. The message is clear: AI is a tool, and learning to use it will be very important for many careers.

**Venice Introduces a New Fee for Day-Trippers**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started charging a new entry fee for some visitors. This rule began on April 25, 2024. The aim is to control the large number of tourists who visit the city each day, especially during busy times.

Now, day-trippers must pay 5 euros to enter Venice's historic center on certain peak days. These days are usually weekends and holidays when the city is most crowded. Visitors need to book their visit online beforehand and get a QR code. This code will be checked when they arrive.

However, not everyone has to pay. People who live in Venice, those who travel for work, children under 14, and tourists who are staying overnight in the city (meaning they have booked a hotel or accommodation) do not need to pay the fee. This new system is Venice's effort to manage "overtourism" and make the city more pleasant for both residents and visitors.
