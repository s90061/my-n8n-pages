            <h1>Cargo Ship Loses Containers in Peru; Evergreen Marine Says Crew and Ship Are Safe</h1>
            <p>Evergreen Marine's ship, the "Ever Fortune," lost some containers in Peru on August 1st. Today, Evergreen Marine stated that a tsunami, bad winter weather, and sudden large waves caused the containers to fall from the ship. After a first check, the company said that both the crew and the ship are safe.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Marine explained that on August 1st, at 9:40 AM local time in Peru, the Ever Fortune was waiting near the port to enter. Because of a recent tsunami from an earthquake in Russia, bad winter ocean conditions in South America, and sudden long waves, the ship rocked strongly. This made the containers fall off the ship.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Marine said that after counting, the first check showed that the crew and the ship were both safe. The company will work with the local port authorities for the investigation.</p>
            <p>Foreign reports stated that on August 1st, when Evergreen's Ever Fortune ship was waiting outside Callao Port in Peru, it seemed to face strong winds and thick fog. About 50 containers from the back of the ship accidentally fell into the sea. This caused the port to close for a short time, and local shipping was briefly stopped.</p>
            <p>According to foreign news videos, the containers that fell from the Ever Fortune were mostly from the back of the ship. The crew members were not hurt. However, some containers were broken, and their contents spread out on the water.</p>

            <h1>Rakuten Girls Cheer for Community Baseball Game, Hualien's Xincheng Old Street Becomes Lively Again</h1>
            <p>Xincheng Old Street, which is near Taroko National Park, held a community baseball game today. This was done to help local tourism after the earthquake. The Rakuten Girls, a cheerleading group from a professional baseball league, also came to support the event. Local business owners said that the two-day event made nearby hotels almost fully booked. The street was closed for a market, creating a good economy for sports tourism.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Sports Association organized community baseball games for U8 (under 8 years old) and U10 (under 10 years old) teams. These games are held today and tomorrow at Xincheng Elementary School and Xiulin Junior High School. Hu Wen-wei, a local person helping with the event, said that 12 teams and over 300 people are taking part. Last night, 60% of nearby hotel rooms were booked, and tonight, they are almost full. This is a rare lively scene after the earthquake.</p>
            <p>During the opening of the games, the Rakuten Girls from the Chinese Professional Baseball League were there to cheer. The young players danced to the music. A parent named Weng, who was at the event, said that his 8-year-old child became very interested in baseball after the World Baseball 12 tournament, so he came to experience it with his child.</p>
            <p>Hu Wen-wei said that after the earthquake, Xincheng Old Street has 5 new shops, giving visitors a different feeling. Besides the sports event, during the two-day activity, a "Baseball Kids Party Market" was also held by closing the street. This market brought together local farm products, food, creative cultural items, and fun activities for families, letting visitors experience the daily life in Xincheng.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-yen, the head of the National Development Council's Land, Regional, and Outlying Islands Development Department, gave a speech. He said that Xincheng Old Street became quiet after the 0403 earthquake. He hopes that holding events will make visitors come to the old street and make it lively again, like it was before.</p>
            <p>A local business called "Mountain and Sea Department Store" also opened today. The owner, Lin Wei-teng, said that it was supposed to open last summer. But due to challenges like the earthquake and other natural disasters, they had to change their plans. Now that it's open, they will regularly offer local tours every Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday. These tours will be both free and paid, helping visitors learn about Xincheng's history. In August, there will be experience activities every weekend.</p>

            <h1>Koushe Village in Pingtung Has the Most Rain in Taiwan; Roads Covered by Mud and Rocks</h1>
            <p>Due to the southwest monsoon, heavy rain continued without stopping. Koushe Village in Sandimen Township, Pingtung, received over 470 millimeters of rain, which is the most in Taiwan. Inside the village, drainage pipes were blocked by many rocks and mud. This caused rocks and mud to cover the roads. In the afternoon, the rain became a bit lighter. After two hours of cleaning, the roads are now normal again.</p>
            <p>According to information from the weather agency, from midnight today until about 3 PM, the rain measuring station in Koushe Village, Sandimen Township, Pingtung County, recorded 470 millimeters of rain. This is the highest amount of rain in all of Taiwan. In the mountainous areas of Pingtung, there are also four other places where the total rainfall was over 300 millimeters.</p>
            <p>Song Zhaofu, the head of Koushe Village, told a CNA reporter that the rain started very heavily at midnight today and continued for several hours. Two drainage pipes in the village were blocked by a lot of rocks and mud, stopping the water from flowing away. This caused rocks and mud to spread onto the roads. After the rain eased a little, heavy machines were used to clear the roads in two hours. The problem is now fixed. The village has water and electricity, and about 500 villagers are safe. They only hope the rain stops.</p>
            <p>Today, work and school are still stopped in 8 aboriginal villages in Pingtung. The county government reported that up to today, 798 people from mountain areas have been moved to safety. Among them, 546 people are staying with relatives, and 252 are in shelters.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Government started its "0728 Heavy Rain Disaster Response Center" at level two at 12 PM. The heavy rain continued. In Shizi Township, the Zhukeng Shenying Industrial Road was covered by rocks and mud, so cars could not pass. In Gaoshu Township, the Yanchan Highway was flooded, and some cars broke down while driving, but luckily, the people got out safely. In Shizi Township, the Nan Shi Hou Shan Industrial Road also had two places where the road base was washed away, and there were also road collapses.</p>
