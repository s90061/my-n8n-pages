            <h1>NASA's First Trip Around the Moon with People is on Track, Planned for April 2026</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, September 23, comprehensive foreign news report) The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said today that "Artemis 2," the first mission with people in the "Artemis program," is making good progress. It is planned to launch in April 2026, and it might even launch earlier, in February 2026.</p>
            <p>The "Artemis program" is NASA's main plan to go back to the Moon. This space exploration program costs billions of dollars and is competing with a similar Moon landing plan by China. China wants to land people on the Moon by 2030.</p>
            <p>Lakiesha Hawkins, a senior NASA official, said today in a meeting, "We truly plan to keep this promise." She added that if the rocket and spaceship are ready earlier, an earlier launch is possible. But the most important rule is always mission safety.</p>
            <p>The "Artemis 2" mission will last 10 days. Four astronauts, including three Americans and one Canadian, will fly in a spaceship around the Moon and then come back to Earth.</p>
            <p>This mission will not land on the Moon. That is the goal of "Artemis 3."</p>
            <p>U.S. President Trump continues to push NASA to make space programs faster during his second term.</p>
            <p>This Republican leader started the Artemis program in his first term. He wants NASA to go back to the Moon quickly and then go to Mars.</p>

            <h1>Li Chenggang Meets with U.S. Midwest Business and Government Group, Focuses on U.S.-China Trade Talks</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, September 24) China's Ministry of Commerce said on September 23 that Li Chenggang, China's international trade negotiator and vice minister, met with a group of business and government leaders from the U.S. Midwest on September 22. They talked about trade between China and the U.S., and how different states and provinces can work together on trade.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced this on its official website on September 23, but it did not give many details.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that experts believe food exports from the Midwest will be very important in any trade agreement between the U.S. and China.</p>
            <p>The report also said that China is the world's biggest buyer of soybeans. However, China has not yet bought any soybeans from the U.S. fall harvest. Traders say most of these soybeans come from the U.S. Midwest.</p>
            <p>Trade experts expect that U.S. President Donald Trump wants China to promise to buy more American farm products and things like Boeing airplanes. This would be part of an agreement to stop the tax war between the world's two biggest economies.</p>
