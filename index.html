            <h1>Ministry of Labor Says It Did Not Block Twin City Forum Agreement</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City government announced that the Twin City Forum will not happen in September. News reports said this was because of problems with agreements like a "vocational training MOU." Today, the Ministry of Labor said that on September 19, it gave suggestions for changes to the Taipei City government. The Ministry said it did not ignore messages from the city. It asked people not to wrongly interpret their actions.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Taipei-Shanghai City Forum was planned to be held in Shanghai this year. Earlier, news said that Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an would lead a group to Shanghai for three days starting on September 25. But on September 22, the Taipei City government told the media that they needed more time to prepare. After thinking carefully, both sides decided not to hold the forum in September.</p>
            <p>Later, news reports said that the Twin City Forum was delayed because of issues with two cooperation agreements (MOUs). They said signing these MOUs was more complicated than in past years, involving more government departments. Some reports even said that messages were intentionally ignored. They also mentioned that discussions about the "vocational training MOU" with the Ministry of Labor were not smooth.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Labor explained that regarding the MOUs Taipei City wanted to sign for the Twin City Forum, they have been actively helping and communicating since they received the documents from the city. They did this to prevent any issues with laws during cross-strait exchanges. They said they did not block anything.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor said that after many discussions with the Mainland Affairs Council and the Taipei City government, both the Ministry of Labor and the Mainland Affairs Council gave suggestions for changes to the MOUs to the Taipei City government on September 19. They did not ignore any messages.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor hopes that people will not wrongly understand their actions. They ask that people do not say the central government's "help" was "blocking." Doing so would not be good for healthy and organized cross-strait exchanges.</p>

            <h1>Baida Company Says It Paid Back Money After Taiwan Branch's Checks Bounced</h1>
            <p>Baida-KY, a Singaporean company, held a press conference tonight. They said that their Taiwan branch had problems with checks bouncing because there was not enough money in the bank. Eight checks bounced, totaling NT$27.3 million. The company said they have already paid the money. They also said that the group has enough money to run its business, so this event should not have a big effect on the company's finances or operations.</p>
            <p>Baida-KY explained that from September 3 to September 5, their Taiwan branch, Baida Precision Co., Ltd., had bounced checks. This happened because of a mistake in managing money. After the checks bounced, the company quickly paid the money. They also told the bank to mark the checks as paid. The Taiwan branch no longer has any unpaid checks.</p>
            <p>Baida-KY pointed out that the group has plenty of money for its operations. At the end of July, their total cash and cash equivalents (including bank deposits that cannot be used freely) were about NT$1.406 billion. At the end of August, this was about NT$1.319 billion. The amount of the bounced checks was about 1.94% and 2.07% of these amounts, respectively.</p>
            <p>Baida-KY stressed that after the checks bounced, the Taiwan branch quickly paid the money and told the bank to mark the checks as paid. They have also improved their internal controls and money management. The company believes this event will not have a major impact on their finances or business.</p>

            <h1>Chipbond Company to Finish New Factory by Year-End for Advanced Semiconductor Materials</h1>
            <p>Chipbond, a company that provides chemicals and materials, sees a good chance in the market. They expect high demand for very pure chemicals needed in making semiconductor chips and advanced packaging. So, at the start of 2024, they began building a new factory in Bade, Taoyuan. It should be finished by the end of this year. This new factory will help the company make more of its own products, aiming for 70% of its products to be made by them.</p>
            <p>Chipbond's main products are special chemicals and materials for making semiconductors. These are used in many areas, such as making semiconductor chips and advanced packaging, high-end circuit boards, passive parts, and diodes. They supply very pure chemicals, chemicals for surface treatment, functional chemicals, and other chemical materials and raw materials needed for these processes.</p>
            <p>Chipbond will hold a meeting for investors on September 25 before listing on the emerging stock market. On September 26, its shares will start trading at NT$32.5 each.</p>
            <p>Today, Mr. Chao Wen-yi, the General Manager of Chipbond, spoke at a media event. He said that Chipbond started by trading and acting as an agent for other companies. In 2003, they changed their focus and began making their own products. In 2006, they created their own brand. Chipbond can develop new formulas, make products to order, and check their quality. Currently, products under their own brand make up 45% of their sales, and agency products make up about 55%. The company's average gross profit margin is around 23%.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Shih-yao, the Chairman of Chipbond, stated that the new Bade factory costs about NT$210 million. This is close to Chipbond's capital of NT$220 million. The company is investing this money because they believe there will be strong demand for chemicals and environmentally friendly products in the semiconductor, advanced packaging, and high-end circuit board industries in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Shih-yao mentioned that the new Bade factory will be finished by the end of the year. At first, it will mainly produce temporary bonding materials (TBM) and cleaning agents, additives for etching processes, and environmentally friendly photoresist removers. The company hopes that within 3 to 5 years, the sales of products made under their own brand will increase to nearly 70% of their total sales.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chao Wen-yi said that as global integrated circuit technology changes quickly, special cleaning agents are very important for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. They can help make more good products. Chipbond has key knowledge in special cleaning agent technology. They work closely with big international companies like those in Japan and Germany to make their products better. This helps them meet the needs of customers at different technology levels.</p>
            <p>Also, for making High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), the quality and demand for etching liquids have increased. Chipbond's etching liquid formulas have been approved by customers and are being shipped in larger amounts both in Taiwan and overseas. Chipbond's stripping solution has also been adopted by major manufacturers of high-end circuit boards. It is one of the few products that is environmentally friendly and non-toxic, and it also works well with new manufacturing processes.</p>
            <p>Chipbond's sales for the first seven months of this year were NT$787 million. Their gross profit margin was 23.39%. Their net profit after tax was NT$26 million, and earnings per share were NT$1.17. Due to delays in customer shipments, they expect their business in the second half of the year to be better than the first half.</p>
            <p>Looking to the future, Chipbond is focusing its research and development on three main areas: green products, advanced packaging processes, and AI cooling solutions. Besides growing in Taiwan and China, they have recently started sending product samples for testing and increasing shipments in overseas markets like South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. They continue to work with big international companies to expand their market share and replace European, American, and Japanese companies in the electronic chemical supply chain.</p>
