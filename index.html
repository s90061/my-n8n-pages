            <h1>US Stocks Reach New Highs, Not Affected by Bad Job Data</h1>
            <p>(New York, September 9, Central News Agency) The four main US stock markets reached new high prices today. This happened even though the job numbers were not good. The US government believes that 911,000 fewer jobs were created in the past year, up to March. This information might make the Federal Reserve (Fed) lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 196.39 points, or 0.43%. It closed at 45711.34 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 Index went up a little by 17.46 points, or 0.27%. It closed at 6512.61 points.</p>

            <h1>Giannis Antetokounmpo Leads Greece to EuroBasket Semi-Finals for First Time in 16 Years</h1>
            <p>(Riga, Latvia, September 9, Central News Agency) Greece won against Lithuania in the European Basketball Championship. They won with a score of 87 to 76. This was thanks to the good play of NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as "the Greek Freak." This win means Greece is in the semi-finals for the first time since 2009.</p>
            <p>The official website for EuroBasket said that Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 29 points. In the last five EuroBasket tournaments, Greece stopped at the quarter-finals four times. But this time, they have finally passed that stage. They will play against Turkey to try and get a spot in the championship game.</p>
            <p>Greece started the second quarter very well. They made three three-point shots and scored 11 points to Lithuania's 2 points. This made the score 35 to 24. But Lithuania quickly scored 11 points to Greece's 2 points. This brought the score closer, 38 to 39. At the end of the first half, Greece was behind by 38 to 44.</p>
            <p>At one point, Lithuania made the score close, 41 to 44. But then Greece made their lead bigger, 51 to 41. In the middle of the third quarter, they made the score 58 to 43. Lithuania made the difference smaller again for a short time, to 9 points. But Greece made their lead even bigger at the start of the fourth quarter, to 16 points. This made it clear that Greece would win the game.</p>
            <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo was very important for Greece. He played strongly in the game against Lithuania. The NBA star scored 29 points in total. He made 9 out of 15 shots and 11 out of 16 free throws. He also got 6 rebounds, 2 assists, 4 steals, and 1 block.</p>
            <p>Vasileios Toliopoulos made 3 three-point shots and scored 17 points. Kostas Sloukas got 11 points and 4 assists. Kostas Antetokounmpo also had 4 points and 4 blocks.</p>
            <p>Jonas Valanciunas played very well for Lithuania, scoring 24 points and getting 15 rebounds. Arnas Velickas also played well, with 12 points, 5 rebounds, and 7 assists. But even with their good play, Lithuania could not win the game.</p>
            <p>Greece won the EuroBasket championship in 1987 and 2005. Now, they need to win just two more games to get their third championship trophy.</p>

            <h1>Apple iPhone 17 Series Focuses on Camera Upgrades, New Thin 'Air' Model Revealed</h1>
            <p>(San Francisco, September 9, Central News Agency reporter Chang Hsin-yu) Apple held its autumn event today. They showed their new iPhone 17 series phones. They also showed a new phone in the family, the iPhone Air, which is the thinnest iPhone ever. All the new phones start with 256GB of storage. The iPhone 17 will cost at least 29,900 New Taiwan dollars, and the iPhone Air will cost at least 36,900 New Taiwan dollars. You can pre-order them on September 12, and they will be available to buy on September 19.</p>
            <p>Apple's autumn event was shown live online. CEO Tim Cook was at Apple's headquarters in California. He showed new products one by one. First were the new AirPods Pro 3 headphones, then the Apple Watch Series 11, Apple Watch SE 3, and Apple Watch Ultra 3 smartwatches. The new iPhone 17 series, which everyone was waiting for, was shown last.</p>
            <p>The normal iPhone 17 has a bigger 6.3-inch screen. The edges around the screen are smaller. It comes in five colors: lavender purple, sage green, mist blue, white, and black. The screen technology is better, and it is three times more resistant to scratches.</p>
            <p>The new iPhone 17 has an A19 chip inside. This chip is made with TSMC's 3-nanometer technology. It has a CPU with 6 cores and a GPU with 5 cores. It works 20% faster than the last model. It also supports Apple Intelligence, which is Apple's personal smart system. This system has a feature for translating languages right away.</p>
            <p>This year, the camera improvements are very important. The back camera is now 48 megapixels. The front camera is also much better. It takes pictures with 16 megapixels. It has a "Center Stage" feature. This means that when you take a selfie, whether your phone is sideways or straight up, the camera will keep you in the middle of the picture. The video is also very stable. Even if you run while taking a selfie video, the picture will stay steady.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max come in three colors: silver, cosmic orange, and deep blue. They have the newest A19 Pro chip and a bigger battery. For the body, the new Pro models use a single piece of aluminum alloy instead of the titanium metal used before. They also have a new cooling system called a VC vapor chamber. This helps the phone stay cool better.</p>
            <p>For the cameras, all three back cameras on the Pro models are now 48 megapixels. They can zoom in up to 8 times with optical zoom and 40 times with digital zoom. The new iPhone camera system uses a camera part that stretches horizontally. Apple calls this "Plateau."</p>
            <p>The new iPhone Air was shown today. It replaces the old Plus models. The iPhone Air is the thinnest and lightest iPhone ever. Its design comes from Apple's thin laptops, the MacBook Air. This means "thin and light" is a big selling point for this iPhone. In the online video, it looked thinner than the side of a finger. It comes in four colors: sky blue, light gold, cloud white, and space black.</p>
            <p>This new phone weighs about 145 grams. It has titanium edges. It is a little thicker than 5.5 millimeters, but it is about 2 millimeters thinner than current iPhones. It has a large 6.6-inch screen. It uses the same 120 Hz ProMotion screen technology as the Pro models. It also has the same A19 Pro chip as the new Pro and Pro Max phones, which means it works better than the regular iPhone 17.</p>
            <p>All new Apple phones will start with 256GB of storage. The iPhone 17 starts at 799 US dollars (or 29,900 New Taiwan dollars). The iPhone 17 Pro starts at 1099 US dollars (or 39,900 New Taiwan dollars). The new iPhone Air starts at 999 US dollars (or 36,900 New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>You can pre-order all the new phones starting on September 12 at 8 PM, Taiwan time. They will officially be for sale on September 19.</p>
