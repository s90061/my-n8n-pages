            <h1>Data Center Demand is Strong, Taiwan's Ethernet Switch Market Expected to Grow by 15%</h1>
            <p>International Data Corporation (IDC) said today that the need for public cloud companies and large local businesses to build data centers in Taiwan is still high. Because of this, IDC expects the market for Ethernet switches in Taiwan to grow by 10% to 15% this year compared to last year.</p>
            <p>Ye Zhen-nan, a senior market analyst at IDC, pointed out that the results of trade talks between the United States and other countries make the global economy's future uncertain. However, public cloud services and AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications are clearly helping to increase sales of fast internet equipment in many countries, and Taiwan is also seeing this trend.</p>
            <p>IDC has noticed that this year, data centers in Taiwan will use faster 800G Ethernet switches. These are for training AI models or offering AI services. Also, local companies that make semiconductors and other high-tech products are growing their business around the world. This will lead to more investment in network equipment. Because of this, the network equipment market in Taiwan is expected to grow by 10% to 15% this year. From 2024 to 2029, the market is expected to grow by 5.8% each year on average.</p>
            <p>IDC looked at how well important companies sold products in Taiwan's network market in the first three months of the year. Cisco, a leading brand in network equipment, stayed number one in both the Ethernet switch market and the business router market. HPE-Aruba was the leader in the market for wireless access points for businesses. TP-Link is currently the top company for wireless routers used at home. F5 remained the leader in the market for ADC (Application Delivery Controller) products.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that in recent years, there has been a big increase in demand for generative AI applications. Because of this, public cloud and data center companies continued to buy more fast network switch equipment in the first three months of the year, especially 400G switches. Because of this trend, companies like Arista, Nvidia, and ODM-Direct, which focus on data center network switches, shipped many more products in the first three months. This was one of the main reasons why the Ethernet switch market grew by a double-digit percentage in the first quarter.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Zhujiecao Causes Many Flights to Shanghai to Be Canceled</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30th (CNA) - According to China's Central Meteorological Administration, Typhoon Zhujiecao landed on Zhujiajian Island in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, around 4:30 AM today. It is expected to make another landfall near the coast of Pudong's southern part or Fengxian in Shanghai around evening. Because of the typhoon, many flights from Taipei to Shanghai Pudong have been canceled or delayed today.</p>
            <p>According to various reports from Chinese media and China's Central Meteorological Administration, Typhoon Zhujiecao first landed on the coast of Zhujiajian Island in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, around 4:30 AM today. The Shanghai Meteorological Bureau said that after landing in the morning, the typhoon continued to move northwest. It might land a second time on Daishan Island in Zhoushan, and then land again around evening in the coastal area from southern Pudong to Fengxian.</p>
            <p>Due to the typhoon, Shanghai is experiencing strong winds and heavy rain today. The speed limit on all highways in the city has been lowered to 60 kilometers per hour. All city ferry services have stopped. Starting at 12:30 PM, trains on some parts of Shanghai Metro Line 2 in Pudong will run at a slower speed. All trains on Line 16 will also run at a slower speed. In addition, flight information shows that many flights from Taipei to Shanghai Pudong have been canceled or delayed today.</p>
            <p>On July 29th, the Pudong New Area of Shanghai began a "state of emergency." They are working hard to find and fix any dangers. They plan to move about 110,000 people to safer places. They also plan to open 116 places where people can stay together, and they expect to house 14,982 people there. On July 28th, relevant teams in the Pudong area also started to lower water levels and empty pipes to prepare. All 2,337 flood prevention and rescue teams in the area are ready to help if needed.</p>
            <p>Because of the typhoon, on July 29th, very heavy rain fell in areas like Zhoushan, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Jinhua in Zhejiang, and Nantong, Suzhou, Wuxi in Jiangsu, as well as Qingpu in Shanghai. Some parts of Ningbo had especially heavy rain. After Typhoon Zhujiecao landed in East China, the air currents guiding it were weak, which made it move slowly. As the typhoon continues to affect the area, places like Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will have rain for a long time, and the rain will be very heavy at times. It is important to be careful about the total amount of rain that falls.</p>
