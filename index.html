            <h1>Trump Hits Brand-Name Drugs, Furniture Hard: A Look at New US Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 25 â€” US President Donald Trump announced today that new taxes will be placed on many imported goods. This includes a 100% tax on brand-name medicines and a 25% tax on large trucks.</p>
            <p>Trump also said there will be a 50% tax on kitchen cabinets and bathroom sinks, and a 30% tax on soft furniture. All these new taxes will start on October 1st. Here is a summary from Reuters about Trump's new taxes.</p>
            <p>Are these new taxes for countries that already have trade deals with the US?</p>
            <p>The Trump government has trade deals with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom. These deals set limits on taxes for some products like cars, computer parts, and medicines. So, new taxes for national security reasons will mostly not go over these agreed limits.</p>
            <p>A statement from the White House in July said that the EU agreed to pay a 15% tax to the US for cars, car parts, medicines, and computer parts.</p>
            <p>A statement from the White House in early September about the trade deal with Japan said: "Special or combined tax rates should be the same as those for EU products."</p>
            <p>How will new taxes affect products from China to the US?</p>
            <p>The US and China agreed in August to stop new taxes for another 90 days. This stopped very high taxes on goods from both sides.</p>
            <p>According to the agreement, the US keeps a 30% tax on goods from China, and China keeps a 10% tax on goods from the US. This will last at least until November 10th.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear if these new US taxes will be added to the current taxes on Chinese goods, or if they will be separate. The White House has not answered questions about this.</p>
            <p>According to "Furniture Today," a magazine for the industry, the US imported about 25.5 billion dollars worth of furniture from other countries in 2024. About 60% of this furniture came from Vietnam and China.</p>
            <p>Will the Supreme Court's decision affect these new taxes?</p>
            <p>The US Supreme Court is now looking at whether Trump's big global taxes are legal. Because of this, the Trump government's new taxes are seen as a way to use a more legally sound power to put taxes, to lower risks.</p>
            <p>The Supreme Court agreed on September 9th to review the legality of Trump's global taxes. This will be a big test for Trump's power in economic and trade policies, which has caused much debate.</p>
            <p>The US Supreme Court will discuss this case on November 5th.</p>

            <h1>Free Flu and COVID-19 Vaccines for Hualien Guangfu Residents and Rescue Workers</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 26 â€” Typhoon Hagupit caused a lot of damage in Guangfu Township, Hualien County. Today, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that people living in Guangfu Township and rescue workers will get free flu and COVID-19 vaccines starting in October. About 12,000 people will get these vaccines. The central government will send vaccines quickly to help.</p>
            <p>The flu season has started. The Taiwan CDC announced in a press release that to keep people in the affected area healthy and to maintain healthcare services, flu and COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) vaccines, which start on October 1st this year, will also be given to all Guangfu Township residents, health center staff, and rescue workers. This includes about 12,000 people.</p>
            <p>CDC spokesperson Tseng Shu-hui told reporters that the flu is becoming more common in Taiwan. Guangfu Township has problems with transportation and getting medical care because of the disaster. If many people get sick in the community, it could make the local healthcare system and rescue efforts much harder.</p>
            <p>Regarding the vaccination schedule, Tseng Shu-hui explained that people in shelters will be vaccinated first, starting before October 1st. Other residents of Guangfu Township and rescue workers will start their vaccinations on October 1st, like everyone else in Taiwan. The CDC started sending vaccines yesterday and expects to send enough free vaccines by next Tuesday (September 30th). The Hualien County Health Bureau will use lists from the Social Affairs Department, Township Office, and Health Center to arrange the vaccinations.</p>
            <p>Tseng Shu-hui noted that the vaccines for this time were sent quickly by the central government. For the flu vaccines, about 200,000 doses from an existing agreement are being used. For COVID-19 vaccines, about 3 million doses were bought this year, and 2.5 million doses have already been given across Taiwan, so there are still enough vaccines.</p>
            <p>The CDC stressed that to protect health in the affected areas and keep medical services running, people who can get the vaccine should get it quickly as arranged by the health authorities. Also, if someone has flu-like symptoms, a doctor can give them free antiviral medicine for the flu. This helps to lower the risk of serious flu sickness and complications, making sure public health is safe.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi Approved to Reopen, Business Resumes on 27th</h1>
            <p>Taichung, September 26 â€” The Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store in Taichung has been closed since a gas explosion on February 13th. Today, the Taichung City Government announced that Shin Kong Mitsukoshi's request to reopen has been approved. The Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store, which has been closed for a long time, will open again tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government sent out a press release saying that the Shin Kong Mitsukoshi department store's Zhonggang store has finished its indoor renovations, changes in use, and repair work. Professional engineers checked and approved these changes, and a third-party organization also checked them. The Urban Development Bureau also asked a fourth professional organization to check each floor. After all this was done, according to the rules, the store sent all the necessary documents to the Urban Development Bureau on September 18th to ask to reopen.</p>
            <p>The city government said that after all relevant departments, including the Urban Development Bureau, Fire Department, and Economic Development Bureau, reviewed the application, they confirmed that it met all legal rules and procedures. So, today they allowed the store to reopen.</p>
            <p>Li Cheng-wei, the director of the Urban Development Bureau, explained that this reopening process followed the Building Act and the "Taichung City Regulations for Building Reopening and Water/Electricity Supply Review." In addition, six strict rules were set, which are even tougher than the law requires. These included making sure the entire building was repaired, not just the damaged parts, and checking the safety of all floors and doing overall repairs.</p>
            <p>The city government stated that all its departments followed the main idea of "public safety first, professional checking." They made sure the company followed the improvement plan strictly to prevent similar accidents from happening again. They also told all owners, users, and managers of similar department store buildings in Taichung City to make sure their buildings are used legally and that their structures and equipment are safe.</p>
            <p>After more than half a year of hard work, Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi finally got approval from the city government today to reopen. The company had already finished bringing in new goods to all floors yesterday. Now, the entire store is ready to open its doors again tomorrow.</p>
