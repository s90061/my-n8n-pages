<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506295001.aspx">https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506295001.aspx</a>

The 36th Golden Melody Awards were held on June 28th. Taiwanese singer Li Zhu-xin was the big winner, taking home three awards: Album of the Year, Best Taiwanese Female Singer, and Best Taiwanese Album for her work "SuÃ­." The album "AAA," a collaboration between Taiwanese and Korean musicians, also won three awards, including Best Music Video and Best Vocal Recording Album. Lu Shi-xuan won Best Male Mandarin Singer and Best Mandarin Album for "Good Voice, Grand Spirit," while Wei Ru-xuan won Best Female Mandarin Singer for the second time. The late singer Khalil Fong won an award for his song "Only Twenty-Three." Eric Lau, the mixing engineer for Fong's album "Dreamer," accepted the award and said that Fong's dedication to his music, even when he was not well, is an example for all musicians to follow.

On June 28, President Lai Ching-te, who is also the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), gave a speech at the party's national congress. He criticized the opposition parties for stopping the government from working and stopping the country from moving forward. He also spoke about China's threats and attacks. President Lai said that Taiwanese people are worried about the safety of their country, and so citizens have started a movement to recall some politicians. He stated that "the DPP must stand with the citizens and share the responsibility of protecting the country." Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu responded by saying that if President Lai insists on "walking with bad recalls," he will be walking with hate, division, and conflict, which is against the spirit of democracy. He urged people to vote "no to recall" to protect democracy. The DPP also passed new rules for choosing candidates for the 2026 city and county elections. Current leaders who want to run again will be chosen by the party chairman. For cities and counties where leaders have already served two terms, like Kaohsiung, Tainan, and Chiayi County, candidates will be chosen through a primary election.

Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim visited the Czech Republic in March 2024, before she officially became Vice President. It was later reported that Chinese diplomats followed her car during her visit, almost causing an accident. The Czech military intelligence agency confirmed that they saw Chinese intelligence trying to cause trouble for Hsiao Bi-khim. On June 28, Hsiao Bi-khim said that China's illegal actions will not scare her. She said she will continue to speak up for Taiwan's interests around the world and that Taiwan will not be scared into being alone.

The Vatican Apostolic Library, located in Vatican City, has 50-meter long bookshelves and contains 80,000 precious handwritten documents, 300,000 coins and medals, 150,000 historical photos, and 2 million old and new books. It is seen as a very important collection of human culture. The director, Mantovani, shared that they started a project about 15 years ago to make the collection digital. They have finished digitizing the handwritten documents and have started digitizing the printed books. He also mentioned that the exhibition they held in Taiwan in 2023 was a "wonderful and unique experience."

The "Gaza Humanitarian Aid Fund," supported by the United States and Israel, started operating aid stations in Gaza on May 26. Since then, there have been reports of Israeli soldiers shooting at people waiting for aid nearby. On June 27, the Israeli newspaper "Haaretz" reported that Israeli soldiers have admitted they were told to shoot at people in Gaza. Several human rights groups have asked for the Gaza Humanitarian Aid Fund's food distribution system to be stopped. US President Donald Trump said on June 27 that the situation in Gaza is bad, but he thinks that Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas might agree to a ceasefire next week.

In June, Australia opened the world's first climate visa for citizens of the South Pacific island nation of Tuvalu. Those who get the visa can live in Australia permanently, but there are only 280 spots each year. Because there are limited spots, a lottery system is used. By June 27, more than one-third of Tuvalu's citizens had applied to join the lottery. Tuvalu is only 5 meters above sea level and is one of the countries most threatened by climate change. Scientists from NASA predict that by 2050, most of Tuvalu's land will be under the sea when the tide is high. In 2022, Tuvalu had a population of 10,643 people.

The Central Weather Administration stated that, according to the latest global climate report for May from Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), May 2025 was the second hottest May on record. The global average temperature was 1.40 degrees Celsius higher than before industrial times. The NCEI also said that the 10 hottest Mays on record have all happened since 2014, and there is a more than 99% chance that 2025 will be one of the five hottest years ever recorded.

Xiao Wei, a Chinese spouse who had to leave Taiwan on April 1st because she supported "unification by force," had problems less than three months after returning to her hometown in Guizhou. She recently posted videos saying she was asking for compensation from her village committee. But then, she received a warning call from the police in the middle of the night, which scared her. She cried and asked, "Is there still justice?" All the videos Xiao Wei posted about her complaints and her live broadcasts have been deleted. Many internet users asked why the videos were gone, but they did not get a reply.

Luo Mao-xiang, who is 91 years old, still goes to his farm every day, no matter the weather, because he doesn't want to leave his land and his favorite rice, called "Ugly Beauty." He is the oldest member of the Farmers' Association in Chishang, Taitung, and was the last farmer in the Taitung Rift Valley to use traditional methods like plowing with oxen and harvesting by hand. But he has now switched to machines, so traditional ox plowing has disappeared in the Taitung Rift Valley. He shared that traditional farming by older farmers also created a sense of "social responsibility."

In the US Open badminton tournament, which is part of the World Badminton Federation Super 300 series, all four spots in the men's doubles semifinals were taken by Taiwanese pairs. These include Lai Po-yu and Tsai Fu-cheng, Chiang Chien-wei and Wu Xuan-yi, Chen Cheng-kuan and Lin Ping-wei, and Ho Chih-wei and Huang Rui-hsuan. This means that a Taiwanese men's doubles pair is guaranteed to win the US Open for the first time in 15 years, since Fang Chieh-min and Lee Sheng-mu won in 2010. In the women's doubles, Taiwanese pairs also took three spots in the semifinals. Chou Tien-chen and Liao Cho-fu both made it to the men's singles semifinals.

**Magnitude 5.5 Earthquake Hits Pakistan, 10 Kilometers Deep**
<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290016.aspx">https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290016.aspx</a>

A shallow earthquake hit central Pakistan today. The German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) said it was a magnitude 5.5 earthquake, while the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) measured it as 5.3.

Agence France-Presse reported that there have been no reports of injuries or damage so far.

The U.S. Geological Survey stated that the earthquake happened around 3:30 AM (6:30 AM Taiwan time). Its center was about 60 kilometers north-northeast of Barkhan, a city in Pakistan's mountainous Balochistan province.

When there are crises in this area, rescue efforts can be very difficult. In 2015, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit Pakistan and Afghanistan, killing almost 400 people. The rough land there made rescue work very hard.

Reuters, citing data from the German Research Centre for Geosciences, said that this earthquake was shallow, with a depth of only 10 kilometers.

**Mostly Cloudy to Sunny and Hot, Watch Out for Afternoon Thunderstorms**
<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290015.aspx">https://www.cna.com.tw/news/ahel/202506290015.aspx</a>

The Central Weather Administration said today that southern and eastern Taiwan will have occasional showers or thunderstorms. Other areas will be mostly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, there might be local, short thunderstorms in western Taiwan and other mountainous areas. The mountains in western Taiwan might even get heavy rain.

The Weather Administration warned that there will be more moisture around Taiwan today, so people should be aware of changes in the afternoon weather and carry an umbrella just in case.

The Weather Administration also said that the weather will be hot, with temperatures generally between 31 and 35 degrees Celsius across Taiwan. The greater Taipei area, as well as areas near the mountains in Changhua, Yunlin, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung, might have local temperatures above 36 degrees. The UV index will be strong around noon, so people should protect themselves from the sun and drink plenty of water to avoid heatstroke. The lowest temperatures across Taiwan will be around 25 to 27 degrees.

For the outlying islands, the Weather Administration said that Penghu will be sunny with some clouds, with temperatures between 27 and 32 degrees. Kinmen will be cloudy with sunny periods, with temperatures between 27 and 32 degrees. Matsu will be sunny with some clouds, with temperatures between 26 and 31 degrees.`;
