Many people worry about how much time we spend looking at screens, like phones and computers. There's a big discussion about whether too much screen time harms our mental health, especially for young people.

Scientists are still studying this, and the answer isn't simple. Some research suggests that a lot of screen time might be linked to problems like anxiety or depression. However, other studies don't find a strong connection. It often depends on how screens are used, what content people are watching, and who is using them. For example, actively creating something on a screen might be different from passively scrolling through social media.

Experts suggest that a healthy approach to screen time is important. Instead of just focusing on the amount of time, we should think about *how* screens fit into our lives. It's crucial to make sure we still get enough sleep, exercise, and real-life social interactions. Finding a good balance between digital activities and other parts of daily life is key for everyone's well-being.

**AI in the Workplace: A Promise Facing Human Challenges**

Many companies are excited about Artificial Intelligence (AI) and how it could make their businesses much more productive. They are spending a lot of money to bring AI tools into their daily operations, hoping to see big improvements in how quickly and efficiently tasks are done.

However, a major challenge is emerging: getting employees to actually use these new AI tools. Even though the technology is available, many workers are slow to adopt it. This can be for several reasons, including a lack of proper training, concerns about job security, or a general mistrust of new technology. Some employees worry that AI might replace their jobs or make their skills less important.

For AI to truly succeed in the workplace, businesses need to focus on their people. It's not enough to just buy the technology; companies must clearly explain the benefits to their staff, provide thorough training, and show how AI can help employees, rather than replace them. Building trust and making sure employees feel comfortable with AI will be key to unlocking its full potential.

**Venice Introduces Fee to Manage Day-Trippers**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started a new system where day-trippers must pay a fee to enter. This rule began as a trial in April 2024 and aims to help the city manage the large number of tourists, especially during busy periods.

Venice has been struggling with "overtourism" for many years. Too many visitors can put a strain on the city's infrastructure, damage its historic sites, and make daily life difficult for local residents. The new charge of 5 euros is designed to discourage people from visiting for just a few hours and instead encourage longer, more thoughtful trips.

Local residents and tourists who are staying overnight in Venice are exempt from the fee. The city government says the main goal is not to earn money, but to reduce congestion and protect the unique environment and culture of Venice. Many other popular tourist destinations around the world are watching this experiment closely, as they face similar challenges with managing visitor numbers.
