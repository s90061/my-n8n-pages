            <h1>Taichung Real Estate Boss Accused of NT$1 Billion Fraud, Caught After Fleeing Abroad</h1>
            <p>A man named Ye, who was in charge of a real estate company in Taichung, is accused of fraud and illegally taking money. Over five years, people lost a total of NT$1 billion. Mr. Ye left the country on September 20th. Prosecutors put out a notice to find him. This morning, Mr. Ye was caught when he came back to Taiwan, and prosecutors asked to keep him in custody without allowing him to see anyone.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung District Prosecutors Office announced that Mr. Ye, 42, was the boss of a real estate company in the Xitun area. From September 2020 to September this year, he was involved in fraud and illegal fundraising, causing losses of up to NT$1 billion. Mr. Ye ran away from Taiwan on September 20th.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors from the Taichung District Prosecutors Office created a special team. They talked to the victims and witnesses. They also collected proof like payment receipts, bank transfer records, and screenshots of conversations. On September 26th, Mr. Ye's passport was canceled, and a notice to find him was issued. This morning, September 28th, Mr. Ye returned to Taiwan from Thailand. Police arrested him at Taoyuan International Airport and brought him to the authorities.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the prosecutor decided that Mr. Ye committed serious crimes such as fraud and running an illegal banking business. These crimes could lead to at least 5 years in prison. Since he tried to escape and might hide evidence or talk to others involved, the prosecutor asked the Taichung District Court tonight to keep him in custody without allowing him to see anyone.</p>

            <h1>China and North Korea Foreign Ministers Meet in Beijing, Both Oppose Too Much Power and Acting Alone</h1>
            <p>According to Xinhua News Agency, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and North Korea's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui met today in Beijing. Wang Yi said that China wants to work more closely with North Korea on international and regional issues. They both oppose any country having too much power and want to protect their shared interests. Choe Son Hui said that North Korea wants to work closely with China in many ways to stop countries from acting alone and using their power unfairly.</p>
            <p>The report stated that during their meeting, the two also talked deeply about issues important to both China and North Korea.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi said that the traditional friendship between the two countries is a valuable shared asset. He added that "maintaining, strengthening, and developing" the relationship between China and North Korea is always a "firm strategy" of the Chinese Communist Party and government. In early September, Chinese President Xi Jinping and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had an important meeting and agreed on many things. This meeting "showed the direction and created a plan" for how their relationship should grow.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also said that China and North Korea are both socialist countries led by communist parties. They share "common beliefs and goals." He believes they can share ideas about how to govern their countries, which will help their socialist causes develop.</p>
            <p>He also stated that the world is currently facing many changes and problems. Stronger countries bullying others is causing serious harm. China is happy that North Korea strongly supports China's main interests and worries. North Korea also supports Xi Jinping's idea of "building a community with a shared future for mankind" and other plans like the "Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, Global Civilization Initiative, and Global Governance Initiative." China wants to work more with North Korea on international and regional matters to oppose any country having too much power, protect their shared interests, and promote "fairness and justice in the world."</p>
            <p>According to the report, Choe Son Hui said that the meetings between the top leaders of the two parties and countries, North Korea and China, have given strong guidance and energy for making their "socialist-focused" relationship even stronger.</p>
            <p>Choe Son Hui also mentioned that Kim Jong Un once said that no matter how the world changes, the friendly feelings between the people of North Korea and China will not change. She said that continuously making their relationship deeper and stronger is North Korea's firm goal. North Korea wants to work with China to carry out the agreements made by their top leaders. This includes "improving talking about strategies, increasing friendly visits, and making practical cooperation deeper" to move their relationship to a new, higher level.</p>
            <p>She also said that North Korea strongly supports Xi Jinping's idea of a "community with a shared future for mankind" and other global plans, especially the newest "Global Governance Initiative." She added that North Korea wants to work closely with China in many ways to stop countries from acting alone and using power unfairly, and to help create a "more fair and just world order."</p>

            <h1>Central Broadcasting System's Website Hacked, Issues Statement to Fight Illegal Actions</h1>
            <p>The official website of the Central Broadcasting System (CBS) was recently attacked by unknown people. The main picture on its website was changed to something bad. Because of this, CBS quickly gave information to the police and prosecutors. They asked for an investigation to start and said they will work with the legal process to stop these illegal acts.</p>
            <p>On September 11th, CBS found that its official website had been hacked by unknown people. The main picture on the homepage (banner) was changed to something bad. CBS immediately sent the evidence to the Taipei City Police Department, which is in its area. They also reported it to the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau, with whom they have a security agreement, asking for technical help and an investigation.</p>
            <p>Today, to protect its reputation and prevent misunderstandings, CBS quickly released a statement. It said that according to its official duties and ways of working, it actively supports government policies. CBS promotes Taiwan's main values like freedom, democracy, human rights, and different cultures. It is the most important platform for Taiwan to speak to the world. However, it has become a target for people who want to cause trouble. In recent years, CBS has spent a lot of human and money resources to prevent and find such attacks. They will not allow anyone to attack their site.</p>
            <p>Based on the information CBS provided, the police and prosecutors have called people involved to come in for questioning. They are continuing to investigate these illegal acts that harm national security and communication security. This is to make sure that the country's important digital systems are protected.</p>
            <p>The case is now under investigation. CBS is waiting for the results of the investigation and will share updates when it's appropriate. They will definitely keep strongly watching their information security and work with the police and investigators. This is to prevent future problems and ask for severe punishment for those who damage the country's communication and broadcasting security.</p>
