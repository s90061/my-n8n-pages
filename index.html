            <h1>School Year Starting: Pingtung Police Warn University Students, "Your Diploma Should Not Be Paid For With a Car Accident"</h1>
            <p>The new school year is about to begin. The Pingtung police have seen over 3,600 traffic accidents involving university students from January to August this year. To help, the police have released a video about safe riding called "Your Diploma Should Not Be Paid For With a Car Accident." It uses real accident videos to teach students how to drive safely.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Police Bureau reported that from January to August this year, there were 3,650 road accidents involving university students aged 18 to 22. These accidents caused 2,147 injuries or deaths. Compared to the same time last year, the number of accidents went down by 549, and the number of injuries and deaths went down by 392. Overall, the numbers are getting lower, but there are still many accidents.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Police Bureau said in a press release today that many new university students are riding motorcycles for the first time. They may not have enough driving experience, might not know the roads well, or don't know about defensive driving. These things often lead to accidents. To make university students aware of the dangers of riding, the police made the video "Your Diploma Should Not Be Paid For With a Car Accident." It uses real accident scenes and strong words to help students learn safe driving ideas.</p>
            <p>The video says, "If you don't yield to a car going straight when turning, it's not just against the rules, it can also kill you." It also says, "Wait three more seconds, and you can be safe for life." These lively phrases remind young riders that "speed does not guarantee safety. Going fast doesn't mean you will arrive safely; going slowly gives you a chance to arrive safely."</p>
            <p>The police looked at common reasons for accidents. These include not keeping a safe distance from other vehicles, turning vehicles not yielding to straight-going vehicles, driving while distracted, and running red lights. This shows that many students have not fully learned safe driving habits after getting their driver's licenses.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung police said they will continue to catch people who drive without a license, drive dangerously, speed, and run red lights. This is to keep students safe and maintain good traffic order around schools.</p>

            <h1>Department of Defense May Be Renamed Department of War; White House Looks for Ways to Do What Trump Wants</h1>
            <p>After US President Trump asked for the Department of Defense to be renamed the Department of War, his team is actively working on plans to make this happen. The Wall Street Journal reported that White House officials said Congress might need to approve this. However, the White House is looking for other ways to make this plan real.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense is the biggest department in the US government. Reuters reported that Greg Steube, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Florida, has added a change to the yearly defense policy bill. This shows that some Republican members of Congress support Trump's idea.</p>
            <p>Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the White House, said, "As President Trump said, our military should focus on attacking, not just defending. This is why the President prioritizes soldiers at the Pentagon, not policies about diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI), or 'woke' ideas. Please stay tuned!"</p>
            <p>Trump has often suggested this idea since he became president. On August 25th, he said, "When it was called the Department of War, we won all wars. We won everything."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump said the old name "sounds stronger" when he met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung in the Oval Office that day. He also said the change would be done in "about a week." Trump was talking about wars the US fought before World War II ended and before the Department of Defense was created.</p>
            <p>A former official said that the Pentagon started preparing legal proposals for this change in the first few weeks of Trump's second term as president. One idea was to ask Congress for permission to use the old name during a national emergency. Also, the highest civilian official of the Department of Defense would once again be called "Secretary of War."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the White House did not share the details of this plan. However, they stressed what Trump said this week about the US military's ability to attack.</p>
            <p>The US Department of War slowly became the Department of Defense after a series of changes. This change started with the National Security Act passed in 1947. This law combined the Army, Navy, and Air Force into one group called the "National Military Establishment."</p>
            <p>An amendment passed in 1949 officially used the name "Department of Defense" and created the current organizational structure.</p>
            <p>While Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth work to make the US military look stronger, they are also pushing for other changes. This includes removing many high-ranking military officers who did not agree with Trump.</p>
            <p>Also, the Trump government tried to stop transgender people from joining the military and wanted transgender soldiers currently serving to leave. The Pentagon said that transgender people are not fit to serve. However, civil rights activists argued that this is not true and is illegal discrimination.</p>
