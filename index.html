            <h1>Trump Keeps 10% Tariff on Australia; Canberra Says Goods Will Be More Competitive in US</h1>
            <p>Australia's Trade Minister, Don Farrell, said today that the White House has confirmed that no country has lower matching tariffs than Australia. This means that US President Trump will keep the 10% basic tariff on Australian goods.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that after Trump kept the 10% lowest tariff rate on Australia, Farrell said that Australian products might become more competitive in the US market. This will help businesses sell more goods.</p>
            <p>Trump is raising import tariffs on 69 trade partners. The new tariffs will range from 10% to 41% and will start in 7 days. For example, many Canadian goods will have a 35% tariff, Brazilian goods will have a 50% tariff, and New Zealand, Australia's neighbor in the South Pacific, will have a 15% tariff.</p>
            <p>Farrell told reporters, "This decision, along with all the tariff changes for other countries, means that Australian products are now more competitive in the US market."</p>
            <p>"We will help all our exporters use this chance to send more goods overseas."</p>
            <p>Farrell's spokesperson said in a statement, "Even though we are in the best position under the new US tariff system, we will continue to ask for all tariffs to be removed completely, as agreed in free trade agreements."</p>
            <p>Australia is one of the few countries with which the US often has a trade surplus. Australian officials often point this out during trade talks with US officials.</p>
            <p>Data from the U.S. Trade Representative's Office shows that in 2024, the US had a trade surplus of 17.9 billion US dollars with Australia. This was 1.6% more than in 2023.</p>
            <p>Last week, Australia made it easier to import US beef. This might help Australia's trade talks with Trump go more smoothly. However, Australian Prime Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that this decision had been thought about for a long time and was not connected to any trade talks.</p>
            <p>The US tariff on New Zealand, Australia's neighbor, has gone up from 10% (announced in April) to 15%.</p>
            <p>New Zealand's Trade Minister, Todd McClay, said in an interview with Radio New Zealand, "The first step is to talk directly with them, and we have had many discussions. In fact, these talks have been very helpful."</p>

            <h1>Expanding in Northeast Asia: Co-op Bank Gets Approval to Open Tokyo Branch</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 1 (CNA) Co-op Financial Holding announced today that its Co-op Bank's Tokyo branch received approval from Japan's Financial Services Agency on July 31. This is to grow its financial business in Asia-Pacific and strengthen its presence in the region. The Tokyo branch is expected to officially open in the fourth quarter of 2025. It will be the bank's first branch in Japan and its 27th location overseas.</p>
            <p>Co-op Bank explained that Japan is an important international financial center in the world. It has many famous trading companies and businesses and is also a main place for raising money. The Tokyo branch will be a key center for the bank to develop its business in Northeast Asia. It will also help the bank use new business chances in Japan as global supply chains become more local. This will help businesses build a strong financial base there.</p>
            <p>Co-op Bank said that its overseas locations are in four large areas: Europe, America, Asia, and Australia. The bank continues to add new offices to complete its global plan. It follows the strategy of "global reach, regional management, and local roots." This means it provides financial services to Taiwanese businesses nearby and uses its professional experience to help local businesses grow. Following the idea of "giving back to the community," it offers professional and stable financial services to local customers.</p>

            <h1>Trump Pushes White House Renovation Project; Will Build 200 Million Dollar Ballroom</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 31 (CNA) White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said today that US President Trump is moving forward with a project to renovate the White House. He also plans to build a ballroom there.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Leavitt stated the 200 million US dollar (about 6 billion New Taiwan dollars) cost for the ballroom will be paid for by Trump himself and other donors who wish to remain unnamed.</p>
            <p>Leavitt said, "For 150 years, presidents, government officials, and White House staff have wanted a large space for events on the White House grounds."</p>
            <p>Leavitt said that the ballroom, which can hold 650 people, is expected to start being built in September. It should be finished before Trump's current term ends.</p>
            <p>The ballroom is being built to host important events for visiting leaders from other countries. Currently, these events sometimes have to be held in tents on the White House lawn.</p>
            <p>According to the model of the ballroom released by the US government, the building will be white and have columns. Its appearance will look like the main White House building. It will replace the East Wing, which is usually the office space for the US First Lady.</p>
