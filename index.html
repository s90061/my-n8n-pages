            <h1>Three Students' Parents Must Pay NT$61,800 Because They Put Plant Juice in a Classmate's Water Bottle</h1>
            <p>Three girls from a primary school in central Taiwan had problems with a boy in their class. Two years ago, they put golden pothos plant juice in the boy's water bottle. This made him feel sick and he had to go to the hospital. The boy's parents sued for money. The Taichung court recently decided that the parents of the three girls must pay a total of NT$61,800.</p>
            <p>The court documents from the Taichung District Court explain that one boy from a primary school in central Taiwan was classmates with three girls. In April 2023, the three girls were unhappy with what the boy said and did. So, they dropped golden pothos plant juice into his water bottle. The boy drank it by mistake and had problems like vomiting, diarrhea, and a numb mouth.</p>
            <p>In May of the same year, the three girls tried to put the plant juice into the boy's water bottle again. But other classmates saw them and stopped them. A few days later, the boy saw what looked like golden pothos plant juice near one of the girls' desks. He told a teacher, and this helped to show what had happened.</p>
            <p>The boy's parents sued the parents of the three girls. They asked for NT$15,080 for hospital costs and NT$1,000,000 for emotional damage, making a total of NT$1,015,080.</p>
            <p>After looking at the case, the Taichung District Court thought about the families' backgrounds, their financial situations, and how much harm was caused. The court decided that the parents of the three girls should pay NT$11,800 for hospital costs and NT$50,000 for emotional damage. This makes a total of NT$61,800. The families can still appeal this decision.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says White House Will Host UFC Fight on His 80th Birthday Next Year</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 5 (CNA) ‚Äì U.S. President Trump announced today that the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) event, which was planned for the White House, is now set for June 14 next year. This date is also his 80th birthday.</p>
            <p>Trump shared this news at Naval Station Norfolk. He was speaking to celebrate the U.S. Navy's upcoming 250th anniversary.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump had said that a UFC event would happen at the White House in 2026. But he did not give an exact date at that time.</p>
            <p>Trump and UFC President Dana White are very good friends. Their friendship started even before Trump became president. Trump sees fans of combat sports as important supporters for him in politics.</p>
            <p>This week, White told "Sports Business Journal" that after the event, UFC will spend 700,000 U.S. dollars to put new grass on the South Lawn of the White House.</p>
            <p>Since becoming president, Trump has often attended UFC events. His most recent visit was in June, at a fight in New Jersey. Trump and White's friendship goes back to the year 2000. At that time, Trump Taj Mahal Hotel in Atlantic City was one of the few places in the U.S. that would host UFC events.</p>
            <p>TKO Group Holdings, the company that owns the UFC, has not yet responded to Reuters' request for comments.</p>

            <p>The National Palace Museum also said that its 100th-anniversary theme is "Palace Museum 100+." This means the museum is moving forward from 100 years to a new century. Besides the exciting special exhibitions, there will also be an event to collect old photos of the Palace Museum, special products for the 100th anniversary, and anniversary books like "Continued Record of Important Palace Museum Events" and "Palace Museum Times ‚Äì News Highlights."
