            <h1>Central and Local Governments Work Together to Protect Penghu's Ocean Resources</h1>
            <p>On August 5th, the head of the Ocean Council, Kuan Pi-ling, said in Penghu that the lives of Penghu people are closely connected to the ocean. The ocean gives a lot to them, and its value is very important. The central government and the local government are working together. This shows their strong will to protect the ocean's natural wealth.</p>
            <p>Kuan Pi-ling arrived in Penghu today and met with County Head Chen Kuang-fu in the afternoon. They talked a lot about protecting the ocean, keeping the ocean environment clean, making sure the sea is safe, and keeping sea life healthy for a long time. This meeting showed that the central and local governments are working hand in hand to protect the ocean's resources.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuang-fu explained that Penghu is surrounded by sea and has amazing ocean resources. For example, the Taiwan Shoal is about 8800 square kilometers large. The ocean is not just where Penghu people live and work; it is also key for tourism and managing things in a way that helps the environment for the future. He thanked the Ocean Council for its long-term help to Penghu. This help includes checking water quality, protecting sea turtles, helping corals and other sea animals live well again, planting seagrass, and teaching people about the ocean. All this has greatly improved Penghu's ability to manage its ocean areas.</p>
            <p>Kuan Pi-ling said that the ocean gives us a lot, and we should not forget how important it is. The lives of Penghu people depend on the ocean. She praised Penghu's efforts and good results in beach cleaning, removing trash from the ocean, and other protection work. However, she noted that the central government's budget will change next year because of a new finance law. She hopes that local governments can keep putting more effort into ocean matters. The central government will also keep giving the necessary help and resources. Together, they will work towards the goal of a healthy ocean for the future.</p>

            <h1>Sung Sheng-jui "Warns" Teammates Before Hitting Home Run, Thanks Coach for Opportunity</h1>
            <p>TAIPEI â€“ On August 5th, Sung Sheng-jui, a player for the CTBC Brothers baseball team, hit a home run while playing as a substitute on August 3rd. He said that before the game, he joked with his teammates. He told them if he went onto the field and did not hit a home run, it would be because he had done weight training. He has been playing very well recently, hitting 4 home runs in his last 6 games. He thanked his head coach for giving him chances even when he was not playing well. This helped him learn and grow from his mistakes.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui of the CTBC Brothers team has been playing extremely well recently. From July 27th to 30th, he hit home runs in three games in a row. On August 3rd, in a game against the Rakuten Monkeys, he did not start. But he came into the game in the 6th inning to play defense. In the bottom of the 7th inning, he hit a solo home run. This was his 8th home run this season.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Sung Sheng-jui spoke to reporters. He started by saying he wanted to "tell something funny." He said that on August 3rd, he knew he would not start the game, so he went to the weight training room. His coach even asked him, "You have a game today, why are you doing weights?" Sung Sheng-jui said he was warming up. He also "warned" his teammates before, saying that if he came into the game later and did not hit a home run, he would have a reason: it was because of the weight training.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui also mentioned that at the beginning of July, he was not playing well. He did not know what the problem was. Wang Wei-chen and Chiang Kun-yu helped him by watching and seeing if anything was different from before. He kept trying, and now his playing is getting better and better.</p>
            <p>Including today's game, Sung Sheng-jui has played in all 77 games this season. He said that adjusting to playing every day is still a bit hard for him. But he tells himself to keep going. He also thanked head coach Hiraoka Keiichi for giving him chances to start even when he was not playing well before. By going through failures, he learned from them and now knows how to adjust better.</p>
            <p>When talking about how this season is different, Sung Sheng-jui said that he planned to gain weight during the break between seasons. He also worked with a trainer and learned a lot at a training center in the United States. He said understanding and using what he learned has helped him a lot. His mindset is also different. He thinks positively and finds the problems. He does not think too much about a few failures. He faces each time at bat with a steady mind.</p>
            <p>Hiraoka Keiichi once said that Sung Sheng-jui was his first choice for the leadoff batter (the first batter in the lineup). Sung Sheng-jui also said that he really hopes he can do this job well. But this year, his ability to choose which pitches to swing at is not very good yet. He hopes he can quickly make his "plate discipline" (choosing pitches to hit) much better.</p>

            <h1>Foreign Investors Buy More Stocks for 2nd Day, Focus on Server Companies</h1>
            <p>TAIPEI â€“ On August 5th, the Taiwan stock market went up by 281.65 points, closing at 23660.59 points. Foreign investors bought more stocks than they sold, by 11.488 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is the second day in a row that they have bought more stocks than they sold. They mainly bought stocks of companies that make servers.</p>
            <p>Wistron was the most popular, with foreign investors buying 20,800 shares. Inventec and Hon Hai also saw many shares bought, with 19,200 shares and 13,300 shares bought, respectively.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan stock market strongly went up by more than 200 points. Electronic stocks led the increase. Companies that make cooling systems and robots, as well as smaller companies, also received a lot of money from investors. In the end, the main index closed at 23660.59 points, up by 281.65 points, which is a 1.2% increase. It stayed above all the moving average lines. The total money traded was 367.844 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Self-traders bought 4.525 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of stocks today. Investment funds bought 3.982 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of stocks. Foreign investors bought 11.488 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of stocks. Together, these three groups bought a total of 19.995 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of stocks.</p>
            <p>Looking at the list of stocks foreign investors bought the most, the top 10 were Wistron (20,800 shares), Taiwan Business Bank (20,400 shares), Inventec (19,200 shares), Hon Hai (13,300 shares), Innolux (13,300 shares), Yuanta Taiwan Dividend High Yield ETF (0056) (12,300 shares), Quanta (12,100 shares), Asia Air Survey (8,058 shares), Capital TAIWAN High Dividend ETF (00919) (7,914 shares), and AUO (7,740 shares).</p>
            <p>Investment funds bought many financial stocks. Their top 10 purchases included CTBC Financial, First Financial, Taishin Financial, Mega Financial, Cathay Financial, E.SUN Financial, Fubon Financial, Inventec, Yuanta Financial, and E.SUN Financial.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-han, a manager at Cathay Securities, said that bad news about the US economy last Friday caused US stocks to fall a lot. But after thinking about it, the market saw the weaker economic news as a good thing because it means there is a higher chance that interest rates will be lowered. This made US stocks go up, and Taiwan stocks followed.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-han explained that today's rise in Taiwan stocks was mainly led by electronic companies. Also, because the risk in the market is lower, smaller companies and the stock index for over-the-counter stocks also went up to catch up. This shows that the market is still in an upward trend. He also noted that even though the results of the MSCI index changes will be announced next week, these changes will only start at the end of the month. So, they will not have a big effect on the stock index in the short term.</p>
