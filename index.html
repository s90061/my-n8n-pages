            <h1>White Party Criticizes Withdrawal of Post-Disaster Reconstruction Report; Kuo Kuo-wen: Executive Yuan Will Propose Special Act</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused great damage in southern Taiwan. Legislator Kuo Kuo-wen from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and others suggested that the Premier of the Executive Yuan should come to the Legislative Yuan to report on disaster reconstruction. But today, Kuo Kuo-wen decided to take back his suggestion. The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) criticized this. They said it's either because the reconstruction is too slow, or because the tariffs between Taiwan and the US are already decided, and the government is afraid to deal with it.</p>
            <p>DPP Legislator Kuo Kuo-wen said he withdrew the suggestion because the Executive Yuan will present a special law this week. He also criticized the TPP for not doing their homework and thinking they found something important, calling it embarrassing.</p>
            <p>DPP Legislators Kuo Kuo-wen and Lin Chun-hsien had suggested that because Typhoon Danas greatly damaged the south, the Legislative Yuan should invite the Premier and other government leaders to report on disaster reconstruction and answer questions. The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met today to decide the agenda for the meeting on the 9th. The TPP wanted Kuo Kuo-wen's suggestion to be the third item for discussion. But a staff member announced that Kuo Kuo-wen had already withdrawn his suggestion. This surprised the KMT and TPP legislators who were there.</p>
            <p>After the Procedure Committee meeting, Chen Chih-han, the head of the TPP, wrote on Facebook. She said that yesterday, Kuo Kuo-wen, Lin Chun-hsien, and 17 other legislators had suggested that the Premier should come to the Legislative Yuan to report on disaster recovery in Tainan and Chiayi, which were badly hit by the typhoon and heavy rain. The TPP agreed with this idea. So, this morning, they decided in their party meeting to put this suggestion among the top three items.</p>
            <p>Chen Chih-han said that when the Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee met today to discuss the meeting agenda, the staff announced that Kuo Kuo-wen and Lin Chun-hsien had withdrawn their suggestion. She thought there could be three reasons. First, the reconstruction after Typhoon Danas is slow, and the government's coordination is not working well. Premier Cho Jung-tai's report would look bad, so the Executive Yuan asked their party members to withdraw the suggestion. Second, the 20% tariffs from the US on Taiwan are not temporary but "fixed." The Lai government is afraid to face it, so they want Cho Jung-tai to avoid the discussion. The third possibility is that all of the above are true.</p>
            <p>In response, Kuo Kuo-wen said on Threads that the TPP, which claims to care most about the "Special Act for Post-Disaster Reconstruction," did not know that the Executive Yuan would propose it this week. He added that when the special budget is proposed later, Cho Jung-tai will have to answer questions.</p>
            <p>Kuo Kuo-wen stated that the TPP is again trying to confuse people and even questioned why he suggested something and then withdrew it. But the reason is simple: the Executive Yuan will propose the special act this week. After this special act passes, when the Executive Yuan proposes a special budget, Cho Jung-tai will have to answer questions in the Legislative Yuan. He does not need to answer questions on the same topic twice, so he withdrew his suggestion.</p>
            <p>Kuo Kuo-wen criticized this, saying it is how the Legislative Yuan normally works. He said Chen Chih-han did not do her homework and thought she found something important, adding, "Honestly, it's very embarrassing."</p>

            <h1>NTUT Student Racing Team Fastest to Complete Endurance Race, Wins FST Taiwan Cup Championship</h1>
            <p>The National Taipei University of Technology (NTUT) student racing team joined the 5th FST Taiwan Cup Student Formula League. Even with strong winds and rain, their 8th generation electric race car set the fastest lap time of 1 minute and 12 seconds. They were also the first team to finish the 30-lap endurance race. Because of this, they won first place for the year.</p>
            <p>National Taipei University of Technology announced today that their student racing team started in 2014. In 2019, they made their first electric race car and built Taiwan's first student formula car with a single-piece body. Last year, their 8th generation electric race car won the "Best Car Inspection Award" at the Australian Student Formula competition. They also ranked 6th in energy efficiency, 8th in figure-eight driving, and 10th in lap time. They were the first Taiwanese team to finish the race in Australia, and their team is now among the top 100 in the world.</p>
            <p>The NTUT racing team said that the 8th generation car was designed to finish races reliably. Its body uses a special carbon fiber process called RTM, and it has improved parts to help with air flow. For power, they made many improvements and used a data recorder to check the car's performance. This helped them make the car's settings and race plan better. For the car's base, they used a "Heave-Roll" suspension design. This allows them to change how the car moves up and down and how it leans sideways separately.</p>
            <p>The NTUT student racing team recently took part in the 5th FST Taiwan Cup Student Formula League. Before the race, the team members practiced the car inspection process many times to make sure they knew the rules very well. On the day of the race, they were the fastest to pass the rain and brake tests, and they were the first team to enter the moving car part of the race.</p>
            <p>On the final day of the race, the rain became heavier for a while, and the track became slippery. But the NTUT student racing team still raced carefully and finished the endurance race. They were the first team ever to complete the 30-lap endurance race. They also won their team's first FST Taiwan Cup championship.</p>
            <p>Chiang Hsin-han, one of the advising teachers for the NTUT racing team, said that the team's great results were not by chance. To find the key to winning with electric race cars, the team members worked very hard on new designs and building methods. They also gave up sleep and holidays to test and adjust the car many times, making its performance better. They overcame every challenge, whether it was trying to make very light and efficient designs in eco-friendly car competitions, or dealing with a typhoon and changing race locations during the FST competition.</p>

A 65-year-old woman named Chen, who lived on the 9th floor, was found clearly dead. Four other people were sent to the hospital because they breathed in smoke. The fire department will investigate to find out how much damage was caused and what started the fire.</p>
