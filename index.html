            <h1>Los Angeles: Car Hits Crowd, 30 Injured; Driver Attacked</h1>
            <p>Los Angeles, July 19th â€“ Local officials in Los Angeles, California, reported that a car hit a group of people outside a nightclub in Hollywood this morning. At least 30 people were hurt. The driver was then pulled from the car and beaten by people before being arrested by the police.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is still looking into what caused the incident. They are also trying to find a person who shot the driver during the confusion after the crash. The driver was shot but did not die.</p>
            <p>Lillian Carranza from the LAPD told CBS that the driver "is in stable condition after having surgery at the hospital. However, he cannot leave. He has been taken into custody by the LAPD. Police are now thinking about charges such as attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon."</p>
            <p>After the event, more than 100 firefighters came to the scene in East Hollywood, Los Angeles. 23 people were taken to the hospital, and 7 of them were in very serious condition.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) stated that 6 other people taken to the hospital had serious injuries, and 10 were in fair condition. They also said that 7 people were treated at the scene of the accident.</p>
            <p>Videos taken after the event showed people running in fear outside the nightclub. Victims lay on the ground, which was covered in blood, and people nearby were crying.</p>
            <p>Videos shared on social media showed the driver, thought to be in a Nissan Versa sedan, being pulled out of the car. His hands were tied, and people hit and kicked him very hard.</p>
            <p>The LAPD released a statement saying, "When officers arrived, they found the driver being beaten by people nearby and realized he had been shot."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that the person who supposedly fired the gun ran away from the scene on foot.</p>
            <p>Firefighters said that many people were waiting in line to enter the nightclub at the time of the event. The car not only hit the crowd but also crashed into a Mexican food truck and a valet stand. (Translator: Cai Jiamin / Editor: Hong Peiying) 1140720</p>

            <h1>Vietnam: Boat Capsizes in Ha Long Bay, 34 Dead Due to Storm</h1>
            <p>Hanoi, July 19th â€“ Vietnamese media reported that a tour boat carrying many families overturned this afternoon in Ha Long Bay. A strong storm hit the area, causing at least 34 deaths. Rescue workers are still urgently searching for people who are missing.</p>
            <p>VNExpress reported that the boat had 48 passengers and 5 crew members. A sudden heavy rainstorm caused it to overturn in Ha Long Bay, which is a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
            <p>The report said that most of the people on the boat were families from the capital city, Hanoi, including more than 20 children.</p>
            <p>The report stated: "Border protection officers saved 11 people and found 34 bodies."</p>
            <p>Rescue work continued through the night to find 8 people who were still missing.</p>
            <p>Tran Trong Hung, an official from the Ha Long Bay office, told AFP that the storm started in the afternoon. "The sky began to get dark around 2 PM (3 PM Taiwan time)," he said.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that "hail as big as toes fell, along with heavy rain, thunder, and lightning."</p>
            <p>A 10-year-old boy who was rescued told the state media VietNamNet: "I took a deep breath, swam through a broken part of the boat, went underwater, and then came up again. I even shouted for help, and then soldiers pulled me onto a boat."</p>
            <p>A statement on the government's official website said that officials will "investigate and find out the cause of the event, and will punish any illegal actions strongly."</p>
            <p>VNExpress quoted Mai Van Khiem, the head of the National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting. He said that this storm in northern Vietnam was not caused by the mild Typhoon Wipha in the South China Sea. (Translator: Cai Jiamin / Editor: Hong Peiying) 1140720</p>

            <h1>Japan Election: Ishiba Campaigns, Sanseito Party Gathers 20,000</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, July 20th â€“ Japan's Upper House election is being held today. Yesterday evening, all political parties made their final efforts. Shigeru Ishiba, the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Prime Minister, campaigned for votes in front of JR Kamata Station in Tokyo. The Sanseito Party, which has been gaining popularity recently, gathered about 20,000 supporters in Shiba Park. They feel very sure they will win many seats, possibly more than ten.</p>
            <p>Ishiba campaigned with candidates for the Tokyo area, including Daichi Suzuki, former head of the Japan Sports Agency, and Keizo Takemi, former Minister of Health, Labor and Welfare. He said he would "fight with all his heart until the end" for people who are truly struggling and for Japan's future. He also responded to criticisms about the LDP's plan to give 20,000 Japanese yen (about 4,000 New Taiwan dollars) in cash to everyone.</p>
            <p>Ishiba also criticized the opposition parties' ideas, such as getting rid of the consumption tax or lowering taxes. He said "politics must be responsible." He strongly stated that "if politics only cares about short-term gains and is selfish, the country will collapse."</p>
            <p>He stressed, "We must protect this country. It's easy to say 'cut the consumption tax in half' or 'get rid of it.' But the consumption tax pays for healthcare, elder care, and child care. Saying you'll carelessly get rid of it or cut it in half is very irresponsible and cannot be called a proper policy." He strongly criticized the opposition parties.</p>
            <p>This was Ishiba's first public speech on the streets of Tokyo during this election campaign. The area in front of the station was extremely crowded, and many people cheered "Ganbare" (Go for it!).</p>
            <p>However, the ruling group of the LDP and Komeito Party is not doing well in the election. To keep their majority in the Upper House, the two parties need to win 50 seats in this election. But the latest surveys before the election suggest that both parties together might get fewer than 40 seats. This means the ruling group might lose its majority in the Upper House, and Ishiba could be held responsible for this.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Sanseito Party held its final campaign event in Shiba Park, which has a view of Tokyo Tower. The grass was full of supporters, showing how much their popularity has grown recently.</p>
            <p>However, because of the Sanseito Party's far-right political views, many protesters also came. They held signs that said "Sanseito OUT," "No Sanseito Nazis," and "I FIGHT RACISM," and they booed when candidates spoke.</p>
            <p>Volunteers at the event tried to stop supporters and protesters from fighting. They held signs saying, "Supporters, please stay calm and do not react to disruptions," and they stood between the two groups to keep them apart.</p>
            <p>Sohei Kamiya, the leader of the Sanseito Party, gave a speech. He said, "Our country's strength is slowly decreasing. Let's stand against the big wave of globalization and build a world where everyone can truly live without worries." The crowd cheered loudly.</p>
            <p>Kamiya also announced that 20,000 people had gathered at the event. He said, "I never thought our support would grow so quickly. When the election campaign began, we only hoped to get 6 people elected. But now some people say it might be more than 6, maybe more than 10, or even 12, 13, or 15 people."</p>
            <p>Kamiya spoke with irony about people who criticize his party. He said, "If you didn't attack us so strongly, we wouldn't have become popular so fast. We became popular because people criticized us."</p>
            <p>Regarding the Sanseito Party getting a lot of attention from the media, he pointed out, "Now, if I say just one wrong thing, it becomes news. Even if I don't say anything wrong, I get criticized. If I drop a chopstick, it becomes news. This is how strong the Sanseito Party is now." The crowd cheered again.</p>
            <p>About the Sanseito Party's main idea of "Japanese first," Kamiya explained, "We are not criticizing or treating foreigners badly. Instead, we are giving our thoughts on globalization."</p>
            <p>He mentioned that Japan's economy is currently weak, its population is getting smaller, and its national power is slowly going down. Foreign money and foreign workers are being used to fill these gaps. The ruling LDP and Komeito Party, as well as the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party, all support this approach.</p>
            <p>Kamiya shouted: "But we, the Sanseito Party, say this is not right! Japan is the 4th largest economy in the world, with 120 million people. Why do we need to depend on foreign money? Why should we give up on solving the problem of fewer births and instead work hard to bring in more foreigners? This is the wrong order!"</p>
            <p>He asked for support: "Please, government, listen to what the people are saying. Japan has land, valuable things, and great possibilities. It should use them well to make the country rich and give hope to young people so they want to get married and have children. Isn't it because the government cannot do these simple, basic things that everyone feels worried? Making citizens feel safeâ€”isn't that the job of a member of parliament?" Kamiya's words made his supporters very excited. (Editors: Hong Peiying) 1140720</p>
