            <h1>Government Passes Law to Increase Employer Responsibility for Workplace Accidents and Prevent Bullying</h1>
            <p>To better protect workers, the Executive Yuan today passed new changes to the Occupational Safety and Health Act. These changes will add a new section called "Workplace Bullying Prevention" and clearly define what workplace bullying is. The new law also increases the penalties for employers if there are fatal accidents or accidents where three or more people are hurt. For fatal accidents, employers could face fines up to NT$1.5 million and up to 5 years in prison.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan today approved the draft changes to the Occupational Safety and Health Act, proposed by the Ministry of Labor. These changes will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review. This is the biggest set of changes since the law was last completely updated in 2013, with 23 articles being revised.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor explained that in the past, during construction projects, some project owners and construction companies focused on making the most money. They often ignored safety, and with many layers of contractors, it was unclear who was responsible for safety. This meant that smaller contractors and workers often faced more risks. So, the new changes require project owners of certain large projects to analyze possible dangers before planning, designing, and building. They must also take steps to prevent accidents and set aside money for safety.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also said that if different parts of a project are given to different specialized companies, the project owner must choose one company to be in charge of overall safety. All levels of contractors must also follow safety measures and take more responsibility for safety management. In addition, the law now includes rules for those who rent out workplaces or equipment, requiring them to inform people about dangers. It also defines the safety duties for people who operate specific machinery and for self-employed workers.</p>
            <p>Another important part of the changes, according to the Ministry of Labor, is the new section on "Workplace Bullying Prevention." This section clearly defines workplace bullying. It means when a worker at their job experiences repeated offensive, threatening, ignoring, isolating, or insulting words or actions from someone in the company, using their position or power. These actions go beyond what is necessary and reasonable for work and cause harm to the worker's physical or mental health. However, for very serious cases, it is not necessary for the actions to happen repeatedly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also stated that the draft law requires companies to set up different prevention measures based on their size and make them public. Companies must also improve how they handle complaints and investigations and provide help and protection to those who complain. They must also report incidents to the government. The law also clearly states how workers can complain to an outside authority if the person they are complaining about is the highest-ranking manager, and it sets out related penalties.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also announced that to stop illegal acts, the new law increases the maximum jail time, fines, and administrative penalties for employers who break the rules. For criminal responsibility, if a fatal workplace accident happens, the maximum jail time goes up from 3 years to 5 years, and the maximum fine increases from NT$300,000 to NT$1.5 million. If three people are injured in a workplace accident, the maximum jail time increases from 1 year to 3 years, and the maximum fine goes up from NT$180,000 to NT$1 million.</p>
            <p>For administrative penalties, if an employer violates safety rules, the maximum fine increases from NT$300,000 to NT$1.5 million. For not following management rules, the maximum fine goes up from NT$150,000 to NT$750,000.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor added that the changes also improve public oversight. Any company that receives a penalty must make public its name, the name of the person in charge, the fine amount, the date and location of the workplace accident, and the number of people affected. This is to make sure companies are responsible for preventing workplace accidents.</p>

            <h1>Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics: General Subsidies Aim for Balanced Local Development, Not to Guarantee More for Those Who Already Receive a Lot</h1>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an was unhappy with the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics' (DGBAS) decision. The DGBAS said that general subsidies could be adjusted for individual cities and counties, even if the total amount of money stayed the same. Today, Mayor Chiang went to the Executive Yuan to repeat his views. The DGBAS stated that general subsidies must help local areas develop evenly. For example, Lienchiang County will receive less shared tax revenue next year. If the subsidies were used to guarantee more money for areas that already get a lot, it would be very unfair.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan recently passed the central government's budget for next year. To use the new funds from the revised Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, the total amount of shared tax revenue for local governments will increase. Next year, central government shared tax revenue will be NT$884.1 billion, which is an increase of NT$416.5 billion for local governments compared to this year. Also, Article 30, Paragraph 3 of the new Act says that general subsidies cannot be less than the amount from the year before the changes took effect. So, NT$250.1 billion has been set aside for next year, the same as this year.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chiang Wan-an had previously criticized the DGBAS for widely interpreting "total amount unchanged" for general subsidies, using it to cut individual cities' and counties' general subsidies. Today, when he attended the Executive Yuan meeting, he brought up this issue again.</p>
            <p>Executive Yuan spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said today at a press conference after the Executive Yuan meeting that according to Article 30 of the Act Governing the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures, the central government can give subsidies to local governments to help with balanced economic development across the country. The new version of the Act states that general subsidies cannot be less than the amount from the year before the changes. This means that the general subsidies given to local governments next year cannot be lower than this year's amount, and the government has set aside money according to this law.</p>
            <p>However, she said that the new Act has problems with how money is distributed horizontally. This means almost all cities and counties will receive much more shared tax revenue, but Lienchiang County will not see an increase. Taipei City, on the other hand, will receive the most shared tax revenue next year, giving it enough money to pay for local projects.</p>
            <p>Regarding Mayor Chiang's comments, Deputy Director-General Chen Hui-juan of the DGBAS said at the press conference that the central government provides funds to local areas in three ways: shared tax revenue, general subsidies, and project-based subsidies. General subsidies are legally meant to help local areas develop evenly and assist cities and counties with basic financial shortfalls. However, with the new Act, there are almost no cities or counties with shortfalls. If the government still has to guarantee more money for cities and counties that already receive a lot of central funds, it would be very unfair.</p>
            <p>Chen Hui-juan emphasized that while the total amount is guaranteed, the government must rethink and change how individual cities and counties receive money. This is to treat all cities and counties fairly and follow the spirit of Article 30 of the Act. For example, the new Act means Lienchiang County will receive less shared tax revenue than before. So, the central government will help them through general subsidies. Next year, Taipei City's shared tax revenue plus general subsidies will increase by NT$15.6 billion.</p>
            <p>Huang Hsiao-wei, Deputy Section Chief of the Financial Planning Division of the National Treasury Administration, Ministry of Finance, explained that in previous years, shared tax revenue and general subsidies were considered together. According to the formula in the new Act, the numerator is calculated based on island cities/counties and offshore islands, while the denominator is for the whole country. This resulted in some funds not being distributed, which is why Lienchiang County received less shared tax revenue. That is why they thought about helping through general subsidies.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te, Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, said that Premier Cho Jung-tai has instructed that the central government will not cut any money for vulnerable groups or social welfare. He hopes that cities and counties that receive more money will take on more responsibility.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-te said that cities and counties that receive more subsidies should spend the money wisely. For example, Mayor Chiang Wan-an wants to increase the Chongyang Festival elderly gift money from NT$1,500 to NT$3,000. However, Taipei City's long-term care services are only at 58.6%, which is the lowest in Taiwan. For child abuse investigations, Taipei City only provides subsidies once every three years. He believes Taipei should put more effort into long-term care and social safety net staffing subsidies.</p>

            <h1>Russia Attacks Kyiv, 8 Dead and 45 Injured; Zelenskyy Asks China to Speak Up</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that a new Russian air attack on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, killed at least 8 people and injured dozens. He also asked China to say something about it.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on social media platform X: "Our cities and communities have been attacked again on a large scale, causing more deaths and injuries." He also mentioned that a child was among those killed and that the death toll had risen to 8.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press, citing the latest information from Kyiv authorities, reported that the number of casualties had increased to 8 dead and 45 injured.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said this shows that Russia does not want "real diplomacy."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy posted on X: "Russia chooses to use ballistic missiles, not to sit at the negotiating table; it chooses to continue killing, not to end the war."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Zelenskyy also said Ukraine expects the international community to react, including placing new sanctions. He specifically asked China and Hungary to take a strong stance.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote in his post: "We expect China to respond to the current situation. China has repeatedly called for the war not to spread and for a ceasefire, but this has never happened because of Russia. We also expect Hungary to respond."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said: "We expect a response from all those in the world who have called for peace, but are now silent more often than they take a principled stand."</p>
            <p>Ihor Klymenko, Ukraine's Interior Minister, said earlier that the air strike killed 4 people and injured about 30. Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv Military Administration, added that a 14-year-old girl was among those killed, and five other children aged 7 to 17 were injured with varying degrees of wounds.</p>
            <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko described the air raid as a "massive attack" that caused damage in several areas of Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Klitschko said that Russian forces fired ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and Iranian-designed "Shahed" drones from many directions, "systematically" targeting residential buildings.</p>
            <p>Klitschko reported that a 5-story building in the Darnytsky district collapsed, and a shopping center in the city center was also hit.</p>
