Microsoft has launched Copilot Pro, a new subscription service aimed at individual users who want to boost their productivity using AI. The service, costing $20 per month, provides faster performance and priority access to the latest AI models, even during peak usage times. Copilot Pro works across multiple devices and integrates seamlessly with Microsoft 365 apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Subscribers can create documents faster, summarise long emails, and generate impressive presentations more easily.

One key feature is the ability to build your own Copilot GPTs, allowing you to customise the AI assistant for specific tasks and interests. This means users can train Copilot to better understand their individual needs and work styles. Microsoft believes that Copilot Pro will be particularly helpful for entrepreneurs, researchers, and anyone looking to save time and improve the quality of their work. The company is also continuing to offer a free version of Copilot for those who don't require the advanced features and benefits of the Pro subscription. The launch of Copilot Pro underscores Microsoft's commitment to making AI accessible to a wider audience and integrating it into everyday workflows.

**Iceland's Volcanic Eruption Sparks Travel Concerns But Life Goes On**

A recent volcanic eruption near Grindavik, Iceland, has raised concerns about travel to the popular tourist destination, but officials are keen to emphasise that much of the country remains unaffected. While the immediate area around the eruption site is closed for safety reasons, Keflavik International Airport, Iceland's main gateway, is operating as normal. Many tours and attractions outside of the exclusion zone are also open for business.

The Icelandic government and tourism board are providing up-to-date information and advice to travellers, urging them to check conditions before planning their trips. Although some flights were briefly disrupted, the situation has largely stabilised. The eruption, while dramatic, is localised, and the vast majority of Iceland is safe for visitors. Locals in areas away from the eruption are continuing with their daily lives, demonstrating the resilience of the community in the face of natural challenges. While some travellers may choose to postpone their trips, others are still arriving to experience the unique beauty and culture that Iceland offers, contributing to the local economy.

**The Slow Food Movement: Rediscovering the Joys of Eating Well**

In a world dominated by fast food and instant gratification, the Slow Food movement is gaining traction as a counter-cultural force. It encourages people to appreciate the origins of their food, the work of farmers and producers, and the importance of sharing meals with others. The movement emphasises the use of local, sustainable ingredients, supporting small-scale agriculture and traditional cooking methods.

Slow Food promotes a more mindful approach to eating, encouraging people to savour flavours, textures, and aromas. It also advocates for food education, teaching children and adults alike about the importance of healthy eating habits and the environmental impact of food production. Through events, workshops, and community gardens, Slow Food initiatives are helping to reconnect people with their food and with each other. Ultimately, the movement aims to create a more sustainable and equitable food system, one that values quality over quantity and celebrates the simple pleasures of eating well.
