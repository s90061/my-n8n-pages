            <h1>"The Empty Spaces" Exhibition: What Taiwanese and French Photographers See in Cities and Lands</h1>
            <p>The "Empty Spaces: A Look at Land and Cities in Modern Photography" exhibition opened today at the National Center of Photography and Culture in Taipei. This exhibition shows what 19 artists from Taiwan and France see in cities and lands through their cameras.</p>
            <p>At the opening event, Minister of Culture Li Yuan said that we live in a time of too much development, less variety of living things, problems and pollution from human life, and fast climate change. Because of this, people are more afraid that the end is coming. The "Empty Spaces" exhibition uses photographs to show feelings like "Vanitas" paintings from Europe in the 1600s. These old paintings used objects to show feelings of sadness and no hope about the world.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li Yuan said that photos are powerful. They capture moments that often make us think deeply. "Empty Spaces" lets Taiwanese and French photographers show everyday things in a way that makes us think about our shared human experience.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li Yuan hopes that these artworks will bring together different cultures and life experiences from Taiwan and France. He believes this will help people understand each other better. He said, "In this empty and slowly changing time, I think this is the best thing."</p>
            <p>The person who organized the exhibition, RaphaÃ«le Bertho, spoke at the event. She said the idea for the exhibition came from a strong wish: "to look closely at the time we live in and keep looking for what is beautiful." She asked visitors to walk slowly and carefully through the exhibition. She wants them to think about whether our world can still offer hope and welcome the future as they look at the artworks and the space.</p>
            <p>The exhibition "Empty Spaces: A Look at Land and Cities in Modern Photography" is open now until November 2nd at the Photography Center in Taipei. On July 18th and 19th, there will be talks where the organizer and artists will share their thoughts.</p>

            <h1>Over 1,000 People Arrested in Scam Centers; Taiwan Asks Cambodia for List of Taiwanese Suspects</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 17th, CNA reporter Yang Yao-Ru) On July 16th, police in Cambodia raided online scam centers and arrested over a thousand suspects, including 75 people from Taiwan. Today, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it has told its office in Ho Chi Minh City to check with the local police. Taiwan is asking Cambodia to quickly give a list of the people involved and information about their crimes.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that on July 16th, Cambodian police raided online scam centers. They arrested over a thousand suspects. Most of the people arrested were foreigners, including at least 271 from Indonesia, 213 from Vietnam, and 75 from Taiwan.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNA that Cambodian police have recently carried out big raids on many online scam centers across the country. They seem to have arrested suspects, including some from Taiwan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very worried about this. It has told its office in Ho Chi Minh City to contact the local police right away to check the information. It is also strongly asking Cambodia to quickly give the names of the people involved and information about the crimes. This will help to understand the truth of the case.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that if it is confirmed that Taiwanese people are involved, Taiwan will ask Cambodia to send them back to Taiwan. This follows the rule that a person should be judged in their own country. After they are sent back, Taiwan's law enforcement will investigate and handle the cases according to the law.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly warns people again not to take risks and go abroad to do illegal things, like phone scams. If they do, they might break local laws. This could lead to them being put in prison or stuck in scam centers. The results can be very bad and not worth it.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that for Taiwanese people who are already stuck in scam centers overseas or in prison, different government departments will continue to work together. They will work with other countries to fight international crime more strongly. They will also actively help the Taiwanese people involved and their families according to local laws.</p>

            <h1>Voting Day for Recall Elections is Near; Police Agency Will Fight Crime</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 17th, CNA reporter Huang Li-Li) The day for the 7/26 recall vote is coming soon. Taiwan's National Police Agency said that today it held a special online meeting with 430 important police officers. It asked that joint command centers be open during the entire recall campaign. This shows their strong decision to enforce the law seriously.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency sent out a press release in the evening. It said that because the recall voting day is near, it invited 430 important police leaders, including directors, deputy directors, and precinct chiefs from different police departments, to a special online meeting today. They stated their strong decision to enforce laws strictly and punish violence.</p>
            <p>At the same time, they asked for joint command centers for keeping public order to be open for the whole recall campaign, just like for presidential, vice-presidential, and legislative elections. This is to make sure the recall process is "safe, smooth, and stable," making society more secure and peaceful.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency said that Director-General Chang Jung-hsing gave clear orders to fight against and strongly deal with any information about gangs getting involved in the recall with violence. He also asked police departments to quickly solve and explain any fake news reports they receive. This will give people the correct information.</p>
            <p>Also, to stop vote-buying and illegal betting from affecting the recall, the police will continue to put more officers on duty and investigate fully. They promised to protect the fairness and honesty of the voting results.</p>
            <p>Director-General Chang Jung-hsing reminded everyone that this is the first large-scale recall security operation in the country. Police officers must stay neutral and fair. For security work, he asked local police to work closely with election offices. They must check every part of the process, control who comes in and out, and do security checks. They must make sure security is perfect.</p>
            <p>The National Police Agency said that during the official recall campaign period, the number of recall events has greatly increased. The police will follow the law and remain neutral. They will strictly prevent fights and problems. For violent actions, they will enforce the law seriously and will not allow anyone to challenge the government's power. They also ask the public to express their opinions and demands at recall events in a peaceful and sensible way. They should support the police in their work to make sure the recall security is completed successfully.</p>
