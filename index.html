            <h1>Israel: First Steps to Take Gaza City, Controls Outer Areas</h1>
            <p>The Israeli army announced today that it has started its first steps to take over Gaza City. They have called up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers to help with the full operation to take Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Israeli army spokesperson Effie Defrin told reporters: "We have started the first part of our attack on Gaza City. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) now control the areas outside Gaza City."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz approved the plan to take Gaza City. He also allowed about 60,000 reserve soldiers to be called up for this task.</p>
            <p>Katz's decision was confirmed by a spokesperson to Agence France-Presse. This move puts more pressure on Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group. At the same time, countries trying to make peace in the nearly two-year war in Gaza are waiting for Israel's official answer to their newest ideas.</p>
