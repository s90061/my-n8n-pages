A crime group brought illegal beauty tools from places like China and rented them to beauty clinics. Police searched and arrested 12 suspects, including a 51-year-old man named Huang who runs a medical equipment company.

The police started investigating after they learned about this illegal activity. The group was bringing in beauty tools and medicines like "Thermage" without government approval or permission from the original makers. They then rented these tools to many beauty clinics in Taipei and New Taipei. Patients did not know the tools were illegal, which caused health and safety concerns.

Yesterday and today, police searched the companies and clinics involved. They arrested the four Huang brothers and 12 employees. They are now facing charges for breaking laws about medical equipment, fraud, and medical practice.

It was rumored that a famous doctor's clinic was involved, but investigations showed their equipment was legal. Police are still looking into where the illegal equipment came from and if more clinics are involved.

**Rare Bee Attack in Southern France: 24 Injured, 3 Seriously**

Authorities in Cantal, a region in south-central France, reported today that a rare bee attack happened yesterday in Aurillac, the capital city. 24 people were hurt, and 3 of them are in serious condition due to allergic reactions.

According to reports, pedestrians were stung by bees for about 30 minutes yesterday morning in Aurillac. Firefighters and medical staff quickly arrived to help the injured. Police also blocked off the area until the attack stopped.

The mayor of Aurillac, Pierre Mathonier, told France 3 TV that the incident might be related to beehives on a hotel rooftop in the city center. These beehives were set up more than 10 years ago. It is thought that yellow-legged hornets might have threatened the bees, making them aggressive.

Mathonier said that luckily, "everything ended well." Besides the many bee stings, there was "no panic" in the city.
