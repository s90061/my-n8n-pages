Amazon is launching a new AI-powered shopping assistant in time for the holiday season. This tool, integrated within the Amazon app, aims to simplify the gift-finding process. Users can ask the assistant for recommendations based on different factors, such as the recipient's interests, age, and budget. It can understand complex requests, like "find a fun gift for a 10-year-old who loves science, under $30." The assistant then provides a curated list of products that meet the userâ€™s criteria, linking directly to the Amazon product pages.

This move is part of Amazon's larger strategy to leverage AI to improve the customer experience. The company hopes the assistant will reduce the time shoppers spend searching for the perfect present and increase sales during the busy holiday period. Early tests have shown promising results, with users reporting a more efficient and enjoyable shopping experience. However, some privacy advocates are raising concerns about the amount of data Amazon collects through the assistant and how it will be used.

**Article 2: UK Government Invests in Green Aviation Technology**

The UK government has announced a significant investment in projects focused on developing greener aviation technologies. The funding will be distributed among several companies and research institutions working on innovations such as electric aircraft, hydrogen-powered engines, and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). The aim is to reduce the environmental impact of air travel and support the UK's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

One of the projects receiving funding is developing a new type of electric motor designed specifically for larger passenger planes. Another project focuses on scaling up the production of SAF from sustainable sources, such as agricultural waste and algae. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said the investment would help the UK become a global leader in green aviation. He emphasised the importance of finding sustainable solutions for air travel to ensure the industry can continue to grow without harming the planet.

**Article 3: New Co-working Space Opens in Lisbon Targeting Digital Nomads**

A new co-working space has opened in Lisbon, Portugal, specifically designed to cater to the growing community of digital nomads. The space offers a range of amenities, including high-speed internet, private meeting rooms, and comfortable workstations. It also features social areas, such as a rooftop terrace and a communal kitchen, designed to foster collaboration and networking among its members.

Lisbon has become increasingly popular with digital nomads due to its affordable cost of living, pleasant climate, and vibrant culture. The new co-working space aims to provide a professional and supportive environment for remote workers who are looking to combine work with travel. The founders of the space say they are committed to creating a community that supports the personal and professional growth of its members. They plan to host regular workshops, social events, and networking opportunities to help digital nomads connect with each other and with the local community.
