A new report shows that fewer people are asking for asylum in the European Union (EU). In the first half of this year, Germany received 43% fewer asylum applications compared to last year. This means Germany is no longer the country with the most asylum requests in the EU, a first in many years.

Now, Spain has the most asylum applications, followed by France, and then Germany is third. Overall, the EU received 23% fewer applications. Most people asking for asylum are from Venezuela (often going to Spain), Afghanistan, and Syria (often going to Germany).

Experts say this drop is because the EU is better at controlling its borders and has made new deals with North African countries like Tunisia and Egypt. The EU gives these countries money to help them manage their borders, healthcare, and education. In return, these countries help stop illegal migration to Europe. Even though there are some concerns about human rights in these partner countries, the EU believes these deals help reduce the number of people seeking asylum in Europe.

Some officials are still worried about new groups of migrants coming from Libya, especially to Crete, Greece. They are concerned that the ongoing conflict in Libya might cause more people to leave. Some also think Russia might be using this situation to create more pressure on Europe. EU officials say it's important to act early to prevent crises before migrants start their dangerous journeys.

National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) is looking for its next president. The current president's term ends on February 21, 2026. NTNU has started to accept recommendations for candidates from July 7 until August 11 this year.

NTNU is a university with a history of 100 years. It has become an international university with a diverse campus. Recently, NTNU signed agreements with famous universities like Columbia University in the US and Osaka University in Japan. Last year, the Ministry of Education also named NTNU a "Bilingual Standard University," offering nearly 1,000 courses taught in English every year.

To be a candidate, a person must meet the rules for hiring education staff. They must be under 65 years old when they start as president on February 22, 2026. They also need to have good academic achievements, high moral standards, strong leadership skills, new ideas for university education, and the ability to get and use resources well. Many different groups can recommend candidates, including academicians, university professors, academic groups, alumni, and the NTNU Student Association.

The university plans to hold meetings in early October for candidates to share their ideas. Then, in mid-October, the university council will vote. The selection committee will choose the new president in late October, and the new president will start in February next year. More information can be found online.

**Tainan Baseball Stadium Roof Damaged by Typhoon, Full Check Planned**

Typhoon Danas has caused damage to the roof of the spectator stand at Tainan Baseball Stadium. This stadium is the home ground for the Uni-President 7-Eleven Lions baseball team.

The Lions team will play away games on July 8 and 9. They are scheduled to return to their home stadium in Tainan for a three-game series starting on July 11.

The team leader, Su Tai-an, stated that the safety of the fans watching the games is the most important thing. Because the typhoon caused a lot of damage, the team will not only check the roof but also inspect the entire stadium. They want to find and fix any damage that can be seen, as well as any hidden dangers.
