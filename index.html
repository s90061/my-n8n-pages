            <h1>Jody Chiang's Last Concert Ends, She Shouts "See You Again" About More Shows</h1>
            <p>Tonight, Taiwanese singer Jody Chiang's "Wu You" concert finished at the Taipei Arena. At the end of the concert, she asked thousands of fans to sing "Jia Ni Lan Lao Lao" together. She was so touched that she cried and stopped singing for a moment. When asked about adding more shows, she shouted, "We will meet again!"</p>
            <p>After Jody Chiang sang her first set of songs tonight, thousands of fans shouted "Happy Birthday" all together. This made her very happy. She said she doesn't usually celebrate her birthday, but she kept thanking her fans.</p>
            <p>For this concert tour, she sang classic songs like "Silent Flower," "Moon, Listen to Me," "The Happy Station," and "You Must Endure." She also invited "Ming Hsing Ko," Taiwan's oldest puppet show group, to perform. She wanted the puppet show to connect with her memories of her father. She also sang "The Old Musician" for her father and the musicians on stage.</p>
            <p>Jody Chiang said that she still cannot believe tonight was the last concert. When fans loudly asked for more shows, she laughed and said, "Do you think the Taipei Arena belongs to me? Everything is already planned. If I could add more shows, I would love to sing. But the organizers need to talk about it. If it's really possible, let's look forward to it, okay?"</p>
            <p>At the end of the concert, Jody Chiang invited her band and dancers onto the stage to receive applause from the audience. She asked everyone to sing "Jia Ni Lan Lao Lao" together. She cried again and said, "Everyone is crying, how can I sing? Let me calm down a bit." Jody Chiang then wiped her tears and sang, "Let go of the past, then life has hope, let me hold you tight." With this classic song, she ended her "Wu You" concert series, which had 23 shows in Kaohsiung and Taipei. Her final shout, "We will meet again," seemed to hint that she might hold concerts again in the future.</p>

            <h1>Serious Mood in Beijing Before China's September 3rd Military Parade; Some Take Photos, Some Find It Hard to Go Home</h1>
            <p>As China's September 3rd military parade gets closer, there are police everywhere on the main roads inside Beijing's Second Ring Road. Security has greatly increased, and the atmosphere is serious. For several weekends, some shops had to close early for parade practices. Some people were busy taking photos with the special decorations set up by the government. However, shops and people living near the blocked-off areas had problems, like shops closing and needing to show ID to go home.</p>
            <p>This year, China is holding events to celebrate the "80th anniversary of the victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." The most important part is the military parade on September 3rd. On Chang'an Avenue, which goes from east to west in front of Tiananmen Square, seats in gold, red, and green have already been set up. On the other side, there are decorations shaped like the Great Wall and a large screen.</p>
            <p>These days, many people in Beijing are riding bicycles along Chang'an Avenue to feel the atmosphere of the parade. But when they ride past Tiananmen Square, staff check their IDs and bags one by one. Staff around Tiananmen also tell people not to stop and take photos. Many people are slowly riding with one hand and taking pictures with the other.</p>
            <p>The Forbidden City in Beijing, which is nearby, also closed temporarily from August 31st to September 4th for the parade and other events. Normally, many people dress in Qing Dynasty clothes to take photos there. But these days, because of the parade rules, there are almost no crowds at the Forbidden City. Some people have to stop outside the Forbidden City to take pictures, remembering this rare time without many people.</p>
            <p>Yesterday was the last weekend before the Beijing parade. Even though some roads still had traffic controls, this weekend was different from the past few weeks because there were no parade practices. The streets felt a little less serious. Many people rushed to the intersection near Dongdan subway station yesterday to take photos with the special flower decorations. There were huge crowds of people.</p>
            <p>In the crowd, some children wore red scarves and held small five-star flags while taking photos with the flower decorations. Because there were so many people, at least 10 police officers stood near one flower decoration, watching everything carefully.</p>
            <p>One person said that China also had a military parade 10 years ago. In the past, when WeChat Moments and social media were not so popular, people didn't know about these special places and decorations on Chang'an Avenue. This time, they decided to come and take photos after seeing videos shared by others online.</p>
            <p>Around 5:50 PM yesterday, many people were stopped at the intersections of Chongwenmen Inner Street and East Chang'an Avenue. They looked disappointed because the area would be closed off at 6 PM. A person who has worked in Beijing for more than 10 years said they saw the beautiful decorations while riding a bus past Tiananmen Square. So, they got off the bus to ride a bicycle and enjoy it, but they couldn't enter due to traffic control. They could only take photos with the flower decorations from outside.</p>
            <p>Yesterday evening, people were lining up at bus stops like Dongdan West and Wangfujing. At least 50 people were at each stop. They all wanted to take a bus before 11 PM yesterday to see Tiananmen Square, which was decorated grandly for the parade. Buses number 1 and 52, which go past Tiananmen Square, were completely full.</p>
            <p>Around 7 PM last night, when a bus stopped at Wangfujing station, a lot of people pushed to get on. A bus conductor poked her head out of the bus to manage the crowd. She asked people stuck by the bus door to get off so the door could close properly. After each bus arrived, the conductor and the passengers had to spend about 5 or 6 minutes struggling to close the door and start driving.</p>
            <p>The government had practiced the parade for three weekends before. At that time, many people stood outside the blocked-off areas with cameras, hoping to see the show. But inside the same blocked areas, some shops had to close early or even for the whole day to help with the practices. Also, people living there had to queue outside their communities and show their ID cards to prove they lived there before they could enter the controlled zone. These were all small problems.</p>
