<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation followed a speech in which he stated that Taiwan is "of course" a country, supported by historical evidence and legal proof.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times. It claims the island is one of its provinces and has no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have repeatedly offered to hold talks with China, but these offers have been rejected. China considers Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had deliberately distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and maintained that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly encouraged conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' errors and false beliefs," the office said in a statement.

It added, "The misleading statements made by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and legal principles, will simply be discarded by history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply presenting historical facts. It called Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country "just a made-up lie without any basis."

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, where 'the two sides are not under each other's control'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists. The Republic of China remains the island's official name.

Lai has repeatedly stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future. He also emphasized that since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak for it.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has experienced increasing military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.

**TSMC Unit to Issue $10 Billion of Stock to Counter Forex Swings**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s overseas branch plans to issue $10 billion in new shares. This is their largest effort yet to manage changes in foreign exchange rates, according to a company statement. This is the third such agreement since 2024, and all have happened when the Taiwan dollar tended to get stronger. These actions give TSMC Globalâ€”which handles overseas investments and currency protectionâ€”more financial freedom to deal with exchange rate risks.

The recent increase in the Taiwan dollar has made people in Taipei concerned about the economy's heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency had its biggest one-day gain since the 1980s, leading Taiwan's central bank to call for measures to control speculation.

Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco in Singapore, explained that more currency volatility usually means banks might change their margin requirements. He added that issuing new shares and providing immediate cash could help companies manage these requirements for both current and new hedges.

TSMC, the main chipmaker for companies like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far Taiwan's largest company and exporter because most of its production is local. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from international sales would convert into less local currency, or they would need to increase their prices abroad, risking a drop in demand.

In June, CEO C. C. Wei informed shareholders that the company's operating profit margin had decreased by several percentage points due to the stronger local currency.
