            <h1>Nanfang'ao Fishing Port Cleans Over 5,000 Tons of Trash Yearly with a New Cleaning Boat</h1>
            <p>Yilan's Nanfang'ao Fishing Port removes more than 5,000 tons of trash every year. Before, people used small fishing rafts to pick up the trash, but this was not very fast. The fishermen's association received money from the government. With help from the county government, they made a new cleaning boat with a gasoline engine. This boat makes cleaning the port much faster.</p>
            <p>Nanfang'ao is south of Su'ao Port in Yilan County. It catches a lot of fish and is one of Taiwan's three main fishing areas. There are three fishing ports and fish markets here. The Su'ao Fishermen's Association says that over 5,000 tons of trash are collected from the land and water each year. There are many kinds of trash, such as old fishing nets, broken fishing tools, boat ropes, paint cans, and even parts of fiberglass boats and broken fishing machines. Sometimes, special trucks are needed to remove the trash.</p>
            <p>For the water part, people used to rely on small fishing rafts to pick up trash, but it was not quick enough. To fix this problem, the Su'ao Fishermen's Association got money from the central government. With help from the Yilan County Government, they spent 1.97 million New Taiwan dollars to make a cleaning boat with a gasoline engine. This boat started working on September 25.</p>
            <p>Wu Po-yun, the head of the Yilan County Ocean and Fisheries Development Office, said in an interview today that the new cleaning boat will help clear floating trash faster from the port and nearby sea. They hope this will make Nanfang'ao Fishing Port much cleaner.</p>
            <p>Wu Po-yun also said that when the county government held a fun event at Nanfang'ao Fishing Port this year, they told fishermen and workers not to throw trash into the port waters. If they do, they could get a fine of 30,000 to 150,000 New Taiwan dollars, as per the Fishing Port Act. Also, there are signs in the port asking visitors to follow the rules.</p>
            <p>The Su'ao Fishermen's Association said that port trash might come from fishermen fixing their nets, or it might float into the port with the ocean currents. The association continues to tell fishermen not to throw trash into the port. They also hope the new cleaning boat will make trash removal more efficient.</p>

            <h1>Dump Truck Overturns on Steep Road in Taichung, Road Closed for a Time</h1>
            <p>Today morning, a man named Hou was driving a dump truck in Shalu District, Taichung. He was on a steep downhill part of Xiangshang Road, Section 6. It seems his brakes failed, and he crashed, causing his truck to overturn. Four other cars were also hit. Mr. Hou was hurt and taken to the hospital. The road was closed in one direction for some time. The police are still looking into what caused the accident.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Fire Department said they received a report at 9:56 AM about a dump truck overturning on the steep downhill part of Xiangshang Road, Section 6, in Shalu District. There was also a person injured. Firefighters and vehicles were sent right away. The dump truck driver, Mr. Hou, who is 36 years old, was taken to Kuang Tien General Hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>The Qingshui Branch of the Taichung City Police Department did a first investigation. They found that Mr. Hou was driving the dump truck west on Xiangshang Road, Section 6. It seems his brakes failed, and he moved to the left into the other lane before the truck overturned. Things that fell from the truck also hit four small cars.</p>
            <p>Only the dump truck driver was hurt in the accident. Mr. Hou had a cut on his head. He was awake and not in danger. Police checked him for alcohol, and he was not driving drunk. The police closed one lane of the road to deal with the accident. The road was fully open again after 3 PM. The police will give the case to the Traffic Police Brigade to find out the exact reason for the accident.</p>

            <h1>China Investigates Qualcomm, Says It's Normal Work</h1>
            <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced recently that it has started an investigation into Qualcomm, a big American company that makes computer chips. An official from SAMR's anti-monopoly department said recently that this is "normal law enforcement work" according to the "Anti-Monopoly Law."</p>
            <p>Lately, the trade dispute between the US and China has become more serious. According to Xinhua News Agency, an SAMR official recently answered questions from reporters about the investigation into Qualcomm. The official said it is normal work that SAMR does based on the "Anti-Monopoly Law."</p>
            <p>The official said that in May 2023, Qualcomm announced it would buy Autotalks, an Israeli company that makes chips for connected cars. After getting a report, SAMR looked at this merger carefully. They decided that even though the merger didn't need to be reported by law, there was "evidence that it could stop or limit fair competition."</p>
            <p>The official also said that on March 12, 2024, SAMR told Qualcomm in writing to report the merger, according to the Anti-Monopoly Law. Qualcomm was told not to complete the merger before reporting it and getting approval. On March 14, 2024, Qualcomm sent a letter to SAMR saying they would not go through with the deal.</p>
            <p>The official mentioned that in June 2025, Qualcomm bought Autotalks without reporting it or talking to SAMR. After receiving a report about this, SAMR checked the information, and Qualcomm agreed that these things happened. Because the facts were clear and there was strong evidence, SAMR officially started an investigation into Qualcomm for breaking the law by buying Autotalks without permission.</p>
            <p>Finally, the official said that SAMR will continue the investigation "following laws and rules, and being fair and objective."</p>
            <p>China's State Administration for Market Regulation announced on October 10 that it was investigating Qualcomm. The reason was that Qualcomm's purchase of Autotalks might break China's "Anti-Monopoly Law." Qualcomm said on October 11 that it is working with the Chinese market regulation agency on the investigation.</p>
