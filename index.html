            <h1>Portugal to Consider Recognizing Palestine as a Country in September</h1>
            <p>The office of Portugal's Prime Minister, Luis Montenegro, said today that the Portuguese government will talk with the president and parliament. They will discuss recognizing Palestine as a country at the United Nations General Assembly in September.</p>
            <p>A statement from Montenegro's office said that Portugal "is thinking about recognizing Palestine as a country." This could happen in September during the 80th United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.</p>
            <p>Recently, France, the UK, and Canada have also said they might recognize Palestine in September. Now, Portugal might do the same.</p>
            <p>Also, Germany's Foreign Minister, Johann Wadephul, said today that Israel is becoming more alone in its diplomatic relationships. This is because of the bad humanitarian situation in Gaza and because some countries want to recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>Before visiting Israel, Wadephul made a statement. He said that a recent UN meeting discussed a "two-state solution" for the conflict between Israel and Palestine. This meeting showed that "Israel is more and more a minority." The United States and Israel did not go to this meeting.</p>
            <p>Germany is one of Israel's closest friends in diplomacy. But Wadephul pointed out: "Some people in the Israeli government have openly said they might take over (Palestinian land). Because of this, more and more European countries are ready to recognize Palestine as a country without talking first."</p>
            <p>Last week, more than 70 Israeli lawmakers voted for a plan. They asked the government to take full control over the West Bank, which they occupy.</p>
            <p>Wadephul also said again that Germany believes "Palestine should only be recognized as a country after talks are finished." However, he also spoke a bit more strongly. He said that "this process must start now," and "Germany might also have to react if one side acts alone."</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Sweden's Prime Minister, Ulf Kristersson, today asked the European Union (EU) to stop the trade part of its agreement with Israel. He said this is because of Israel's actions in the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The EU-Israel Association Agreement is a plan that explains how they trade and work together politically. The EU says it is Israel's biggest trading partner. About one-third of all Israel's world trade is with the EU.</p>

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Hsieh Cheng-chun Plays Well in Pitching and Batting; Ku Meng-chieh Injured and Needs More Watching</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Tainan, July 31st) In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Hsieh Cheng-chun from Taiwan's team had lost a game to Japan before. But today, he felt better and played in the first game of the next round against the Dominican Republic. He came into the game when it was difficult, and he pitched and hit well. This helped his team win 9-4. Another player, Ku Meng-chieh, got hurt and left the game. He got some basic care, and they will watch him to see how he is doing.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Cheng-chun started the game against Japan and pitched for 3 innings. He gave up 4 runs, and his team lost that game. Today, in the "Super Round" game against the Dominican Republic, he came in to pitch in the second part of the second inning when the other team had players on base. He stopped the other team from scoring. He pitched for 1.2 innings, struck out 4 players, and did not let the other team score any runs. He won the game as a pitcher. When he hit, he also did well, getting 2 hits and helping his team score 1 run.</p>
            <p>After the game, the head coach for Taiwan, Chang Tzu-chien, said that Hsieh Cheng-chun's pitching in the last game was actually quite good. But the Japanese team hit the ball very well. After that game, the coach told Hsieh to feel better because he would need to pitch again. Today, when the game was difficult, the coach chose Hsieh Cheng-chun to pitch. He showed that he could control the game and played very well.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Cheng-chun said that he was not nervous when he came in to pitch with players on base. He said he is used to stopping difficult situations. His idea when he was on the field was to throw good balls for the batters to hit, let his teammates help him in defense, and try to do what the coaches asked him to do.</p>
            <p>Today, Ku Meng-chieh, who bats fourth for Taiwan, was hit on his hand by a ball in his first turn at bat. He then had to leave the game to rest. Coach Chang Tzu-chien also said that after getting some simple care, they need to keep watching him. If his hand hurts more, they will take him to the hospital for more checks. They hope his injury is not too bad.</p>

            <h1>World Athletics: New Gender Test to Start in September, Only Negative Results Can Enter Women's Category</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Paris, July 31st) World Athletics has announced that from September this year, women athletes in top competitions must take a gene test.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, this test will officially start before the World Championships in Tokyo. Those games will be from September 13th to 21st.</p>
            <p>Sebastian Coe, the head of World Athletics, said: "Sports have always tried to get more women to join. It is very important to make them feel that there is no unfair physical limit in the competition."</p>
            <p>He added, "Doing a test to check a person's biological sex is an important step to make sure this happens."</p>
            <p>The SRY gene that they test for is a part of the Y chromosome. This gene helps male features grow. Athletes can choose to have a sample taken from their cheek or have a blood test.</p>
            <p>If an athlete's test result is negative, they can compete in women's events that are part of the world rankings.</p>
            <p>If the test result is positive, the athlete can only compete in women's events that are not part of the world rankings, or in other types of events that are not for women.</p>
            <p>Each country's sports group will be in charge of doing these tests.</p>
            <p>World Athletics said that this test is "very exact." They also said that "the chance of getting a wrong negative or wrong positive result is very, very small."</p>
            <p>The SRY gene test is also what World Boxing (WB) started using this year for their required gender tests.</p>
            <p>Coe said in a statement on July 30th: "Now, for top-level competitions, if you want to be in the women's group, athletes must be biologically female."</p>
