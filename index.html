            <p>Pakistan's disaster management agency said that in Punjab, an eastern area, a boat carrying people to safety turned over today. At least 5 people died, and more than 10 people were saved. The water in the area was very high, like a river.</p>
            <p>Reuters news reported that the strong water made the boat sink in the Multan area. Luckily, most people on the boat were saved.</p>
            <p>Nabeel Javed, who leads rescue work for the Punjab government, said that floods in the Ravi River, Sutlej River, and Chenab River have hurt over 4,100 villages. More than 2 million people had to leave their homes.</p>
            <p>The government has made 423 temporary places to stay, 512 hospitals, and 432 animal clinics. This is to help people and their animals. They have also moved more than 1.5 million animals to new places. Javed also said that at least 50 people have died because of the floods this season.</p>

            <h1>Chicago's Traditional Parade is Quiet Due to Fear of Trump's Immigration Actions</h1>
            <p>In Chicago, USA, there are usually big and colorful parades for Mexican Independence Day. But today, the city is quiet and worried. People are afraid that President Trump will send more people to find and remove immigrants.</p>
            <p>Today, in the old Mexican area of Pilsen in Chicago, there was no usual big party. A small group of dancers in nice clothes danced and gave out papers that said, "Know Your Rights." Not many people came to watch.</p>
            <p>Some people rode horses. They put Mexican flags on the horses' tails. They also wore bright orange whistles around their necks. These were to tell people in the parade if immigration officers came.</p>
            <p>Along the streets, helpers also watched carefully for immigration officers.</p>
            <p>Eddie Chavez grew up in Pilsen. He stood by some chairs on the parade road, waving a Mexican flag. He said, "Many people should be here... but now it's empty, like a ghost town."</p>
            <p>Reuters news reported that Trump wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," about the movie "Apocalypse Now." He meant that immigration raids would happen soon in Chicago.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote: "I like the smell of taking people out in the morning... The city of Chicago will learn why this group (Department of Defense) is called the Department of War." His post showed a picture of him in a army uniform, with fire and the Chicago buildings behind him.</p>
            <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who is a Democrat, often speaks against Trump. On September 2nd, he said he thinks immigration officers will do raids during the Mexican Independence parties this weekend and next weekend.</p>
            <p>Some Mexican parties in Chicago were put off or even stopped. This was because people were worried about the raids.</p>

            <h1>Los Angeles Police Stop Protecting Kamala Harris After Criticism</h1>
            <p>President Trump recently took away former Vice President Kamala Harris's special security. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) was going to give her temporary security. But people inside the police department were not happy about it. So, today, the LAPD said they would stop protecting her. Kamala Harris will soon travel to talk about her new book. No one knows yet who will keep her safe during this time.</p>
            <p>The Los Angeles Times newspaper said that the LAPD stopped protecting Kamala Harris today. This happened because the police workers' group did not agree. They said it was wrong to use police officers to protect a rich person who has millions of dollars. They felt this put the safety of Los Angeles citizens at risk. They also said she could hire her own private guards.</p>
            <p>After Harris left her job in January, she had 6 months of security from the Secret Service. Before former President Joe Biden left the White House, he made this security last for one more year. But President Donald Trump cancelled this extra year of security.</p>
            <p>Harris's security was supposed to end in July 2026. The Associated Press news agency said that when Harris was Vice President, she was in danger. However, the Secret Service recently checked and said there are no clear dangers to her now.</p>
            <p>People who knew what was happening told the Los Angeles Times that many police officers were very much against being taken away from their normal jobs of stopping crime.</p>
            <p>Until this morning, some LAPD officers were still working outside Harris's house in Brentwood.</p>
            <p>A person from the LAPD said last week that the police department would keep Harris safe until a different plan was ready. They also said this temporary plan was to make sure her security did not stop.</p>
            <p>A TV station in Los Angeles, FOX 11, was the first to tell that the LAPD was helping with Harris's security. After that, police workers criticized it. The police workers' group even said that Harris was a "president candidate who did not win." They also pointed to California Governor Gavin Newsom, saying if he wanted to make Harris happy, he should pay for her security himself.</p>
            <p>All these changes to her security are happening when Harris is getting ready to travel for her new book. Her book, "107 Days," is about her short time trying to become president. She will visit 15 cities to talk about it.</p>
            <p>It is not clear who will keep Harris safe while she is on her book tour. People in the US have different ideas about this situation.</p>
