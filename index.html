            <h1>Tainan Nanhua District Guanshan Village to stop work and school on 8/4, other areas to work and study as usual</h1>
            <p>The Tainan City Government announced tonight that the weather office predicted that the amount of rain in Tainan in the next 24 hours would not be enough to stop work and school. However, many parts of the Nan 179 road have landslides, and traffic is blocked. Also, there is still a risk of more landslides or damage because of the on-and-off rain. So, Guanshan Village in Nanhua District will stop work and school tomorrow. All other areas will work and go to school as usual.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung mountain areas heavy rain, home care worker worried about cases, bravely serves, praised for kindness</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain has caused problems in the mountain areas of Kaohsiung. A home care worker was worried about the people she helps. She bravely drove from Meinong to Liugui to serve them, and people praised her for her kindness. She shared her story and hoped the heavy rain would stop.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration continues to warn about very heavy rain in Kaohsiung's mountain areas. Since July 30, the amount of rain in Maolin and Taoyuan districts has been more than 2000 millimeters. Many main roads in the mountains are closed or damaged. The Kaohsiung City Government's Civil Affairs Bureau said that 3140 people have moved to safer places.</p>
            <p>A home care worker, Ms. Zhu, wrote on a local Facebook group. She said that even though work and school were canceled this morning, she still had to drive from Meinong to Liugui to help. She said it was not because she loved money too much. It was because most of the people who ask for home care are weak or live alone. If they cannot move easily and have no food, no one to help them wash, or no one to feed them when places are closed for many days, she felt she had to help. She asked people to think about how they would feel in that situation.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zhu told a reporter that she was just doing her job. She was happy that she had a car, so she tried to do her best. She faced floods, deep water, and mudslides, but she was always safe. She only wished that the heavy rain would stop causing problems and that the people of Liugui could have a safe home again.</p>
            <p>Also, the Kaohsiung City Indigenous Affairs Committee explained that roads in Namasia District, like Ziqiang Road to Taiwan Provincial Highway 29, 4.5 kilometers, and Yuda Mountain to Jia 129-1 line, have road damage or mudslides. In Maolin District, the connecting road to Lover's Valley also has problems. The steel temporary bridge that connects Fuxing Village to Lafu Village in Taoyuan District is still being hit by the strong river water. In the tunnel at Taiwan Provincial Highway 29, temporary 11-0K+100, the water is about 60 centimeters deep. People are told not to go through the tunnel for now and not to go into the mountain areas unless it is very important.</p>

            <h1>Israel office refutes Gaza hunger video: Hamas intercepts aid convoys</h1>
            <p>There is still hunger in Gaza. Hamas recently showed a video with a very thin Israeli hostage and pictures of children who seemed hungry. The Israeli office in Taipei said today that Hamas says Israel stops help from coming in, but Hamas actually takes the aid convoys. The office asked people to check the facts.</p>
            <p>AFP and Reuters reported that Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, recently shared a video of a 24-year-old Israeli man, Evyatar David. He looked very thin and was in a small concrete tunnel. The video also showed pictures of babies and children in Gaza who looked hungry.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei released a statement today. It said that Israel respects open discussions and protests. But it also asked everyone to use facts that have been checked. It asked them to work together against terrorism and against misusing help meant for people.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei said that the frightening video from Hamas shows an Israeli hostage who is deliberately starving. Hamas says Israel stops humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, but Hamas actually stops the aid convoys. They take the supplies for their fighters. They even sell these supplies at high prices to poor people in Gaza to make money. While Palestinian families are having a hard time, Hamas leaders and fighters appear on camera looking well-fed and happy.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei also said that Hamas used pictures of children with special health problems to get sympathy from other countries. They wrongly showed these children as victims who were intentionally starved by Israel. But these children are actually getting medical care in other countries. Sadly, only a few news groups have corrected this or explained it clearly so far.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei said that the American government had already confirmed that Hamas again said no to a plan that could have ended the problems. Anyone who truly wants the war to stop should ask for all hostages to be set free immediately. They should also ask for Hamas to give up its weapons. They should support rebuilding Gaza with a government led by regular people, not by a violent group that does not care about peace or its people's well-being.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei strongly stated that Israel thanks all friends who chose to see that Hamas's information was wrong. Real and lasting peace and safety can only happen if we work with partners who care about life, help for the future, and say no to terrorism and taking people hostage.</p>
