            <h1>Putin praises Trump for understanding problem, urges Ukraine and Europe not to hinder peace process</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Alaska on August 15. After their talk, Putin said he was happy that Trump wanted to deeply understand the main reasons for the conflict in Ukraine. Putin called the meeting helpful and said it happened with trust and respect between both sides. He hopes that the understanding reached by the U.S. and Russia will start a path to peace in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Putin said he hopes Ukraine and European countries will accept the understanding and peace efforts made by the U.S. and Russia. He hopes they will not create problems for peace or try to stop progress with difficult actions or secret plans.</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump talked for over two hours. Their top foreign officials, a special U.S. representative, and a Russian presidential assistant for foreign affairs were also there. After the meeting, they held a press conference but did not answer questions from reporters.</p>
            <p>Besides the Ukraine issue, Putin spoke a lot about making U.S.-Russia relations normal again and moving from conflict to practical teamwork. He also spoke about how important it is for the two countries to work together. He rarely mentioned how the U.S. helped the Soviet Union during World War II. He also talked about more times in history when the U.S. and Russia fought against a "common enemy" together. This is different from how Moscow usually talks, which often says the Soviet Union was the only "good army" and that Western countries were "ungrateful" after World War II.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the international date line is the border between the U.S. and Russia. He hopes their relationship can also turn a new page, moving from "yesterday" to "tomorrow" in politics. Putin stated that in the last four years, the relationship between the U.S. and Russia became the worst it has been since the end of the Cold War. He said this was not good for either country or for the world.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the last time he spoke with the U.S. government in 2022, he tried to tell the president at the time, Joe Biden, that "there was no need to let the situation lead to such serious results as military actions." He clearly stated then that it was a "big mistake."</p>
            <p>Putin said he agrees with Trump's idea that if Trump had been the U.S. president then, what the U.S. calls the war would not have happened. Putin repeated that he and Trump have a very good, practical, and trusting way of communicating directly. He believes that if they continue like this, the U.S. and Russia can end the conflict in Ukraine as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>In terms of trade, Putin said that since Trump's government started in January this year, trade between the U.S. and Russia has begun to grow by 20%. Putin believes there is great potential for economic and trade cooperation and investment between the two countries. Important areas to consider include working together in the Arctic, as well as in energy, digital technology, high technology, and space. It is also important for the U.S. and Russia to restart talks at the local level, including between the Russian Far East and the U.S. West Coast.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the U.S. and Russia are close neighbors, separated only by the Bering Strait. When he arrived in Alaska, he called Trump "dear neighbor" as he got off the plane, which sounded friendly. Putin also mentioned that Alaska has many historical signs of shared U.S. and Russian history. These include Russian Orthodox churches from the time of the Russian Empire, over 700 place names with Russian origins, and burial sites of Soviet pilots.</p>
            <p>On the issue of Ukraine, Putin's words did not show any big changes. He said that Russia still sees Ukraine as a "brother nation." Because of this, the events in Ukraine are a tragedy and a great sorrow for Russia. He said Russia truly wants to end the conflict.</p>
            <p>Putin repeated that what is happening in Ukraine is a "basic threat to Russia's national security." To make sure the situation in Ukraine is solved for a long time and in a stable way, "all" the main reasons that caused the crisis must be removed. Also, Russia's "reasonable and legal" worries must be considered.</p>
            <p>Putin said that a "fair balance" in security must be brought back in Europe and across the world. He claimed he fully agrees with Trump that Ukraine's security also needs to be ensured, and Russia is "of course willing to work for this."</p>
            <p>Russia started a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In March 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Putin, saying he committed war crimes.</p>

            <h1>Sun Haiyan, Deputy Minister of International Liaison Department of CPC Central Committee, attends reception after being rumored to be detained</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported on August 15 that Sun Haiyan, a Deputy Minister of the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, was held in early August. This was because she was involved in a case with Minister Liu Jianchao. However, the official website of the International Liaison Department showed that Sun Haiyan attended a reception in Beijing on the evening of August 15 to celebrate India's Independence Day. When a Reuters reporter at the event asked her if she had been held or questioned by the authorities, she did not say directly. She only replied, "I am right here."</p>
            <p>On August 15, Reuters had an exclusive report. It used information from three unnamed sources. These sources said that Sun Haiyan was held by the authorities because of her connection to Liu Jianchao. Sun Haiyan was last seen in public on July 31, when she attended a political event in Russia.</p>
            <p>The report at that time said that it was not possible to check if Sun Haiyan and Liu Jianchao were still being held. It also said that neither of them could be reached for comment.</p>
            <p>According to the International Liaison Department's official website, Sun Haiyan met with Pradeep Rawat, the Indian Ambassador to China, in Beijing on August 15. She was also invited to attend the reception held by the Indian Embassy in China to celebrate India's Independence Day.</p>
            <p>Reuters also reported early on August 16 that Sun Haiyan attended a diplomatic event in Beijing on the evening of August 15. The report said that when Sun Haiyan answered questions from a Reuters reporter at the event, she did not directly say if the authorities had held or questioned her. She only said, "I am right here," and called Reuters' report "irresponsible."</p>
            <p>Singapore's Lianhe Zaobao reported on August 16 that according to two sources, the story about Sun Haiyan being held was not true. These sources said she has been working normally for the past two days.</p>
            <p>The report said that it is not clear why Sun Haiyan was questioned. It is understood that in China's official system, when a team leader has a problem, it is normal for other team members to be questioned. This helps supervisors or investigators understand their views on the problem and asks them to state their position. However, these kinds of questions are usually done within the department. It is a bit unusual if someone is taken away for questioning.</p>
            <p>At the time of this report, the official website of the International Liaison Department still had information about Liu Jianchao and Sun Haiyan.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin end Alaska talks, special planes depart one after another</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin finished their meeting in Alaska today. They discussed the war between Russia and Ukraine. After the summit, their private planes left the military base in Alaska one after the other.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Russia fully invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The two sides have been fighting for over three years. Trump and Putin talked about this for about three hours. After the meeting, their special planes took off from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson within minutes of each other.</p>
