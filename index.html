            <h1>International Court to Give First Climate Change Advice: What Are the Main Points?</h1>
            <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will announce its first official advice on climate change today. Many people see this as a very important moment for international law. Agence France-Presse (AFP) has explained the five main points of discussion.</p>
            <p>This is the biggest case the ICJ has ever heard. The judges have looked at thousands of pages of written information and listened to two weeks of talks.</p>
            <p>This advice is expected to be announced today at 1 PM GMT (9 PM Taiwan time). It will likely be hundreds of pages long. It will explain what countries must do to stop climate change and what will happen to countries that cause pollution.</p>
            <h3>Why Do We Need Legal Rules?</h3>
            <p>This is the main point of the case, and it's the first question the ICJ needs to answer about countries' duties for climate change. The judges will try to make all environmental laws into one set of international rules.</p>
            <p>Big polluting countries say that this is not needed. They believe that the rules made under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are enough.</p>
            <p>But others disagree. They think the ICJ should set wider rules that also include human rights law and ocean law.</p>
            <h3>What Should Be the Consequences?</h3>
            <p>The second question for the judges is more difficult. It's about what legal results there will be for the main countries that cause climate change.</p>
            <p>Who is responsible has always been a sensitive topic in climate talks. However, at the UN climate meeting in 2022, rich countries agreed to create a fund. This fund will help countries that are easily affected by climate change deal with the problems caused by past pollution.</p>
            <p>But many big polluting countries say that climate change is a global problem and affects different places in different ways. They argue it's impossible to blame single countries.</p>
            <p>Those who disagree use a basic international law rule: "where there is a right, there is a remedy." This means if someone is responsible, there should be a way to get help or payment.</p>
            <h3>Harmful or Not Harmful?</h3>
            <p>Another important point is about how laws work across countries. This is called the "no-harm rule." It's a key idea in international law. It means that a country should not allow activities inside its borders that could harm other countries.</p>
            <p>Polluting countries say that this rule does not apply to climate change. They say it's impossible to know if one specific source caused harm to another country. Other countries argue that climate change should not be an exception to this rule.</p>
            <h3>When Did Countries Know They Were Causing Harm?</h3>
            <p>One basic disagreement the judges heard during the talks was about when governments first knew that greenhouse gases were harming the Earth. This could affect when any payments for harm should start.</p>
            <h3>Future Generations</h3>
            <p>One of the main groups that pushed for this case in the ICJ was young climate justice activists. A key part of what they want is "fairness for all generations."</p>
            <p>For example, the country of Namibia said that "the effects of climate change are not limited by time." The worst effects will happen decades or even centuries later and will affect people then.</p>
            <p>But developed countries argue that the rights of people who are not yet born are not valid under international law.</p>

            <h1>Korean Woman Who Bit Off Assailant's Tongue Was Sentenced; 61-Year-Old Case to Be Reviewed by Court</h1>
            <p>A South Korean court today reopened a very old case from 61 years ago. In this case, a woman was found guilty after she defended herself from sexual violence. She asked for a new trial because she was inspired by the Me Too movement in recent years.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, in 1964, Choi Mal-ja, who was 19 years old, was attacked by a 21-year-old man in Gimhae City, in the southern part of South Korea.</p>
            <p>Court records show that the man pushed her to the ground and forced his tongue into her mouth. Choi Mal-ja bit off about 1.5 centimeters of the man's tongue to try and escape.</p>
            <p>This case became one of the most argued-about sexual violence judgments in South Korea. The attacker was only given a 6-month prison sentence, suspended for 2 years, for illegal entry and threats. He was not punished for trying to commit rape.</p>
            <p>However, Choi Mal-ja was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for 2 years, because the court said she caused serious injury.</p>
            <p>At that time, the court said that her actions to fight back "went beyond what is considered fair self-defense allowed by law."</p>
            <p>In 2017, the Me Too movement started around the world. This brought attention back to Choi Mal-ja's case after many decades. It also made her want to get justice for what happened to her.</p>
            <p>In South Korea, large protests for women's rights led to many changes in laws. These changes include protecting the right to abortion and giving stronger punishments for illegal filming crimes.</p>
            <p>Choi Mal-ja asked for a new trial in 2020, but a lower court first said no. After many years of trying and appealing, the Supreme Court of South Korea finally decided in 2024 that the case could be reviewed again.</p>
            <p>Choi Mal-ja spoke to reporters today before her new trial at the Busan District Court. She said, "For 61 years, the country made me live like a criminal."</p>
            <p>She said she hopes that future generations can "live in a world without sexual violence, where they have human rights and happy lives."</p>
