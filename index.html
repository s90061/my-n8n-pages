Starlite Visual, a company that makes digital display systems, plans to be listed on the stock market in early August. The company expects good growth because its main customers in the US are building many new digital outdoor advertising displays. Also, older displays that are more than 15 years old need to be replaced, which will bring more business.

Starlite Visual has about five months of orders already. The company plans to build a new factory to increase production by 1.5 times to meet future demand. They expect that spending on digital outdoor advertising in the US will grow by 11% each year from 2023 to 2028.

**Taiwan's Reciprocal Tariffs Not Yet Announced, Stock and Currency Markets Weaken, New Taiwan Dollar Drops to Two-Week Low**

Taiwan's stock and currency markets are weaker because the US has not yet announced its new tariffs on Taiwan. This situation is making investors worried. The New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) has fallen to its lowest point in two weeks against the US dollar, closing at 29.296 today.

The stock market also went down by 136.06 points, and foreign investors sold many shares. Experts say that the NTD might not go back to a stronger value soon because of the unclear tariff situation and the strong US dollar. Other Asian currencies have also weakened against the US dollar today.

**Philippines: Chinese Militia Ship Used Parachute Anchor, Destroying Large Area of Coral Reefs**

The Philippine government says that a Chinese militia ship damaged a large area of coral reefs near Thitu Island. The ship used a special "parachute anchor" that harmed about 465 square meters of coral. This damage is estimated to be worth around 5.73 million New Taiwan Dollars.

The incident happened on June 7, when the Chinese ship got stuck for three hours and then left. Philippine experts investigated the area and found the discarded anchor. They explained that corals covered by the anchor will die because they cannot get sunlight, and marine life will lose their homes. Filipino divers tried to remove the heavy anchor but could not.
