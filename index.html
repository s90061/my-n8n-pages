Walking is becoming very popular again as a way to stay healthy and happy. Experts say that even a short walk every day can improve your physical health, like your heart and bones. It also helps your mental well-being by reducing stress and improving your mood. Unlike going to the gym, walking is free and easy for most people to do anywhere. Many people are now sharing their walking journeys online, which inspires others to start. This trend shows that simple activities can have a big positive effect on our daily lives.

**The Success of the Four-Day Work Week**

A new study shows that working four days a week instead of five can be good for companies. The study looked at trials of the four-day work week in many businesses. It found that most companies saw better results, not worse. Employees were happier and healthier, and they took fewer sick days. Businesses also found it easier to hire new staff and keep their current workers. Importantly, productivity, which means how much work gets done, often stayed the same or even improved. Only a small number of companies decided to go back to the traditional five-day week after the trial. This suggests that a shorter work week could be a successful model for the future.

**Cheaper European Travel This Summer**

This summer, travelling to some popular places in Europe might be more affordable than expected. Experts say that more flight options are now available, especially from North America. New budget airlines are flying more often and offering cheaper tickets. This increased competition between airlines means prices could go down. Also, while popular cities like Paris or Rome are still busy, more travellers are choosing to visit other European regions or countries, like Eastern Europe. This helps spread out the demand for flights and hotels, leading to potentially better prices for travellers who plan ahead. So, if you're thinking about a European holiday, it could be a good time to look for deals.
