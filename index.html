            <h1>Bolivian Election Starts; Ruling Left-Wing Party Might Lose Power Due to High Inflation</h1>
            <p>Today, Bolivia is holding elections for president and parliament. The country is experiencing the worst inflation in 40 years, so the economy is the main topic. The left-wing party, which has been in power for a long time, might lose control. However, the two main right-wing candidates for president do not have more than 30% support in surveys. This means the presidential election will likely go to a second round.</p>
            <p>Reuters reports that surveys for the Bolivian presidential election show that the right-wing candidates, businessman Samuel Doria Medina and former president Jorge Quiroga, are leading. But neither has more than 30% support. About a quarter of voters have not yet decided who they will vote for.</p>
            <p>Surveys also show that the Movement for Socialism, Bolivia's left-wing party, might lose this presidential election after being in power for almost 20 years.</p>
            <p>Former president Evo Morales, who led the Movement for Socialism from 2006 to 2019, is not allowed to run for president again, as decided by Bolivia's constitutional court.</p>
            <p>Voting in Bolivia started at 8 AM local time and finished at 4 PM. Early results are expected after 9 PM local time (9 AM on August 18th in Taiwan). The full official results will be announced within 7 days.</p>
            <p>If no candidate gets more than half of the votes in the first round of the Bolivian presidential election, or if no one gets more than 40% of the votes and is 10 points ahead of the second-place candidate, a second election will be held on October 19th.</p>
            <p>Bolivia's weak economy is what voters are most worried about. This year, prices in the country have risen more than in other Latin American countries. There is also a shortage of fuel and US dollars. Some local people have started to put their money into cryptocurrencies to protect it.</p>

            <h1>National Palace Museum Holds Its First Go Tournament, Players from 4 to 70 Years Old Compete</h1>
            <p>Today, over a thousand people came to the National Palace Museum's Northern Branch not just to see exhibits, but also to watch a competition. The museum held its first Go tournament for its special exhibit, "People and Go â€“ Ancient Go Culture." This brought back the lively feeling of watching Go games in old times. There were 300 Go players, aged from 4 to 70.</p>
            <p>This year is the National Palace Museum's 100th anniversary. They have many important exhibits. The "People and Go â€“ Ancient Go Culture" exhibit opened recently and many families have visited. The museum's "National Palace Museum Hundred Years Go Tournament," which started today, offers a cultural experience of playing Go. This makes the 100th anniversary a time for the museum's treasures to connect with Taiwanese society.</p>
            <p>The museum announced today that players of all ages, from children and teenagers to adults and older people, took part in the Go tournament. They could all feel the special charm of "playing with hands" (referring to Go) in this unique place. All players received a special certificate and a folding fan. The top 4 players in each group also got an exhibit catalog and a trophy shaped like black and white Go stones, showing respect for the old tradition of professional Go players who think deeply and gently wave their fans.</p>
            <p>On the evening of August 15th, the museum's Facebook page had a poll to guess the winner of the top group. Lai You-cheng was the most popular choice and won two out of three games. But he narrowly lost in the end and became the second-place winner. Guo Nai-fu won the championship at the National Palace Museum's 100th Anniversary Go Tournament.</p>
            <p>Besides the 300 players, more than a thousand people came to the museum's Northern Branch, including family and friends who watched the games. Before and after the competition, people walked through the exhibit to learn about the history and meaning behind the game that Go players love. The exhibit shows ancient objects from the Han to Qing dynasties. It also has a special part called "Taiwan Go Scene," which shows how Go grew in Taiwan from local communities to become famous around the world.</p>
            <p>Many important guests were at the competition today. These included the museum's director, Hsiao Tsung-huang, and people who care about Go in Taiwan like Chen Qian-yu from the Taipei City Sports Federation, Ma Heng-li from the Taiwan Go Association, and Chang Chao-fen from the Chinese Go Association. Also, eight top amateur 7-dan Go players, including Lai You-cheng, Lin Shih-yao, Chung Cheng-en, Wang Chi-lin, Yeh Kang-ting, Shih Meng-chen, Chuang Hao-yu, and Kuo Nai-fu, were there.</p>
