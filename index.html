            <h1>Pingtung's Dapu Community Keeps Hakka Culture Alive with Capon Competition for Bo Gong Sheng</h1>
            <p>Pingtung, September 23 (CNA) Dapu Community in Nanju Township, Pingtung County, is known as a 'Hakka dialect island.' Its local temple, Dapu Fude Temple, is celebrating 'Bo Gong Sheng' (Birthday of Earth God). Yesterday, they held a capon (castrated rooster) weight competition. Tonight, there will be an awards ceremony and a special dinner. This event helps to keep the 100-year-old tradition of Hakka people moving south alive.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Dapu Community Development Association, Dapu Community is a 'Hakka dialect island' in Nanju Township. It only has two neighborhoods in Wanhua Village, with about 70 to 80 homes and over 300 people. The villages around it mostly speak Taiwanese. The people here moved from the Hsinchu and Miaoli areas a long time ago. They brought their northern Hakka culture with them.</p>
            <p>Dapu Fude Temple, the main temple of Dapu Community, celebrates Bo Gong Sheng every year on the second day of the eighth lunar month. They have two days of plays to thank the gods. The day before, they hold a capon weight competition. On Bo Gong Sheng, they kill the winning chicken to honor the god. This year, the winning chicken weighed 14.1 catties (about 8.5 kg). It was raised by 73-year-old Zhuang Huan-xin, who often wins.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Huan-xin told CNA that chickens are hard to raise now because of the weather. When it's too hot, they need fans. When it's too cold, they need lights. The temperature must stay around 26 degrees Celsius. He took care of the winning chicken for a whole year. He said it was 'harder than taking care of a child.' He is a wax apple farmer. The prize money for the capon competition is only NT$3,000. He raises chickens seriously, not for money, but to continue the Dapu Hakka spirit.</p>
            <p>Dai Hsiao-ping, a local representative from Nanju Township and a daughter of Dapu Community, said her ancestors moved here from Hsinchu and brought their Hakka culture. In the past, the older people in the village were farmers. They raised chickens, ducks, and geese in their traditional courtyards. What was special was that Hakka people would raise capons that could grow very fat. They would raise them for a year just for worshipping and and offering to the gods. Now, the Fude Temple has been built for 40 years. The younger generation should continue these traditions. This year, they still have the capon competition and plays for the gods. But for the first time, a follower gave a blackfin tuna as a gift. There was a show of cutting the fish at the special dinner.</p>
            <p>According to the Dapu Community Development Association, in 1912 (the first year of the Republic of China), the Dapu area was still the riverbed of the Shalun River. There were no people, and wild grass grew along the riverbanks. Dai Ran, a person who moved from a Hakka village in Hukou Township, Hsinchu County, placed a stone under a large banyan tree behind the current site. He worshipped it as the Earth God. The temple was finally built in 1985 and completed with the moving of the god's spirit into the new temple.</p>

            <h1>Famous Moose Crosses Central European Countries, Caught in Austria and Released Near Czech Border</h1>
            <p>Vienna, September 23 (CNA) A young male moose named Emil became very famous this summer. He traveled through several countries in Central Europe. He even had almost 26,000 followers on Facebook. But yesterday, Austrian officials caught him. They then released him near the border with the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Emil probably traveled south from Poland or the Czech Republic to Austria. In the past few weeks, he was in international news. People also followed his every move on social media.</p>
            <p>But yesterday, Emil came dangerously close to a busy highway in Upper Austria. Wildlife officials in Austria used tranquilizers to catch him. His adventure ended there.</p>
            <p>Emil was fitted with a GPS device. Then, he was released back near the border between Austria and the Czech Republic. Austrian officials said they will watch where Emil goes for 30 days.</p>
            <p>Austrian wildlife officials released Emil near the Sumava National Park in the Czech Republic. This national park is at the edge of the Bohemian Forest. It is home to a small group of moose.</p>
            <p>The Austrian newspaper 'Kurier' reported that Emil's leaving was 'not completely his own choice.' Local media compared this to the Austrian government's strict policy of sending people away.</p>
            <p>Tierschutz Austria, an animal protection group in Austria, said that catching Emil was 'not clear enough.' They also said that there should be clear rules for hunting to better protect wild animals.</p>
