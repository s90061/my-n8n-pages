            <h1>Israeli Foreign Minister: War Could End if Hamas Releases Hostages and Disarms</h1>
            <p>Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, said today in Jerusalem that the war in Gaza could end. He was speaking at a press conference with Denmark's Foreign Minister. He said that if Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, lets go of the people they are holding and gives up their weapons, the war could finish.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that yesterday, Hamas repeated its usual position. They said they would release all the hostages if Israel agrees to stop the war and takes its soldiers out of Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Israel used air attacks to destroy a tall building in Gaza City. Israel said that Hamas was using this building to "watch" Israeli soldiers. Israel also said they took "steps to reduce harm to ordinary people."</p>
            <p>Hamas strongly disagreed with this attack. They said that they do not use homes or other buildings for military reasons.</p>
