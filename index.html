            <h1>Vice President Says Young People's Ideas Help Taiwan's Global Connections</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim was at an awards event for university students who help rural areas. She explained that "returning" is more than just coming back. It means bringing new skills, experiences, and ideas from outside to rural areas. This helps these areas grow with fresh energy and creative ways of doing things. Then, these new ideas can go out into the world again. She said that returning is not an end, but a cycle that keeps going.</p>
            <p>The Vice President shared that she went to the same event last year. She saw many creative projects there. Later, she used some of these items as special gifts when she met with visitors from other countries.</p>
            <p>For example, students from Yunlin University of Science and Technology used a 3D printer to make special potato snacks. When the governor of Idaho, USA, visited Taiwan, the Vice President asked these students and their teachers to print the words "Taiwan" and "Idaho" using potatoes from both places. They made delicious potato snacks. She shared these with the guest and asked them to guess which potatoes came from Taiwan and which came from the US.</p>
            <p>The Vice President also said that last year she saw beautiful cloth made with natural dyes by a community in Keelung. The colors were very calming. She later asked for two pieces of this cloth and put them in frames in her office. Visitors thought they were very expensive art pieces. But they were actually just summer projects made by university students. This showed how good the quality was and how attractive they were.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao hopes that the world will keep seeing Taiwan and the new ideas from its rural areas. She said that Taiwan is often known internationally for important world issues or its high-tech industries. Many people do not know that the warmest parts of Taiwan are actually in its rural areas.</p>
            <p>She also said that the government wants all parts of Taiwan to grow well. Besides Taiwan's strong technology industries, the government hopes that technology and artificial intelligence can also help in areas like healthcare, services, banking, and farming. Not long ago, she visited a smart farming exhibition. She saw many young people bringing their different skills and ideas to rural areas. This helps farmers have a more secure life and also makes farming more valuable.</p>
            <p>The Vice President mentioned that rural development is also important for the country's food supply. Rural areas are not only the warm, fertile places that older people know well, but also places where young people can find hope and a future. She believes that different generations and industries can find opportunities in rural areas.</p>
            <p>Also, the Vice President said that President Lai Ching-te cares a lot about young people. Last week, the stock market reached a new high, and the value of Taiwan's exports was higher than South Korea's, even though South Korea has twice Taiwan's population. This makes people feel that society is growing well. However, not everyone owns stocks, especially young people.</p>
            <p>She said that people might feel that the benefits of economic growth are not always shared equally. Because of this, the "Rural Return Program" is even more important to bring new ideas to rural areas. At the same time, the government is working hard to make life easier for young people. This includes help with rent, special housing loans for young people, and money for childcare. There are also programs to help with school fees and a "Youth Billion Dream Project."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Wins Third Place in U18 Baseball World Cup, Beats South Korea</h1>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup happens every two years. In the year before, the top three teams from the Asian Youth Baseball Championship get to play in the U18 World Cup. Taiwan won against strong team Japan in the last Asian Youth Baseball Championship. This means they could join the U18 World Cup again. In the past three World Cups, Taiwan played in the final game. This time, they won third place.</p>
            <p>On September 14, in Okinawa, Taiwan played a tough game against South Korea for third place in the U18 Baseball World Cup. Taiwan scored 2 runs in the fifth inning. When the score was tied in the seventh inning, Chiang Ting-yi hit the ball at the right time, and Taiwan scored another run to take the lead. There was a moment with a questionable decision, but it did not greatly change the game's outcome. Taiwan finally won the game 3-2 and took home the third-place trophy. After the game, the players were happy and hugged each other on the field to celebrate.</p>

            <h1>Special Moment in U18 Third Place Baseball Game: Tseng Sheng-en's Run Counts After Review</h1>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup happens every two years. In the year before, the top three teams from the Asian Youth Baseball Championship get to play in the U18 World Cup. Taiwan won against strong team Japan in the last Asian Youth Baseball Championship. This means they could join the U18 World Cup again. In the past three World Cups, Taiwan played in the final game. This time, they won third place.</p>
            <p>On September 14, in Okinawa, Taiwan played against South Korea in the U18 Baseball World Cup third-place game. The game was very close. In the fifth inning, Taiwan scored 2 runs and took the lead. In the sixth inning, South Korea scored to make the game tied again. In the seventh inning, something unexpected happened. Tseng Sheng-en ran to home plate and bumped into the catcher. At first, the umpire said Tseng Sheng-en was out and tried to make him leave the game. But after watching the video again, the decision was changed. The umpire said there was an obstruction (meaning the catcher blocked Tseng Sheng-en), so Tseng Sheng-en's run counted. This made Taiwan lead 3-2 over South Korea.</p>
            <p>The game between Taiwan and South Korea for third place in the U18 Baseball World Cup was very close. After six innings, the score was 2-2. In the top of the seventh inning, Taiwan started to attack. Chiang Ting-yi hit the ball, and Tseng Sheng-en ran to home plate. He collided with the catcher. At first, the umpire called him out and gestured for Tseng Sheng-en to leave the game. But after a video review, the decision was changed to obstruction, and Tseng Sheng-en's run was counted. This put Taiwan ahead.</p>
