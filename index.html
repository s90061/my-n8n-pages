            <h1>Taiwan and US Work Together More Closely to Stop Drug Crime</h1>
            <p>To make working together against drug crime across borders stronger, Taiwan's office in the US and the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) signed an agreement in Virginia, USA. This agreement will help Taiwan's High Prosecutors Office and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) share information better and investigate crimes more effectively.</p>
            <p>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) announced today that the 4th yearly "Cross-Border Anti-Drug Cooperation Forum" happened for the first time in the US on August 18. Before the forum, Taiwan's office in the US and AIT signed an agreement. This agreement will improve how they share information, making it easier to investigate and charge groups that smuggle drugs across borders.</p>
            <p>John Scott, the head of DEA's Asia Pacific office, said that this forum shows that Taiwan and the US are both determined to fight drug smuggling together. The DEA knows that working with other countries is very important to stop drug smuggling groups. This forum helps to make their partnership stronger, share information, and plan ways to fight the global drug trade.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's High Prosecutors Office stated that this year's forum and the signed agreement mark a new beginning for stronger international law enforcement work. All these efforts have one clear goal: to break up drug smuggling groups across borders and keep people on both sides of the Pacific Ocean safe and healthy.</p>
            <p>AIT also said that Taiwan's new rules to stop fake medicine making started on March 31, and this was a main topic at the forum. All machines, parts, and molds from Taiwan used to make pills must now have a serial number printed on them. This is the first time such a rule has been made in Asia, and it is a very important step to stop pill-making equipment from being used illegally.</p>
            <p>AIT mentioned that this forum also showed how well the DEA's Taipei Narcotics Liaison Office works with Taiwan's police and other law enforcement agencies. For example, they worked together to stop groups that smuggle Ketamine and Methamphetamine from the Golden Triangle to Taiwan and other parts of Asia.</p>
            <p>AIT explained that the forum was held at the DEA headquarters. AIT and Taiwan's office in the US led the meeting. Important law enforcement officials from the DEA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the US Postal Inspection Service, US Customs and Border Protection, and Taiwan's law enforcement agencies all took part.</p>

            <h1>Lawmakers Cook Meals for Disaster Victims in Chiayi</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Chiayi County. Today, lawmakers from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), including Tsai Yi-yu, Lin Shu-fen, Wang Mei-hui, and Kuo Yu-ching, along with Wu Yin-ning, the deputy executive director of the Executive Yuan's Central Joint Services Center, held a shared meal event in Yichu Township's Toutsu Community. They acted like chefs to show their care through action.</p>
            <p>Lin Shu-fen, who started the event, told reporters that she felt very sad when she saw people in the southern parts of Taiwan suffering from the typhoon and floods. She remembered when Typhoon Wayne blew off her own roof and caused power and water outages, so she completely understood how the disaster victims felt.</p>
            <p>Lin Shu-fen said that because of this, she suggested cooking meals for the elderly in the community. She also brought love from the head and followers of Fuan Temple in Luzhou, New Taipei. They donated 500,000 New Taiwan Dollars each to the social welfare departments of Chiayi County and Tainan City. She hoped this would comfort the local people and help them stay strong.</p>
            <p>Tsai Yi-yu said that during the typhoon, he worked hard to organize repair work. Many supporting tasks in the Legislative Yuan relied on the great help from lawmakers like Lin Shu-fen and Kuo Yu-ching. Today, he felt very moved and thankful to see his supportive friends come to Chiayi in person, moving from the meeting hall to the kitchen.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-ching and Wang Mei-hui also said that spending mealtime with the elderly and listening to their thoughts is the most real happiness for a lawmaker. This "cooking" event, full of warmth, not only made the elderly feel full but also comforted the hearts of the people in the disaster area, bringing warm and strong support for rebuilding after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Tsai Yi-yu said that the atmosphere at the meal event in Yichu Toutsu Community was very lively. The lawmakers acted like chefs, preparing food with the elderly and chatting happily, with lots of laughter.</p>

            <h1>Meta Fined NT$2.5 Million for Not Taking Down Scam Ads on Time (Third Fine)</h1>
            <p>The Digital Industry Administration (DIA) of the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) announced today that Meta's Facebook platform did not take down scam ads within 24 hours after being told to by the Taipei City Government. This is against the law for preventing harm from fraud. Because of this, MODA has fined Meta NT$2.5 million. This is the third time MODA has fined Meta.</p>
            <p>Meta said that it continues to work closely with Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs and law enforcement to fight and remove scam content from its platform. One main reason for this fine was that government agencies sent notices to Meta on paper, not electronically. This made Meta's review process slower. Even so, Meta still removed 95% of the ads that were reported on paper within the 24-hour time limit. Meta will keep working with MODA to make the reporting process better, to make sure scam ads are reviewed and removed even faster.</p>
            <p>The DIA said that this case started when the Taipei City Government sent 1,763 cases of illegal activity by Meta in June 18 and July 14 this year. This included 77 ads that were not taken down within 24 hours as required by the fraud prevention law, and 1,686 cases where information about the person who asked for the ad to be placed was not given. After getting the reports, MODA started an investigation and confirmed that all the reported scam ads had been taken down.</p>
            <p>The DIA explained that their investigation found that even though Meta removed 95% of the scam ads provided by the Taipei City Government, the Taipei City Government sent the reports on paper, not as electronic files. Meta was slow to process these paper reports, so 5% of the cases were not taken down within 24 hours as required. Considering the violations, MODA fined Meta NT$2.5 million under the fraud prevention law and asked Meta to fix the issue within 30 days.</p>
            <p>Regarding Meta not giving information about the people who placed the ads to the Taipei City Government, the DIA said that Meta had already given the relevant information to the National Police Agency of the Ministry of the Interior, which follows the rules. MODA will later ask the Ministry of the Interior to think about setting up a single point of contact system. This will make it easier for companies and local governments to follow the rules.</p>
            <p>The DIA stressed that MODA follows the law and makes sure companies follow legal rules. Besides asking companies to fix problems by a deadline, to make the process faster, MODA will help local governments and the four main internet companies set up electronic ways to send notices. In the future, scam ads will be reported and taken down quickly through the online scam reporting and checking system built by MODA. This will lower the risk of people seeing scam ads.</p>
            <p>On May 22 this year, MODA decided that Meta's Facebook ad information was not fully open and did not show who asked for the ads. MODA fined Meta NT$1 million for the first time under the fraud prevention law. This was also the first time a company was fined since the fraud prevention law started. On June 30, MODA explained that their investigation found Meta's ad service had problems in its system, which broke the fraud prevention law. MODA then fined Meta NT$15 million.</p>
