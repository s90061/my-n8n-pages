        const text = `**Trump Asked African Countries to Take US Immigrants; Nigeria Says No**

Nigeria's government said today that it will not accept people from Venezuela who were sent away from the United States. Earlier, American news said that President Trump was asking African countries to take people who were removed from the US.

Sending immigrants to other countries is a main policy of Trump's government to stop people from coming in illegally. For example, hundreds of immigrants were sent to prisons in El Salvador, a country in Central America.

Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Yusuf Tuggar, told Channels Television, "The US is putting a lot of pressure on African countries to take Venezuelans sent from the US. Some are even coming straight from prisons." He added, "It is hard for Nigeria to accept Venezuelan prisoners."

Tuggar also hinted that the US threats of high taxes on BRICS countries might be related to the immigrant issue. Nigeria is a member of BRICS.

Yesterday, Trump met with leaders from five West African countries at the White House. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump's government is asking these countries to take people sent out of the US.

The president of Guinea-Bissau told reporters that Trump talked about sending immigrants to other countries, but "he did not ask us to take immigrants." He was at the White House meeting with leaders from Senegal, Liberia, Mauritania, and Gabon.

Trump had also sent hundreds of immigrants to Panama, a country in Central America. Some of them were sent even before their requests for protection were processed. The US government had also sent hundreds more to El Salvador after saying they were part of Venezuelan gangs.

**Jiekou Payment Stops Being Used by Some Stores; momo and PChome Start Using It Again**

Jiekou Payment faced problems when some stores stopped using it. This happened because of a disagreement between its parent company and another company, Taishan, about buying shares. After National Electronics stopped using it first, other places like Honhui Plaza and ETMall also stopped. But then, momo and PChome, two big online stores, said they would use Jiekou Payment again later today.

Convenience stores like FamilyMart, Hi-Life, and OK Mart all said that the Jiekou Payment system is working normally.

The new management team at Taishan said that the decision to invest NT$3.6 billion in Jiekou Financial Technology was not valid. They asked for their money back and were allowed to get it. On July 10, the court went to seal Jiekou Financial Technology's assets.

After news of the seal became public, users and stores worried about their money. This morning, more and more reports came out that stores were stopping Jiekou Payment.

National Electronics, an electronics store, was the first to announce this morning on its Facebook page that it would stop using Jiekou Payment from July 11.

For online stores, Fubonmomo first said this afternoon that to keep customers' money safe and protect its partners, momo would stop using Jiekou Payment from today. They said this was to control risks quickly and reduce problems for their sales and users.

However, closer to evening, Fubonmomo said again that after looking at Jiekou Payment's money trust system and getting information from the government, they have now started using Jiekou Payment again.

PChome also said earlier that it had temporarily closed Jiekou Payment. But in the evening, they updated their statement, saying that PChome 24h shopping had temporarily stopped Jiekou Payment, but after checking its money trust system and getting information from the government, it has now started using Jiekou Payment again. They will keep watching the market and government advice to make sure customers' rights and safe transactions are protected.

Shopee said that its platform offers many ways to pay, and Jiekou Payment is just one of them. Not all sellers on the platform use it. Sellers who use Jiekou Payment can manage their payment options through their seller account. Shopee also said it continues to watch how stable the payment system is to protect sellers' rights.

ETMall said that to keep transactions safe and continuous, they stopped Jiekou Payment from today as a quick way to control risk and protect customers and partners. They still offer other ways to pay, and their services are normal, with orders and deliveries happening as usual.

For convenience stores, Uni-President Chain Store did not comment. FamilyMart and OK Mart said their systems are working normally. Hi-Life also said that their payments from Jiekou Payment are normal, and they do not plan to stop using it for now. They will check the situation carefully later to make sure they offer many stable ways to pay.

For department stores, Honhui Plaza said that to protect customers, they have completely stopped using Jiekou Payment. Far Eastern Department Stores do not use Jiekou Payment at all.

Watsons, a pharmacy and beauty store, said that they have temporarily stopped Jiekou Payment both online and in their stores.

For restaurants, Dali Breakfast has announced on Facebook that they have stopped using Jiekou Payment. Chain restaurants like Wang Steak and Tsukemen said they do not use Jiekou Payment.

Jiekou Payment said that some stores and people are indeed worried. They hope everyone understands that electronic payment money is held safely in trust accounts and is separate from the company's own money. They thanked many partners for still supporting them.

Jiekou Payment also said that the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) explained earlier that electronic payment companies must put 100% of users' money into a trust bank account. This money is kept strictly separate from the company's own money. Jiekou Payment follows this rule, so the money in the trust account is not affected by the parent company's issues and is safe.

Jiekou Payment added that Financial Information Service Co., which handles domestic consumer financial payment systems, also said that Jiekou Payment's bank transfers (including transfer services) are working normally, and related funds are kept as required. Jiekou Payment said it is still working closely with the government and partners to make sure it continues to provide stable and safe services. Many stores are also starting to use it again, and transactions are becoming normal.
