            <h1>A Doctor's Words of Courage: A Person with HIV Lives Peacefully for 40 Years</h1>
            <p>For A-Zhen (not her real name), who is 61, getting HIV was once her biggest fear. She was afraid to tell anyone. But a doctor told her, "It's like a cold; with medicine, you will slowly get better." This gave her the courage to face it. Now, she has lived with HIV for 40 years. She is most happy that she did not pass it to her daughter.</p>
            <p>A-Zhen's husband also had HIV. He did not get treatment and sadly passed away later. A-Zhen came to Taiwan for work. A blood test showed she had HIV. Today, she shared her 40-year journey with HIV at a camp for women with HIV, organized by the Taiwan Lourdes Association.</p>
            <p>"At that time, I was completely afraid to tell anyone about this," A-Zhen said, thinking back to those worried days. She felt even more thankful for the doctor's words, which gave her hope: "The doctor told me it's like a cold, and with medicine, I will slowly get better." But she was still scared about possibly giving it to her daughter.</p>
            <p>After A-Zhen was sent to Lourdes, she found out that many other people were going through the same thing. Many years later, when her daughter grew up, she finally found the courage to tell her the truth. Luckily, her daughter's test result was negative, which removed a long-held worry from her heart.</p>
            <p>According to statistics from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), by the end of 2024, the total number of people with HIV in Taiwan was 45,381. Only 5% of these were women. Because there are fewer of them, the Taiwan Lourdes Association says that women with HIV are often left out. They have to deal with the illness and social pressure quietly.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Lourdes Association pointed out that many women with HIV also take care of their families. They are daughters and mothers. But when their own health is in danger, they cannot get enough help. They often hide their illness because they fear being judged. This means they cannot let out their emotional stress and miss chances to get medical and social support.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Lourdes Association said that in the past, HIV services mostly focused on gay men and people who use drugs. The identities, experiences, and needs of women were often forgotten. So, since 2019, they have held a special camp each year just for women with HIV. They want to create a special, safe, and understanding place for them.</p>
            <p>Now, medical treatments have improved. The idea of "U=U" (Undetectable = Untransmittable) is becoming more common. The Taiwan Lourdes Association stressed that HIV is no longer a deadly disease. For most women with HIV, the real difficulty is not the illness itself, but society's lack of understanding. They ask society to seriously look at the situation of women with HIV. They also ask for a review of how HIV services are given, to make sure everyone gets care and help.</p>

            <h1>Russia Claims to Take Another Village in Dnipropetrovsk Region, Moving from East to Central Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Today, Russia said its soldiers have taken another village in the Dnipropetrovsk region in central Ukraine. Russia said its army moved into this region at the start of July.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), Russia's Ministry of Defense stated that its troops have taken the village of Novomykolaivka. This village is near the border of the Donetsk region, where much of the fighting is happening.</p>
            <p>AFP could not check if this statement is true.</p>
            <p>An online war map called DeepState, run by Ukrainian military experts, shows that Kyiv still controls the village.</p>
            <p>The Russian army has better equipment and many more soldiers than the Ukrainian army. In recent months, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine and has gained ground in the eastern part of the country.</p>
            <p>At the end of August, Kyiv first said that Russian forces had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region. Moscow had already claimed to be moving forward there in early August.</p>
            <p>Currently, the Russian army controls about one-fifth of Ukraine's land.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin wants Ukraine to pull its soldiers out of the Donbas area in the east. This is a condition for a ceasefire. However, Kyiv has clearly said no to this.</p>
            <p>The Dnipropetrovsk region is not one of the five Ukrainian areas that Moscow has officially said belong to Russia. These five areas are Donetsk, Kherson, Lugansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Crimea.</p>

            <h1>Lai Ching-te's Meeting in New Taipei Focuses on False Information and Fighting Scams, No Talk of Elections</h1>
            <p>Today, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) held a national party meeting in New Taipei City. After the meeting, Su Chiao-hui, who is a lawmaker and the head of the DPP in New Taipei City, said the meeting focused on important issues for people's lives, such as the economy, stopping false information, and fighting scams. When asked if they talked about the 2026 New Taipei City mayoral election, she replied that they did not mention it at all.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the DPP's national party meeting was held with local party officials in New Taipei City. President Lai Ching-te, who is also the DPP chairman, along with DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung and Deputy Secretary-General Ho Po-wen, were there. Su Chiao-hui, along with New Taipei City Council members Tai Wei-shan and Cho Kuan-ting, spoke to reporters afterward to share what happened at the meeting.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui said that President Lai Ching-te led the DPP central party team to New Taipei City for a meeting with local party officials that lasted over two hours. During the meeting, they mainly discussed policies from the central government and local areas. People from local levels shared their ideas, and these were discussed with the central government.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui pointed out that the meeting focused on economic issues that affect people's daily lives. In the future, this includes not only high-tech industries but also small and medium-sized businesses. They talked about helpful policies needed when facing problems like US tariffs. They also discussed special offers and benefits for people, from students to older family members. These need to be improved, made faster, and advertised well.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui also mentioned that local officials told the central party and government teams that they must stop false information faster. President Lai Ching-te and Hsu Kuo-yung then explained the reasons and details of the policies the central government is working on to the local officials. They also said that if more needs to be done, they will keep working harder. They said the team works as one, central and local together, and everyone must try their best.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui shared that, overall, it was a very positive meeting between the central and local governments. Those who attended also said they hoped for more meetings like this in the future, without strict rules. She hoped the central government would take these practical ideas back to make national policies better and more complete.</p>
            <p>When asked about the New Taipei City mayoral election, Su Chiao-hui replied that it was not mentioned at all during the meeting.</p>
            <p>Tai Wei-shan said that they talked a lot about false and incorrect information. She said that not only the DPP but all political parties should take responsibility. They should work together to change laws to deal with false information and stop it from spreading.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting explained that besides preventing false information, another main point was fighting scams. President Lai responded to all the suggestions from the council members. Regarding scams, President Lai clearly stated that they will work harder to fight them. He also mentioned that laws related to fighting scams have already passed, and the government will make fighting scams a key job.</p>
