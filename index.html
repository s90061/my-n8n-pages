            <h1>Mazu High School Brings in New Players, Aims for Top League This Season</h1>
            <p>Mazu High School's basketball team has brought in five players from Taiwan this year. This is unusual. The local players were surprised. Yang Haowei, from Ta-cheng Junior High in Taoyuan, joked that Mazu is a good place, except for slow internet.</p>
            <p>Mazu is holding the 2025 Mazu High School New Southbound International Sports Competition. The Mazu High School basketball team lost to Taiwan Sport University, 34 to 75. But coach Zeng Qinlun was not worried. He told the Central News Agency that he didn't blame his team because they have 11 first-year students playing against older university students.</p>
            <p>This year, the Mazu High School basketball team looks very different. Many local people didn't recognize some of the new faces. Zeng Qinlun said that five players are "foreign aid" from Taiwan. This season, they will try to play in the top division (A-level) of the HBL High School Basketball League for the first time.</p>
            <p>Liu Shuwei, who will be in his second year, is a local player from Mazu High School. He said that when the coach first told him players were coming from Taiwan, he thought, "How can that be?" But soon, the new teammates were there, and he was "very surprised."</p>
            <p>Liu Mingzhe went to Longmen Junior High in Taipei when he was younger. He moved from a big city to a rural area. He said he is still not used to it. But Yang Haowei, from Ta-cheng Junior High in Taoyuan, has a good attitude. He said, "Besides the slow internet, there's nothing bad here. The scenery is good, the environment is nice, and there's not much to do at night."</p>
            <p>Kong Wuyunxi, also known as "Xiaohei," also came from Ta-cheng in Taoyuan. He didn't play much in junior high. When he finished, he thought about changing to play korfball. But his coach and old teammate Yang Haowei convinced him to join the Mazu team. He said, "I want to try hard again, and I also want to be chosen for the U18 national team."</p>
            <p>Lin Ruqian was teammates with Yang Haowei and Kong Wuyunxi in junior high. But at that time, he was just a practice player. When he heard he could play more at Mazu High School, he quickly said yes. He smiled shyly and said, "I just want to play basketball, and I don't regret it at all."</p>

            <h1>Former Sri Lankan President Arrested for Corruption, Political Rivals Show Support</h1>
            <p>Sri Lanka's former President, Ranil Wickremesinghe, was arrested by the new left-wing government for corruption. After he was held, three other former Sri Lankan presidents, who used to be his political rivals, supported him today. They said his arrest was a "planned attack" on democracy.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that these three people are Chandrika Kumaratunga, 80, Mahinda Rajapaksa, 79, and Maithripala Sirisena, 73.</p>
            <p>They were political opponents of Wickremesinghe. Now, they say the accusations against Wickremesinghe are not serious.</p>
            <p>Wickremesinghe, who is 76, was the president of Sri Lanka from July 2022 to September 2024.</p>
            <p>He is accused of taking $55,000 of public money. This happened when he was returning home after attending the G77 summit in Havana, Cuba, and the UN General Assembly in New York, USA, in September 2023. He used the money to stay in the UK.</p>
            <p>In a statement, Kumaratunga said, "We are seeing a planned attack on the main values of our country's democracy."</p>
            <p>Wickremesinghe was arrested on August 22. Yesterday, he was taken to the emergency room because of dehydration, diabetes, and high blood pressure. He was later moved to the intensive care unit. His condition is now stable.</p>
