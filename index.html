            <h1>Actress Angelica Lee: Watching Abuse Videos of Daughters, All Mothers Understand That Pain</h1>
            <p>Angelica Lee felt strongly while filming. She said that watching videos of abused daughters makes all mothers understand that kind of pain. On August 19th, the new TV series "The Soul Keeper" showed its preview. In the video, Shu Qi, Angelica Lee, and Alyssa Chia spoke about how mothers feel when they want revenge. Angelica Lee shared that the most memorable part for her was going into the morgue to identify a body and then watching videos of her daughter being hurt. She said, "Any woman who is a mother will surely understand that pain."</p>
            <p>The TV series "The Soul Keeper" is about a kidnapping and fraud case. It looks at how mothers try to bring back a fraud leader who was sentenced to death and died. They go on a dark journey of hate and trying to find peace. Today, "The Soul Keeper" released a video about "A Mother's Revenge" behind the scenes. In the show, Shu Qi's daughter is kidnapped. She lives, but she can't move or speak. Shu Qi said in a press release that her character is a mother who accepts bad things. She felt confused about getting revenge until she met Angelica Lee. Then she decided, "I must help my good friend do this."</p>
            <p>In the preview, Angelica Lee illegally punished the prisoner Fu Meng-Po, showing her fierce side that would not accept being challenged. Angelica Lee said she had been waiting for a role that felt strange, far away, and scary, but also very real. She also remembered a scene in the script that she couldn't forget. Her character had to go into the morgue to identify a body. After that, she had to watch a video of her daughter being hurt. Angelica Lee said, "Any woman who is a mother will understand that deep pain in her heart." She described her character as a woman who can change into someone she can't even imagine for the people she loves.</p>
            <p>Alyssa Chia plays a mother and a lawyer in the show. Her daughter survived the case. At first, Alyssa Chia fully helped Shu Qi and Angelica Lee seek justice. But as the case became more difficult, the trust among the three mothers started to shake. This was Alyssa Chia's first time working with Angelica Lee and Shu Qi, both famous international actresses. As an actress herself, Alyssa Chia felt a special connection with them when acting together. As a mother, she also deeply understood the sadness that the three daughters in the show faced and the pain that mothers of victims must go through. She said, "When motherhood and revenge come together, that power is very, very, very amazing."</p>

            <h1>To Deal With Tariffs, Financial Commission Extends Insurance Loan Offer Until End of August</h1>
            <p>On August 19, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) in Taipei said that media asked if there were plans for US tariff policies. The FSC said that life insurance companies offer special low-interest loans for policyholders who have financial problems. This offer was usually open only from January to March each year. This year, the application period has been extended again. It is now open from June 1st to August 31st. The FSC has also asked companies to provide support to policyholders.</p>
            <p>On August 18, the Ministry of Labor announced that 3,934 people had agreed to work fewer hours with their employers due to economic problems. The Ministry of Labor's own numbers show that 2,388 of these people were affected by the US putting similar tariffs on goods. Most of them work in the metal and electrical machinery industries. Media asked if the FSC had plans to help businesses if the economy changes and unpaid leave increases a lot.</p>
            <p>Tsai Huo-yen, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, explained that because of the US tariffs, the FSC sent a letter on April 18th. This letter asked insurance associations to tell their member companies to help industries and policyholders in Taiwan affected by the tariffs. It encouraged insurance companies to extend old loans and offer lower rents.</p>
            <p>Tsai Huo-yen pointed out that the special low-interest loan program for financially weak policyholders started in July 2021 and became a regular service in 2022. Every year from January 1st to March 31st, eligible policyholders can apply. This makes sure that policyholders in need get help quickly. During the pandemic, insurance companies were also asked to allow late payments for policy renewals. In May this year, the FSC again asked life insurance companies to offer the special loan program for financially weak policyholders. The application period was extended again, allowing applications from June 1st to August 31st.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that from January to March this year, a total of 1,878 people applied. The approved amount was 164 million New Taiwan Dollars. The special interest rate for this year is 2.165%. Tsai Huo-yen said that this year there are three extra months to apply. They are currently in the second application period, and 21 life insurance companies are offering this service.</p>
            <p>Hou Li-yang, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Banking Bureau, explained that because the US put similar tariffs on goods, the FSC worked with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Bankers Association in April. They created a platform for different government groups to talk. On April 18th, they also asked the Bankers Association to suggest financial help. This includes extending old loans until the end of this year and quickly checking new loan applications. Banks were asked to create a single contact point. In May, the FSC also sent a letter to the Bankers Association to tell member companies to help private businesses deal with the US tariffs. By the end of June, the overdue loan rate for local banks was 0.16%. Looking at the last three years, the overdue loan rate has not gone up much. The FSC will continue to watch the quality of bank assets.</p>
            <p>Regarding unpaid leave, Hou Li-yang said that if a company has financial problems and needs to give unpaid leave or cannot pay back loans, the Ministry of Economic Affairs helps companies talk with banks about their debts. The Bankers Association also offers ways for individuals to discuss their debts. Currently, they are also offering debt extensions, similar to what they did during the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Huang Hou-ming, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that if listed or over-the-counter companies implement unpaid leave and it greatly affects their finances, they must immediately announce this important news. The GreTai Securities Market and the Taiwan Stock Exchange are also asked to make sure these companies follow the rules.</p>

            <h1>China and India Discuss Border Issues: Looking for Fair Solutions and Better Control</h1>
            <p>On August 19, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and India's National Security Advisor met in New Delhi. This was their 24th special meeting about the border problem between China and India. Xinhua News Agency reported that both sides said they will look for fair and reasonable ways to solve the border issue that both sides can agree on. They also said they will improve regular control of the border.</p>
            <p>According to the report, Wang Yi and Ajit Doval had a "full, deep, and good discussion" about the China-India border issue and their relationship. They also talked about important international and regional problems that both countries care about. They agreed to hold their 25th meeting in China next year. Wang Yi attended this meeting as the Director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi said that this year, the relationship between China and India has been growing steadily. The situation at the border has also been stable and improving. As two big neighboring countries and two developing countries, China and India "have similar ideas and many shared interests." They should trust and support each other. He said this is how two rising big countries should act.</p>
            <p>He stated that China thinks it's very important that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tianjin Summit. China hopes India will help make the summit successful.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also said that both sides should follow the idea of "moving forward on two paths at the same time, helping each other, and creating a good cycle." This means dealing with their relationship and border issues by talking and working together to build more trust and increase cooperation. They should also work together to agree on border control, talks about drawing the border, and activities across the border. They should set clear goals, solve specific problems well, and make more good progress. This will create good conditions for the relationship between the two countries to get better.</p>
            <p>The report says that Doval stated the China-India border area is peaceful now, and the relationship between the two countries has made important progress. The current global situation is not stable, and India and China face many shared problems. It is important to "increase understanding, deepen trust, and strengthen cooperation." This is important for the well-being of people in both countries and for world peace.</p>
            <p>Doval said that this year is the 75th anniversary of China and India starting their diplomatic relationship. Modi hopes to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Tianjin Summit. He believes this will help the relationship between India and China grow in new ways. India wants to keep talking with China in a positive and practical way to create good conditions for solving the border problem in the end.</p>
            <p>According to the report, both men talked about early positive results from the China-India border talks. They said again that they will fully use the special representative meeting system. They will follow the political guidelines agreed in 2005. With a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, they will look for fair and reasonable solutions that both sides can accept. At the same time, they will improve regular control of the border to keep the border area peaceful.</p>
