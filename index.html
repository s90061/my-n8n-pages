            <h1>China Starts Investigation on Pea Starch from Canada</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced today that it will investigate pea starch from Canada. They are looking into whether Canada is selling pea starch at unfairly low prices. Before this, China put a 100% tax on peas from Canada starting March 20. This was because Canada added taxes on Chinese electric cars, steel, and aluminum. These disagreements between China and Canada are currently being checked by the World Trade Organization.</p>
            <p>Canada sells the most peas in the world and makes a lot of pea starch. China buys the most peas and also processes a lot of them. Pea starch is used to make food like noodles and jellies. It is also used in food, medicine, and animal feed to make things thicker or more stable.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce said that on June 26, 2025, six Chinese companies asked for this investigation. These companies make pea starch in China. The ministry checked their request and found that the amount of pea starch made by these companies was enough. Also, their request had all the information and proof needed for an investigation.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that China's Ministry of Commerce decided to start the investigation on Canadian pea starch today, August 12, 2025. The investigation will look at prices from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. It will also check if Chinese businesses were harmed from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2024.</p>
            <p>The announcement stated that the investigation will begin on August 12, 2025, and should usually finish by August 12, 2026. In special cases, it can be extended by six months.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that Chinese businesses asked for this investigation. The spokesperson explained that in recent years, a lot more pea starch has come from Canada at very low prices. This has hurt Chinese companies, causing them to lose money.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson also said that after receiving the request, the investigation team checked it according to Chinese laws and World Trade Organization rules. They found that the request met the conditions to start an anti-dumping investigation, so they decided to begin one. The team will follow the law and make a fair decision based on what they find.</p>
            <p>Finally, the spokesperson stated that anti-dumping investigations are fair trade actions that follow World Trade Organization rules and protect local businesses. The spokesperson said, "China's decision to investigate pea starch from Canada is very different from Canada's recent actions against China, which went against World Trade Organization rules."</p>
            <p>Canada started adding a 100% tax on electric cars from China on October 1, 2024. Then, on October 22, 2024, Canada added a 25% tax on steel and aluminum products from China.</p>
            <p>To get back at Canada for these taxes, China's Ministry of Finance put a 100% tax on peas, rapeseed oil, and oilseed meal from Canada starting March 20. They also added a 25% tax on seafood and pork.</p>
            <p>In June, the World Trade Organization formed a group of experts to look into these two trade arguments between China and Canada.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon and Heavy Rain Damage 78 Historic Sites; Cultural Heritage Bureau is Helping Fix Them</h1>
            <p>Recent typhoon and heavy rains have caused damage in many places, including many old buildings and historic sites. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage says that 71 cultural sites were damaged by "Typhoon Daan." Also, 7 sites were damaged by "Heavy Rain on July 28." In total, 78 sites need repairs. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage is working hard to help fix them.</p>
            <p>According to the Bureau of Cultural Heritage, as of August 11, the damaged sites include 13 national historic sites, 28 city historic sites, 5 county historic sites, 2 city-level historic sites, 29 historic buildings, and 1 group of old buildings.</p>
            <p>The areas with the most damage are Tainan, Chiayi, Penghu, and Yunlin. For example, in Tainan, the "Nankunshen Daitian Temple" had parts of its decoration broken or fallen off, and the stone drums at "Kaiyuan Temple" moved. In Chiayi, the "Old Chiayi Prison" was damaged. In Yunlin, the "Taiwan Sugar Shigueixi Bridge" had twisted tracks and leaning pillars. In Penghu, the "Tianhou Temple" had bad water leaks inside, and parts of the "Magong Ancient City" wall were washed away.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage told the Central News Agency that the Ministry of Culture has asked the Bureau to create special teams for national historic sites in different areas. These teams will work with local governments. They will visit the sites and help the people in charge plan how to quickly fix the damage. This will help speed up the repairs.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage also said that a draft law called "Special Rules for Recovery and Rebuilding After Typhoon Daan and July 28 Heavy Rain Disasters" includes money for repairing cultural heritage sites. They will work with the Legislative Yuan after it reviews the law to help with repairs in all affected areas.</p>
            <p>Also, during the storm, many people saw pictures online of "Lukang Longshan Temple" flooded. Many people were worried. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage said that the water leaks at "Lukang Longshan Temple" are from the building getting old, not from the recent storms. They are currently planning a project to fix these problems.</p>
