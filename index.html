            <h1>China's CDC: High Risk of Infectious Diseases Due to Rain and Other Factors</h1>
            <p>China's National Center for Disease Control (CDC) announced today that the risk of diseases spread by insects and animals is currently high. This is because people are moving around more, there has been a lot of rain, and animals that carry diseases are more active. The CDC also mentioned that the upcoming "October 1st Golden Week" and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays will see many people traveling. They advised people to be careful and plan their trips well.</p>
            <p>According to Chinese state media CCTV, the China CDC shared information about recent infectious disease situations and health advice today.</p>
            <p>The China CDC stated that due to people moving around, a lot of rain, active disease-carrying insects, and animals moving into wider areas, the risk of diseases spread by insects and animals is high. This is based on how infectious diseases usually spread and information from different monitoring systems. There is also a higher risk of groups of people getting gut infections like hand-foot-and-mouth disease and norovirus. Other breathing illnesses like the flu are at a low level.</p>
            <p>The China CDC also warned that the "October 1st Golden Week" and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays are coming in a week. These are popular times for travel. Before traveling, people should pay close attention to health warnings from official departments. They should learn about any disease information for their destination, prepare for it, and plan their travel activities wisely.</p>
            <p>Finally, the China CDC said that after returning home, people should check their health. If they have symptoms like fever, cough, throwing up, or a rash, they should try not to join group activities. They should see a doctor quickly and tell the doctor where they traveled and what they ate.</p>

            <h1>To Prevent Rain from Typhoon Hagupit, Chen Chi-mai Inspects Flood Control in Renwu and Cishan</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai visited flood prevention preparations and drainage cleaning in Renwu and Cishan today. He went to the Guanyin Lake detention pond and the Qishan No. 5 drainage pumping station. This is because Typhoon Hagupit's outer winds might bring a lot of rain to the mountain areas of Kaohsiung. The goal was to make sure water systems work well.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai went to areas like Renwu and Qishan this morning. He checked flood prevention work and how well drainage ditches were cleaned. First, he inspected the Guanyin Lake detention pond. To make flood control better in Dashe and Renwu areas, the city turned Guanyin Lake into a flood control pond that can hold 560,000 tons of water.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai told the Water Resources Bureau to make the area look nicer. He also asked them to think about building a bridge over the inner and outer parts of the lake. This would make the Guanyin Lake detention pond useful for both flood control and recreation.</p>
            <p>After that, Chen Chi-mai went to the Qishan No. 5 drainage pumping station. He checked how the pumps were working. This station has 4 pumps. They help direct water and pump it out strongly. This has greatly improved the problem of water collecting in low-lying areas nearby.</p>
            <p>During his visit, Chen Chi-mai also checked the cleaning of side ditches in Dashe District and Qishan District. He wanted to make sure the drainage systems were clear. He also gave drinks to the workers to thank them for their hard work. He thanked the cleaning staff for helping clean the ditches and keep the environment tidy. He also told them to be careful.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said that they continue to clean main roads and drains. Today, 642 people and 77 vehicles were used to clean side ditches and drains on main city roads. They cleaned 37.13 kilometers of ditches. They also cleared 6,706 blocked drains and 4,162 blocked manhole covers.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-mai said that the city has started all its disaster prevention plans. Until the typhoon warning is completely lifted, they will continue to make disaster prevention stronger in all areas. Since there is still a high chance of rain in the mountains from the typhoon, he asked people not to go hiking or camping in mountain areas.</p>

            <h1>Nantou's Mingjian Township Opposes Incinerator, Ministry of Environment Asks for Better Local Communication</h1>
            <p>Residents of Mingjian Township in Nantou today said again that they do not want an incinerator built there. The Ministry of Environment said that dealing with trash is a local matter. The Ministry encourages all local areas to be able to deal with their own trash. However, they should still talk well with local people. The Ministry also said that reducing trash from the start is the most important way to solve the problem.</p>
            <p>Today, a group of Mingjian Township residents who oppose the incinerator and environmental groups held a press conference at the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Central Taiwan Innovation Campus. They spoke against the Nantou County Government's rough decision to build an incinerator in Mingjian Township. They also explained the dangers the incinerator would bring to local residents and local businesses, saying clearly that an incinerator should not be built.</p>
            <p>During the press conference, some people became very upset. There was a small push-and-shove with the police at one point.</p>
            <p>Environment Minister Peng Chi-ming spoke to the media today after attending the "2025 Asia Carbon Pricing Forum." He said that managing trash and waste is the local government's job, and the Ministry of Environment helps. From the Ministry's point of view, they hope that all local areas can handle their own trash.</p>
            <p>Peng Chi-ming pointed out that in the past, Nantou was like "kicking the ball around." Its trash was burned in Taichung's incinerator. But now, other counties and cities cannot help them deal with it, which is why so much trash has piled up. He encouraged Nantou to handle its own trash, but it must talk fully with its residents. It also needs to calm local people's worries about air pollution and harm to farming.</p>
            <p>Peng Chi-ming stressed that reducing trash from the start is the most basic way to deal with it. He gave Changhua as an example: after checking trash bags, the amount of trash decreased by 20% to 30%. He encouraged all county and city governments, environmental groups, and people to work together to reduce trash from the start. This would lighten the load on Taiwan's limited trash disposal ability.</p>
