            <h1>Sun Jia-Hong Carries Taiwan Flag at World Games, Says It Feels "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>The opening ceremony for the 2025 Chengdu World Games took place today, August 7th. Sun Jia-Hong, a martial arts athlete, became the first Wushu player to carry Taiwan's flag. He said he was very excited, describing the moment as something that only happens in dreams.</p>
            <p>At the last World Games in Birmingham, Taiwan's team won one gold medal, six silver medals, and six bronze medals. For the Chengdu World Games, Taiwan sent 120 athletes who will compete in 14 different sports. The women's tug-of-war team plans to win their sixth championship in a row in the 500-kilogram group, which would be a first.</p>
            <p>At the opening ceremony in Chengdu today, Sun Jia-Hong and Huang Mei-Chien carried the flag for the Taiwan team together. They entered the stadium as the 104th team, coming after Syria and before the Czech Republic. A total of 64 athletes from Taiwan took part in the event. These athletes compete in sports such as canoe marathon, korfball, orienteering, water sports, roller sports, waterski, Wushu (martial arts), and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Jia-Hong won a gold medal in Tai Chi Quan and a silver medal in Tai Chi Sword at the 2021 Chengdu Universiade. Now, he is back in Chengdu and is the first Wushu athlete to be a flag bearer. He told reporters he was very moved, saying this moment was something he had dreamed of since he was a child. He believes it is because many older athletes have done well in the past, helping Taiwan's Wushu become well-known in international competitions.</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-Chien, who was a swimmer for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has been focusing more on coaching recently. However, she still competes in finswimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fins at the World Finswimming Championships. Huang Mei-Chien said she has been an athlete's representative for taking an oath and has carried the Olympic torch before. But this is her first time being a flag bearer. She is very excited and a little nervous, and she hopes to do this job well.</p>

            <h1>If Your Car Is Flooded, You Need Extra Insurance, Says Financial Watchdog</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain recently hit southern and central Taiwan, causing many cars to be damaged by water. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that regular car insurance plans (called type A, B, and C) do not cover damage from typhoons or floods. If people want protection, they need to buy an extra insurance plan. This extra plan is called "Additional Clause for Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood or Water Accumulation due to Rain."</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-Yuan, who works for the FSC's Insurance Bureau, explained that insurance has two main parts: for individuals and for companies. Many people and businesses in the areas hit by the rain lost money, and their homes or cars might also be damaged. For individual insurance, current home fire insurance already includes "Residential Typhoon and Flood Disaster Compensation Insurance." If a home is flooded by more than 50 centimeters because of a typhoon or flood, this insurance gives a basic payment of NT$7,000 to NT$9,000, depending on the area.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen also said that if people think the basic coverage is not enough, they can ask their insurance company to add an "Excess Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause." This extra plan gives more money than the basic coverage. It also pays NT$3,000 per day for temporary housing for up to 60 days.</p>
            <p>Recently, there have also been many mudslide problems. Mr. Chen stated that if a house is in a low area or on a hillside, people can choose to add a "Land Subsidence, Sliding or Landslide Insurance Additional Clause." This protects against damage caused by the ground moving down, landslides, loose ground, or losing sand and soil (like mudslides) that happen because of typhoons or floods.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that many cars were also damaged by floods. However, current car insurance, like type A, B, and C, does not cover damage from typhoons and floods. If your home is in a low area and you are worried about your car getting damaged by a typhoon or flood, you can add the "Additional Clause for Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood or Water Accumulation due to Rain." This will protect your car if it is damaged by a typhoon or flood.</p>
            <p>For company insurance, Mr. Chen said that businesses often buy "Commercial Fire Comprehensive Insurance." This insurance usually covers buildings, machines, and movable items that are damaged by sudden, unexpected accidents. This means it can cover damage from typhoons and floods.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Chen also said that commercial fire insurance must clearly list what it covers. So, if it does not clearly state that it covers losses from typhoons or floods, businesses can buy a separate "Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause." This helps them manage the risks from natural disasters. He suggests that businesses talk to their insurance company when they buy a policy to make sure the coverage is right for their needs.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Says MRT Project Damaged Power Lines, New Taipei MRT Bureau Will Check</h1>
            <p>Songshan Airport had a short power cut tonight. Taipower, the power company, said that a construction project for the New Taipei City MRT's Xizhi-Donghu Line accidentally broke some power lines. However, the New Taipei MRT Bureau said they are not sure yet if their work caused the power cut. They will let Taipower come to the site tomorrow morning to check.</p>
            <p>The Civil Aeronautics Administration said the power cut at Songshan Airport lasted only 3 to 4 seconds. No flights were affected. Also, other parts of Songshan District had power cuts, like escalators stopping at Nanjing Fuxing MRT Station.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that the Xizhi-Donghu Line project accidentally damaged power lines. This caused the electricity voltage to drop very quickly. Because of this, the power at Songshan Airport, Taipei MRT, and the main office of Far EasTone Telecommunications flickered for a short time. Now, Taipower's power supply is working normally again.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems explained in a message that the Xizhi-Donghu MRT project was drilling on Tongxing Road in Xizhi District. According to the power lines maps from Taipower, there were no 161KV high-voltage power lines underground at that spot. Also, the company doing the work dug down 2.5 meters and drilled 40 meters, but they did not find any pipes or cables. So, they are not yet sure if their project caused the power cut.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei MRT Bureau said that because Taipower believes the Xizhi-Donghu Line project caused the problem, they will control traffic tomorrow morning. They will also let Taipower enter the site to check everything. This will help them find out why the power cut happened.</p>
