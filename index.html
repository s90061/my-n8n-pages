Microsoft is introducing its new AI assistant, Copilot, to more companies. This tool is designed to make work more productive. Copilot works with common programs like Word, Excel, and Outlook. Its goal is to do simple tasks automatically, summarize long documents, and even help write emails.

Some early users say they are working much faster. However, there are still worries about whether AI will cause people to lose their jobs. There is also a need for workers to learn new new skills. Businesses are now focused on teaching their employees how to work well with AI tools. They see AI as a way to help people, not to replace them.

**A Big Jump in Clean Energy Around the World**

Last year, the world added more renewable energy than ever before. This big increase happened because the cost of solar and wind power has gone down. Also, governments are supporting these cleaner energy sources more. Many new solar panels and wind turbines were built, setting new records. This shows a clear move away from fuels like oil and gas.

Building more clean energy systems is very important to fight climate change. It also brings economic advantages over time. Countries can become more energy independent, and new jobs are created in green industries. However, there are still challenges. It can be difficult to connect all this new energy to the main power grids and to store the energy for later use.

**Popular Tourist Spots Face Challenges with Too Many Visitors**

Many famous places around the world are now dealing with a problem called 'overtourism.' This means too many tourists are visiting, which puts a lot of pressure on local services and buildings. It also damages cultural sites and makes daily life difficult for the people who live there.

Cities such as Venice in Italy, Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and Kyoto in Japan are trying different solutions. These include making tourist taxes higher, limiting the number of visitors, and encouraging people to travel during quieter times of the year. The aim is to find a good balance. They want to keep the money that tourism brings, but also protect their local culture and ensure a good quality of life for their residents.`;
