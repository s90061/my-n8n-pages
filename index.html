            <h1>3000-Year-Old Egyptian Gold Bracelet Stolen and Melted; Museum Worker Sold It Cheaply</h1>
            <p>Egyptian officials have said that a 3000-year-old gold bracelet from a pharaoh was stolen from the famous Egyptian Museum in Cairo and then melted. This news has made many people in Egypt very angry.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Sherif Fathy, Egypt's Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, spoke on TV last night. He said the gold bracelet was stolen on September 9th. At that time, museum workers were getting historical items ready to be shown in Italy. He blamed the theft on "poor ways of working" and said that police are now looking into the matter.</p>
            <p>This gold bracelet had a blue stone called lapis lazuli. It belonged to Pharaoh Amenemope, who ruled Egypt about 3000 years ago. Officials said that the bracelet was stolen from the museum's repair room. Then it was passed among several sellers before finally being melted down. Minister Fathy pointed out that there were no security cameras in the repair room.</p>
            <p>Four people have been arrested. One of them is a museum worker who fixes old things. He said he gave the bracelet to the owner of a silver jewelry shop in Cairo. The bracelet was then sold for about 3800 US dollars (around 115,000 New Taiwan dollars) to a gold workshop owner. After that, it was sold again for about 4000 US dollars to a worker at another gold workshop, and then it was melted to make other gold items.</p>
            <p>On September 18th, the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities announced that the arrested people had admitted what they did. The money they got from the crime was taken back. The ministry also showed a video from a security camera. The video showed a shop owner taking the gold bracelet, weighing it, and paying one of the suspects.</p>
            <p>Local news today said that a judge has ordered the museum worker and his partners to stay in jail for 15 more days while the investigation continues. The other two suspects can leave jail if they pay 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about 207 US dollars) each.</p>
            <p>Many Egyptians who care about their ancient culture were very sad that the 3000-year-old gold bracelet was destroyed. A lot of people questioned why the museum's security was not good enough. They asked for better protection for all of the country's old treasures.</p>
            <p>Pharaoh Amenemope was a ruler during the 21st family of kings in Egypt. His main city was Tanis, which is in the Nile Delta area. The Egyptian Museum says that French archaeologist Pierre Montet found the royal tombs in Tanis in 1940.</p>

            <h1>Maduro Writes to Trump, Says He is Not a Drug Lord and Wants to Talk</h1>
            <p>Today, Venezuela shared a letter that President Maduro sent to US President Trump. In the letter, Maduro said that the US was wrong to call him a drug lord. He also asked Trump to have discussions. The relationship between the two countries has been getting worse lately.</p>
            <p>The letter was written on September 6th. It was sent a few days after the US sent warships near Venezuela. These ships attacked Venezuelan boats that the US said were carrying drugs. This was the first attack.</p>
            <p>The first attack by the US killed 11 people. Even though Maduro asked for peace in his letter, two more similar attacks happened after that.</p>
            <p>In the letter, Maduro strongly said that the US's claims that he leads a group that sells drugs are "completely made up." Many people in Venezuela who do not support Maduro, and many other countries, believe that Maduro's re-election last July was unfair.</p>
            <p>The letter said, "This is the worst false news against our country. It makes fights with weapons much more likely and could cause terrible damage for the whole continent."</p>
            <p>Maduro asked Trump to "keep peace in all of America by talking and trying to understand each other."</p>
            <p>After this letter was sent, the US military attacked two more ships in the Caribbean Sea. Washington said these ships were carrying drugs. One ship was near Venezuela, and the other was near the Dominican Republic.</p>
            <p>The US putting its military in Latin America caused many people to speak out against it. People were worried that the US was planning to use force against Venezuela. People also wondered if it was right to kill people in these attacks. Even selling drugs is not a crime that usually leads to death under US law. They also asked why the US attacked and destroyed the ships directly, instead of taking them and arresting the people on board, which is what usually happens.</p>

            <h1>After UK, Canada, and Australia, Portugal Announces It Recognizes Palestine as a State</h1>
            <p>Today, Portugal announced that it recognizes Palestine as a state. This comes after the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia also did the same. This means another Western country is taking this important step. This is happening while the war in Gaza still continues with no end in sight.</p>
            <p>Paulo Rangel, Portugal's Foreign Minister, spoke to reporters in New York today. This was before the big meeting at the United Nations General Assembly starts tomorrow. He said, "Recognizing the State of Palestine is part of our basic, constant, and widely agreed policy."</p>
            <p>He also said clearly, "Portugal believes that a 'two-state solution' is the only way to have a fair and lasting peace. This is also the way to help Israel and Palestine live together peacefully."</p>
            <p>Earlier today, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia also announced they recognize the State of Palestine. This makes the UK and Canada the first countries from the G7 group to do this. It is expected that France and other countries will also recognize Palestine after the United Nations General Assembly meeting begins.</p>
