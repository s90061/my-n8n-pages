            <h1>Ceasefire Continues Before Peace Summit; Israel Expects All Hostages Released Soon</h1>
            <p>The government of Israel said today that all remaining hostages held in the Gaza Strip are expected to be set free tomorrow. At the same time, Palestinians are waiting for Israel to release hundreds of prisoners and for a lot of aid to enter Gaza, where people are very hungry.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Eyal Zamir, a top general in the Israeli army, said in a statement, "In a few hours, we will all be reunited."</p>
            <p>US President Trump is planning to go to Israel and Egypt later today. He will celebrate the ceasefire agreement announced last week. This agreement gives hope that the two-year war will end.</p>
            <p>Shosh Bedrosian, a spokesperson for the Israeli government, said, "We expect all 20 remaining hostages to be given to the Red Cross at the same time. They will be taken in 6 to 8 vehicles." She also said that Israel does not think the armed groups will do this publicly, like in past prisoner exchanges.</p>
            <p>Bedrosian added that the hostages will be taken to a military base to meet their families. If they need medical help, they will go straight to a hospital.</p>
            <p>After all the hostages are released, Israel is ready to free about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and they will also receive the bodies of 28 hostages who are believed to be dead. Bedrosian said the army plans to hold a memorial service for them in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Gal Hirsch, Israel's coordinator for hostages and missing people, said that a special international team will look for the bodies of dead hostages who are not returned within 72 hours. Officials said some bodies might be under fallen buildings, and finding them could take time.</p>
            <p>The time when Palestinian prisoners will be released has not been announced yet. These prisoners include 250 people who were given life sentences and 1,700 people who were caught in Gaza during the war but have not been charged.</p>
            <p>At the border of Gaza, preparations are happening to let much more aid come in. The Israeli army unit in charge of aid for Gaza said that, according to the agreement, about 600 trucks are expected to cross the border every day.</p>
            <p>Egypt announced that it will send 400 aid trucks into Gaza today. Pictures from the Associated Press show that many trucks have already passed through the Egyptian side of the Rafah border crossing. The Egyptian Red Crescent said these trucks carry medical supplies, tents, blankets, food, and fuel. They will first go to the Kerem Shalom crossing's inspection area to be checked by the Israeli army.</p>
            <p>According to the White House schedule, President Trump, who worked hard to make the ceasefire happen, is expected to arrive in Israel tomorrow morning. He will meet with the families of the hostages and give a speech in the Israeli Parliament (Knesset).</p>
            <p>After that, Trump will go to Egypt. According to the office of Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Trump will lead tomorrow's "Peace Summit" with leaders from the region and other countries.</p>

            <h1>Trump Posts: America Wants to Help China, Not Hurt It</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 12 (Foreign news report from Central News Agency) A few days after threatening to put a 100% tax on goods from China, the world's second-biggest economy, US President Trump said today that America "wants to help China, not hurt it." This shows a softer stance.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," "America wants to help China, not hurt it!" He also said that "respected Chairman Xi (Jinping)... does not want his country to fall into an economic recession."</p>
            <p>On October 10, Trump said that starting November 1, he would add more taxes on goods from China. This is because China put in place "very strong" new rules on exporting rare earth minerals.</p>
