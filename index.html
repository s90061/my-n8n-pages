            <h1>Ministry of Labor Says It Did Not Block Taipei-Shanghai Forum Agreement</h1>
            <p>Taipei City Government said that the Twin City Forum will not happen in September. News reports said this was because of problems with a "Skills Training Agreement" (MOU). The Ministry of Labor said today that they gave new ideas to the Taipei City Government and the Mainland Affairs Council on September 19. They did not ignore any messages. They ask people not to change what really happened.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Taipei-Shanghai City Forum was planned to be held in Shanghai. News earlier said that Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an would lead a group to Shanghai for three days on September 25. But on September 22, the Taipei City Government told the news that they needed more time to prepare. So, both sides decided not to hold the forum in September.</p>
            <p>Later, news reports said the forum was delayed because two cooperation agreements (MOUs) had problems. They said that signing these agreements was harder than in previous years, involving more government offices. They also said that some messages were ignored. One agreement, the "Skills Training MOU," did not go smoothly when it was sent to the Ministry of Labor.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor said today that they have actively helped and talked about the MOUs that the Taipei City Government wanted to sign for the Twin City Forum. They have done this since they first received the official papers. They did this to make sure that exchanges between Taiwan and China follow the rules and do not break any laws. They were not trying to stop the forum.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor also said that they had many talks with the Mainland Affairs Council and the Taipei City Government. After these talks, the Ministry of Labor and the Mainland Affairs Council gave their suggestions for changes to the MOUs to the Taipei City Government on September 19. They did not ignore any messages.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor hopes that some people will not purposely say that the government's "help" was actually "blocking" the forum. They believe this kind of talk does not help good exchanges between Taiwan and China.</p>

            <h1>PATA Says Its Taiwan Company Paid Back Bounced Checks</h1>
            <p>PATA-KY, a company from Singapore, held a press conference tonight. They announced that their Taiwan company had some checks that bounced. This happened because there was not enough money in the bank account. There were 8 bounced checks, and the total amount was NT$27.3 million. The company has already paid this money. PATA-KY said that the group has a lot of money, so this problem should not have a big effect on the company's money or business.</p>
            <p>PATA-KY explained that between September 3 and September 5, the Taiwan branch of PATA Precision Co., Ltd. had bounced checks. This was due to a mistake in how they managed their money and did not have enough funds ready in time. After this happened, they quickly paid the money for the checks. The checks were then given to the bank to show they were paid. The Taiwan branch does not have any unpaid checks now.</p>
            <p>PATA-KY also said that the group has plenty of money. At the end of July, their cash and similar funds (including money kept in banks for specific reasons) were about NT$1.406 billion. At the end of August, it was about NT$1.319 billion. The amount of the bounced checks was only about 1.94% and 2.07% of these amounts.</p>
            <p>PATA-KY emphasized that after the checks bounced, the Taiwan company quickly paid the money and made sure it was recorded. They also made their internal money management better. After looking at everything, they think this event will not have a big effect on the company's money or business.</p>

            <h1>Chipbond's New Factory for Advanced Semiconductor Packaging Materials Will Be Ready by End of Year</h1>
            <p>Chipbond is a company that provides chemicals and materials. They see a good chance to grow because more and more very pure chemicals are needed to make computer chips and advanced packaging. So, Chipbond started building a new factory in Bade, Taoyuan, at the beginning of 2024. They expect it to be finished by the end of this year. This new factory will help them make 70% of the products themselves.</p>
            <p>Chipbond's main products are special chemicals and materials for making semiconductors. These are used in different areas like making computer chips, advanced packaging, high-quality circuit boards, regular circuit boards, small electronic parts, and diodes. They supply very pure chemicals, chemicals for treating surfaces, special chemicals, and other raw materials needed for these processes.</p>
            <p>Chipbond will have a meeting for investors on September 25 before their shares start trading on the emerging stock market. On September 26, their shares will be listed at NT$32.5 each.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chao Wen-yi, the general manager of Chipbond, said at a meeting with the news today that Chipbond began as a company that traded and sold other companies' products. In 2003, they started making their own products. In 2006, they created their own brand. Chipbond can also create new chemical recipes, make custom products, and check their quality. Currently, 45% of their money comes from selling their own brand products, and about 55% comes from selling other companies' products. Their average profit is about 23%.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Shih-yao, the chairman of Chipbond, said that they invested about NT$210 million in the new Bade factory. This amount is almost the same as Chipbond's total company value of NT$220 million. They invested this money because they believe that the semiconductor, advanced packaging, and high-quality circuit board industries will need many chemicals and environmentally friendly products in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Shih-yao said that the new Bade factory will be finished before the end of this year. At first, it will mainly produce temporary sticky materials, cleaning liquids, liquids for etching (a process to make patterns on chips), and environmentally friendly liquids to remove photoresist. They hope that in the next 3 to 5 years, the money they make from selling their own brand products will grow to almost 70% of their total sales.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chao Wen-yi explained that as computer chip technology changes fast around the world, special cleaning liquids help to make more good chips. These liquids are very important materials for making advanced semiconductors. Chipbond knows a lot about special cleaning liquids. They work with big international companies from Japan and Germany to improve their products. This helps them meet what customers need for different chip-making technologies.</p>
            <p>Also, making HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) requires better etching liquids. Chipbond's etching liquid formulas have been tested and approved by customers. They are now sending more and more of these products to customers in Taiwan and other countries. Chipbond's stripping liquids are also used by big companies that make high-quality circuit boards. These products are special because they are good for the environment and help with new manufacturing methods.</p>
            <p>Chipbond's sales for the first seven months of this year were NT$787 million. Their profit was 23.39%. After paying taxes, they made NT$26 million. This means each share earned NT$1.17. Because some products were sent later to customers, they expect to have better results in the second half of this year compared to the first half.</p>
            <p>For the future, Chipbond will focus on three main areas: green products, advanced packaging for chips, and ways to cool down AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer systems. Besides working strongly in Taiwan and China, they have recently sent product samples to markets overseas like Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. They are slowly increasing their sales in these places. They continue to work with big international companies to grow and take the place of European, American, and Japanese companies in supplying chemicals for electronics.</p>
