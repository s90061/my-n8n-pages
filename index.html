New reports suggest that artificial intelligence (AI) will cause major changes in the job market around the world. While AI can make many tasks faster and more efficient, it also means some jobs may disappear. However, experts also believe that AI will create many new types of jobs.

A recent study by the World Economic Forum predicts that while AI could replace some roles, it will also lead to a net increase in jobs globally in the coming years. This shift will require many workers to learn new skills, known as 'reskilling' or 'upskilling.' Jobs involving repetitive tasks are more likely to be affected by automation, while roles that require creativity, critical thinking, and social interaction may become more important. This transformation will affect various industries, from manufacturing to service sectors, changing how people work and what skills are needed for the future.

**Europe Faces Another Summer of Extreme Heat**

Parts of Europe have recently experienced unusually high temperatures, marking another severe heatwave. This extreme weather has had a clear impact on daily life, health, and local economies. Many people struggled with the heat, which led to health warnings and an increase in heat-related illnesses.

The intense heat also affected farming, causing damage to crops and making water scarce in some areas. Tourists and locals alike had to change their plans, avoiding outdoor activities during the hottest parts of the day. Scientists confirm that such frequent and powerful heatwaves are becoming more common due to climate change. This trend highlights the growing need for cities and countries to adapt to hotter climates and prepare for more extreme weather events in the future.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day Visitors to Manage Tourism**

The historic city of Venice has recently started a trial program requiring day visitors to pay a small entry fee. This new rule aims to help manage the large number of tourists who visit the city each day, especially during busy periods. The city hopes this measure will protect its unique culture, fragile buildings, and local residents' quality of life from the effects of overtourism.

The fee is being tested on specific days when tourist numbers are usually very high, mostly during spring holidays and summer weekends. Visitors who stay overnight in hotels are usually exempt from this fee. Venice is one of the first major tourist destinations to introduce such a system, and many other popular places around the world are watching closely to see if it helps reduce the negative impacts of too many visitors. This move shows a growing trend towards more sustainable tourism practices globally.`;
