            <h1>Arab-Islamic Emergency Meeting Will Support Qatar and Speak Against Israel</h1>
            <p>Leaders from Arab and Islamic countries will meet in Doha, Qatar, tomorrow. Everyone expects them to show strong support for Qatar. Last week, Israel attacked Doha from the air. This was unusual. The attacks were aimed at the leaders of Hamas, a Palestinian group.</p>
            <p>Reuters saw a plan for the meeting. This plan says that Israel's attacks make the region less stable. It also says that Israel wants to change things in the region by force. The plan does not talk about taking any diplomatic or economic actions against Israel. The plan might change before the leaders meet tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Hamas said that 5 of its members, who were not leaders, died in the attack. This made Arab countries in the Gulf, who are friends with the US, come together. It also made things worse between the United Arab Emirates and Israel. These two countries only started to have normal relations in 2020.</p>
            <p>This urgent meeting brings together countries from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. Today, foreign ministers met first to talk about the meeting plan.</p>
            <p>Ahmed Aboul Gheit, who is the head of the Arab League, told Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that this meeting wants to send a message. The message is that "Qatar is not alone... Arab and Islamic countries support it."</p>

            <h1>Germany's Local Elections: Alternative for Germany Party Grows, Government Faces Pressure</h1>
            <p>Today, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany had local elections. This state has the most people. Early results show that the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has much more support. This is a big warning for the government, which is led by Chancellor Merz. His government started only four months ago.</p>
            <p>Reuters reports that early results from a survey by Infratest dimap for ARD TV show this. After the elections for local councils and mayors in North Rhine-Westphalia, the AfD party got 16.5% of the votes. This is more than three times what they got in 2020.</p>
            <p>Merz's party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is still the biggest party with 34% of the votes. This is similar to their results five years ago. The Social Democratic Party (SPD) got 22.5%, which is less than their 24.3% before.</p>
            <p>About a quarter of all Germans live in North Rhine-Westphalia. The state is very large. It includes the Ruhr area, where coal and steel industries are now smaller and trying to change. It also has cities like Cologne and Dusseldorf, and many rural areas.</p>
            <p>These local elections were the first test for Merz's government, which is a group of parties including his and the SPD. Critics say the government has not done enough to make the economy stronger. They also say it has not listened to people's worries about immigration.</p>
            <p>The AfD party always puts immigration first. They are trying to get more support in the western parts of Germany, not just in their strongholds in the east.</p>
            <p>A survey by INSA this weekend showed that Merz's conservative party lost 1% of support across the country. They now have 25%, the same as the AfD. The SPD is in third place with 14%.</p>
            <p>In the national election in February this year, the AfD became the second-biggest party in Germany. Elon Musk, a rich technology businessman, also supports them.</p>
            <p>The early results for North Rhine-Westphalia also show that the Green party and the Free Democratic party lost a lot of support in this election. The final results are expected tomorrow.</p>

            <h1>Russia Says It Successfully Fired Hypersonic Missile in Military Exercise</h1>
            <p>Today, Russia's Ministry of Defense announced that its army fired a Zircon hypersonic cruise missile at a target in the Barents Sea. They hit and destroyed the target. This happened during a joint military exercise called "Zapad-2025" with Belarus.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Russian Ministry of Defense said: "Based on the monitoring data received in real time, the target was directly hit and destroyed."</p>
            <p>Russia and Belarus started their joint military exercise, "Zapad-2025," on September 12. Russia's Ministry of Defense said the exercise is to make their military command and teamwork stronger if they are attacked.</p>
            <p>Moscow and Minsk both said that this exercise is only for defense. They do not want to attack any NATO countries. However, after Russian drones flew into Polish airspace on September 9 and 10, NATO, led by the US, started "Eastern Sentry" operations.</p>
            <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense showed a video. It showed the frigate "Admiral Golovko" from the Northern Fleet firing a Zircon hypersonic cruise missile at a target in the Barents Sea.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Zircon missiles can fly nine times faster than the speed of sound. They can hit targets on land and sea more than 1000 kilometers away.</p>
            <p>Russian media said that this missile is called 3M22 Zircon in Russia. NATO calls it SS-N-33. It can travel between 400 and 1000 kilometers. The warhead, which is the part that explodes, weighs about 300 to 400 kilograms.</p>
