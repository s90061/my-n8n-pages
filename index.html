            <h1>Swiss Re: Los Angeles Wildfires Caused 5.4 Trillion in Natural Disaster Losses in First Half of Year</h1>
            <p>Swiss Re, an insurance company, said today that natural disasters caused 135 billion US dollars in economic losses worldwide in the first half of 2025. This is about 5.4 trillion New Taiwan dollars. The wildfires in Los Angeles helped make these losses very high.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Swiss Re is a company that insures other insurance companies. They said that the losses in the first half of 2025 were higher than the 123 billion US dollars in the first half of 2024.</p>
            <p>This large insurance company, which is based in Zurich, estimates that 80 billion US dollars of the losses in the first half of this year were covered by insurance. This amount is almost twice the average from the past 10 years (when looking at 2025 prices).</p>
            <p>Swiss Re said that the big fire in Los Angeles in January was the largest wildfire insurance claim so far. The estimated loss from this fire was 40 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>The company stated that the "extremely serious damage" from the Los Angeles fire was due to several things. These include strong winds for a long time, not enough rain, and many expensive single-family homes in the area.</p>
            <p>Swiss Re said that losses from wildfires have gone up a lot in the last 10 years. This is because the world's temperature is rising, there are more dry periods, and rain patterns are changing. Also, more houses are being built in areas outside cities, and more valuable properties are in one place.</p>
            <p>The company said: "Most of the fire losses came from the United States, especially California. In California, dangerous areas where fires can start have grown the most."</p>
            <p>Before 2015, insurance claims related to wildfires were only about 1% of all natural disaster claims. But now, they make up 7%.</p>

            <h1>US Senator Writes to Intel Board, Questions Lip-Bu Tan's Relationship with China</h1>
            <p>Today, a US Republican Senator named Tom Cotton sent a letter to Frank Yeary, the independent chairman of Intel's board. The letter asks questions about how Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is connected to Chinese companies. It also asks about a recent criminal case involving his old company, Cadence Design.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Senator Cotton sent the letter to share his worries about Intel's safety and honesty in business. He also expressed concern about how this could affect the national security of the United States.</p>
            <p>He asked if Intel's board knew that Cadence Design, Mr. Tan's previous company, received a legal document when he was their CEO. He also asked what Intel's board has done to deal with these worries.</p>
            <p>Intel is part of a plan called "Secure Enclave" from the previous Biden government. This plan aims to keep the supply of microelectronics for defense safe. Because of this, Senator Cotton also asked if Intel's board asked Mr. Tan to sell his investments in Chinese chip companies that are connected to the Chinese military or the Communist Party of China. He also asked if Mr. Tan has fully shared his relationships with other Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Intel gets money from the government for this plan. So, in his letter, Senator Cotton asked Frank Yeary to explain how Mr. Tan has told them about his investments, work roles, or other connections with Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Senator Cotton stated: "Intel has a duty to use American taxpayers' money well and to follow safety rules. Mr. Tan's connections make people wonder if Intel can do these duties."</p>
            <p>An Intel spokesperson said in a statement that "Intel and Mr. Tan are strongly committed to the national security of the United States and our honesty in the defense industry." Intel also mentioned that the company will talk to Senator Cotton about the things he mentioned in his letter.</p>
            <p>Also, Reuters reported last week that Cadence Design agreed to admit guilt and pay over 140 million US dollars. This was to settle charges that they sold chip design products to a Chinese military university. People believe this university was involved in making nuclear explosion simulations.</p>
            <p>Lip-Bu Tan led Cadence Design for more than 10 years. He is a Malaysian-born Chinese-American business manager. In March of this year, he was chosen to be the CEO of Intel. Mr. Tan was the CEO of Cadence Design from 2008 to December 2021. This time includes when the company sold these chip design products. He was also the executive chairman until May 2023.</p>
