Taiwan's weather agency has announced a heat warning for 12 cities and counties, saying temperatures could go above 36 degrees Celsius. Hsinchu might even reach 38 degrees. Weather expert Wu Derong said that from today until July 5th, it will be sunny and very hot everywhere. People should remember to protect themselves from the sun and avoid getting heatstroke.

In the afternoons, there might be some rain in the mountains and in areas near the mountains in the south. From July 6th to 7th, a tropical low-pressure system or a light typhoon might bring more clouds and some local showers, which could make the weather a little cooler.

A new typhoon, MUN, has formed southeast of Japan, but it is not expected to affect Taiwan directly. However, another tropical system is forming near the northern part of the Philippines. Its path is still unclear and could potentially affect Taiwan. People should continue to watch for the latest weather updates.

**TSMC Shares in the US Reach New High, Experts Think Taiwan Stocks Could Go Up**

TSMC's shares traded in the US (ADR) have reached a new highest price. This happened after the US and Vietnam made a new agreement on trade and taxes. Major US stock markets, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, also closed at new record highs. Companies like NVIDIA, which makes AI chips, also saw their stock prices go up.

Taiwan's stock market also ended the day higher. Financial experts believe that the stock market in Taiwan is currently stable at a high level. They think it still has a chance to go up more, especially with companies soon paying out dividends.

The New Taiwan Dollar has also become much stronger against the US dollar. It reached its highest value in over three years. Also, TSMC's new factory in Arizona, USA, might get a 35% tax discount from the US government if it starts construction by 2026. This is seen as good news for the company.

**Japan's Upper House Election Begins, Fighting High Prices is the Main Issue**

The election for Japan's upper house of parliament officially started today. People can now sign up to be candidates, and the voting will happen on July 20th. In this election, 125 members of the 248-member upper house will be chosen. The biggest topic for discussion in this election is how to deal with the problem of rising prices.

The ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito, do not have a majority in the lower house of parliament. So, it is very important for them to win at least 50 seats in this upper house election to keep their majority there. Recently, leaders from eight different political parties discussed their plans for solving the problem of high prices.

Other important topics in the election include plans for financial help, changing sales tax rates, dealing with the high price of rice, social welfare like pensions, ways to help with the low birth rate, and foreign policy, especially concerning the US government's tax measures. Around 519 people are running in the election. About 30% of these candidates are women, which is the second highest number ever for this type of election.

If the ruling parties do not win enough seats in this election, it could lead to big changes in Japanese politics. The ruling parties might try to get other political parties to join them. Or, the opposition parties might work together to form a new government.
