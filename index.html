            <h1>Lin Chia-Cheng Joins Independent League Blue Crabs, Former Team for Wang Chien-Ming's Return to MLB</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese baseball player Lin Chia-Cheng was let go by his team last week. Today, he announced he will play for the Blue Crabs team in an independent league. Ten years ago, the famous player Wang Chien-Ming also played for this team. The next year, Wang returned to Major League Baseball (MLB).</p>
            <p>After waiting for a week, Lin Chia-Cheng announced on social media today that he has joined the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in the Atlantic League.</p>
            <p>On August 4th, Lin Chia-Cheng flew to join the team. Today, he played in an away game in North Carolina, batting second in the starting lineup.</p>
            <p>The Southern Maryland Blue Crabs' home is in Waldorf, Maryland, on the East Coast of the United States. This will be Lin Chia-Cheng's new home for more than a month. He will continue to play and try to get attention from teams in the American professional baseball system for the rest of the season.</p>
            <p>People generally think the Atlantic League is somewhere between Double-A and Triple-A in skill. Many players there have played in Triple-A or MLB. Also, new talented players who were let go by minor league teams try to improve here. The retired Taiwanese baseball legend, pitcher Wang Chien-Ming, played for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in 2015.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Wang Chien-Ming was 35 years old. At the start of that season, he played for the Braves' Triple-A team. On June 19, the Braves released him. Four days later, he joined the Blue Crabs in the Atlantic League. At that time, he said, "Pitchers who have been injured need to work twice as hard." His fighting spirit touched many fans.</p>
            <p>Wang Chien-Ming played three excellent games for the Blue Crabs. The Seattle Mariners liked his performance and signed him to their Triple-A minor league team. The next year, he got a chance to return to MLB with the Royals. After three years of hard work, he played 38 games in MLB again.</p>

            <h1>Unboxing Old Photos: The "1995" Life Line is Now All One Number</h1>
            <p>When news reports talk about suicide, they often include a warning at the end. This warning tells readers to pay attention to their feelings and offers help for mental health. One of these help lines is the "1995" Life Line. It started from the "Suicide Prevention Center" at MacKay Memorial Hospital.</p>
            <p>In 1969, MacKay Memorial Hospital started the Suicide Prevention Center. It gave immediate help to people who came to the emergency room because of suicide attempts. On July 1st of the same year, the center worked with the Taipei North Rotary Club to start the "Life Line." They opened two phone numbers, "514242" and "514343," to offer mental health counseling. This was the first organization in Asia to help prevent suicide through phone calls. Later, countries like Japan and South Korea used it as an example.</p>
            <p>The Life Line works because trained volunteers help. In the beginning, local groups were started in places like Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hsinchu, and Pingtung. To make sure services were the same everywhere and to connect better with international groups, the "International Life Line Association Republic of China General Assembly" was started on April 15, 1977. This group was in charge of managing all the local groups.</p>
            <p>In earlier years, the phone numbers used by Life Lines in different cities and counties were not the same. Most of them used "9595" for the last four digits, which sounds like "save me, save me." But the full phone numbers in different places were between 6 and 8 digits long. This made them hard to remember and dial quickly. So, in 1998, with help from the Ministry of Transportation and Chunghwa Telecom, the Life Line General Assembly worked to combine the phone numbers. On August 10, they held a press conference. They announced that all Life Lines in the country would use one 4-digit number, "1995." This number sounds like "want to save me, save me," making it easier for people to call for help. The goal was to offer mental support as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p>Value life. Suicide does not solve problems. There is always a way out in life. If you need advice or help, you can call the Ministry of Health and Welfare helpline at "1925," the Life Line at "1995," or the Teacher Chang service line at "1980."</p>

            <h1>Trump Forms 2028 Olympics Task Force; Committee Head Invites Him to Carry Torch</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced that he has created a special White House team for the 2028 Summer Olympics. This team will use the power of the federal government to make sure the Olympics happen smoothly. When the head of the organizing committee, Casey Wasserman, spoke, he invited Trump to carry the Olympic torch. Trump smiled and nodded.</p>
            <p>Today in Washington D.C., Trump signed an official order. Both Trump and Casey Wasserman, the head of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Committee (LA28), spoke.</p>
            <p>Many important government leaders were there, showing that the federal government supports the Los Angeles Olympics. These leaders included U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Brendan Carr.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Trump said that the U.S. team has been number one in winning medals at the Summer Olympics for eight times in a row. The U.S. also has the most gold medals in the Summer Olympics, three times more than the country in second place. He believes that the U.S. team will be number one again in 2028.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be held in the U.S. Also, 2028 will be 250 years since the U.S. was founded. He said this is the best time to be an American sports fan, and 2028 will be a very special year in American history.</p>
            <p>Casey Wasserman, the head of the Los Angeles Olympic Committee, thanked the federal government for its support. He said that Trump's government has approved important money for security. This money will be given to local, state, and federal groups for security plans to make sure the Olympics are safe.</p>
            <p>Wasserman also mentioned in his talk that around 150 world leaders will visit Los Angeles. More than 10,000 Olympic athletes and 4,500 Paralympic athletes will take part. Millions of people from all over the U.S. are expected to watch the games.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Olympic torch relay has traveled through 38 states in the U.S. Wasserman said that for these Olympics, they will do something new: the torch will travel through all 50 states. He directly invited Trump, "Mr. President, if you would like to run along Park Avenue again and remember history, we would be very happy."</p>
            <p>Before the 2004 Athens Olympics, Trump was a torchbearer. He ran on Park Avenue in New York as part of the torch relay then.</p>
