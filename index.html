            <h1>DPP Says Ling Tao Lacks Understanding of Democracy and Law; Ling Tao Responds Society Distrusts Justice</h1>
            <p>On September 9, in Taipei, Ling Tao, who is the Deputy Executive Director of the Kuomintang (KMT) think tank, said that after Ko Wen-je, the former chairman of the Taiwan People's Party, was released on bail, the government led by President Lai should also release KMT party workers. He believes this would make Taiwan's legal system fair. In response, Dai Wei-shan, a spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that Ling Tao's words were wrong and showed a lack of understanding of logic and basic democratic law. She called his statements "three blindnesses."</p>
            <p>Ling Tao then sent out a press release. He explained that a poll from the KMT in May showed that 48% of people felt that prosecutors were unfair when dealing with KMT cases, while only 36% thought the investigations were fair. This, he said, proves that society does not trust the legal system, and it is what people truly feel. Yet, President Lai continues to allow this unfairness in the legal system.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao also pointed out that the legal system should fairly investigate the "wrong, fake, copied, or false" parts of the signature collection process. However, people feel that the KMT is investigated, but the DPP is not. He said that cases involving personal data were handled with very strong methods, like big searches and detentions, which were not fair. He believes the people of Taiwan do not agree with this, and these methods are very different from how similar cases were handled in the past. This suggests that there is a political reason behind these actions.</p>
            <p>Today, Dai Wei-shan explained in a press release that Ling Tao first shows a lack of legal knowledge. Whether a suspect stays in jail or is released is up to the judicial branch, not the government. But Ling Tao, influenced by an old way of thinking where political parties control everything, wrongly believes that political parties can interfere with the legal system. This twists the truth and misleads the public.</p>
            <p>She continued, saying Ling Tao also shows a lack of logic. In the case where the KMT allegedly forged signatures, there is strong proof of over 20,000 fake signatures, and most party workers have admitted their guilt. However, the person behind these actions has not yet appeared, and the KMT central office and chairman Chu Li-lun have not apologized.</p>
            <p>Finally, Dai Wei-shan said Ling Tao also shows a lack of awareness. In cases of corruption related to green energy, most of the people who were charged or convicted were KMT members. The legal system is still investigating these cases, but Ling Tao chooses to ignore them and does not talk about his own party's problems. She said that the legal system should only follow laws and facts, and the KMT should not keep using different standards for different people.</p>

            <h1>Zhubei, Hsinchu County: Air Odor Problem Leads to Monitoring Starting September 9</h1>
            <p>On September 9, Hsinchu County reported that Zhubei City has been experiencing problems with strange smells in the air. Member of Parliament Hsu Hsin-ying, from the Kuomintang, held a meeting today with the Ministry of Environment and other groups. They discussed long-term solutions for the problem. In the afternoon, they visited Zhubei Water Canal Park to check a place for an air quality monitoring vehicle. This monitoring is expected to start tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Hung-chieh, the Director of the Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau, told CNA reporters that Zhubei City had several reports of strange air smells, for example, on August 26 and September 4. The Environmental Protection Bureau sent people to check and used small, portable devices to measure air pollution levels in different areas. They also looked at air quality data. However, they did not find any big increases in PM2.5 or VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), which are types of air pollutants.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hsin-ying stated in a written message that a meeting was held in the Legislative Yuan this morning. During the meeting, the Ministry of Environment promised to provide special technology and equipment for finding very small amounts of substances. They will also send people to Zhubei to check locations for monitoring vehicles. The Ministry of Environment will also provide special steel containers for collecting air samples and arrange for air quality monitoring vehicles. With this professional technology, they can find and understand what substances are causing the bad smells.</p>
            <p>Jiang Yu-de, the Vice President of the National Environmental Research Institute, said in a written message that the strange smell seems like burning plastic. He thinks the smell might come from volatile organic compounds. He added that they plan to send an air quality monitoring vehicle and special stainless steel collection containers. The collected samples will then be sent back to the National Environmental Research Institute's laboratory for testing.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau, the Zhubei City Office, Hsu Hsin-ying's office, and other groups checked places for the air quality monitoring vehicle. They plan to place one vehicle in Water Canal Park starting tomorrow. It will monitor the air for one week.</p>

            <h1>Only Sleeping, Not Exercising: Young People in China Save Money by Using 24-Hour Gyms for Naps and Overnight Stays</h1>
            <p>On September 9, in Taipei, young people in China are facing pressure from work or cannot find jobs easily. In the past, they would go to internet cafes or bathhouses to stay overnight. Now, they have found a new place to stay: 24-hour gyms. They can buy a monthly pass for about 200 Chinese Yuan (around 860 New Taiwan Dollars). Also, some office workers now use gyms to sleep during their lunch break.</p>
            <p>The "Sanlian Life Lab," a part of Sanlian Life Weekly, reported that some gyms in China are now used by young people like hotels. Yoga mats become beds, and the sound of people running helps them sleep. There are also showers for washing. The report described how some young people find they sleep better in 24-hour gyms than at home. Some even travel around the country to sleep in different gyms.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that some young people in China think internet cafes are cheaper, but they are too noisy to sleep because people are playing games. Bathhouses seem comfortable, but it's hard to get a private room, and you might have to sleep on bunk beds. Also, you need to take off your clothes. Gyms, however, don't require you to find a bed. You can sleep anywhere. Some people said that when others are busy working, they can secretly take a nap, which feels better than sleeping at home.</p>
            <p>The report also said that office workers who exercised during their lunch breaks were the first to find gyms as a good place to sleep. Because of this, yoga and meditation classes turned into group nap sessions. Few people did the movements, and more people slept on the floor while listening to meditation music. As long as they did not snore, sleeping in the gym was seen as "advanced meditation." After this, 24-hour gyms in Chinese cities became full of young people who wanted to sleep, not exercise.</p>
            <p>Some people said that if you buy a monthly gym pass, you don't need to worry about where to stay even when you visit other cities. Since gyms have branches all over the country, it means you can "travel around the country to sleep."</p>
            <p>According to the report, He Liu-liu, a woman who works for a startup company in Beijing, recently bought a monthly pass for 200 Yuan at a chain gym near her office. She only uses it for sleeping, not exercising. She said that she bought the pass to "get a good rest" during her lunch break at the gym, which is better than renting a room for an hour. In winter, with floor heating and blankets, it's even easier to sleep. After 10 PM, when everyone leaves, the entire gym becomes a luxury suite where she can sleep or exercise as she wishes.</p>
            <p>Cha Cha-zi, a "post-90s" generation worker (born between 1990 and 1999) who moved to Beijing for work, thought about staying overnight in a 24-hour chain gym when she first arrived. She wanted to use her monthly pass from her hometown to save money on accommodation. But she later found out that gym managers patrol at night, and staying overnight is clearly not allowed. So, she can only take a short nap on a yoga mat after doing some cardio at night. She can use it like an hourly room, but not like a big hotel.</p>
            <p>Another person, Bo Bo, a 35-year-old employee of a state-owned company in Beijing, first bought a gym membership at a five-star hotel across from his office to exercise a lot. But after a month, he couldn't keep going. So, he only used the gym for its sauna. Recently, he started using the resting area as a large bedroom to take naps during lunch. He said that going to the sauna means showering and changing clothes, but in the gym's resting area, he can just lie down and sleep right away. The lights are softer, and one hour for a nap is perfect.</p>
