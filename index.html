            <h1>People in Europe and Australia March to Support Palestine After Gaza Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>After the ceasefire agreement in Gaza started, many thousands of people who support Palestine marched in several European cities yesterday. Today, many thousands also marched in Sydney, Australia. They felt happy about the ceasefire, but they were also worried if it would last.</p>
            <p>News reports said that people in Europe shouted "Free Palestine" and waved Palestinian flags during weekend protests. Many thousands marched in London. About 5,500 people marched in Berlin, and about 500 people marched in Vienna to support Palestine.</p>
            <p>In Bern, the capital city of Switzerland, about 2,000 people protested in the city center without permission. Some protesters had their faces covered and threw fireworks. The police used tear gas and water cannons to make the crowd leave, and there were fights.</p>
            <p>The Gaza ceasefire officially began on October 10th at 9 AM Greenwich Mean Time (5 PM Taiwan time).</p>
            <p>Ben Jamal, a leader of the "Palestine Solidarity Campaign" (PSC), said, "We feel happy like the Palestinian people. But we are also worried that the ceasefire will not last." The PSC often holds events in London to support Palestine. They have done this during the two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas.</p>
            <p>Along the River Thames in London, many people holding Palestinian flags made a big display. On the other side, people who were against the protests waved Israeli flags and played loud music. They stood against the people marching for Palestine. London police said there were small physical fights, and "a few people were arrested."</p>
            <p>Katrina Scales, a 23-year-old student from Berlin who studies sociology and psychology, marched in the protest. She felt the ceasefire was "not enough." She said she would continue to join protests in the future. Another person, Steve Headley, who is 50 years old, was not sure if the ceasefire would continue.</p>
            <p>The group "Palestine Action" organized the marches in Australia. They said there were about 27 marches today across the country. The biggest one was in Sydney, with around 30,000 people. Some of the people marching also doubted if the ceasefire would last.</p>
            <p>Pictures taken by the Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) showed many Australian protesters holding Palestinian flags and wearing traditional Arab headscarves called Keffiyehs. Police said that no one was arrested during the protest.</p>
            <p>The Executive Council of Australian Jewry speaks for more than 200 Jewish groups in Australia. They said the protest organizers were wrong. Peter Wertheim, who is a co-leader of the committee, said, "These people want the agreement to fail so the war continues."</p>
            <p>Also, Israel played a football game in Oslo, Norway, yesterday for the 2026 World Cup. Outside the stadium, hundreds of people gathered to protest and support Palestinians. News reporters saw many police officers on horses and fully armed police guarding the area outside the stadium.</p>
            <p>Inside the stadium, some fans who supported Palestine showed a very large Palestinian flag. Only a few dozen Israeli fans waved their country's flag. One strong supporter of Palestine was made to leave the stadium.</p>

            <h1>Source Says Hamas Will Not Govern Gaza After the War</h1>
            <p>A source told a news agency today that Hamas will not be involved in ruling Gaza after the war. This news comes a few days after the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian armed group.</p>
            <p>The source did not want to be named. They said: "For Hamas, the issue of governing Gaza is finished. Hamas will not be part of any temporary plans. This means Hamas has given up control of Gaza. But it will still be an important part of Palestinian society."</p>

            <h1>Tainan's Historic Sites See Many Visitors, Make Record Money During National Day Holiday</h1>
            <p>The Tainan City Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau said today that many people visited the city's old sites and parks during the National Day holiday. This holiday was from October 10th until today. The money from tickets and sales in the parks was more than NT$2 million. This is the highest amount of money made during this holiday period ever.</p>
            <p>Huang Ya-ling, who is the director of the Tainan City Government Cultural Affairs Bureau, told a news reporter that this year's National Day holiday happened at the same time as events for "Tainan City Wall 300 Years." The city government focused on culture. They connected old sites, art shows, and market events. This helped tourism and the economy. It also let visitors feel how culture and daily life come together.</p>
            <p>Huang Ya-ling said that ticket sales grew steadily. Also, creative products, market items, and gifts sold very well in different parks. The total money spent was more than NT$2 million. This shows that cultural places are not just for looking at. They are also important places where people can relax, shop, and learn about the city's culture.</p>
            <p>She said that the Shanshang Garden Waterway Museum planned a "Summer Wave Season" event. This was for its 6th birthday. They built a 100-meter-long waterslide. This brought many visitors to other places in the mountain area, like the Zuojhen Fossil Park and the Jiaobanian Cultural Park.</p>
            <p>Huang Ya-ling said that the historic sites offered special National Day activities. For example, "three people go, one enters for free" and "get a flamingo flower when you enter." Also, the weather was sunny, and people felt excited to travel. This brought many families, couples, and tourists from Taiwan and other countries to visit the historic sites. Places like Chihkan Tower, Anping Fort, Eternal Golden Castle, Anping Tree House, the old Tainan Patriotic Women's Association Hall, and the Water Dance Community Cultural Park all had many visitors.</p>
            <p>The Cultural Affairs Bureau shared information that showed early results. These results prove that people are still very interested in cultural activities. The Cultural Affairs Bureau will create more detailed and creative shows and events. This will make Tainan's cultural name even stronger.</p>
