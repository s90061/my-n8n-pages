            <h1>TSMC German Factory Needs 5,000 Workers, German Schools to Start English Classes</h1>
            <p>TSMC's factory in Germany will start making products in 2027. It will need at least 5,000 skilled workers. To get international students and solve the worker shortage, the state government of Saxony is building a vocational school. This school will teach all classes in English. This will be the first time in Germany, changing the old system where vocational education is mostly in German.</p>
            <p>TSMC and other European chip makers like Infineon started a company called ESMC. Last August, they began building the factory in Germany's "Silicon Saxony." The factory expects to start work in 2027 and will need about 5,000 skilled workers.</p>
            <p>Because of this need for workers, the Saxony government, ESMC, and the local Chamber of Commerce are working together. They are building a new vocational school in Saxony. It will offer technical courses related to semiconductors, all taught in English. They hope to attract young people from nearby countries like Poland and the Czech Republic, and even further away, to come to Germany for training.</p>
            <p>Conrad Clemens, the Minister of Education in Saxony, said that Saxony is becoming more international as TSMC and other global companies come to the area. He said, "TSMC brings a big chance to the area. Now it's time for our vocational training to also grow and start English teaching."</p>
            <p>The new school will cost about 140 million Euros (about 5 billion New Taiwan Dollars). The European Union will give 100 million Euros. It plans to open in 2029. The building will have 6 floors, a gym, and a swimming pool. Big semiconductor companies plan to hire 1,000 apprentices each year.</p>
            <p>Germany has a long history of apprenticeships and values vocational education. Most vocational schools use a "dual system." Apprentices spend 70% of their time working at a company and 30% in school. This means they learn both practical skills and theory. According to Statista, Germany currently has about 3,400 dual vocational schools. Last year, more than 450,000 people chose this type of training.</p>
            <p>Unlike senior high vocational schools in Taiwan, German students can sign an apprenticeship contract with a company after finishing their full-time compulsory education, usually around 15 to 16 years old. At the same time, they enroll in a vocational school. There is no strict age limit for apprenticeships. It is common for people in their 20s or 30s to start vocational training.</p>
            <p>However, a vocational school that teaches completely in English is a new thing for Germany. After the news of the new English school came out, the German Federal Ministry of Education also told Handelsblatt that no public vocational school in Germany has ever taught completely in English before.</p>
            <p>Even though this new plan is getting attention, there are still many problems to solve. First, according to current German law, vocational school final exams must be in German. To change this to English, the law needs to be updated. Also, all school materials, lessons, exam questions, and teacher training need to be translated and changed. This is a big challenge for the education system.</p>
            <p>The Chamber of Commerce said that some schools tried to teach in English before, but most failed because they did not have enough teachers or learning materials. Also, many small and medium-sized companies still mostly use German at work, and not all their employees speak English. So, they worry it will be hard to compete with bigger companies for international apprentices.</p>
            <p>To help different companies, the Saxony government plans to offer "bilingual teaching" for some technical jobs, like microelectronics engineers. Some classes will be in English, with some German training. This will help international students learn skills and slowly get used to the German language.</p>
            <p>Christian Koitzsch, the president of ESMC, said that international teams are normal in the semiconductor industry. Training in English will help the company stay strong in the world market.</p>
            <p>Infineon, a big German semiconductor company, also believes that English is often used at work. They will offer language classes and help with daily life for international apprentices. This will help them finish their training and fit into the local area.</p>
            <p>Even with many legal and practical difficulties, the Saxony government and businesses are determined to make these changes. Local officials said, "If we don't try, we will never know if it works. City authorities, the Chamber of Commerce, and companies are all working together to make this new idea happen."</p>

            <h1>Giants Pitching Coach Remembers 18-Year-Old Teng Kai-Wei: First Impression Was Amazing Talent for Controlling Ball Spin (Interview)</h1>
            <p>J.P. Martinez, the pitching coach for the San Francisco Giants baseball team, might know Teng Kai-Wei the best on the whole team. Seven years ago, he met Teng Kai-Wei when he was 18 years old. His first thought was that Teng had "amazing talent for controlling the ball's spin, he could make the ball spin any way he wanted."</p>
            <p>Martinez, who is 43, has coached professional baseball for 10 years. He joined the Minnesota Twins' minor league system in 2015 and used to be the assistant pitching director for the Twins' farm team. In 2021, he moved to the San Francisco Giants and worked as an assistant pitching coach in the major leagues. This year, he became the main pitching coach.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese pitcher Teng Kai-Wei joined the Twins in 2018. He started his career working with Martinez. For the next seven years, their baseball paths often crossed.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Teng moved from the Twins to the Giants. In 2021, when he was invited to major league spring training, Martinez coached him again. Last year, he played his first major league game, and this year he was called up to the major leagues again. Both times, he reunited with Martinez.</p>
            <p>Martinez recently spoke to CNA and said, "The baseball world is really small. Working with a player from Taiwan, first in one place with one team in the U.S., and then moving to another team in another place, we still kept interacting. That's really cool."</p>
            <p>Martinez remembered meeting Teng Kai-Wei seven years ago. Teng was 18 and flew from Taiwan to Florida. His first impression was "amazing talent for controlling the ball's spin." Martinez remembered that Teng could throw many different breaking balls then. "It seemed like he could control the ball's spin as he wished and throw all sorts of breaking pitches."</p>
            <p>Martinez said that over the years, as a coach, he has always helped Teng Kai-Wei find the best fastball for him. For some time, Teng used his four-seam fastball a lot. Then he threw many two-seam fastballs. Now, he mainly uses the four-seam fastball again.</p>
            <p>Martinez said that Teng Kai-Wei's four-seam fastball has a good angle when it reaches the batter and a good rising effect. This works well with his many breaking pitches.</p>
            <p>Being able to control breaking balls well is a main part of Teng Kai-Wei's pitching. Martinez said, "Many pitchers have trouble with control. Coaches often tell them to throw more fastballs, because most pitchers control their fastballs best. But Kai-Wei is the opposite. He controls his breaking balls best. This year, he used his fastball the least, but he is having his best year overall."</p>
            <p>Martinez said that the most important part of Teng Kai-Wei's control is not his technique, but his mindset when he pitches against hitters.</p>
            <p>He gave an example from August 13, in a home game against the Padres. Teng Kai-Wei gave up 7 runs in 1.2 innings. That day, Teng's first pitch strike rate was actually very good, about 75%. But his strike rate for the whole game was only 60%. This means he often got ahead in the count at the start. However, when he got into a real fight with the batter, he became a bit careful. He started throwing pitches near the edges of the strike zone and was afraid to throw strikes right over the plate.</p>
            <p>Martinez believes that for Teng Kai-Wei to be successful on the mound, he needs to keep his good first-pitch strike rate. Also, as he throws more pitches in an at-bat and faces the batter, he needs to put pressure on the hitter and strongly attack the strike zone.</p>
            <p>Watching Teng Kai-Wei go from an 18-year-old new player to a 26-year-old major league pitcher, Martinez said that Teng's improvement is clear. He is more mature in his thinking, more aggressive when pitching, has better control of his pitching movements, and knows better how to use his different pitches to attack the batter's strike zone.</p>

            <h1>Pope Meets Israeli President, Says Two-State Solution is Only Way to Peace</h1>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV met with Israeli President Isaac Herzog today. They talked about the need for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. They also discussed making sure aid supplies can get through easily and that all hostages must be released. Both agreed that a "two-state solution" for Israelis and Palestinians is the only way to achieve peace.</p>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV met Herzog at the Apostolic Palace. After this, Herzog met with Pietro Parolin, the Vatican Secretary of State, and Paul R. Gallagher, the Vatican Foreign Minister.</p>
            <p>The Vatican Newsroom released a statement saying that during the talks between the Pope, the Vatican, and the Israeli President, they focused on the political and social situation due to the conflict in the Middle East, especially "the sad situation in the Gaza Strip."</p>
            <p>The Vatican statement said they hoped for "talks to start again quickly." With international support, they believe all hostages can be released. They also wished for an urgent and lasting ceasefire to help humanitarian aid reach the areas most affected. They emphasized the need to fully respect human rights and meet the fair wishes of both peoples.</p>
            <p>The statement added that they also discussed how to ensure a future for the Palestinian people and keep peace and stability in the region. The Vatican repeated its belief that "the two-state solution is the only way out of the current war."</p>
            <p>The Vatican statement also said they talked about the situation in the West Bank and important issues concerning the city of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>After many governments said they might recognize a Palestinian state, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, on September 3, asked to take control of large parts of the West Bank. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) then warned Israel. The UAE said that any move to take control of the West Bank would be crossing a "red line" for them.</p>
            <p>In the end of its statement, the Vatican said that during the talks, both sides agreed on the long-standing value of the relationship between the Vatican and Israel. They also discussed the relationship between the local government and the church. They especially highlighted the importance and good work of Christian communities in the area and across the Middle East. These communities help with human and social growth, and improve education, social unity, and peace in the region.</p>
