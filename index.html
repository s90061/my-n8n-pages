            <h1>Pingtung Mountain Area Has Over 2000 mm of Rain in 7 Days; 831 People Moved to Safety</h1>
            <p>Because of a southwest air current, the Pingtung mountain area has had over 2000 millimeters of rain in 7 days. This caused roads to flood and rocks to fall. The county government moved 831 people to safety as a precaution. Also, yesterday, in Koushe Village, Sanhemen Township, mud blocked a water pipe. Today, the water flow is back to normal.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration has given severe heavy rain warnings for Pingtung. Data shows that from July 28 until noon today, the Shenshan rain gauge in Wutai Township and the Shangdewen rain gauge in Sanhemen Township, Pingtung, both recorded over 2000 millimeters of rain. This is almost the average yearly rainfall for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Pingtung continued to have heavy rain today due to the southwest air current. Yesterday, in Koushe Village, Sanhemen Township, two water pipes were blocked by a lot of mud because of the heavy rain. This stopped the water from draining, and mud flowed onto the roads. The Koushe Village head, Song Zaofu, told CNA reporters today that they used heavy machines to clear the mud yesterday. Today, the water is flowing well again. But he said it's hard to relax because the heavy rain keeps falling.</p>
            <p>According to Pingtung County Government information, as of noon today, 831 people from mountain areas like Wutai Township, Sanhemen Township, Majia Township, and Mudan Township have been moved to safety. Among these, 576 people went to stay with family, and 255 people are in shelters.</p>
            <p>Today, schools and offices are closed in 9 townships in Pingtung, including Wutai Township and Gaoshu Township, due to the heavy rain. The old Sanhemen Bridge in Sanhemen Township was closed at 12 PM today as a warning because the water level was too high. Jianyuan Road in Gaoshu Township is flooded 30 centimeters deep and is temporarily closed. In Shizi Township, on the Shouka section, trees and mud slid onto the road, blocking traffic, but they have been cleared. In Zhutian Township, on the Chaozhou section, there is a hole in the road.</p>

            <h1>Xinyi District Building Loses Outside Tiles; Taipei City Building Management Office Fines NT$60,000</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Building Management Office said today that a building on Fude Street in Xinyi District, which is 40 years old, recently had tiles fall off its outside wall. After checking, they found the tiles fell from an air conditioner opening on the 5th floor. They told the residents to fix it quickly and will fine them NT$60,000 according to building law.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, someone posted on a Facebook group called "Xinyi District Bits and Pieces" with pictures and text. They said that tiles and bricks were falling from the outside wall of a building on Fude Street in Xinyi District. They had seen it happen twice in one week and told people walking on nearby roads and sidewalks to be careful.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Building Management Office said today in a press release that the building on Fude Street in Xinyi District had tiles fall from its outside wall. They checked and found that the building got its use permit in 1985, making it an old building. They asked a professional architect from the Architects Association to go to the site and check the building's safety.</p>
            <p>The Building Management Office stated that their first check showed the tiles fell from the air conditioner opening on the 5th floor of the building. They have told the residents to fix it quickly to keep everyone safe.</p>
            <p>Also, according to Article 77 of the Building Act, the owner of a building must keep it safe.</p>
            <p>The Building Management Office said that because the owner did not manage and maintain the building well, tiles fell and put public safety at risk. They will fine the owner NT$60,000 according to Article 91 of the Building Act. If anyone is hurt or loses property, besides the fine from the Building Act, the building owner will also be responsible for related civil and criminal matters.</p>
            <p>To encourage people to check and fix the outside walls of old buildings, the head of the Building Management Office, Yu Ji-xue, said that according to the "Taipei City Application for Repair and Subsidy for Exterior Wall Tile Peeling," people can apply for money to help fix their building's exterior walls. Buildings that are 10 years old or older can apply. The maximum subsidy is NT$200,000 per building, and it pays for the actual costs.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Taipei City Urban Regeneration Office also has subsidies for updating old houses. Each project can get up to 50% of the total engineering costs, but not more than NT$12 million.</p>
            <p>The Building Management Office asks building owners to check their outside walls regularly and fix them early. This is important for people's lives and property safety, to prevent sad events from happening.</p>
