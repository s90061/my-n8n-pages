            <h1>Two Students Died in Motorcycle Accidents; Pingtung University of Science and Technology to Add Speed Reduction Measures</h1>
            <p>Two students at Pingtung University of Science and Technology died in motorcycle accidents on campus within 11 days. Both students were new first-year students. The university said today that it will work with other groups to check and improve traffic safety everywhere. This includes adding speed cameras and other ways to make people drive slower.</p>
            <p>National Pingtung University of Science and Technology had two motorcycle accidents where students died in 11 days. On October 1st, a male student named Qiu rode his motorcycle on Xuefu Road in front of Mengxiang Sports Center. He fell off his bike and hit the divider. Today, another male student named Yang fell off his motorcycle on Xuefu Road on campus. Both new first-year students died at the scene. The two accidents happened about 700 to 800 meters apart.</p>
            <p>Pingtung University of Science and Technology said in a written reply that these two accidents are the only deaths on campus in the last two years. The school has many traffic lights and other signs. It also has warning signs like "Speed Limit 40 km/h, Drive Slowly." But sadly, these accidents still happened. The school immediately sent staff to help at the scene and gave full support to the families for what happened next.</p>
            <p>Pingtung University of Science and Technology said that they strongly ask all teachers and students to care about traffic safety and value life. In a meeting last week, the school decided to focus on first-year students as a main group. They will give them safety advice and information. To stop similar events from happening again, the school will keep working closely with other groups. They will check all traffic safety things and make them better. This includes adding things to reduce speed, like speed cameras and warning signs.</p>
            <p>Pingtung University of Science and Technology also said that since the start of the school year, they have been teaching and telling students about traffic safety. This includes safety talks, motorcycle driving training, and courses on how to prevent accidents. They also offer a bus service for students who live off-campus and use signs on campus to promote safety. They continue to tell students to use slow ways to travel, such as campus buses, small electric vehicles, and bicycles.</p>
            <p>Also, every year, the school invites the Pingtung County Government and a team of traffic experts to check traffic safety on campus. They look at things like traffic lights and road markings to make them better.</p>
            <p>The roads inside and around Pingtung University of Science and Technology have always been places where many accidents happen. According to the Pingtung County Government Police Bureau, from the start of this year until October 2nd, there were 89 traffic accidents of type A2 (injuries or death after 24 hours) involving young people aged 18 to 22 around the school (Shoubi Road, Keda Road, Xuefu Road). 128 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>Pingtung University of Science and Technology just signed a "Joint Declaration for Promoting Campus Traffic Safety Cooperation" with the Pingtung County Police Bureau on October 9th. Recently, they asked a professional traffic group to check the traffic design on campus. They hope to finish looking at the improvements and budget by the end of the year. The county government will help the school get money from the central government.</p>

            <h1>Golden Bell 60 at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall: Online Exhibition to Relive the Glory</h1>
            <p>The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall has opened an online exhibition called "Gathering Light into Shadow: Golden Bell 60." It shows more than 150 important videos and photos. It connects over 40 years of Taiwan's popular culture history from a different view.</p>
            <p>Wang Lansheng, the director of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, said today at a press conference that the Golden Bell Awards first happened at the Memorial Hall in 1980. Since then, until 2023, 39 award ceremonies have been held there. This shows how Taiwan's radio and television industries have grown and changed.</p>
            <p>This year's online exhibition uses "light" as its main idea. It represents the fame of the Golden Bell Awards and the bright energy of the media industry. It also shows the many strengths of women in media. This reflects the wonderful light and shadow of Taiwan's popular culture.</p>
            <p>The exhibition has two main parts. Part one, "Shadows of Time," focuses on the history of the Golden Bell Awards at the Memorial Hall from 1980 to 2023. It is divided into four time periods. This allows visitors to see how culture and daily life are closely connected through changes in TV and radio works.</p>
            <p>Part two, "Light of Women," focuses on 23 women who won "Special Awards," "Special Contribution Awards," "Lifetime Achievement Awards," and "Lifetime Contribution Awards." It tells their stories of shining brightly both in front of and behind the camera. It highlights women's skills and strength. The online exhibition is officially available starting today.</p>
            <p>Wang Lansheng said that to celebrate International Day of the Girl on October 11th, the exhibition also includes stories about the lives and contributions of Golden Bell Award winners who are women. Examples include Yang Li-hua, a famous Taiwanese opera performer, and Chang Hsiao-yen, a well-known TV host. Many people who work behind the scenes are also included.</p>
            <p>The Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall also planned a special one-day public education event called "Taiwan Girls' Day: On Screen and Behind the Scenes, Roles Without Limits." It turns the exhibition content into fun games and career card designs. This helps visitors learn about gender equality in the film and television industry by hearing the voices of the female winners.</p>
