            <p>According to AFP news, when Trump met with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today, Zelenskyy said that Russian President Vladimir Putin "is not ready" to talk about peace. However, Trump said that Putin "wants to end this war."</p>

            <p>Trump said, "I hope they don't need to use it. I hope we can end this war before we have to think about 'Tomahawk' missiles."</p>

            <h1>Former US Security Advisor Bolton Says Not Guilty of Handling Secret Information Wrongly</h1>
            <p>Today, October 17, US media reported that John Bolton, a former National Security Advisor, said he was not guilty in court. He was accused of "wrongly handling secret information." Bolton worked for President Trump for 17 months during his first term. After that, he became a public critic of Trump.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Bolton has 18 criminal charges against him. These include giving and keeping top-secret defense information. Today, in a court in Greenbelt, Maryland, he said he was not guilty.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Bolton was allowed to leave court without bail. His next court date is November 21.</p>
            <p>Bolton was charged on October 16. The official document said that Bolton shared secret documents by email with two "people who were not allowed to see them." The document did not name these people, but many believe they are his wife and daughter.</p>
            <p>The US Justice Department stated that these documents "showed secret information about future attacks, foreign enemies, and relationships with other countries."</p>
            <p>Each charge can lead to a prison sentence of up to 10 years.</p>
            <p>Bolton said in a statement that he denied the charges. He said he "is the newest victim of the Justice Department using its power for politics."</p>
            <p>Bolton is now the third person who criticized Trump to be charged in recent weeks. Before him, James Comey, the former head of the FBI, and Letitia James, the Attorney General of New York, were also charged.</p>
