The United States is considering ending exceptions that currently allow foreign chipmakers, such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC, to use American technology in their manufacturing operations in China. These exceptions were initially granted after the U.S. imposed broad export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022. For South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies, having production in China is crucial to their business, as China is the world's largest market for semiconductors. This potential decision to remove these exceptions for allies' operations in China marks an important moment in U.S. technology policy.

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., is proposing what could be his largest investment yet: a trillion-dollar industrial area in Arizona for building robots and artificial intelligence. SoftBank officials are keen for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to play a prominent role in this project. TSMC, which makes advanced AI chips for Nvidia Corp., already plans to invest $165 billion in the U.S. and has begun production at its first Arizona factory. Son has listed SoftBank Vision Fund companies that might join the Arizona project, as he aims to boost SoftBank's stock and repay long-term investors.

**Taiwan Adds Chinaâ€™s Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List**

Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision comes as trade and technology tensions between Taiwan, China, and the United States continue to increase. Both Huawei and SMIC have already faced sanctions from the U.S. These two companies are currently producing China's most advanced self-developed artificial intelligence chips, aiming to compete with U.S.-based Nvidia and to supply Chinese tech firms with essential chips despite existing export restrictions.
