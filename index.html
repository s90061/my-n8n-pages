            <h1>EU Official: US and Europe Will Create a Metal Alliance to Deal with China's Too Much Production</h1>
            <p>Brussels, July 28 â€“ Maros Sefcovic, an official in charge of trade for the European Union (EU), said today that the EU and the United States will form a "metal alliance." They will do this based on a trade agreement. The goal is to lessen the negative effects that China's subsidized production has on markets around the world.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Sefcovic stated that officials from both sides talked for many hours to reach the agreement. During these talks, US officials realized that the steel industries in the United States and the EU had the same problems. Because of this, steel and aluminum makers in the EU will get a special system. This system will let them pay very low taxes or no taxes on imports, instead of the 50% import tax that US President Trump put in place. However, this new system is not yet final.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic said at a press conference, "This agreement clearly shows a plan for working together on steel, aluminum, copper, and related products. I call this a metal alliance. It will create a shared protection barrier around our economies. It will do this by using special tax limits and benefits that are at a historic level."</p>
            <p>This planned alliance and special import system show that Europe and the US are starting to push back more against China producing too much.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic also said, "It is clear that the problem is having too much production. We believe this problem is connected to illegal financial help."</p>
