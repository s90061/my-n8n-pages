            <h1>Cargo Ship Explodes, Baltimore Port Channel Closed; Investigators Find Cause</h1>
            <p>Baltimore, August 19 (CNA) â€“ A cargo ship full of coal exploded last night. It was leaving Baltimore, Maryland, for East Africa. Now, investigators are trying to find out why it exploded. The main shipping path in Baltimore Port was closed this morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, officials said no one was hurt in the explosion last night. The explosion sent out a distress signal. The ship was reportedly near where the Francis Scott Key Bridge fell last year.</p>
            <p>Videos show flames going high into the sky after the explosion. Then, a lot of thick smoke covered the Patapsco River.</p>
            <p>The main shipping path of the Port of Baltimore was closed this morning.</p>
            <p>Port officials said in a press release: "The U.S. Coast Guard is leading this effort. They will decide when the channel is safe to open again and when ships can enter and leave the port."</p>
            <p>Ship tracking websites show that the W-Sapphire, a 229-meter-long merchant ship, was supposed to go from Baltimore to East Africa. It was expected to arrive at Port Louis, Mauritius, in about one month. The ship was built in 2012 and sails under the Liberian flag. Officials said the ship was carrying coal.</p>
            <p>According to U.S. Coast Guard staff, there were 23 crew members and 2 pilots on the ship when the explosion happened.</p>
            <p>John Marsh, a spokesperson for the Baltimore Fire Department, said his department went to put out the fire that was below the ship's deck.</p>
            <p>The Maryland Department of Emergency Management reported that nothing else was damaged, only the ship itself.</p>

            <p>Reuters reported that Sinner, who won the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open, felt unwell in Cincinnati yesterday because of the very hot weather. He was losing 0-5 to Carlos Alcaraz in the first set and decided to stop playing.</p>

            <p>He also said: "Congratulations to Alcaraz and his team. You have played very well this season. I wish you all the best for the future. Now I need to rest for a few days before I return to the court."</p>
            <p>The new mixed doubles event lasts 2 days and has 16 teams. It started today, but Sinner and Siniakova's team is not on the official list of players or the schedule.</p>
            <p>Danielle Collins and Christian Harrison, both from the US, have replaced Sinner and Siniakova on the list. They will play against Belinda Bencic from Switzerland and Alexander Zverev from Germany in the first round.</p>
            <p>Also, the main matches for the US Open singles are expected to start on August 24.</p>
