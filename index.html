            <h1>Jerome Cohen, Teacher of Ma Ying-jeou and Annette Lu, Dies at 95</h1>
            <p>Jerome Cohen, a well-known American law expert, passed away yesterday at the age of 95. This was reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cohen was an important teacher to former President Ma Ying-jeou and former Vice President Annette Lu. He had a big and important effect on Taiwan's move towards democracy and the development of China's legal system.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal stated that Jerome Cohen's son, Ethan Cohen, confirmed that his father died on September 22, at 95 years old.</p>
            <p>Jerome Cohen studied China's legal system for many years. He deeply influenced Taiwan's move to democracy after martial law ended. He was a respected teacher to former President Ma Ying-jeou and former Vice President Annette Lu when they studied at Harvard Law School. In 1985, after the Henry Liu murder case, he helped Liu's widow, Cui Rongzhi, by going to court in Taiwan without payment. During that time, he visited Annette Lu in the hospital. She was in prison as a political prisoner because of the Formosa Incident.</p>
            <p>In May 2012, when Chinese human rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng left the US embassy in Beijing to go to the US, there was a diplomatic problem. Jerome Cohen contacted New York University, where he taught at the time. He helped Chen Guangcheng go to the US by offering him a visiting scholar position and a scholarship. Later that year, Cohen came to Taiwan and met former President Chen Shui-bian in Taipei Veterans General Hospital. Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption. Cohen gave his legal opinion on the case.</p>
            <p>Jerome Cohen finished law school at Yale University in 1960. He worked for two US Supreme Court judges. When he was 30, before the US and China had official relations, he decided to study China's laws under the communist system and learn Chinese. After the US and China built relations, Cohen, who spoke fluent Chinese, was the first American lawyer to work in Beijing for several American universities and law firms.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that in the 1960s, during the Cold War, Cohen visited Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, but he could not enter China. In Hong Kong, he once said he would pay 20,000 US dollars to buy a panda. He also sent letters to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai but could not reach them. In 1972, when relations between the US and China started to improve, Cohen met Zhou Enlai, who was the second most powerful person in China at the time, in Beijing.</p>
            <p>In 1979, the US and China became allies, and China started to open up to the world. Cohen and his wife were invited to Beijing to teach Chinese officials.</p>
            <p>Jerome Cohen always cared about China's legal system, human rights, and the growth of democracy and law in the region. He skillfully played a trusted role between the US and China. He was trusted by high-level officials in Taiwan, the US, and China. He also gave legal comments on the changes happening in China and Hong Kong under President Xi Jinping.</p>

            <h1>US Secret Service Finds 100,000 SIM Cards During UN Assembly, Stops New York Communications Crisis</h1>
            <p>Hours before US President Trump was going to speak to foreign leaders at the United Nations General Assembly, the US Secret Service said they found and removed a complex network of electronic devices in New York. These devices were planned to threaten US government officials.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Secret Service stated these devices were found about 56 kilometers away from where the global meeting of 193 member countries was taking place.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Early checks showed that there had been phone talks between people linked to unfriendly countries and others known to federal police."</p>
            <p>Police found more than 300 SIM card servers and 100,000 SIM cards in several places. The Secret Service said this action removed a serious threat to their security operations.</p>
            <p>The Secret Service said these devices were used to "make several threats related to phone calls against high-level US government officials."</p>
            <p>Matt McCool, a Secret Service agent, said in a video statement, "This network could stop cell phone towers from working and essentially shut down New York City's mobile phone network."</p>
            <p>He added that these devices no longer pose a threat to the area.</p>
            <p>The White House did not immediately reply when asked for comments.</p>
            <p>The devices found could be used for many types of phone attacks. This includes making cell phone towers stop working, starting cyber security attacks, and allowing criminals and dangerous people to talk using secret messages.</p>
