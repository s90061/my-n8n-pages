            <h1>World University Games Women's Gymnastics: Chen Ruey-An is Third in All-Around and Goes to Finals</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) Today, the World University Games in Germany held the team finals and qualifying rounds for individual all-around and single events in women's artistic gymnastics. Chen Ruey-An, a mixed-race girl who moved from Sweden to Taiwan, placed 3rd in the individual all-around qualifying round, 6th on the balance beam, and 7th on the floor exercise. She made it to the finals in all three events.</p>
            <p>For the women's team results, the Taiwanese women's team finished 6th with 150.000 points. They did not win a medal.</p>
            <p>Chen Ruey-An, 21, has a Swedish father and a Taiwanese mother. This year, she changed her nationality to represent Taiwan for the first time at the World University Games and did very well. She ranked 3rd in the individual all-around qualifying round with a total score of 53.350 points.</p>
            <p>In June this year, Chen Ruey-An finished 4th in the individual all-around at the Asian Gymnastics Championships with a score of 52.499, just missing a medal. Her score at the World University Games is a new personal best. If she can keep this level in the individual all-around finals, she has a good chance to win Taiwan's first women's gymnastics medal at the World University Games.</p>
            <p>Besides her strong performance in the individual all-around, Chen Ruey-An also made it to the finals in the balance beam, ranking 6th with 13.250 points, and the floor exercise, ranking 7th with 12.800 points. Chen Ruey-An is also the only Taiwanese female artistic gymnastics team member to reach the finals.</p>
            <p>Coach Cheng Kun-Chieh told CNA that Chen Ruey-An performed as expected and showed what she practices every day. Her individual all-around score is better than at the Asian Championships, which means she is in good shape. She has a chance to win a medal in the finals. (Edited by Li Ming-Tsung) 20250725</p>

            <h1>Ko Ching-Hsien Moves Up to Dodgers' Class A; He Was Like a Machine Getting on Base in Rookie League</h1>
            <p>Los Angeles, July 24 (CNA) Ko Ching-Hsien, an 18-year-old Taiwanese outfielder, has played very well in the Dodgers' rookie league this year. He is good at getting on base and hitting for power. In 52 games, he got on base in 50 of them. He was like a machine getting on base in the rookie league. Today, he moved up to Class A in the minor leagues.</p>
            <p>Today, news spread on American social media that Ko Ching-Hsien, the Taiwanese outfielder in the Dodgers' rookie league, was moving up to the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, a Class A team. A CNA reporter contacted Ko Ching-Hsien, and he confirmed the news.</p>
            <p>Ko Ching-Hsien started his first professional season in the rookie league this year. The games were played at the spring training base in the Phoenix area of Arizona. Now that he has moved up to Class A, he will go to Southern California on July 25th to join the Dodgers' Class A team.</p>
            <p>The home field of the Dodgers' Class A Quakes team is east of Los Angeles, about an hour's drive from the Dodgers' main league stadium.</p>
            <p>Ko Ching-Hsien played 52 games in the rookie league. What was most noticeable was his amazing ability to get on base. He got on base in almost every game. Out of 52 games, there were only 2 games where he did not reach first base. In one of those games, he left early in the first inning and did not get a chance to bat.</p>
            <p>The rookie league season started in May. In these three months, Ko Ching-Hsien played 52 games. In 180 times at bat, he hit 66 times. His batting average was 0.367, his on-base percentage was 0.487, and his slugging percentage was 0.539. His OPS, which measures how well a player hits, was 1.026.</p>
            <p>Among his 66 hits, he had 15 doubles, 2 triples, and 4 home runs, showing his excellent power hitting. He was number one in both on-base percentage and OPS in the Arizona Complex League (ACL).</p>
            <p>This week, the Dodgers' Class A Quakes team will play against the Diamondbacks' Class A Rawhide team at home. The Rawhide team also has a Taiwanese pitcher, Huang Chung-Hsiang, who just moved up from the rookie league. Huang Chung-Hsiang is expected to pitch on July 26, which could lead to a face-off between two good Taiwanese players. (Edited by Chen Cheng-Kung) 20250725</p>

            <h1>Fewer Swiss People Drink Alcohol for Health Reasons; Restaurants Change Business Plans</h1>
            <p>Zurich, July 25 (CNA) A new survey in Switzerland shows that fewer young people are drinking alcohol. Among people aged 16 and older, 8% do not drink at all, and 9% have started to stop drinking. More women are quitting alcohol than men, by 4 to 5 percent. The group most actively stopping drinking is aged 31 to 54. This drop in drinking affects the restaurant industry, which is changing its services to deal with it.</p>
            <p>This summer, a survey by the Swiss online media Watson showed the top three reasons young people drink less are: alcohol is not good for health, they simply don't want to drink, and they worry about losing control after drinking. The higher price of alcoholic drinks is also an economic reason for drinking less.</p>
            <p>Regarding this trend, the Addiction Aid St. Gallen Foundation in Switzerland told Swiss Radio and Television (SRF) that over the past 25 years, people in Switzerland have become more aware of health. This has led more young people to actively choose not to drink alcohol.</p>
            <p>However, the foundation also noted that even though young people usually control themselves, some still choose to "break the rule" and drink a lot at summer outdoor parties. They said, "We are controlled normally, but we enjoy ourselves fully when we party."</p>
            <p>In Europe, drinking together is part of social culture. Having a drink in hand at a gathering often helps make the mood better. However, the amount of alcohol young Swiss people drink is going down each year. This is a warning for restaurant owners, as it could mean less money for them.</p>
            <p>Restaurant owners who were interviewed said that to deal with these changes, they will create a happy atmosphere, offer good prices, make outdoor dining areas bigger, provide kind service, and offer more non-alcoholic drinks. Also, to improve public safety by preventing drunk driving, offering good public transport options will help bring in more customers.</p>
            <p>Switzerland's outdoor activity season started in June, and outdoor music festivals are happening everywhere. Beer companies have set up many stalls. Industry observers note that the hotter the weather, the more people like to go outside, and sales get better. Alcoholic drinks play an important part in summer fun and have become a popular topic in Swiss society. (Edited by Tang Sheng-Yang) 20250725</p>
