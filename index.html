            <h1>Former Researchers Say Meta Puts VR Money Before Child Safety</h1>
            <p>Two former researchers from Meta Platforms, the company that owns Facebook, told a US Senate committee today that Meta puts making money from its virtual reality (VR) products before keeping users safe.</p>
            <p>Cayce Savage, a former researcher for Meta who worked on user experience, said that Meta stopped an internal study. This study showed that Meta knew children were using its VR products and saw bad content.</p>
            <p>Savage told the Senate subcommittee for privacy, technology, and law that "you cannot trust Meta to tell the truth about how safe its products are or how they are used."</p>
            <p>Recently, news reports showed internal documents where Meta allowed its chat tools to "talk to children in romantic or unclear ways." This made lawmakers unhappy.</p>
            <p>Jason Sattizahn, another former researcher from Meta Reality Labs, also spoke today. Senator Marsha Blackburn asked him, "Are you surprised that they allowed their chat tools to have these kinds of talks with children?"</p>
            <p>Sattizahn answered, "No, not at all."</p>
            <p>Meta had said before that the situations reported in the news were against company rules and had been removed.</p>
            <p>"The Washington Post" first reported yesterday about the statements from Savage and a group of current and former Meta workers.</p>
            <p>Savage said that researchers were told not to look into how VR technology could harm children. This was so the company could say it knew nothing about it. Savage said that during her work, she found children were bullied, sexually attacked, and even asked for nude photos.</p>
            <p>Andy Stone, a spokesperson for Meta, said in a statement that these claims are based on "carefully chosen, partly leaked internal papers, picked only to make up a false story." He also said that the company "never completely stopped research about young people."</p>
            <p>Senator Blackburn said at the hearing that what the people told them shows why Congress needs to pass the "Kids Online Safety Act" (KOSA). This law was passed by the Senate last year but did not pass in the House of Representatives.</p>

            <h1>Israel Attacks Hamas Base in Doha, 6 Dead; Qatar Will Still Work for Peace in Gaza</h1>
            <p>Israel attacked a Hamas base in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, and six people died. The Prime Minister of Qatar said that even after this "clear attack," they will keep trying to help stop the fighting in Gaza and get the prisoners released.</p>
            <p>Hamas said that in this attack, Khalil al-Hayya's son, one helper, and three security guards died. Khalil al-Hayya is a representative in the Gaza peace talks. But Hamas also said, "The enemy did not succeed in killing our peace talk members."</p>
            <p>Another Qatari security guard died in this attack. This attack makes the difficult peace efforts even harder.</p>
            <p>Today, Qatar's Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said that Qatar has the right to "respond to this clear attack." He also called the attack a "very important moment for the region."</p>
            <p>But he added, "No matter how hard the situation in the region is, it will not stop us from continuing to work for peace."</p>
            <p>Qatar is an important friend of the United States in the Middle East. It has the biggest US military base in the area. Since 2012, Hamas's political office has been in Qatar with the US's agreement.</p>
            <p>The White House said that US President Donald Trump did not agree with Israel's decision to do a military action in a friendly country. It said the US warned Qatar about the attack before it happened.</p>
            <p>However, Qatar said it did not get any warning before. It said it was only told about the attack after it happened.</p>

            <h1>iPhone 17 Series Prices Not Up Because of Tariff Threat; Apple Ready to Pay Costs</h1>
            <p>Apple today showed many new and better iPhones, including the very thin iPhone Air. The company kept prices the same, even though new taxes from US President Trump could make them lose money.</p>
            <p>News reports said that the iPhone Air has a strong battery and a new computer chip. It starts at $999. Before this, financial experts wondered if Apple would make iPhones more expensive or find other ways to deal with the costs from new taxes, like charging more for iPhones with more storage space.</p>
            <p>This new model was the main product at Apple's yearly event. Tim Cook, the CEO, said, "We are making the biggest step forward for iPhone ever."</p>
            <p>Apple said the iPhone Air is the strongest iPhone yet. It will use a special A19 Pro chip. Apple said they changed this chip to use less power and work better with the iPhone Air's thinner battery. Other companies like Samsung already sell phones that are very thin.</p>
            <p>Just like experts thought, the iPhone Air's price is between Apple's other phone models. Apple also showed the latest improved versions of its main smartphones, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. They also showed new AirPods Pro wireless headphones and added a blood pressure checker to the newest Apple Watch.</p>
            <p>The basic iPhone 17 with 256 GB of storage will cost $799. This is the same price as the older iPhone 16 model with only half the storage. The iPhone 17 Pro with 256 GB will cost $1099. This is the same price as last year's model with the same storage. But Apple removed the cheaper option for the iPhone 16 Pro that cost $999.</p>
            <p>Apple also did not make its watches or the new AirPods Pro 3 more expensive.</p>
            <p>These pricing choices show that Apple is ready to pay for the costs from new taxes. This is to fight against other companies like Samsung, Google, and Chinese phone makers. Apple had thought these new taxes would make them lose more than $1 billion this financial period.</p>
            <p>Tom Mainelli, who works for IDC (a market research company), said, "They are using their big size to try and keep prices the same."</p>
            <p>He said, "I think Apple, like most tech companies, knows that new taxes will affect how much people can buy later this year, especially in the US. So they will keep prices steady. They want people to be able to upgrade their phones by the end of the year for the same price as last year."</p>
            <p>The iPhone Air will compete directly with Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. Experts told news reporters that this phone might be a first step for Apple to compete with Samsung's foldable phones. Samsung has already made 7 versions of its foldable phones.</p>
            <p>For Apple, foldable phones are very important to attract customers in China. People in China like foldable phones, and Apple has been losing its share of the market there.</p>
            <p>Paolo Pescatore, an expert from PP Foresight, said, "This new phone will bring something new to the iPhone, which has been the same for a long time... The new and much better iPhone models look very good. This puts Apple in a good position to meet the needs of different groups of buyers."</p>
