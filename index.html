            <h1>Trump Threatens Punishment, Indian Government Says It Will Still Buy Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>Two unnamed sources from the Indian government said that India will continue to buy oil from Russia, even though US President Trump has threatened to punish India.</p>
            <p>One source said: "These are long-term oil agreements. It's not easy to stop buying overnight."</p>
            <p>Last month, Donald Trump posted on "Truth Social," a social media platform, saying that India would face more punishment for buying Russian weapons and oil.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Trump told reporters that he heard India would no longer buy oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported today, citing two unnamed senior Indian officials, that the Indian government has not changed its policy. One official said that the government has not told oil companies to buy less oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported this week that Indian state-owned oil refineries stopped buying Russian oil after discounts became smaller in July.</p>
            <p>Randhir Jaiswal, a spokesperson for India's Ministry of External Affairs, said yesterday during a regular press meeting: "Regarding our need for energy... we will think about what resources are available in the market and what choices we have. We will also consider the current global situation or environment."</p>
            <p>Jaiswal added that India and Russia have a "strong and long-standing partnership." He also said that India's relationships with all countries are important and should not be seen from the point of view of a third country.</p>

            <h1>Mature Uncles Film Shot in Penang, Sharing the Joy of Living Life to the Fullest</h1>
            <p>The movie "NO GOOD! Old Man" was filmed in Penang, Malaysia. Local media reported that the movie tells an exciting story about "dream-chasing older men." It shares a message of living life fully and having no regrets.</p>
            <p>Malaysia's "Kwong Wah Yit Poh" newspaper reported today that director Chang Ching-feng led a team including Li Ming-shun (winner of a Golden Bell Award for acting), Li Kuo-huan (Singapore's comedy king), Hsu Hsiao-shun (a long-time TV host from Taiwan), and Huang Pei-chia (winner of a Golden Bell Award for acting). They filmed in Penang from July 28th to August 2nd.</p>
            <p>In the movie, there is a part where the main character, played by Li Kuo-huan, leaves Penang as a boy to study in Taiwan. At that time, the Komtar skyscraper in Penang was being built. Forty years later, he returns home and finds that the city has changed a lot. The Komtar skyscraper is now a famous landmark there.</p>
            <p>Chang Ching-feng has visited Penang many times. He said in an interview that he feels Penang is a "warm place with kind people." So, he wanted to write a story about Taiwan and Penang. One of the main characters is from Penang, and his story helps connect many parts of the movie about Penang.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that Li Ming-shun, who is from Malaysia, plays a Taiwanese person in the movie. When he went to Penang, he had to deal with different cultures. He constantly reminded himself not to use his Malaysian accent during filming so that his role would seem real.</p>
            <p>Li Ming-shun said: "I cannot say 'Uncle' or 'Auntie' in Malaysian; I have to say 'Shushu' or 'Ayi' (Taiwanese terms). This difference was very interesting to me. I hope that when the movie is shown in Malaysia, people will see how I play someone returning to their own home."</p>
            <p>Li Ming-shun plays a retired photographer in the movie. He said that even though he is "an older man," it is hard to achieve dreams. But he still believes that he should live without regrets.</p>
            <p>During the interview, Hsu Hsiao-shun wanted to say that Li Kuo-huan acts like a woman in the movie. But Li Kuo-huan quickly stopped him, saying, "That's a surprise ending; you can't tell them!"</p>
            <p>Chang Ching-feng said that "NO GOOD! Old Man" is expected to be released next year. They will try to release it during the Chinese New Year period. All plans are still being made.</p>
            <p>He hopes that the movie will share a message: no matter your age, you should be brave and follow your dreams that you haven't started yet.</p>

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Hu Cheng-en Hits 3 Base Hits, 4 RBIs; Moving Because They Didn't Give Up</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's player Hu Cheng-en, also known as "Shanzhu" (Wild Boar), had a great game against South Korea today in the U12 World Baseball Championship. He got three hits and four RBIs, including his third home run of the tournament. He said that before sleeping, he will think about what to do for tomorrow's third-place game. He was very touched that everyone on the team did not give up and did not complain.</p>
            <p>In the U12 World Baseball Championship, Taiwan played South Korea in the last Super Round game today. In the top of the 3rd inning, when Taiwan was losing by one run, Hu Cheng-en hit a two-run home run. This gave his team the lead. In the 8th inning (extra innings), he got an infield hit. In the 9th inning, he hit a two-run single, helping his team win against South Korea with a score of 11 to 5.</p>
            <p>Hu Cheng-en had five turns at bat today and got three hits, helping his team get four runs. He played very well. He said that when he hit the home run, he was calm. He was not trying to hit a long ball. He just wanted to hit the ball well and show what he practiced.</p>
            <p>Before batting in the 9th inning, his coach told him to stay calm and do every action correctly. Hu Cheng-en said that after he hit the two-run single, he wanted to do a "Rising Dragon Punch" move. But when he reached base, he did not finish the move and laughed.</p>
            <p>Today's game started at 6:15 PM and finished around 10:45 PM. Hu Cheng-en said he had never played a game so late before. The most important thing he remembered was that everyone did not give up and did not complain. Everyone just wanted to win. He knows he has to play South Korea again tomorrow at 10 AM for the third-place game. But he will still think about what to do before he goes to sleep.</p>
