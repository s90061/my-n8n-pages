Hospitals in Gaza are struggling due to ongoing conflict. Doctors say they have to put several babies in the same incubator. Hospitals are warning that they are running out of fuel, which means they might have to shut down life-saving services. This puts many patients' lives in danger.

The United Nations (UN) has said that the fuel problem is very serious, and there is almost no fuel left. The UN also stated that hospitals are using fuel very carefully. Ambulances are not working, and water systems are in trouble. Many more people could die if Israel does not allow new fuel to enter Gaza quickly and regularly.

Earlier this year, Israel stopped humanitarian aid from entering Gaza for 11 weeks. This caused more than 2 million Palestinian people in Gaza to face hunger and a worse humanitarian crisis.

Dr. Fadel Naim, who runs Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City, shared a picture showing many newborn babies sharing one incubator. This incubator was borrowed from another hospital. He said this situation is because of the war and the blockade on Gaza, which has damaged the entire healthcare system. He added that taking care of premature babies has become a struggle for life or death because of the blockade. No child should be born into a world where bombs and blockades decide if they live or die.

The head of Al-Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said they had to close their dialysis unit to save fuel for intensive care and operating rooms. He warned that if fuel doesn't arrive in a few hours, the hospital will stop working in three hours. This could lead to more deaths, including 22 babies in incubators.

**US and China Foreign Ministers to Meet at ASEAN Meeting**

The United States Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, will meet with China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, today. This meeting will happen during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) foreign ministers' meeting in Malaysia.

This will be the first time the two ministers meet in person. Their countries have been having problems with trade and defense issues. The US and China still disagree on several topics, including trade, a drug called fentanyl, Taiwan, and advanced technology. Both Rubio and Wang Yi are in Kuala Lumpur for the ASEAN meeting. Other countries like Japan, South Korea, and Australia are also there.

**Taiwanese Table Tennis Duo Reaches Semifinals at US Tournament**

Taiwanese women's table tennis players Cheng I-ching and Li Yu-chun have reached the semifinals of the WTT US Grand Slam. In their quarterfinal match today, they beat a Romanian team with scores of 11-7, 13-11, 8-11, and 11-3.

Cheng I-ching and Li Yu-chun, who are the fourth-seeded team, played against the fifth-seeded Romanian team. In the first game, the Taiwanese team started strong, taking an early lead and winning easily. In the second game, even though they were losing, they came back to win, helped by Cheng I-ching's strong play. They lost the third game due to many mistakes. In the fourth game, after a close start, the Taiwanese team played very well together, scoring eight points in a row to win the game and the match.

Next, Cheng I-ching and Li Yu-chun will play against the top-seeded Chinese team.

In other news, Taiwan's mixed doubles team, Lin Yun-ju and Cheng I-ching, lost their semifinal match. They started well, winning the first two games, but then lost the next three games to a Korean team (11-8, 11-7, 9-11, 12-14, 7-11), so they will not play in the final.
