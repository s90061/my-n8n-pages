**Heavy Rain in Changhua Causes Ditch Wall to Break, Repairs Happening Now**

Changhua County had heavy rain for two days. Because of this, a wall next to the Hongmen Ditch in Tianzhong broke down. About 17 meters of the wall fell, and water covered the farms nearby.

Workers from the Agriculture and Food Agency in Changhua quickly started fixing it. They will tell the main government about the broken part to get it fixed permanently.

The part of the wall that broke was old, built in the 1990s, and did not have strong metal inside. The rain made the ground soft, and that made the wall fall down.
