            <h1>Russian Drone Enters Poland, NATO to Start 'Eastern Sentry' to Boost Defense</h1>
            <p>Brussels, September 12 (Central News Agency) â€“ NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte announced today that NATO will strengthen its defenses on its eastern side. This is in response to a Russian drone flying into Polish airspace this week.</p>
            <p>This announcement by Secretary General Rutte comes after NATO, for the first time in three and a half years since the Russia-Ukraine war began, used fighter jets to shoot down a Russian drone that entered a member country's airspace.</p>
            <p>Rutte held a joint press conference with General Alexus Grynkewich, the top commander of NATO forces in Europe. Rutte said at the press conference, "NATO is starting 'Eastern Sentry' to make our presence on the eastern side even stronger."</p>
            <p>Rutte stated that these military actions will begin in the next few days. They will involve forces from member countries like Denmark, France, the UK, and Germany. He stressed that these extra forces will not only include "more traditional military setups" but will also add "special elements to deal with drone problems."</p>
            <p>He also said that NATO is still checking if Russia purposely flew into Polish airspace. But no matter what, he said, "this is careless and unacceptable."</p>
            <p>Before this, member countries like France and Germany had already said they would send more fighter jets to Poland. Grynkewich said, "Even though we are focusing on Poland now, this situation is bigger than just one country. If one member country is affected, the whole NATO is affected."</p>
            <p>He also added, "'Eastern Sentry' will be flexible and quick. It will provide more focused deterrence and defense when and where it is most needed."</p>
            <p>Poland's Defense Minister, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, thanked NATO for "showing strong action and decisions when facing Russia's aggressive policies." He said that this new deployment "is not just a smart decision, but it shows NATO's responsibility for the safety of the entire eastern side."</p>

            <h1>Former Chief Justice Karki Sworn in as Nepal's Prime Minister, Leading Temporary Government</h1>
            <p>Kathmandu, September 12 (Central News Agency) â€“ Sushila Karki, Nepal's former Chief Justice, was sworn in today as the Prime Minister. She will lead a temporary government after the previous government was removed due to deadly protests against corruption.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Nepal's President Ram Chandra Paudel congratulated Karki during the swearing-in ceremony, which was shown on state television. He said, "Congratulations! We wish you success, and we wish the country success."</p>
            <p>The previous government had to step down after a series of deadly public protests happened in Nepal recently.</p>
            <p>Nepal, a country with 30 million people, faced chaos this week. Military and police tried to stop young people's anti-corruption demonstrations. This led to a lot of violence, causing at least 51 deaths.</p>
            <p>Former Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli announced his resignation that day, and his location is still unknown.</p>

            <h1>Schroder's 26 Points and 12 Assists Lead Germany to EuroBasket Final, Defeating Finland</h1>
            <p>Riga, September 12 (Central News Agency) â€“ Germany showed its strength and experience today, beating Finland 98 to 86. This win means Germany is the first team to reach the final game of the EuroBasket basketball championship.</p>
            <p>This is Germany's first time in the EuroBasket final since 2005. They won the championship in 1993, and now they are trying to win their second title.</p>
            <p>Dennis Schroder, a point guard for the NBA's Sacramento Kings and a player for world champion Germany, scored 26 points and made 12 assists. He led his team to end Finland's surprising dream of winning the championship. Schroder made 4 three-point shots and all 10 of his free throws.</p>
            <p>Another NBA star on the German team, Franz Wagner, a forward for the Orlando Magic, scored 22 points. In the second quarter, he made two three-point shots in a row, which helped Germany lead by 49 to 30. This was Germany's biggest lead in the whole game.</p>
            <p>For Finland, Olivier Nkamhoua was the best player, scoring 22 points. Lauri Markkanen, a forward for the Jazz, added 16 points. Finland got closer in the late third quarter, reducing the difference to just 6 points. Even though Finland fought hard to come back, they could not stop Germany from moving forward.</p>
            <p>Germany will play against Greece or Turkey in the championship game. The game between Greece and Turkey will happen later today.</p>
