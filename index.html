            <h1>Boy Hit on Crosswalk, Mayor Calls for Clearer Traffic Rules</h1>
            <p>A primary school boy in Keelung was hit by a taxi while crossing a crosswalk in the city. He got hurt. Mayor Hsieh Kuo-liang went to the place where it happened today. He suggested that the central government should change the law. He wants the rules for drivers to slow down at intersections to be much clearer. This would help keep people walking safe.</p>
            <p>The accident happened at noon on August 21st. A taxi was turning right from Ai Liu Road to Ren Yi Road in Keelung City. It hit the boy who was walking on the crosswalk. The boy fell down and rolled several times. An ambulance took him to the hospital, and he had many scrapes and bruises. The police are looking into the accident to find out exactly what happened.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hsieh heard about the accident and thought it was very important. This afternoon, he went to the accident site with people from the city's transport, public works, education, and police departments. They met to talk about ways to make things better.</p>
            <p>At the meeting, some parents suggested having "pedestrian-only traffic lights" to keep children safe. City council member Cheng Wen-ting from the Democratic Progressive Party suggested moving the crosswalks back a bit. Mayor Hsieh said that the city government will study and plan for these ideas.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hsieh also said that the current law for road traffic only states that it's against the rules if a driver "does not slow down when approaching a crosswalk without traffic lights." But he said this rule is too vague. It does not have clear standards for how much drivers should slow down. He has asked the city's transport department to tell the Ministry of Transportation about this. He suggests that the central government should change the law to make it clearer. This would make sure that people crossing the street are safer.</p>

            <h1>Shilin Immortal World Big Party to Happen This Weekend, Taipei Performing Arts Center Hosts a Special Event</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Performing Arts Center (TPAC) will hold a special event called "2025 Trendy Taipei: Shilin Immortal World Big Party + Silent Disco." This event will combine different art forms such as traditional puppet shows (Budaixi), music, acrobatics, and a silent disco. It will be a fun festival that feels like an evening trip to an immortal world. It will take place on August 30th and 31st.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the TPAC, the event will feature performances by Su Chun-Ying Puppet Theater, Sheng Sheng Theater, 0471 Acrobatics and Body Theater, and JAZZHEAD Jazz Band. These performances will happen in the "Sirius Constellation" area on the first floor of the TPAC for two evenings in a row.</p>
            <p>The "party" will also change the TPAC plaza, the underground passage, and the areas around it into magical "wormhole-like" paths. These paths will guide visitors through different parts of a story. They will help people experience a mix of old traditions and new, modern styles.</p>
            <p>The "Shilin Immortal World Big Party" is free to enter for everyone. People who sign up early for the Silent Disco can wear headphones. Through these headphones, they will get instructions and become part of the performance. This allows them to experience the party in a deeper way and help create the party scene.</p>
