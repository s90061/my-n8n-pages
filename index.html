            <h1>Wei Chieh Huang's First Start in CPBL Only Lasted 1 Inning, Dragons Lost 4-7 to Monkeys</h1>
            <p>Wei Chieh Huang is a pitcher for the Wei Chuan Dragons. He was chosen in the first round of the draft this year. Today, he started his first game in the professional baseball league against the Rakuten Monkeys. He only pitched for one inning and gave up 5 runs. The Dragons lost the game to the Rakuten Monkeys by a score of 4 to 7.</p>
            <p>Wei Chieh Huang has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the US. In recent years, he has had many injuries. But when he joined the professional baseball draft, the Dragons still chose him first. After 3 games in the minor league, he moved to the main team to help as a relief pitcher. Today, he started the game against the Monkeys. However, Wei Chieh Huang did not play well. Also, his teammates made mistakes. He only pitched for one inning and gave up 5 runs. This caused the Dragons to lose the game.</p>
            <p>In the first inning, Wei Chieh Huang got three outs very fast. But in the second inning, he had trouble. After Lin Hung-Yu hit a ball, a teammate made a big mistake. Then, the other team got four more hits. Wei Chieh Huang also walked Chen Chen-Wei. He had to leave the game without getting anyone out. The next pitcher, Kuo Yu-Cheng, could not stop the other team from scoring. The Monkeys scored 5 runs in that one inning.</p>
            <p>In this game, Wei Chieh Huang pitched for 1 inning and threw 29 balls. He faced 9 players. They hit 4 balls and he walked one player. He let in 5 runs. But only 2 of those runs were his own fault.</p>
            <p>In the 5th inning, the Dragons' defense had trouble again. The right fielder, Tseng Sheng-An, made a mistake when Chen Chen-Wei hit the ball. His throw back was also bad. This let Chen Chen-Wei run all the way to home plate. The Dragons scored 3 runs in the 7th inning to try and get closer in score. But they could not get past the pitchers Chen Kuan-Yu and Chu Cheng-Yang. So, they lost the game 4 to 7. It was Wei Chieh Huang's first game as a starting pitcher, and he lost.</p>

            <h1>U.S. August Retail Sales Grew More Than Expected, No Impact From Trump's Tariffs Seen</h1>
            <p>The U.S. government said today that stores sold 0.6% more in August than in July. This is the same as how much sales grew in July. Compared to last August, sales grew by 5.0%. These numbers were better than what people thought they would be. It seems that new taxes on goods from other countries, put in place by President Trump, did not hurt sales.</p>
            <p>News said that when people buy things, it helps the U.S. economy a lot. Many businesses in the U.S. have said that President Trump's new taxes are making prices higher. As these higher costs are put on the prices, everyone is watching to see what American shoppers will do.</p>
            <p>In August, places that sell cars and car parts sold 0.5% more than in July. Restaurants and bars sold 0.7% more. Stores that sell fresh food also sold a little more, 0.3%.</p>
            <p>But in August, furniture stores in the U.S. sold 0.3% less than in July. Department stores also sold a little less, 0.1%. Big department stores saw a bigger drop in sales. This means people might be buying less of some things.</p>
            <p>For a while, companies that bring goods into the U.S. and stores have been paying some of the extra tax costs themselves. But we don't know how long they can do this. Also, many businesses bought a lot of goods before President Trump's new taxes began. When they need to buy more goods, they will have to pay higher prices.</p>

            <h1>Fun and Budget: First French Sports Festival Causes Discussion</h1>
            <p>On September 14th, France had its first Sports Festival. Nearly 5000 events happened all over the country. A main road next to the Louvre Museum in Paris changed into a "Sports Street." Even with the rain, many people came to try sports like climbing, running, and sledding, which are Olympic sports, right on the street. But the French government is still cutting money for sports. This has been a big topic in the news.</p>
            <p>President Emmanuel Macron announced the "French Sports Festival" after the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics. The main idea is to keep people excited about sports and to show that sports are important for everyone. Every year from now on, September 14th will be the Sports Festival. This year was the first one.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, Rue de Rivoli, a very busy street in the middle of Paris, became the "Sports Street." This was a special place for the whole event. From 11 AM to 6 PM, cars had to go on other roads. Some subway exits were closed, and there were security checks. The street became a 2-kilometer-long outdoor sports place.</p>
            <p>The activities had popular sports like running, tug-of-war, boxing, judo, taekwondo, and skateboarding. There were also Olympic and Paralympic sports that they wanted people to know more about. These included Flag Football, Boccia (a game played with balls), and Wheelchair Handball.</p>
            <p>All the different sports happened at the same time, like a fair. It was free for everyone. Athletes were there to help people learn. Many famous athletes also came to meet and talk with people.</p>
            <p>Lucie and AmÃ©lie live in Paris. They told a reporter, "We never thought we would try rock climbing on Sports Street, especially next to the Louvre Museum." They liked that the festival showed many Paralympic sports that people don't often see. But they said that not enough people knew about it because there wasn't much advertising.</p>
            <p>Another person, Sophie, brought her two children to try "sledding," which is a Winter Olympic sport. Her son, Henri, said he saw this sport on TV during the Tokyo Winter Olympics. He tried it today and found that the sled was very heavy. But he thought it would be very fast when it slides on ice.</p>
            <p>Sophie said she thinks sports can help children learn and be happy. Her son learned about different countries and math because he liked watching the sports channel "L'Ã©quipe" when he was little. Now, their whole family watches sports together. Her daughter, Jeanne, started learning to swim after the Paris Olympics last year.</p>
            <p>Sophie, who works as a journalist, sent good wishes to Taiwan because it has a new Ministry of Sports. She said that sports can help bring peace and unite countries. Sports let countries compete fairly. Both athletes and people watching can see who wins and feel the good spirit of sports.</p>
            <p>Even though it rained a lot on the 14th, people were still happy to be there. Men, women, and children of all ages were exercising together on the big street, surrounded by old buildings. This was a special sight in Paris. The French Sports Ministry said on the 15th that 140,000 people came to the event in Paris that day. They also said it will happen again next year.</p>
            <p>But while the event was fun, French news said bad things about the government. Many people online said the Sports Festival felt fake and sad. They said it did not match the government's choice to cut money for sports in recent years.</p>
            <p>The Le Monde newspaper said that the French government cut the money for sports by 13% in 2025. They plan to cut it by another 17.6% in 2026.</p>
            <p>StÃ©phane Troussel, the leader of Seine Saint Denis in northern Paris, asked people not to go to the Sports Festival. His area was one of the local governments that did not join the event. This area was important for the 2024 Paris Olympics. It had the Stade de France, swimming pools, and the place where athletes stayed.</p>
            <p>Troussel said that the country is giving less money for sports for young people. For example, the Pass'Sport program used to help children and teenagers from 6 to 18 years old. But now, children from 6 to 14 years old are not included anymore.</p>
            <p>The LibÃ©ration newspaper said that AmÃ©lie OudÃ©a-CastÃ©ra, who used to be the Minister of Sports and the Olympics, said clearly, "We don't feel like celebrating." She also asked why the government used money from the Paris Olympics to pay for the Sports Festival.</p>
            <p>But the current Minister of Sports, Marie Barsacq, said that having the Sports Festival helps sports be important now. She said, "Money for sports does not only come from the Sports Ministry's budget." Because money for sports has been cut for many years, many people in sports talked a lot about her statement.</p>
            <p>The first Sports Festival will continue until September 21st. About 5000 events are happening in France and its areas overseas. Local governments and 46 sports groups are organizing them. The goal is to use sports to make France stronger as a country, more new, and more sure of itself.</p>
