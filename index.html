            <h1>Ohtani Hits Two Home Runs, Ends Dodgers' 5-Game Losing Streak; Kershaw Gets 10th Win</h1>
            <p>(Baltimore, September 7, news from foreign sources) The Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team had lost 5 games in a row. They really needed to start winning again on their trip to the East Coast. Today, Japanese star Shohei Ohtani started the team's attack with a home run in his first turn at bat. In the end, the Dodgers won against the Baltimore Orioles with a score of 5 to 2.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Shohei Ohtani brought energy to the team right away today. On only his second pitch, he hit the ball over the fence in center-right field for a home run. As the team's lead hitter, Ohtani hit another home run in the third inning. He now has 48 home runs this season, which is second in the National League. Finally, the Dodgers played strong defense and stopped their losing streak.</p>
            <p>Dave Roberts, the Dodgers' manager, said, "You could see the team's mood suddenly become lively." He added, "Clearly, Ohtani hitting a home run at the start of the game was extremely important."</p>
            <p>Just one day before, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, was only one out away from throwing a no-hitter. But in the bottom of the 9th inning, Orioles shortstop Jackson Holliday hit a home run. Then, the Orioles scored 4 runs quickly, and the Dodgers lost 3 to 4.</p>
            <p>On this road trip, the Dodgers first lost 3 games in a row to the Pittsburgh Pirates, who are at the bottom of the league. After that, they played the Orioles and lost two more games in the 9th inning. The team felt very down and really needed to win today.</p>
            <p>Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers' left-handed pitcher, said, "We rarely lose so many games in a row like this." He continued, "This is not something you get used to, and it's certainly not fun when it happens in a game."</p>
            <p>Kershaw pitched for 5.2 innings today and struck out 8 batters. He got his 10th win of the season. He talked about Ohtani's first home run, saying, "It's always a big deal to score first at the start of the game." He added, "This also helped us recover quickly from yesterday's loss. Getting a 1-0 lead felt very good."</p>
            <p>The Dodgers are now going back home as the top team in the National League West division. In this game, Ohtani helped a lot with his two home runs and also got three walks. Mookie Betts also hit a home run, and Kershaw got his sixth win in a row today.</p>
            <p>Roberts said, "It was really great. Ohtani reached base five times in this game, and Betts has also been hitting very well lately." He added, "The whole team was energetic and played actively. Even the players at the end of the batting lineup played their parts well today."</p>
            <p>After winning, the Dodgers' trip home will not be as difficult. Roberts smiled and added, "This also shows the team's strength. When Ohtani and Betts can play like this, it's a big plus, of course."</p>

            <h1>New iPhones and Semiconductor Expo Begin; Experts Say It Will Help Taiwan Stocks Reach New Highs</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 8, news by Ho Hsiu-ling) On September 5, most major stock indexes in the US went down. However, TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) went up by 3.49%, while Nvidia's stock went down by 2.7%. Taiwan's stock market closed at 24494.58 points on September 5. During the day, 25 companies had very high stock prices. Experts say that Apple's autumn product launch event and the SEMICON Taiwan international semiconductor exhibition will both start on September 10. These events are important to see how money moves in the market and if Taiwan's stock market can reach new record highs.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market went up by 314.73 points on September 5, closing at 24494.58 points. This was very close to the record high of 24519.9 points on August 27. Apple will hold its autumn product launch event at 1 AM Taipei time on September 10. They are expected to announce new iPhone models, watches, and other devices.</p>
            <p>Experts said that Apple's supply chain companies will be a main focus for investors. The SEMICON Taiwan 2025 International Semiconductor Exhibition will start its talks on September 8 and open its doors on September 10. The exhibition will cover three main areas: artificial intelligence (AI), car semiconductors, and robot semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Looking at the US stock market on September 5, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 220.43 points, or 0.48%, closing at 45400.86 points. This was because the US announced bad job numbers, which made investors worry about the economy's future. The S&P 500 Index went down by 20.58 points, or 0.32%, closing at 6481.50 points. The Nasdaq Index, which has many technology stocks, went down by 7.30 points, or 0.03%, closing at 21700.39 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 93.541 points, or 1.65%, closing at 5761.398 points.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan's stock market, it opened high and continued to rise on September 5. It closed up by 314.73 points at 24494.58 points. The total value of shares traded was 416.399 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Foreign investors and Chinese investors bought 28.281 billion New Taiwan Dollars more shares than they sold. Individual trading companies bought 5.177 billion New Taiwan Dollars more shares than they sold. Investment trusts sold 473 million New Taiwan Dollars more shares than they bought. In total, the three main types of big investors bought 32.985 billion New Taiwan Dollars more shares than they sold.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, foreign investors bought 59,513 shares of Winbond Electronics and 31,302 shares of Nanya Technology. These were the top two stocks bought by foreign investors. The top two stocks sold by foreign investors were China Steel and Walsin Lihwa.</p>
            <p>Senior stock analyst Chien Po-yi said that last week, the stock index moved up and down at a high level. The index closed at a new high recently, but the total trading volume for the week did not increase much. This shows that investors are waiting to see what happens. If the overall market doesn't show a clear increase in trading volume soon, the market will likely stay in a bigger period of adjustment in the short and medium term.</p>

            <h1>7 Counties and Cities Should Prepare for Temperatures Above 36 Degrees; Wu Der-rong Says Weather Will Become Clearer from September 10</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 8, news by Chang Hsiung-feng) The Weather Bureau today shared information about high temperatures. It warned that 7 counties and cities, including Greater Taipei, should prepare for local temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that northern Taiwan will be quite hot today and tomorrow. Also, people everywhere should be careful about strong thunderstorms in the afternoon. From September 10, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger, and the weather across Taiwan will slowly become sunny and hot.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau gave out high-temperature warnings this morning. The weather everywhere is hot and very warm. Today, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Changhua County, Yunlin County, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County are under an orange alert. This means there is a chance of temperatures being above 36 degrees for a long time. Tainan City is under a yellow alert, meaning people should be aware of temperatures above 36 degrees.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column "Heavenly Secrets Classroom" for the Weather Application and Promotion Foundation today. He said that the latest European weather models show that today and tomorrow, the edges of Tropical Storm Tapah will bring moisture. This will cause a slight increase in clouds everywhere, and northern Taiwan will still be quite hot. There will be small chances of local, short rain at different times. The air will not be stable, and strong air currents will form in the mountains in the afternoon. These will also reach some flat areas. People should be careful of strong thunderstorms, which may bring lightning, strong winds, and sudden heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the latest European weather models show there is still a chance of strong thunderstorms in the afternoon of September 10. From September 11 to 13, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger. The weather everywhere will be sunny and stable. There might be some local, short showers or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon, but they will be weaker and cover a smaller area. On September 14, the Pacific high-pressure system will get even stronger. It will be sunny and hot everywhere, and there might be a few small, local rain showers in the mountains in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also mentioned that the latest "Track and Strength Forecast Map" from the Weather Bureau shows that Tropical Storm Tapah is moving to the north-northwest. It will land east of Yangjiang City in Guangdong this morning. After it lands, it will slowly get weaker. The latest European weather models also show that the Pacific high-pressure system is getting stronger. There are no signs of other "tropical disturbances" forming in the Northwest Pacific in the next week.</p>
