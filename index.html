            <h1>Taiwan Stock Market Drops Over 350 Points; Financial Supervisory Commission Calls for Confidence</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Su Siyun, Kaohsiung, July 22) The Taiwan stock market went up to a new high of 23486.08 points today. But then it fell by 352.64 points, closing below 23000 points. This happened because of unclear tariffs between Taiwan and the US. Officials from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that the stock market is still around 23000 points. They also asked the Taiwan Stock Exchange and Taipei Exchange to check how tariffs might affect different industries. They said "it should be okay."</p>
            <p>The Asia Asset Management Center's Kaohsiung area held a ceremony today. During the ceremony, Zhang Zhen-shan, who is the head of the Securities and Futures Bureau at the FSC, told reporters that the Taiwan stock market is still around 23,000 points. He added that with current global tariff trends, "Taiwan's position should be fine."</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if the FSC had plans for different tariff rates. Zhang Zhen-shan said that people in the market might be worried, but the exact tariff numbers are not clear yet. He also said that the Taipei Exchange and Taiwan Stock Exchange have been asked to study how tariffs might affect different industries. He still thinks "it should be okay."</p>
            <p>The FSC also added that the Taiwan stock market closed today at 22987.92 points. It went down by 352.64 points, which is a drop of 1.51%. The total money traded was 435.315 billion NT dollars. Foreign investors bought more shares, totaling 10.024 billion NT dollars. At the same time, Shanghai went up by 0.61%, Hong Kong went up by 0.37%, Singapore went down by 0.14%, Japan went down by 0.29%, and Korea went down by 1.60%.</p>
            <p>The FSC pointed out that by the end of June this year, the price-to-earnings ratio was about 17.78 times. The cash dividend yield was 2.96% (or 3.05% including stock dividends). From January to June 2025, companies listed on the Taiwan stock market made about 22.85 trillion NT dollars in total income. This is 13.75% more than the same period last year, and it is the highest ever for this period. As of July 21, the margin maintenance ratio for credit trading accounts was 178.59%.</p>

            <h1>Sea Dragon Frogmen to Focus on Penghu; Army: To Improve Overall Combat Power</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter You Kai-xiang, Taipei, July 22) The "Sea Dragon Frogmen" belong to the Army Aviation and Special Forces Command. They are very important for defending Taiwan's small islands far from the main island. It is understood that they used to focus on Kinmen and Matsu. But now, because of new barracks and training plans, most of their soldiers will move to the Penghu area. The Army said that where they put soldiers and how they use them depends on what missions they have and what dangers they face. This is to make their fighting power stronger.</p>
            <p>The "Sea Dragon Frogmen" are a key part of Taiwan's military. They are part of the Army Aviation and Special Forces Command's Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion. They can fight on land, in water, and in the air. They also do tasks like sniping, sneaking into enemy areas, blowing things up, fighting terrorism, and searching for people. Right now, they are on islands like Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu. But their main base is in Kinmen, and they mostly focus on Kinmen and Matsu.</p>
            <p>It is understood that the Sea Dragon Frogmen have worked with the US for many years and trained together. After thinking about many things, the military decided to move most of the Sea Dragon Frogmen to Penghu. This is because new barracks have been built in Penghu. Also, the base there has tracks that can quickly launch and set up their special "Sea Dragon boats." The military is still thinking about whether to give them unmanned boats.</p>
            <p>The Army Command said that how they place and use their soldiers depends on the threats from enemies and the needs of their missions. This is to make their overall defense stronger. Military exchanges between Taiwan and the US are normal and planned activities. They happen according to yearly plans. The Army does not usually comment on these exchanges.</p>

            <h1>Humanistic Education Foundation: Zhou Tai-ying's Harm to Students is Enough for Lifetime Dismissal</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chen Chih-chung, Taipei, July 22) Today, National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) held a meeting about the women's soccer team blood sampling case. It is said that the committee decided to fire coach Zhou Tai-ying. Feng Chiao-lan, who is the head of the Humanistic Education Foundation, said that the harm Zhou Tai-ying caused to students is enough for her to be fired forever. She added that if Zhou is only fired for 2 or 4 years, it means the university is not taking the issue seriously.</p>
            <p>At NTNU, it became known that women's soccer coach Zhou Tai-ying threatened players to take blood samples for research by saying she would take away their class credits. Today, the Department of Athletic Performance held a committee meeting to talk about the soccer team's blood sampling case. Trustworthy sources say that the committee decided to "dismiss" Zhou Tai-ying. However, the head of the Athletic Performance department, Zheng Jing-feng, would only say that they made a different decision from the first committee meeting. (The first decision was about five smaller punishments, like not giving a pay raise, but not dismissal). Zheng hopes this new decision meets what society expects.</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan from the Humanistic Education Foundation told a CNA reporter today that it is still not clear if the committee decided on "lifetime dismissal," or "dismissal with no re-employment for 4 years," or "dismissal with no re-employment for 2 years."</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan thinks that Zhou Tai-ying's actions and the harm she caused to students are enough for "lifetime dismissal." For example, a recently revealed audio recording showed that after the issue became public, Zhou Tai-ying still threatened students. She told them to say what she wanted them to say to outsiders. All her actions show that Zhou Tai-ying often treats students in a bad way. She does not know how to set clear limits between teachers and students, or in relationships with others. She also cannot control her feelings.</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan said that for a long time, Zhou Tai-ying treated students as if they were her own property, or people she could order around. She forgot that students are independent people. Feng called this "a very strong abuse of power."</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan also mentioned that problems with academic ethics should be considered. Zhou threatened students who did not agree to the blood test by saying they would have to "leave the team." Even at a recent press conference, Zhou still told the public that she "did not threaten students with credits." This shows that her attitude after the event is not good.</p>
            <p>Recently, Zhu Jun-zhang, the Deputy Minister of Education, spoke publicly. He stressed that on July 18, the "Review Committee for Campus Bullying Incidents in Colleges and Universities" met. This committee decided that, according to the law, this case meets the conditions for "lifetime dismissal" or "dismissal with no re-employment for 4 years."</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan explained that the three levels of faculty committees at NTNU act independently. However, the Ministry of Education, as the main authority, can still explain laws and state its position, which can have an effect. She also asked the later college and university faculty committees at NTNU to seriously consider "lifetime dismissal." She said that if they don't, it means they don't understand how serious this event is, and they will not be able to truly make the sports environment at the school better.</p>
