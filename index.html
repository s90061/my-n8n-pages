Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner, the world's number one, moved to the Wimbledon quarter-finals in an unexpected way. His opponent, Grigor Dimitrov from Bulgaria, had to stop playing in the third set because of an injury. Sinner was losing the first two sets when this happened.

Sinner fell in the first game and hurt his right elbow, losing the first two sets 3-6 and 5-7. In the third set, with the score at 2-2, Dimitrov, who is 34 years old, got injured while serving.

Dimitrov was in pain and sat on the court, holding his chest. Sinner went to check on him. After getting some medical help, Dimitrov told Sinner he had to quit the game. Sinner hugged him, and Dimitrov wiped away tears.

Sinner, who is 23 years old and has won three Grand Slam titles, will play against Ben Shelton from the US in the quarter-finals. Sinner has never reached the Wimbledon men's singles final, with his best result being the semi-finals in 2023.

Separately, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic won his match against Alex de Minaur from Australia. Djokovic was losing at first but then won three sets to reach the quarter-finals. This was his 101st win at Wimbledon.

Djokovic, who is 38 years old and has won Wimbledon seven times, is trying to win a record 25th Grand Slam title. He will play Flavio Cobolli from Italy in the quarter-finals. If Sinner and Djokovic both win their quarter-final matches, they will play each other in the semi-finals.

**Brazilian President Criticizes Trump's Tariff Threat: BRICS Countries Can Respond in Kind**

Brazilian President Lula criticized US President Donald Trump today at the BRICS summit in Rio de Janeiro. He especially spoke against Trump's threat to add a 10% tax on goods from countries that "agree with BRICS' anti-American policies." Lula said that if the US adds these taxes, BRICS countries also have the right to respond in the same way, following the principle of fairness.

Lula said that Brazil is a country that makes its own decisions. He also said that BRICS was created not to be against anyone, but to offer a new way for countries to work together globally.

Lula thinks that Trump's threats to other countries through the internet are not responsible and are wrong. He also said, "The world has changed, and we don't need an emperor." He repeated that if the US adds taxes, BRICS countries can respond in the same way.

When Trump defended Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro, Lula said that protecting Brazil's democracy is only for Brazilians, and no one is above the law.

Lula also said that Trump's comments did not affect the BRICS summit much. He said that BRICS leaders didn't even talk about the extra taxes, which shows "no one takes it seriously."

Even though Lula used strong words, Brazil's foreign ministry chose not to have a direct conflict with the US. The BRICS summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from July 6th to 7th. In a statement on July 6th, BRICS leaders criticized Trump's taxes without mentioning him by name. They warned against "unfair, one-sided protective actions, including adding taxes equally without looking at each case."
