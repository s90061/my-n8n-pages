            <h1>Head of South Korea's Unification Church Detained for Alleged Bribery of Former First Lady</h1>
            <p>Korean media reports that the Seoul Central District Court today ordered the detention of Han Hak-ja, the head of the Unification Church. She is accused of giving bribes to Kim Keon-hee, the wife of former President Yoon Suk-yeol. The court is worried she might hide evidence.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency stated that the Seoul Central District Court in South Korea issued an arrest warrant. This was because they feared Han Hak-ja might destroy evidence, which was one reason the prosecutors asked for her detention.</p>
            <p>Han Hak-ja, who is 82 years old, was questioned last week about possibly bribing former First Lady Kim Keon-hee. After that, prosecutors asked for her detention. Han Hak-ja is the widow of Sun Myung Moon, who started the Unification Church and passed away in 2012.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Korean prosecutors have charged Kim Keon-hee with several crimes, including taking bribes. Kim Keon-hee is accused of taking bribes worth 80 million Korean won. This included two Chanel bags and a diamond necklace. These gifts were allegedly given so she would help the Unification Church with its business.</p>
            <p>Kim Keon-hee's lawyer said that she did not take any gifts. Han Hak-ja also said she was not involved in any illegal activities and called the accusations against her "fake news."</p>

            <h1>Jimmy Kimmel's Talk Show Returns on September 23 After Suspension for Comments on Conservative Influencer's Death</h1>
            <p>American talk show host Jimmy Kimmel's show was stopped on September 17. This happened after he made comments about the death of conservative political influencer Charlie Kirk. Today, Disney announced that his late-night talk show will be back on TV screens on September 23.</p>
            <p>ABC, which is owned by Disney, announced on September 17 that Jimmy Kimmel's show would be stopped for an unknown time. This was because his comments on September 15 about Charlie Kirk's death received a lot of criticism.</p>
            <p>At that time, Jimmy Kimmel said on his show: "Last weekend, we saw that the MAGA group had no limits. They tried to separate themselves from the person who killed Kirk, and they tried every way to gain political advantage from this event."</p>
            <p>Disney released a statement today: "Last Wednesday, we decided to pause the show. This was to avoid making tensions worse when people across the country felt strong emotions. We made this decision because we thought some comments were not appropriate at that time and showed a lack of understanding."</p>
            <p>"Over the past few days, we had deep talks with Jimmy Kimmel. After our discussions, we decided to bring the show back on Tuesday, September 23."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) noted that the sudden stop of Jimmy Kimmel's show was clearly due to pressure from the Trump administration on ABC. This also made many liberal people very angry. Critics said that Jimmy Kimmel was targeted because he often spoke against President Trump.</p>
