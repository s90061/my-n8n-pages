            <h1>Russia Denies Drone Entered Polish Airspace, Calls Warsaw's Claim Nothing New</h1>
            <p>The Kremlin today said that statements from Warsaw and other European countries about a Russian drone being shot down in Poland, a NATO member country, were "nothing new." Moscow also stated it would not comment further on the situation.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Poland, Ukraine, and Lithuania released a joint statement today. They said Russia sent a drone into Polish airspace yesterday, calling it a planned and unusual act of aggression.</p>
            <p>Regarding this joint statement, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that Moscow would not make new comments about the situation. This is because the Russian Ministry of Defense has already given a statement.</p>
            <p>Peskov told the media, "There will be no new comments. Our Ministry of Defense has already commented on this and said that discussions can be provided if needed. There is nothing more to add."</p>
            <p>He continued, "As for the words and statements we hear from Warsaw, in fact, there is nothing new in them. Such statements have become common in almost all European capitals recently. We see that this continues."</p>

            <h1>Keelung Father Accused of Suffocating Son with Pillow, Court Orders Continued Detention</h1>
            <p>A man named Jian in Keelung is suspected of using a pillow to suffocate his 5-year-old son on May 14 this year. This happened after he argued with his wife. He was arrested and held in custody after the event. Prosecutors have charged him with murder, and his case was sent to court today. The Keelung District Court said that Mr. Jian might try to run away, so they decided to keep him in custody.</p>
            <p>Police investigations show that Mr. Jian and Ms. Zhang had a 5-year-old son after they got married. The couple often argued about small things in their daily life. After they separated in April this year, they agreed that their son would live with his mother at her parents' home. With his wife's permission, Mr. Jian could pick up their son from school and take him to his (Mr. Jian's) home to stay.</p>
            <p>On the evening of May 14, Mr. Jian's wife went to his home to pick up their son. When she entered the room, she found Mr. Jian was not there. To her shock, she saw her son lying on the bed with no signs of life. She called for help, and he was taken to the hospital, but he did not survive.</p>
            <p>After the police received the report, they arrested Mr. Jian the next day. Mr. Jian admitted that he killed his son.</p>
            <p>The Keelung District Court announced tonight that after questioning by the judge, Mr. Jian admitted to the crimes mentioned in the indictment. The court believes he broke the Child and Youth Welfare and Rights Protection Act and the Criminal Code for a grown-up purposely killing a child. Also, because he might try to escape, the court ordered him to stay in custody according to the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>
