            <h1>Japanese Poll: Sanae Takaichi Most Popular for Next Prime Minister</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Yang Ming-chu, Tokyo, July 22) In Japan, the ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, lost in the recent Upper House election. The leader of the LDP and Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, is being held responsible. A new poll from Japanese media shows that if the LDP continues to lead the government, most people think Sanae Takaichi, who was a minister for economic security, is the best person to be prime minister.</p>
            <p>NNN, a Japanese TV news network, and Yomiuri Shimbun did a phone poll on July 21st and 22nd. They asked, "If the LDP government continues to rule, who is the best person to be prime minister?" The results were: Sanae Takaichi, former economic security minister (26%), Shinjiro Koizumi, minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries (22%), and the current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba (8%).</p>
            <p>Other results showed: Taro Kono, former digital minister (7%), Takayuki Kobayashi, economic security minister (3%), former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (2%), former Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa (2%), former LDP Secretary-General Toshimitsu Motegi (2%), and Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato (1%).</p>
            <p>The poll also showed that support for Ishiba's government is 22%. This is a 10% drop from June and the lowest since he became prime minister in October last year. The disapproval rate for Ishiba's government is very high at 67%, which is a 14% increase from June and the highest since he took office.</p>
            <p>The Upper House election ended on July 20th. The two ruling parties, the LDP and Komeito, won fewer seats than their goal of 50. Even with the seats they already had, they do not have more than half of the seats in the Upper House. The poll shows that 54% of people think the prime minister should resign.</p>
            <p>When people were asked which party they want to be in power, 47% said they want the opposition parties to form a new government. 35% said they want the LDP to continue leading the government.</p>
            <p>The same question was asked in a poll after the Lower House election in October 2024. At that time, 43% wanted the government to continue, and 40% wanted a change in government.</p>
            <p>This poll also showed that when people were asked, "If there is a change in government, which party would be better to lead?", most people chose the Democratic Party for the People or the Constitutional Democratic Party, both at 23%.</p>
            <p>After that, the Sanseito Party had 11%, Japan Innovation Party 9%, Reiwa Shinsengumi 4%, Japan Conservative Party 2%, Team Future 2%, Social Democratic Party 1%, and the Communist Party 0%.</p>
            <p>In total, 1043 people answered this poll. 408 people answered using a landline phone, and 635 people answered using a mobile phone. (Editor: Wei Hsu) July 22, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Cathay Financial Holdings Sees Big Chances in Taiwan's Wealthy Market</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Su Szu-yun, Kaohsiung, July 22) Cathay Financial Holdings today shared the results of its trial services in the Kaohsiung special zone. Cathay Life Insurance said that since they started offering services for high-value customers on July 1st, the insurance payments for cases being checked have already reached over 10 million New Taiwan Dollars. These customers were not on Cathay Life's current list of high-value customers. This shows that there is a good chance to find more wealthy customers in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) held a ceremony to open the Kaohsiung special zone for the Asia Asset Management Center. Taipei Fubon Bank and Cathay United Bank were also invited to share their experiences.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings stated that the group uses three main parts: banking, insurance, and asset management, to connect all its resources. Fu Po-sheng, the head of Cathay United Bank's private banking and high-value customer services, shared that Cathay United Bank plans to open a new branch in the Kaohsiung special zone. This branch will connect with other parts of the group. The trial services include cross-border financial services, loans based on financial assets (Lombard Lending), new insurance policies and premium loans, and special investments for family offices.</p>
            <p>Mr. Fu Bo-sheng said that Cathay United Bank will use the group's professional experience and teamwork from both Taiwan and other countries. This will help them meet the varied and international needs of wealthy customers.</p>
            <p>To meet the three main needs of wealthy customers â€“ growing wealth, keeping wealth safe, and passing it on while saving on taxes â€“ Cathay Life has actively joined the Kaohsiung asset management special zone. They have started offering special insurance products for these wealthy customers.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life pointed out that in less than half a month since July 1st, they have successfully gotten wealthy customers to buy insurance. The insurance payments for cases that are currently being checked have already gone over 10 million New Taiwan Dollars. These customers were not on Cathay Life's existing list of wealthy clients. This shows that there is a promising hidden market for wealthy people in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>After the event, Cheng Shao-kai, the Vice President of Cathay Life Insurance, said that Cathay Life considers customers with yearly insurance payments of 5 million New Taiwan Dollars as wealthy customers. They currently have nearly 2,000 such customers. They also see customers with yearly payments of 3 million New Taiwan Dollars as almost wealthy customers, with about 4,000 of them. In total, they aim for about 6,000 customers. From the cases they are checking now, it seems there are "more wealthy customers in Taiwan than we thought."</p>
            <p>Cheng Shao-kai noted that for the services offered in the special zone, two people have already started the process of proving their assets. Cathay Life aims to get 450 million New Taiwan Dollars in yearly insurance payments from this special zone.</p>
            <p>Following the government's plan to create the Kaohsiung asset management special zone, HSBC (Taiwan) Commercial Bank held a ceremony today at its Lingya branch in Kaohsiung. They announced that the Lingya branch will be HSBC's main office in the Kaohsiung asset management special zone. They will use the bank's resources to create special products for wealthy customers in Taiwan. (Editor: Yang Kai-hsiang) July 22, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Hits Northern Vietnam, Authorities Warn of Floods and Landslides</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Hanoi, July 22, based on foreign reports) Typhoon Wipha landed in northern Vietnam today and became weaker. However, the authorities are still careful because the heavy rain it brings can still cause floods and mudslides.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center of Vietnam said Wipha was coming towards Vietnam with winds almost 28 meters per second strong. But when it landed in Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces this afternoon, its strongest winds had gone down to about 21 meters per second.</p>
            <p>Wipha is the first typhoon that Vietnam has faced this year. Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh had already told provinces along the coast to be ready. About 350,000 soldiers are now waiting to help.</p>
            <p>People living there are worried because Typhoon Ma-on hit Vietnam very badly last year. It caused about 300 deaths and 3.3 billion US dollars in damage (about 97 billion New Taiwan Dollars). So, people are worried about Typhoon Wipha.</p>
            <p>The weather forecast says that heavy rain in Vietnam will continue until tomorrow morning. The rain could be as much as 500 millimeters. Authorities are telling people to be careful about mudslides in the mountains and floods in cities. (Intern translator: Cheng Chi-yuan / Editor: Chang Cheng-chien) July 22, 2025.</p>
