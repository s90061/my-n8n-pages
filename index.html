            <h1>Traditional Chinese Medicine Joins the Gym Business, Aiming for the 30 Billion Sports Market</h1>
            <p>Not everyone goes to the gym, but many people go to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinics. The TCM field is not only focused on beauty and fertility treatments, but now it is also entering the sports industry, which is worth 30 billion New Taiwan dollars. They are looking for new opportunities with people who do not yet go to gyms but need health support.</p>
            <p>"The number of people who need to see a doctor shows how many potential customers there are," said Wu Jun-ching, a doctor who runs a clinic that offers both TCM and emergency services. He told reporters today that less than 5% of gym members are active, but about 70% of people in Taiwan have seen a TCM doctor. Combining TCM and fitness is not just about bringing two fields together; it's a new beginning for the health industry. He calls it a "blue ocean beyond a blue ocean," meaning it's a very new and open market.</p>
            <p>Young people often sit for a long time and are very stressed, so "pain" has become a common modern problem. More people now believe in preventing illness. Many people know that exercise can help with pain. Wu Jun-ching said that many office workers who start exercising often feel that it doesn't help, or they even feel more pain. The problem might not be their exercise method, but that their bodies are not ready. At this point, they need TCM to help their bodies from the inside.</p>
            <p>Wu Jun-ching believes that as more people get older, it is important to stay active, and muscle strength is key. For older people, gyms might seem strange, but TCM is like an old friend. If TCM is combined with step-by-step training and doctors are always available to give advice, TCM gyms could become a safe way for older people to start exercising.</p>
            <p>Li Wei-yi, another TCM clinic director, also said that TCM gyms are not for making strong men. Instead, they give useful exercise advice for people of all ages with different needs. Even if someone only wants to sit without pain or climb stairs without getting tired, they can find a suitable training plan. A good gym, like a good TCM clinic, is not just for athletes; everyone can come in.</p>
            <p>Li Wei-yi further explained that the goal of combining TCM with gyms is not just to stop pain, but to prevent it from coming back. Office workers who sit for long periods often have stiff necks and back pain. In the past, they would get temporary relief from massage or acupuncture. But the effect was only for a short time. "We give more than just acupuncture or medicine; we also give exercise plans and 'homework' to help them keep exercising."</p>
            <p>Li Wei-yi believes that the main idea of TCM gyms is to change from passive treatment (where someone does something to you) to active recovery (where you do something yourself). This means patients leave the clinic and go to the gym. With a professional coach, they can make their lower back muscles stronger, learn how to stand correctly, and get into the habit of exercising. Only by building muscle strength can people truly say goodbye to pain.</p>
            <p>Grace, a Pilates coach, said that regular gyms usually only offer simple exercise training. They do not offer full services like diet advice or TCM care. From her experience, many students who want to lose weight only exercise but do not change their body condition or daily habits. This often makes their weight loss progress slower.</p>
            <p>Grace said that combining TCM with fitness is like using "internal and external methods" at the same time. Also, using smart AI tools can accurately check body fat and muscle amount. It can even find fascia problems that cause the body to be uneven. Then, they can plan suitable exercises, like core training or other fitness plans, to reach health and body shape goals more effectively.</p>

            <h1>Melania's Letter to Putin Asks for Peace for Children</h1>
            <p>In Washington, August 16 â€“ The President of the United States, Donald Trump, gave a special gift to the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, at their meeting in Alaska. It was a letter written by his wife, First Lady Melania. In the letter, she asked the Russian leader to bring peace for children.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that after the meeting between Trump and Putin yesterday did not make a big step forward, Melania Trump's office shared the Fox News report on social media platform X today. The report showed the short letter.</p>
            <p>According to Fox News, after Trump gave the "peace letter" to Putin, Putin opened and read it right away. Representatives from both sides watched.</p>
            <p>The letter, which Melania signed, said: "In today's world, some children must laugh quietly, not affected by the darkness around them." The letter did not mention Ukraine.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Putin, you alone can bring back their sweet laughter. By protecting the innocence of these children, you do more than just for Russia; you do it for all people," the letter continued.</p>
            <p>The letter also said: "Such a bold idea goes beyond all human differences. And Mr. Putin, today you have the power to make this idea real with one simple action. Now is the time."</p>
            <p>In July, Trump had said that his wife, who was born in Slovenia, helped him change his thoughts about Putin.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I went home and told the First Lady, 'You know what, I talked to Putin on the phone today, and we had a very good talk.'"</p>
            <p>"Then she said, 'Oh, really? Another city was just bombed.'"</p>
            <p>Soon after his second term began, Trump tried to make friendly relations with Putin again. During his election campaign, he had promised to stop the war in Ukraine within 24 hours.</p>

            <h1>Is Solar Power in Taiwan the Most Expensive? Ministry Says No Easy Comparison</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 17 â€“ Some news reports said that solar power is the most expensive in Taiwan. They also said that if Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) built it, the cost would be at least 50% less. The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) today released a press statement to explain. They said that different countries start their renewable energy efforts in different ways, so it is not fair to compare prices directly. Taiwan's solar power price has already gone down by 60%.</p>
            <p>The news reports claimed that solar power is the most expensive in Taiwan and that Taipower could cut costs by 50% if they built it. The MOEA's Energy Administration explained today that Taiwan's system for buying solar power was set up in 2009. This was the first way to support renewable energy.</p>
            <p>The MOEA pointed out that in 2010, the price for one unit of solar power was 11.76 New Taiwan dollars on average. But by 2025, it has dropped to 4.30 New Taiwan dollars per unit, which is a 60% decrease. This happened because technology improved and the market became more developed. Also, about 25% of solar power is now sold directly to private businesses in Taiwan. This shows that the market for renewable energy is slowly becoming more varied.</p>
            <p>The MOEA's Energy Administration stressed that when countries promote renewable energy, they have different natural resources, how developed their industry technology is, how mature their electricity market is, and how their policies are designed. So, comparing prices directly can give wrong information. For example, India, Japan, and Germany mostly use systems where companies bid for projects or get extra money. These systems are clearly different from Taiwan's system, so it's not fair to compare them directly.</p>
            <p>The MOEA's Energy Administration added that the media's claim that "Taipower building it would cut costs by 50%" is not true. Taipower's main job is to make sure there is enough power supply. The cost of solar energy depends on many different things. These include how easy it is to get land, how big the project is, how developed the technology is, and how much prices change in the supply chain. So, Taipower running the project does not automatically lead to a large drop in costs.</p>
            <p>The MOEA's Energy Administration stated that the price for buying renewable energy is set every year by a special committee. They follow fair, open, and strict rules. They also consider Taiwan's environmental conditions, goals for promoting renewable energy, and what is happening with technology around the world. This helps them set a fair price. In the future, they will continue to learn from other countries and review the system. This will help Taiwan steadily reach its goal of having 20% green energy and also change policies to meet the needs of industries that require green electricity.</p>
