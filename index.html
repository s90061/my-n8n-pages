            <h1>Lu Shiow-yen Joins Lo Chih-chiang for Meal, Offers Support</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen joined KMT party leader candidate Lo Chih-chiang tonight at a famous "Taichung Rouyuan" shop for a live broadcast. Lu Shiow-yen said that this shop has been open for almost 100 years and is one of her favorite places to eat. She hopes to help the economy using the candidate's popularity. She also sent her good wishes and support to Lo Chih-chiang.</p>
            <p>Last week, Lu Shiow-yen ate sticky rice cakes with another party leader candidate, Hau Lung-pin. Tonight, she joined Lo Chih-chiang, a legislator who is running for KMT party leader, to eat rouyuan. Lu Shiow-yen said that because all the party leader candidates are very popular, her job as mayor is to help the economy. So, she is using the candidates' popularity to help Taichung's economy.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen explained why she chose "Taichung Rouyuan." She said this shop in Taichung is almost 100 years old and is one of her favorite places to eat. She has been eating there for decades. When she was a news director for a TV station, her apartment was across the street from "Taichung Rouyuan." So, she often went there to enjoy rouyuan. A shop that only sells rouyuan and has been open for almost 100 years, even getting a Michelin Bib Gourmand award, is truly a pride for Taichung.</p>
            <p>About Lo Chih-chiang running for party leader, Lu Shiow-yen said she will give him support and good wishes. She believes elections are happy events. She feels it's her duty as a party member to give opportunities to other members who are willing to take on responsibilities and serve. She must vote for good leaders. She will support and wish good luck to every candidate.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang said that many talented people are running in this party leader election, and everyone is great. He believes that whoever wins the KMT party leader position will be good for the party. He himself tries hard but stays calm during the process. Everyone is competing fairly. If they get the party members' good wishes, they will naturally win. Winning is the start of taking on responsibility. If they don't win, they should fully support the party leader. He thinks this is the right attitude. He said Lu Shiow-yen is someone everyone hopes to get good wishes from, so he visited her today.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang, who was born in Hualien, thanked Lu Shiow-yen for starting a "return-to-home rebuilding allowance" and sending Taichung City Fire Department workers to help in the disaster area of Guangfu Township, Hualien. He said that he thanked Lu Shiow-yen on behalf of Hualien legislator Fu Kun-chi and indigenous legislator Kao Chin Su-mei. He will also suggest that the central government consider starting a similar "return-to-home rebuilding allowance" like Taichung City Government.</p>
