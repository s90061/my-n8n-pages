A recycling plant in Kaohsiung's Gangshan District caught fire early this morning where plastic materials were stored. Firefighters put out the fire, and no one was hurt. Kaohsiung Environmental Protection Bureau said they will fine the company for breaking air pollution laws and waste disposal laws. The total fines could be up to NT$8 million.

The Kaohsiung City Fire Department said they got a report at 4:59 AM about a fire at a metal building on Youqing Road in Gangshan District. They sent 24 vehicles and 47 people to the scene. It was an open recycling plant, and recycled plastics and other things were burning. The fire was controlled at 5:35 AM and put out at 6:02 AM. No one was hurt or trapped.

The Kaohsiung City Environmental Protection Bureau said that the fire started at a closed factory that was storing waste plastics, causing a lot of pollution in the air. This breaks Article 32 of the Air Pollution Control Act, and the company will be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$5 million.

The Environmental Protection Bureau checked air quality sensors nearby during the fire. They found that in Gangshan and Qiaotou areas, the PM2.5 level briefly went up to 47.9 micrograms per cubic meter between 5:36 AM and 5:47 AM. After the fire was controlled and put out, the level dropped to the usual average of 13.5 micrograms per cubic meter. Other areas were not affected.

The Environmental Protection Bureau said that even though there was a short period of high pollution, the air cleared quickly today, and the PM2.5 levels are back to normal. Also, the air quality station in Qiaotou showed "good" to "average" air quality, meaning the fire did not make the air quality very bad.

The Environmental Protection Bureau also found that the waste plastics were stored outside without following the rules. This breaks Article 36 of the Waste Disposal Act, and the company will be fined between NT$6,000 and NT$3 million. They also found that the company renting the factory for the recycling plant had been fined three times in 2021 for breaking waste disposal laws, with total fines of NT$18,000.

**Canada Orders Hikvision to Stop Operations; China Opposes Discrimination Against Chinese Companies**

The Canadian government recently told Hikvision, a Chinese camera company, to stop working in Canada because of national security concerns. The Chinese Embassy in Canada said they are strongly against any unfair treatment of Chinese companies using national security as an excuse. They will take necessary steps to protect the rights of Chinese companies.

A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Canada said on June 28 that the Canadian government's order for Hikvision Canada to stop operating and close its business in Canada, based on "national security," harms the legal rights of Chinese companies and disrupts normal trade between China and Canada. China is very unhappy and strongly against this.

The spokesperson said that the Chinese government always encourages Chinese companies to do business fairly and according to international rules, while following local laws. China is strongly against any unfair actions that use national security to hurt Chinese companies.

The spokesperson also asked Canada to change its mind right away, stop making trade issues political, and stop treating Chinese companies unfairly. They want Canada to create a fair environment for Chinese companies to do business normally. China will do everything needed to protect the legal rights of Chinese companies.

Reuters reported earlier that Hikvision, also known as Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd., has been sanctioned by the US many times over the past five and a half years because of its business and equipment use in China's Xinjiang region.

Canadian Industry Minister Melanie Joly said on social media on June 27: "The government has decided that Hikvision Canada continuing to operate in Canada would harm Canada's national security."

**Student Who Cried While Running Becomes National Champion in Shot Put; Coach Chiang Mei-Fen Becomes a Role Model**

Chiang Mei-Fen, a coach at Dali High School in Taichung, is known as "Mama Chiang" to her students. She helped a student who used to cry while running around the track and was afraid of throwing the shot put. With her support and encouragement, this student became a national champion in shot put. She has been chosen as an example of an excellent educator.

The Ministry of Education announced today that Coach Chiang Mei-Fen from Dali High School in Taichung joined the track and field team in junior high. In the past, track and field training focused on strict rules, with athletes training, eating, and studying together. For Chiang, the hard daily training was to one day stand on the winner's stand.

Later, as a coach, Chiang trained with her students in all weather. However, she faced challenges because of the different ideas between old and new generations. For example, Chiang used to require boys to have very short hair, but today's students believe that being serious and fighting hard in a game has nothing to do with hair.

After thinking about it, Chiang realized that the time when coaches simply gave orders and expected students to obey was over. New generation students have their own ideas and need more time for discussion. Now, Chiang is called "Mama Chiang" by her students. She supports them in training, daily life, and studies. With her careful guidance, her students have achieved amazing records.

Chiang remembered that when she worked at a smaller school, the track was only 40 meters long. The training environment was limited. She found ways for students to run from the school gate into the school, and then throw a softball at a certain point. This helped them train for high jump and softball, and they even reached second place nationally.

There was also a male student who weighed over 100 kilograms and joined the track and field team. For several days, he cried while running around the track. Chiang realized that because of his weight, he couldn't run fast or jump far. She suggested he try shot put and asked him to shout loudly every time he threw the ball. His teammates cheered him on, and he learned to be competitive and confident through competitions. He went from being afraid of throwing the shot put to becoming a national champion in the event.
