            <h1>US Envoy Says Putin Agrees to Give Ukraine Strong Security Promises</h1>
            <p>Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for US President Trump, told CNN today that Russian President Putin agreed to let the United States give "strong security promises" to Ukraine. This agreement happened during a meeting between Putin and Trump. It is part of a possible peace deal.</p>
            <p>Witkoff told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" show, "We agreed on strong security promises. I would say this can change the situation."</p>
            <p>Witkoff also said that these security promises are like the protection in Article 5 of the NATO treaty. This would help Ukraine if Russia attacks again.</p>
            <p>He added that Putin also agreed to "write into law" that Russia will not go into any land in Ukraine or other parts of Europe. This is also part of a possible peace deal.</p>

            <h1>Terence Stamp, British Actor Who Played General Zod in Superman Movies, Dies</h1>
            <p>Terence Stamp, an experienced British actor, passed away today at 87 years old. He was well-known for playing the main bad guy, "General Zod," in the popular Hollywood movies "Superman" and "Superman II."</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp's family said in a statement to Reuters that he died this morning. The statement said, "He has left behind many great works. As an actor and a writer, he will continue to touch and inspire people for many years."</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp was born in the East End of London, UK, in 1938. During World War II, London was bombed. After leaving school, he first worked in advertising. Later, he got a scholarship to study acting in a drama school.</p>
            <p>He was nominated for an Oscar. He acted in movies like "Theorem" in 1968, "A Season in Hell" in 1971, and "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" in 1994.</p>
            <p>Also, Terence Stamp tried to get the role of James Bond, Agent 007, after Sean Connery. But he did not get the part.</p>
            <p>Terence Stamp played the main bad guy, "General Zod," in the 1978 movie "Superman" and the 1980 movie "Superman II." Christopher Reeve was the star of these movies.</p>
            <p>Before he died, he also acted in other movies and TV shows. These include "Valkyrie" in 2008, starring Tom Cruise, and "The Adjustment Bureau" in 2011, starring Matt Damon.</p>

            <h1>Many European Leaders Go with Zelensky to US, BBC Says This Is New</h1>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will go to Washington to meet with US President Donald Trump. Leaders from Europe and NATO will go with him. The BBC says this is a new and unusual event. It seems European leaders are a bit worried after the meeting between the US and Russia.</p>
            <p>The US wants the war between Russia and Ukraine to end quickly. Because of this strong pressure, Zelenskyy will fly to Washington tomorrow. He will try to protect Ukraine's interests and also try to avoid problems with Trump at the White House again.</p>
            <p>Today, these leaders announced they will go with Zelenskyy: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>
            <p>At first, it was just going to be a meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy. But now, it has become much bigger. Trump and Zelenskyy might still talk alone.</p>
            <p>The BBC said that this meeting is very unusual. It is hard to imagine so many European leaders quickly deciding to fly across the Atlantic Ocean to talk about one issue.</p>
            <p>European leaders seem a bit worried after Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska, USA.</p>
            <p>Now, a big goal for them will be to get security promises for Ukraine after a peace deal is made between Russia and Ukraine. European leaders also want to talk to Trump about Ukraine's land. They want to show that they will keep helping Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In February, Trump and US Vice President JD Vance spoke harshly to Zelenskyy in the White House Oval Office. Everyone in the world was shocked to see this.</p>
            <p>At that time, Zelenskyy was made to leave the White House. It was hard to think that their relationship could get better. But in the next few months, European leaders worked quietly to improve the relationship. Leaders who were friends with Trump tried their best to make Trump like Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy learned how to compliment Trump and how to talk like a businessman.</p>
            <p>In April this year, Ukraine and the US signed a deal about minerals. Trump and Zelenskyy also had a private talk in the Vatican. Ukraine clearly said they were willing to pay for US weapons.</p>
            <p>In July, Trump and Zelenskyy talked on the phone. Zelenskyy said it was "our best talk."</p>
            <p>People still think that Trump is easily influenced by praise and likes strong leaders. So, Ukraine is still worried about Putin's influence on Trump.</p>
            <p>But Zelenskyy continues to learn. Before the meeting in the Oval Office on the 18th, he has European friends to help him. Merz said about this: "We will give some good advice."</p>
            <p>The BBC also said that Keir Starmer will be important in helping Zelenskyy talk with Trump.</p>
            <p>Starmer has tried to keep a good relationship with Trump. In February this year, Starmer visited the White House, and Trump recently visited Scotland. The atmosphere was friendly during both visits. Starmer and Stubb might be the European leaders who are closest to Trump.</p>
            <p>The UK Prime Minister's office believes Starmer going to these events can help. He can be a middleman between Trump and Zelenskyy.</p>
