            <h1>6 Judges Not Allowed into Azerbaijan; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Strongly Protests</h1>
            <p>The Association of Judges of the Republic of China (Taiwan) announced today that 6 judges were supposed to go to Azerbaijan for an international meeting. But they were not given visas or permission to enter the country. The leader of the group was also not allowed to enter.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the Azerbaijani government stopped the judges from entering because of a made-up "one-China principle." This forced the group to cancel their trip. The Ministry said they are very sad about this and strongly protest Azerbaijan's actions.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters that the Association of Judges of the Republic of China had planned to send 6 judges to Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, in October. They were going to attend the 67th meeting of the International Association of Judges in 2025. However, the Azerbaijani government used a false "one-China principle" to stop the judges from entering. This caused the group to cancel their trip. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is very unhappy about this and strongly protests Azerbaijan's actions.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said again that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are separate countries. The Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan. Any statements that change Taiwan's independent status cannot change the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, which is known by other countries. It also said that discussions and cooperation between professional groups should not be about politics. Azerbaijan ignored professional rules and used political reasons to stop Taiwan from joining. This goes against the idea of "inclusion and equal participation" that the International Association of Judges supports. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticizes this.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also thanked the Czech Republic's group for speaking up for Taiwan at the meeting. They also thanked friendly countries like the United States and Canada for supporting Taiwan during the meeting. The Ministry asked Azerbaijan, as an independent country, to understand that the Chinese government is authoritarian. It should not agree with China's silly ideas, which could harm possible international cooperation and national interests.</p>

            <h1>US Dollar Falls, New Taiwan Dollar Drops Slightly to 30.686</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 17 (CNA) â€“ Officials from the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested they might lower interest rates in October. Because of this, the U.S. dollar got weaker. Asian currencies changed differently, some going up and some going down. The New Taiwan dollar moved up and down because the U.S. dollar was weaker and money was leaving Taiwan. In the end, it closed at 30.686, a small drop of 2.1 cents. This is the second day in a row it has fallen. The total amount of money traded in the Taipei and Yuanta foreign exchange markets was 1.7875 billion U.S. dollars.</p>
            <p>After Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, seemed to change his mind and become more open to looser money policies, Christopher Waller, a member of the Federal Reserve board, also hinted that he supports cutting interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in October.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve's friendly words about lowering rates made people expect rate cuts more. This affected how different countries' money changed value. According to the central bank's numbers, the U.S. dollar index went down by 0.47% today. Asian currencies had mixed results: the Chinese Yuan dropped a little by 0.02%, the New Taiwan dollar dropped by 0.07%, the Korean Won dropped a lot by 0.41%, and the Japanese Yen went up strongly by 1.03%.</p>
            <p>The New Taiwan dollar started today at 30.64 against the U.S. dollar. It went up because the U.S. dollar was weaker. However, the Taiwan stock market went up very high and then dropped a little. Foreign investors took money out to make a profit. This made the New Taiwan dollar move up and down. It reached a high of 30.62 and a low of 30.692 during the day. The central bank made some small adjustments at the end, and the currency closed with a small drop.</p>
            <p>A currency trader said that the topic of AI is still very popular, and the Taiwan stock market is also going up steadily, breaking new records often. But people are worried about a market crash, so many investors are selling their stocks to make a profit when prices are high. Today, foreign investors sold a lot more Taiwan stocks and took their money out of the country through the currency market. Also, companies that export goods think the New Taiwan dollar will get weaker, so they are not in a hurry to exchange their foreign money. This means the currency does not have strong support.</p>
            <p>The New Taiwan dollar also finished its weekly trading today, having dropped by 0.141 Taiwan dollars, or 0.46% in total. This is the second week in a row it has dropped.</p>
            <p>Currency traders believe that Federal Reserve officials have been saying they might lower interest rates, and the market has already reacted to this idea. From now on, unless expectations for rate cuts become even bigger (like a 0.5 percentage point cut), there will not be much more effect on the currency market. For now, foreign investors are still the most important factor for the New Taiwan dollar.</p>
            <p>Currency traders also pointed out that there are worries about loans from a U.S. bank. They need to see if this is just one problem or if it will cause other problems. If it causes more problems, U.S. stocks might fall, which could also make Taiwan's stock and currency markets fall. Also, how the disagreement in the U.S. government about stopping its work will end needs to be watched.</p>

            <h1>Company Involved in Hacking Radio Taiwan International Had City Contracts; Council Member Worries Sensitive City Data Leaked</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 17 (CNA) â€“ The website of Radio Taiwan International (RTI) was hacked, and its front page was replaced with a Chinese flag. A city council member found out that the company involved had received contracts from the city government. Council member Yen Ruo-fang said today that the people in charge of the company had opened a company in China. She is worried that sensitive city data might have been leaked. She wants the city government to provide a report on how to check for data leaks of sensitive information.</p>
            <p>An official from the Taipei City Department of Information said in a city council meeting that they will check this thoroughly.</p>
            <p>Democratic Progressive Party Taipei City Council member Yen Ruo-fang said this afternoon during a regular meeting of the Public Works Department that another council member mentioned yesterday that the company involved in the RTI case had won contracts to update and maintain the websites or databases of the Taipei City Department of Building Management and the Department of Cultural Affairs.</p>
            <p>Yen Ruo-fang said that after checking the information, it was found that this company involved in the case had received 5 contracts from Taipei City in 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2023. The Department of Cultural Affairs and the Department of Building Management also had over 1200 contracts. The company that fit these conditions was a certain technology company.</p>
            <p>She said that public information showed this company only has 2 owners, one as the person in charge and one as a director. But both of them had opened technology companies in China. Also, the company's director had started a "Cross-Strait Youth Alliance," which may have been involved in spreading Chinese propaganda.</p>
            <p>Yen Ruo-fang said that the company involved in the RTI case had also handled contracts for running official websites for both the central and local governments. She believes there might be security risks. She said that the Taipei City Department of Information should check all contracts this company got from the city government. The city government should also provide a report on how to assess where sensitive data might be at risk and create a system to stop such risks in future contracts.</p>
            <p>Yu Ji-xue, the director of the Taipei City Department of Building Management, said in the meeting that after checking records, it was found that this company had received a contract to maintain the department's official website. As for other contracts, they will ask an IT company to compare data. He also said that while this company used to maintain the official website, the warranty period has ended, and the Department of Building Management now maintains it themselves.</p>
            <p>Democratic Progressive Party Taipei City Council member Hung Wan-chen mentioned in a committee meeting yesterday that the RTI website's homepage was hacked and replaced with a Chinese flag. She said the company involved had contracts for updating and maintaining the websites or databases of the Taipei City Department of Building Management and the Department of Cultural Affairs. Zhao Shi-long, the Director of the Department of Information, responded at the time that he would provide a report on their findings within two weeks.</p>
