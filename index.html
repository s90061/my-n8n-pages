            <h1>Iran Says No to Direct Nuclear Talks with US; Currency Hits New Low</h1>
            <p>Before Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke at the United Nations General Assembly, Iran's money, the rial, reached a new low against the US dollar today. One US dollar was worth 1,074,000 rials.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that this big drop in value happened after Iran's top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said no to talking directly with the United States about its nuclear plans. Khamenei's decision might make it harder for President Pezeshkian and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to do diplomatic work in New York.</p>
            <p>The large drop in the rial also shows that last-minute talks between Iran and European countries might not stop the United Nations from putting more punishments on Iran for its nuclear program. The 30-day period before these punishments start will end on September 28.</p>

            <h1>Mata'an Stream Dam Overflows; Forest Agency Sent 7 Red Alerts to Hualien County</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a natural dam on Mata'an Stream in Hualien overflowed. This caused serious damage in Guangfu Township. Some people said they did not get warnings to leave their homes. The Forest and Nature Conservation Agency's records show that they talked with the Hualien County Government in August about moving people. Yesterday, they sent 7 red alerts to the Hualien County Government.</p>
            <p>Today, the Forest and Nature Conservation Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture shared their plans for the Mata'an Stream dam on Facebook. Starting from midnight on September 23, they sent 7 red alerts to the Hualien County Government. At 6 AM, they sent mobile phone messages to tell people to take shelter. After the dam overflowed at 2:50 PM, they sent more mobile phone messages at 3 PM and 4:30 PM to tell people to quickly move to safety.</p>
            <p>According to the agency's records, on July 26, the Hualien branch created a team to deal with the dam. They checked the situation and told areas downstream to be careful about possible dangers. After that, they used drones for photos, checked risks, and set up a warning system. On August 7, they visited the Hualien County Government to discuss how to move people and what to do.</p>
            <p>At 11 AM on September 21, the Forest and Nature Conservation Agency sent a yellow alert and mobile messages about the Mata'an Stream dam. They told people to follow government advice and take shelter. At 7 AM on September 22, they sent a red alert. They also sent mobile messages at 7 AM, 9 AM, and 12:30 PM to tell people to follow government advice and take shelter.</p>
            <p>The agency said that the soil that formed the dam was about 200 million cubic meters. It made a dam body 2300 meters long. Calculations showed that there was no immediate danger of the dam breaking before the water flowed over it. But once water flows over, the dam can be washed away quickly and get damaged faster. So, they made plans for four possible situations that could damage the dam: natural overflow, overflow due to typhoons or heavy rain, earthquakes stronger than magnitude 5, and water flowing through holes in the dam. They also made plans for warnings and telling people to leave.</p>
            <p>The agency also said that the dam is in a deep valley in a faraway mountain area. There is no road to get there, not even a path for people to walk. So, it was impossible to bring heavy machines for construction. Workers had to be taken by helicopter from the National Airborne Service Corps. This was to quickly install water level monitors on the dam. Also, the slopes near the dam continued to have soil falling, so it was dangerous for people to stay there for too long.</p>
            <p>The agency said that from July 26, they flew drones 17 times to take pictures. They calculated how much water the dam held and how fast the water level was rising. Experts guessed that even without more typhoons or heavy rain, with only normal rainfall, the dam would naturally overflow by early October. In the two months before the overflow, it was not possible to change the dam using engineering methods, both in terms of technology and time. So, before the overflow, they could only work with others to clear the river downstream, fix gaps in the riverbanks, and make the Mata'an bridge stronger.</p>
