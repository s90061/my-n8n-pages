            <h1>Taichung Shigan: 80-Year-Old Man's Car Falls Down Hillside, No Injuries</h1>
            <p>An 87-year-old man named Mr. Chuang was driving his car in Shigan District, Taichung City, yesterday. He was on Shigan Street, near Lower Pit Lane, number 126. It seems the road was narrow, and he didn't know the area well. He accidentally drove off the side of the road, and his car turned over. Luckily, he was able to get out of the car by himself and was not hurt.</p>
            <p>The Dongshi Police Station in Taichung City said in a written statement today that the event happened yesterday at about 9:29 AM. A car went off the road near number 126, Lower Pit Lane, Shigan Street, in Shigan District. The road was narrow, and the driver was not familiar with it. The car turned over, but the driver got out safely and was not injured.</p>
            <p>Police checked the area and found that the driver was the 87-year-old Mr. Chuang. He was driving alone when the accident happened. There were no traffic lights, signs, or road markings at the site, and no construction work was going on. Mr. Chuang had not been drinking and was not hurt. The police finished their work and made all the necessary records.</p>
            <p>Wu Yong-xin, the head of the Shigan Police Substation, reminded drivers that mountain roads are often narrow and winding. When driving on roads you don't know, you should slow down and be careful about the road conditions to avoid accidents.</p>

Also, it will be very hot all over Taiwan. Temperatures in the eastern part will be around 31 to 33 degrees Celsius. The western part will reach 34 to 35 degrees.

Only the Taitung area and the Hengchun Peninsula will have a few short rain showers. In the afternoon, the Gaoping area and other mountain areas will have some short thunderstorms. In the mountains, people should be careful about landslides, falling rocks, and loose soil. If you go to the mountains or rivers, please be safe.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, the eastern part will be around 31 to 33 degrees, while the western part can reach 34 to 35 degrees.

            <h1>Typhoon Podul to Have Strongest Impact on Taiwan from August 13th; Sea Warning Possible</h1>
            <p>The Weather Bureau has announced that a typhoon has formed. The tropical depression that was located north-northeast of Guam's sea area became a weak typhoon, named Podul (number 11), at 2 AM. After August 12th, it will slowly move closer to the sea southeast of Taiwan. Its biggest impact will be on August 13th and 14th. The Bureau might even issue a sea warning.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau said that Typhoon Podul formed at 2 AM from a tropical depression that was north-northeast of Guam. The center of the typhoon is now 2660 kilometers east of Eluanbi. It is expected to move west.</p>
            <p>Weather Bureau forecaster Zeng Chao-cheng told Central News Agency that Typhoon Podul will come close to the sea southeast of Taiwan after August 12th. The most noticeable impact will be on August 13th and 14th, with significant rain expected in the eastern parts of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Zeng Chao-cheng reminded everyone that we still need to see if the typhoon will move closer to Taiwan or the Bashi Channel, as this will change its effect on Taiwan. If the typhoon gets very close to the sea east of Taiwan, the Bureau might issue a sea typhoon warning. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about its path right now.</p>
