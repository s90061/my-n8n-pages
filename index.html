            <h1>New York, New Jersey Heavy Rain Causes Chaos for Land and Air Travel; Flood Warnings Issued in Many Northeastern US Areas</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain hit parts of New York and New Jersey tonight. Many areas in the northeastern United States have flood warnings. This has caused big problems for traffic, and many cars are stuck.</p>
            <p>News reports say that New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency. He asked people to stay inside. Authorities in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania also warned that roads are dangerous because of possible floods.</p>
            <p>Tonight, flights stopped taking off at New York's JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport. This led to dozens of flights being canceled.</p>
            <p>CBS News reported that in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, sudden floods trapped several drivers. Rescuers used red floats and walked into the fast-moving floodwaters to help them.</p>
            <p>In New York City, videos shared online showed brown, muddy water shooting out like fountains in front of subway station gates. Many subway lines were stopped or delayed for a short time. On the streets, there was a lot of traffic jam, which blocked many main city roads.</p>
            <p>The National Weather Service told drivers to "turn around" if they see flooded roads. They warned that "most deaths from floods happen inside cars."</p>
            <p>The National Weather Service said that flood warnings for some parts of New Jersey will last until tomorrow morning. A slow-moving storm is expected to bring heavy rain to the Mid-Atlantic area of the United States.</p>

            <h1>Russia Says Trump Helping Ukraine Continue Fighting, Not Good for Making Peace</h1>
            <p>The Kremlin in Russia warned today that US President Donald Trump's promise to give Ukraine more weapons could make the war continue. He also threatened to punish Russia's trade partners. This might delay peace talks that have already stopped.</p>
            <p>News reports say that yesterday, Donald Trump said Russia had 50 days to agree on peace with Ukraine. He also spoke about his disappointment with Moscow. Also, he made a deal with NATO. The US will give new military help to Kyiv, paid for by NATO countries.</p>
            <p>Before this, Trump tried to make Russia and Ukraine start peace talks to end the war, which has lasted more than three years. However, Russia said no to calls for a ceasefire. In recent months, they have also attacked Ukraine many times with drones and missiles, more than ever before.</p>
            <p>Moscow said it needs more time to fully respond to Trump's statements. But they also hinted that what Trump is doing might not help the talks succeed.</p>
            <p>Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: "This decision made directly by Washington, NATO countries, and Brussels does not seem like a sign of peace to Kyiv. Instead, it seems like a way to continue the war."</p>
            <p>Peskov also said: "President Trump's statements are very serious. We really need time to look at what Washington said."</p>
            <p>Trump has warned that if Russia and Ukraine do not make a peace deal, he will put high taxes on the goods from Russia's remaining trade partners. This is to make it harder for Russia to pay for its military attacks.</p>

            <h1>France's Strategic Report Concerned About Taiwan Strait; Wu Chih-chung: Democratic Countries Stand With Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The French government has released an updated "National Strategic Report." This report talks about its worries over the Taiwan Strait and China's military exercises. Today, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it will work with other democratic countries to keep peace in the Taiwan Strait. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wu Chih-chung, also said on social media that the main democratic countries are standing with Taiwan. He called this "our common future."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced tonight that the French government released an updated "National Strategic Review 2025" report on July 14th. In this report, the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan are mentioned six times. The report says that China keeps increasing its military power and is doing more intense military exercises around the Taiwan Strait. It also says China is putting pressure on Taiwan with force and other methods. This makes the region tense and unstable.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the 2022 version of the report also talked about China's growing military power threatening the current situation in the Taiwan Strait. This year's report spends more time talking about China's threats to Taiwan and shows France's concern for Taiwan and the safety of the Taiwan Strait. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said he welcomes and thanks France very much for this.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also mentioned that French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer made a statement together on July 10th at the 37th UK-France Leaders' Summit in London. They repeated their promise to support peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. After this, France again showed its concern for the safety of the Taiwan Strait and the importance of Taiwan through its National Strategic Report.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed that Taiwan is an important part of the Indo-Pacific region. Taiwan will keep working with France and other democratic partners to protect freedom and democracy. It will also firmly work to keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
            <p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Chih-chung also posted on Facebook tonight. He said that the world's main democratic countries are all standing with Taiwan. He stated, "This is our common future."</p>
