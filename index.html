            <h1>Li Chen-Chang Has a Sense of Urgency; Coach Hirano Keiichi: Current Players Should Aim to Improve</h1>
            <p>Pitcher Li Chen-Chang of the CTBC Brothers team in Taiwan's professional baseball league has been playing well recently. The head coach, Hirano Keiichi, said that Li Chen-Chang is responsible and also has a sense of urgency. The coach sees good teamwork between younger players and older players. He believes that current players should not try to go back to how they played in the past, but instead should "improve" and become better.</p>
            <p>Li Chen-Chang, a 38-year-old pitcher for the Brothers, had some difficulties in early May. He was sent to the minor league on May 10th. He came back to the main league on June 22nd. Recently, his performance has improved. Before today's game, Coach Hirano Keiichi spoke to the media. He said that Li Chen-Chang is a player who takes responsibility. The coach thinks Li Chen-Chang also feels a need to do well.</p>
            <p>Hirano Keiichi is happy to see the "good teamwork" among the older players, middle-aged players, and young players on the team. He said that at the start of the season, pitchers Wu Li-Chen and Chen Kuan-Ying played well. But when the younger players got tired, other players stepped up. The young players and older players work well together. The coach also hopes that when Li Chen-Chang plays many games and gets tired, other players can step in and help.</p>
            <p>Hirano Keiichi also mentioned that it is not easy for someone of Li Chen-Chang's age to still throw pitches at 147 to 148 kilometers per hour. When asked if Li Chen-Chang had returned to his good form from the past, Hirano Keiichi said that as a current player, one should not just try to "go back to the past." This is because the past is already gone. Instead, players should try to "improve." He said that the saying "If you don't move forward, you fall behind" is very true.</p>

            <h1>Referendum to Restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant: Pingtung Council Member Says Survival Rights Cannot Be Voted On</h1>
            <p>Today, Hung Ming-Jiang, a Pingtung County Council member from the Democratic Progressive Party, spoke on the streets of Chaozhou Township. He said that the Third Nuclear Power Plant, located in Hengchun Township, Pingtung, puts people's right to live at risk. He believes that this kind of issue should not be decided by a vote. The referendum to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant will be voted on soon, and it is very important for people in Pingtung to understand why this matters.</p>
            <p>The question for the referendum on August 23rd is: "Do you agree to continue operating the Third Nuclear Power Plant after the authorities confirm it is safe?" Hung Ming-Jiang spoke to the media and said that the referendum is not right. He thinks the Pingtung County Government's statement against it is not enough. They need to do more to tell people about it.</p>
            <p>He explained that in the past, when one political party had too much power, people in Pingtung could not stop the Third Nuclear Power Plant from being built in Hengchun. Now, after 40 years, it has stopped working. But the parliament is trying to restart it with a referendum. However, he believes that issues about people's rights cannot be decided by a vote. For example, if there was a proposal to give rich people's money to poor families, even if the vote passed, it could not be done. He argues that a person's property cannot be taken away by "democracy and the majority." He says that the right to live is also like this.</p>

            <h1>Friendly Meeting, But No Peace Deal: Main Points of the Trump-Putin Summit</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin finished a friendly meeting today in Alaska. The meeting was about the war between Russia and Ukraine. Many people hoped for good news from this meeting. However, the two leaders did not reach a deal to stop the war, and they did not share many details about their talks.</p>
            <p>Here are the main points of the meeting, according to Reuters:</p>
            <h2>Body Language and Praising Each Other</h2>
            <p>Soon after Trump and Putin's planes landed at a U.S. military base in Alaska, they met on a red carpet. The mood was friendly. This was their first meeting since 2019. They greeted each other like old friends, smiling, shaking hands, and touching each other's arms. They seemed to get along very well.</p>
            <p>Hours later, when they finished their talks and appeared before reporters, the atmosphere seemed less warm. But they still praised each other strongly. Trump, as the host, let Putin speak first. Putin said he was happy to see Trump safe and well. Trump survived an attempt on his life in July last year.</p>
            <p>Trump said that he and Putin have always had a very good relationship. He did not talk about his unhappiness with Putin starting the war in Ukraine in 2022. He also did not mention any punishments Russia might face if it does not stop the war.</p>
            <p>But their efforts to show a good personal friendship hid an important fact: even with their friendship, they did not announce a deal to stop the war.</p>
            <h2>Will There Be a Deal?</h2>
            <p>Trump told reporters, "We made some good progress today." He did not say more. He added, "There is no real agreement yet."</p>
            <p>Before the meeting, Trump and his advisors tried to lower people's hopes for a big step forward in the war in Ukraine. Trump had said he wanted a ceasefire deal. The sign at the meeting place also said "Pursuing Peace."</p>
            <p>When Trump left Alaska, he had almost no results to show. This did not help his image as someone who is good at making deals. It also meant he had one less thing to boast about if he tried to win the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <h2>Understanding Putin and Bringing Up Former U.S. President Biden</h2>
            <p>Even though he did not make big concessions, Putin spoke in a way that pleased Trump. He agreed with Trump's claim, which has not been proven, that if Trump had won the last election instead of Joe Biden, the war in Ukraine would not have started.</p>
            <p>Putin ignored Biden's advice and ordered Russian troops to enter Ukraine.</p>
            <p>However, even while agreeing with Trump's idea about why the war started, Putin hinted that it was too early to solve the conflict in Ukraine. He said, "For the solution to last, we must remove all the root causes of this conflict. Russia has its own national interests."</p>
            <p>Putin did not say more, but he has long said that the eastward expansion of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) was the main reason for the war in Ukraine. He claims this put Russia's existence at risk. NATO, however, does not agree with this view.</p>
            <p>Putin had promised to fight until Ukraine was disarmed and neutral. Since these goals are still far away, his words today about "conflict causes" and "national interests" suggest he is ready to continue fighting.</p>
            <h2>No Questions from Reporters</h2>
            <p>Trump and Putin were very careful today when they spoke to the media. They each read a statement but did not allow any questions. This stopped reporters from asking for more details about the talks.</p>
            <p>However, for Putin, who is often isolated by other world leaders, just being invited to the U.S. to meet with the American president was a victory. He seemed very happy about this.</p>
