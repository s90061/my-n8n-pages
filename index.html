            <h1>European Stocks Close Higher as US Interest Rates and Powell's Future Are Watched</h1>
            <p>London, July 17 (CNA) â€“ European stock markets closed higher today. Investors were thinking about what might happen with interest rates in the US and if Jerome Powell would stay as the head of the US central bank, the Federal Reserve (Fed). US President Donald Trump said he does not plan to remove Powell right now, but he also said he might do it in the future.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 46.09 points, or 0.52%, and closed at 8972.64 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt rose by 361.55 points, or 1.51%, closing at 24370.93 points.</p>

            <h1>Bali District Office Says No Anti-Recall Flyers Were Included with Recall Announcements</h1>
            <p>New Taipei, July 17 (CNA) â€“ Reports came from Bali District in New Taipei City that flyers against a recall were included with official recall announcements. Late tonight, the Bali District Office said that they checked, and this did not happen. They think it might have been a misunderstanding because other groups were giving out flyers at a similar time. The district office also stated that they remain neutral.</p>
            <p>Tonight, New Taipei City Councilor Cheng Yu-en from the Democratic Progressive Party wrote on Facebook that a person from Pitou Village in Bali District complained. The person said they received a recall announcement that also had anti-recall flyers from Legislator Hung Mong-kai of the Kuomintang party.</p>
            <p>Lin Chao-chieh, the head of Bali District, spoke to CNA and said that when the office put together the recall announcements and voting notices, he watched. He said, "There were definitely no anti-recall flyers included."</p>
            <p>Lin Chao-chieh also added that the head of Pitou Village picked up the announcements at 2:30 PM today and started giving them out around 3:00 PM. He understood that Hung Mong-kai's volunteers gathered at a local temple around 4:00 PM to give out their flyers. This might have caused the misunderstanding.</p>
            <p>Hung Mong-kai said that it is normal to give out flyers to get people's support right before an election to stop the recall. He added that volunteers delivered all the flyers in that area door-to-door.</p>
            <p>Late tonight, the Bali District Office released a statement. After checking with village heads, neighborhood heads, and community leaders, they found no evidence that flyers were included. They also said that in recent days, different villages have been sending out voting notices. If groups that support or oppose the recall also give out flyers around the same time, then voting notices and flyers might appear in mailboxes at the same time. They asked people not to spread false information.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Bali District Office declared that they will remain completely neutral. They said that voting notices will never have any flyers attached or included.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission said that the commission and all election staff in New Taipei City will stay completely neutral. As part of their job, if there is clear proof of a complaint, they will seriously investigate and handle it.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine President's Chief of Staff: Xi Jinping Should Meet with Zelenskyy</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, July 17 (CNA) â€“ Andriy Yermak, who is the chief of staff for Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, has asked China's President Xi Jinping to meet with Zelenskyy soon for the first time. Yermak said that China can play a very important role in helping to make peace.</p>
            <p>Yermak recently spoke to The Times newspaper in the UK. He said, "It is very strange that Chinese President Xi Jinping has never met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. I think it is time now." He asked China to help find a way to end the war between Russia and Ukraine peacefully.</p>
            <p>Also, Yermak said that Ukraine has captured some Chinese prisoners of war and has their identity papers. He doubted China's claim that they knew nothing about this. He said, "In China, it is very hard to become a soldier for money (a mercenary) without anyone knowing." He thinks China is quietly encouraging its soldiers to become mercenaries for Russia, which helps Russia's military actions indirectly.</p>
            <p>The report also mentioned that since the war started, Europe has put many punishments on Russia. Because of this, Russia is depending more and more on doing business with China.</p>
            <p>Right now, 47% of Russia's oil and 44% of its coal exports go to China. Oil and natural gas make up about 60% of Russia's total exports and one-third of its total income. This shows how important the relationship between China and Russia is. After China, India is Russia's next most important trading partner.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Xi Jinping recently met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Beijing. After the meeting, Xi said that China and Russia will make their close strategic partnership even stronger. They will also support each other more in different international groups.</p>
            <p>US President Trump recently suggested a "50-day ceasefire" to Russia. Yermak said in the interview that secondary punishments (sanctions) would work. He meant that these punishments could really affect China and India.</p>
            <p>He said, "Only economic pressure can make Russian President Vladimir Putin agree. It will make him think that this war is too costly." Yermak also expects to see results within this year.</p>
            <p>Yermak also talked about the relationship between Ukraine and the US. He said that the two countries "are speaking the same language." He trusts Trump's decisions and believes that Trump will not easily change his policy of punishing Russia. He pointed out that Trump knows Putin does not want a ceasefire. Trump also learned from the problems with Iran that "force can sometimes bring peace."</p>
            <p>Even though China officially says it is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and does not give weapons to either side, Ukraine has often said that China is secretly helping Russia. Recently, Ukraine arrested two Chinese citizens. They are suspected of collecting secret information about Ukraine's own "Neptune" cruise missile technology for Chinese intelligence.</p>
            <p>Also, Ukraine said that about 60% to 65% of the electronic parts used inside Russia's self-destructing drones come from China.</p>
