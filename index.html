            <h1>11 Scam Cases Related to Hualien Flood; CIB and Wang Cai-hua Warn Against Fraud</h1>
            <p>Scammers are using the Hualien flood disaster to trick people. The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said today that they have received 11 reports about such scams. Most of these, 8 cases, were about giving away rain boots, which led to over 620,000 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) lost. Famous artist Wang Cai-hua also came to help tell people how to recognize and prevent scams.</p>
            <p>Today, the CIB held a press conference. They named it "Scammers Misuse People's Kindness. CIB Calls: Kindness Needs Protection." They specially invited Wang Cai-hua to help spread awareness about scam prevention.</p>
            <p>CIB Director Chou Yu-wei said that the latest numbers from the "165 Anti-Fraud Dashboard" show that in September this year, there were 470 scam cases reported each day on average across the country. The total money lost was over 223.92 million NTD. Compared to the same time last year, when there were 601 cases and 396.80 million NTD lost, the numbers have gone down by 22% and 44% respectively.</p>
            <p>Chou Yu-wei explained that even though the total number of scam cases is decreasing, scammers keep finding new ways to trick people. So, everyone still needs to be very careful.</p>
            <p>He reminded people that because of the Hualien flood disaster, many people want to help. Many have given supplies, money, or worked as volunteers. But some scammers are pretending to help with the disaster. They use tricks like "fake charity scams" or "online shopping scams" to cheat people. He asked everyone to check that donation information is correct.</p>
            <p>Head of the CIB's Anti-Fraud Center, Hsu Tzu-che, said that as of October 7, there were 11 scam cases related to the Hualien flood. The total money lost was over 620,000 NTD.</p>
            <p>Out of these, 8 cases were about giving away rain boots online. People lost about 480,000 NTD in these cases. Scammers would say that people only needed to pay for shipping at convenience stores to get the rain boots. But then they would send fake links to victims. A fake customer service person would then trick victims into giving away their account details and steal their money.</p>
            <p>There were also cases of fake disaster donations, fake travel ticket help, and offering paid sports betting analysis reports while claiming the money would go to disaster relief, but it was actually a scam.</p>
            <p>Wang Cai-hua, who has long cared about fighting scams, also came to share anti-scam messages. She said that scammers are very bad now. They steal many elderly people's retirement money. She asked everyone not to click on strange links, not to answer calls from unknown numbers, and to be careful of romance scams.</p>
            <p>Wang Cai-hua mentioned that some scammers also use her photos to make fake Facebook accounts. When fans tell her about these, she immediately posts a message to warn everyone not to be tricked. Also, she once received a strange call from someone pretending to be from a bank. The person said someone was trying to take money from her account. She quickly became alert and went straight to the police station to report it, to avoid being scammed.</p>
            <p>"If you think something is suspicious, call the 165 hotline to check," Wang Cai-hua said. She added that people should not panic when something happens. The most important thing is to check immediately to lower the risk of being scammed. She hopes everyone can work together to fight and prevent scams.</p>
            <p>The CIB said that real charity will not ask for your full bank account number, bank card number, or credit card number. If you want to donate money, supplies, or help with disaster relief, you must use official ways. For example, use the "0923 Hualien Mataian River Landslide Disaster Project" account set up by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, or the "Mataian River Landslide Information Zone" by the Hualien County Government.</p>
            <p>Also, you should "use the right channels," such as machines at the four big convenience stores or the "Charity Donation" section on Line Pay. Do not click on strange links or believe unknown messages.</p>
            <p>The CIB also reminded people that the government will soon give out 10,000 NTD to everyone. The government will not send text messages or emails to tell people to claim it or log in. It will also not ask people to go to an ATM or use online banking to transfer money. People should remember the "four don'ts": do not click, do not fill in information, do not transfer money, and do not share strange messages. Always rely on official information.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Guangfu Disaster Area Schools Reopen; Cheng Ying-yao Says Quick Recovery is Moving</h1>
            <p>Minister of Education Cheng Ying-yao visited schools in Fuguang Township, Hualien, which were affected by the disaster, again today. He said that what he saw this time was very different from before. The schools have recovered quickly, and over 90% of students are back in class. This amazing speed of recovery is moving. He also said that they will check the damage and try their best to help.</p>
            <p>This morning, Cheng Ying-yao visited schools that were badly hit, such as Guangfu Junior High School and National Guangfu Senior High School of Commerce and Industry. He told reporters that when he visited on September 25, there was 1.5 meters of mud and sand everywhere. The school grounds were a mess. It was very difficult to clean up the mud and sand in the basements. But in recent days, the central and local governments worked together. This allowed the schools to quickly return to normal, so students can learn again. This quick recovery is truly amazing and touching.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao said that he came today especially to thank everyone, including the "Shovel Supermen" volunteers. These volunteers came from all over Taiwan, and even from other countries. This shows how strong Taiwanese society is. Guangfu Junior High School reported damage of almost 100 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) at first. Guangfu Senior High School of Commerce and Industry reported about 200 million NTD in damage. On October 15, they will quickly check and review the damage one last time. Then, the money will be given quickly to help rebuild the schools.</p>
            <p>Also, the Taipei City Government offered to give YouBike bicycles to students in Fuguang Township to use for getting around. Huang Chien-jung, the principal of Guangfu Junior High School, said that he does not recommend students use YouBike now. This is because the roads in the town are still not very good, and there are still big machines working there. They will open them for use when life returns to normal.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-jung said that students who were sent to live in other towns have started coming back to school today. They are now renting two cars to use as school buses. One bus follows the old school bus route, and the other goes through the town. This allows students to take the school bus to class anytime.</p>

            <h1>New Zealand Opens eGate for Taiwanese Passports; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Plans Similar Treatment</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that New Zealand announced today that people with Taiwanese e-passports can now use their automatic border control system, called eGate. New Zealand is the eighth country to offer eGate to Taiwanese citizens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also thinking about letting New Zealand passport holders use eGate in Taiwan. This is planned to start between late November and December this year.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent out a press release. It said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, New Zealand Immigration, and the New Zealand Customs Service have worked together. They want to make it easier for people from different countries to use automatic border control systems. On the 13th, the New Zealand government announced that travelers with Taiwanese e-passports can use eGate when they enter or leave the country.</p>
            <p>According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, New Zealand is now the eighth country to offer eGate to Taiwanese people. The other countries are the United States (which needs a paid application), South Korea, Australia, Italy, Germany, Singapore, and Malaysia.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that New Zealand has already made it possible for Taiwanese people to use the New Zealand Traveller Online Declaration, which is an electronic arrival card. Taiwanese travelers just need to fill out the online arrival form at www.travellerdeclaration.govt.nz within 24 hours before their flight. Then, when they arrive, they can use the eGate service directly. Also, because Taiwan wants to treat other countries equally, Taiwan is looking into letting New Zealand e-passport holders use eGate when they arrive at Taiwanese airports. This is expected to happen between late November and December this year.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that Taiwan and New Zealand are close partners. They share ideas like democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law. About 60,000 people visit each other's countries every year. Allowing both countries to use eGate will make it easier for people to travel between them. It will also help improve cooperation and exchanges in many areas.</p>
