New Taipei City plans to build a big sports dome. Mayor Hou You-yi went to Japan in April to learn from how Tokyo Dome and Seibu Dome are built and run. He hopes the new dome in New Taipei will help the local economy grow.

Hong Yu-ling, head of the city's sports department, said today that experts met in February to discuss where to build the dome. They looked at six possible places and gathered information about each one. Officials involved in choosing the site said that Mayor Hou You-yi, Vice Mayor Liu Ho-ran, and experts have been part of all regular meetings. They also held small meetings with different groups of people, including coaches, athletes, fans, cheerleaders, and businesses. They also looked at how Japanese domes are managed.

Another city official said that all six possible locations have different features. The most important thing they are looking at is how easy it is to get there by transport. City council members from areas like Sanxia, Shulin, Yingge, and Tamsui want the dome to be built in their areas. The official said that besides transport, they also consider how the dome will be run, managed, and if it can help the economy grow around it. Vice Mayor Liu Ho-ran said that besides growth potential and good transport, it's important that the dome doesn't bother residential areas. He added that by August, they will choose two locations for the next step of evaluation and decide on the final location by the end of this year.

**Paris's Seine River Now Open for Swimming After 100 Years**

People can now swim in the Seine River in Paris, France, starting this morning. This ends a ban that was put in place in 1923. It lets people who live there and visitors cool down on hot days. News reports say that many swimmers arrived before 8 AM, when it opened. They jumped into the water with lifeguards watching, happy to finally swim there.

If the weather is good, people in Paris and visitors can swim in three special parts of the river this summer. One of these places is very close to the Eiffel Tower. Opening the Seine River for seasonal swimming is a big success from the 2024 Paris Olympics. The river's water was cleaned especially so it could be used for water sports during the games.

The swimming areas have changing rooms, showers, and beach-style furniture. They can hold 150 to 300 people who want to relax and put down their towels, away from the city noise. Paris officials said they have taken many steps to make sure swimmers are safe. This includes checking the water for pollution every day and testing swimmers' abilities. They also told swimmers to be careful of possible dangers, such as fast currents, boats, and the average water depth of 3.5 meters. To lower risks, lifeguards will check visitors' swimming skills before they can enter the water. A rule from late June says that anyone swimming outside the allowed areas will have to pay a fine.
