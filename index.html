            <h1>Taiwan Railway Service Between Dawu and Longxi Is Back to Normal; Buses Helped 1548 People</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 27, Central News Agency reporter Yu Hsiao-han) The Taiwan Railway (TRA) service between Dawu and Longxi stopped working today at noon. This happened because a lot of water leaked inside the Da-niao Tunnel. This caused electric trains to stop running. After quick repairs, the service started again at 8:02 PM. Buses were used to help people travel. A total of 36 buses carried 1548 people.</p>
            <p>Today, the TRA service between Dawu and Longxi on the South Link Line could not run electric trains. This was because a lot of water leaked from the tunnel roof in Da-niao Tunnel. This caused the power lines to short circuit and lose electricity. The TRA quickly started bus services to help passengers. They also sent diesel trains to pull other trains through the area with no electricity. This helped keep trains moving in the affected part.</p>
            <p>The TRA said tonight that by 7:40 PM, the bus services had helped many people. From Fangliao Station, 17 buses carried 731 people. From Taimali Station, 15 buses carried 645 people. From Taitung Station, 4 buses carried 172 people. In total, 36 buses carried 1548 people.</p>
            <p>The TRA said that trains going in one direction (starting from train 168) and trains going in the other direction (starting from train 165) are now running normally. The TRA asked staff at stations and on trains to make more announcements and help guide passengers.</p>
            <p>The TRA also said that if passengers have tickets they could not use because of this problem, they can get a refund within one year without paying a fee. If they have round-trip tickets, they can get a refund for both at the same time. (Editor: Chang Ya-ching) 20250727</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Niebuen Choir Wins Gold Medal in Tokyo Choral Competition Despite Pressure from China to Remove Flag</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, July 27, Central News Agency reporter Tai Ya-chen) Taiwanese choirs went to Japan for the Tokyo International Choral Competition. Suddenly, China complained and asked for the Taiwanese flag to be removed. Even though this made them feel bad before the competition, the Niebuen Choir from Kaohsiung performed as planned today. Good news came in the evening: the Niebuen Choir won the gold medal with a high score of 95.9.</p>
            <p>The 7th Tokyo International Choral Competition was held from July 25 to 27. In today's folk music category, 8 teams joined. Three of these teams were from Taiwan: Kaohsiung Xingguo Elementary School Bugulav Children's Art Troupe, Nantou County Sinyi Township Shinabalan Elementary School, and the Niebuen Choir. There were also two teams from China in the same category.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, after receiving the complaint, the organizers quickly told the Taiwanese teams that they had to take down their national flag hanging in the Dai-ichi Life Hall. Also, their name for the stage had to change from "Taiwan" to "Chinese Taipei."</p>
            <p>When the Taiwan Representative Office in Japan found out, they quickly talked with the choir and Legislator Chiu Yi-ying, who came to Japan with them. They tried to find a solution with the organizers until the very last moment before the competition this morning. Mr. Keiji Furuya, the head of the Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council, also spoke up for Taiwan right away. However, the organizers still decided to change the name to "Chinese Taipei" on their own and not to hang any national flags of the competing countries.</p>
            <p>Even after the flag incident, the Niebuen Choir gave a high-quality performance in the morning competition. Their final performance touched everyone there. Good news came in the evening: the Niebuen Choir, which often wins big international competitions, got the gold medal with a high score of 95.9. The team from Indonesia came in second with 94.8 points, and the team from the Philippines was third with 93.8 points.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-chih, the conductor of the Niebuen Choir, told the Central News Agency that the competition lasted for 3 days. On the first two days, when they watched at the venue, all Taiwanese teams were called "Taiwan," and national flags were hanging next to the stage. But at noon on the second day of the competition, they suddenly got an email from the organizers. It said that for the third day of the competition, "all Taiwanese teams must be called Chinese Taipei, and our national flag must be removed." He said, "Even though they said they needed our permission, we thought it was not fair." So, they immediately asked the Taiwan Representative Office in Japan for help.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-chih said that if the organizers wanted to follow the Olympic rules and change the name to "Chinese Taipei," maybe they could accept it. "But we could not allow our flag to be taken down alone." He said if one flag was taken down, then all flags should be.</p>
            <p>He said that even though the children felt bad, if both sides could agree, they still wanted the children to perform. This is because only by performing could Taiwan's culture be seen by everyone. This is Taiwan's "soft power." He said, "When soft power is seen and recognized, it is more important than anything else." He was very thankful for everyone's help, which brought the situation to a good end.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-chih shared that he had thought, "If the flag is taken down alone, then we won't compete." Luckily, in the end, all flags were removed. Before the competition, the children promised to do their best. He was deeply moved by their performance while he was conducting. After giving this perfect performance, he said, "We didn't hope for much, just the gold medal." And they got it.</p>
            <p>Legislator Chiu Yi-ying, who went to Tokyo to support the Niebuen Choir, also helped solve the sudden problem in the last two days. She was very happy that the team did well.</p>
            <p>She wrote on Facebook, "Children from Liugui, Kaohsiung, we are proud of you! Even though yesterday afternoon the organizers were pressured by China to remove our national flag, and our name had to be changed to Chinese Taipei (even though we are clearly from Kaohsiung), because of the continuous efforts and talks from the Representative Office, you stood on the stage and showed everyone the strength of Niebuen and also showed everyone Taiwan! I just heard that we won the gold medal again, it's truly so touching! Children, thank you for making me feel better, and for bringing glory to Taiwan! Thank you!" (Editor: Kao Chao-fen) 20250727</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Average Temperature in 2024 Was 24.6 Degrees Celsius; Weather Agency Says It Was the Warmest Ever</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 27, Central News Agency reporter Chang Hsiung-feng) The Weather Agency has said that Taiwan's average temperature last year was 24.6 degrees Celsius. This made it the warmest year ever. Taipei recorded 63 days of high temperatures, which was the most in Taiwan. The Weather Agency explained that this high temperature is part of a long-term trend of global warming. Also, the El NiÃ±o weather pattern played a role.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency released its "2024 Climate Annual Report." It showed that Taiwan's average yearly temperature last year was 24.6 degrees. This is 0.7 degrees higher than the usual average of 23.9 degrees. It is the highest temperature ever recorded. All 22 weather stations in Taiwan recorded temperatures higher than their usual averages. They were all among the top 10 warmest on record. Seven stations, including Hsinchu, Taichung, Sun Moon Lake, Tainan, Chenggong, Taitung, and Dawu, broke their own records for average temperature.</p>
            <p>Regarding very hot days, last year, the number of days with high temperatures (when the daily highest temperature was 35 degrees or more after rounding) was lower than usual at 4 stations: Pengjia Islet, Keelung, Hualien, and Hengchun. But at the other 18 stations, the number of hot days was more than or close to the usual. Taipei had 63 high-temperature days, the most in Taiwan. This was 19.8 days more than its usual average.</p>
            <p>The Weather Agency said that the number of hot days slowly started to increase after the mid-1970s. This increase became even clearer from the 2010s to 2020. Also, since the mid-1960s, the number of cold days has slowly gone down.</p>
            <p>For rainfall, last year's average total rainfall was 2135.9 millimeters. This is similar to the usual average of 2161.1 millimeters. Looking closer at how Taiwan's total yearly rainfall changes, it changes a lot from year to year. There is no clear trend of more or less rain. But in the last 10 years, only 2 years (2016 and 2022) had more rain than usual. The other 8 years had less rain than usual.</p>
            <p>If we look at the number of rainy days, last year's average was 127 days. This is 14.8 days less than the usual average of 141.7 days. It was the 7th lowest number of rainy days on record for Taiwan. Looking closer at how the number of rainy days changes over the years, from the 1950s until now, the number of rainy days in Taiwan has clearly gone down.</p>
            <p>The Weather Agency explained that Taiwan's average temperature last year broke the record, making it the warmest year. This happened because of the long-term trend of global warming and partly because of the El NiÃ±o weather pattern. Global warming is a long-term change, and because greenhouse gases are still increasing each year, temperatures are likely to keep rising.</p>
            <p>The Weather Agency explained that because of global warming, the El NiÃ±o weather pattern caused a short-term increase in temperature. This pushed global temperatures even higher. It also made extreme weather events happen more often and be stronger. These events include heatwaves, droughts, heavy rains, and hurricanes, and they affect the whole world.</p>
            <p>Also, from December 2023 to February 2024 (winter), the monsoon winds were weak. This made Taiwan's winter warmer and drier. Last summer (June to August), the subtropical high-pressure system over the Pacific Ocean caused less rain in places like the Indochina Peninsula, the South China Sea, Taiwan, and along the East Asian coast. At the same time, the average summer temperature along the entire East Asian coast was also much higher. (Editor: Chang Ya-ching) 20250727</p>
