            <h1>Largan's August Revenue Up 10%; GSEO and Canon's Revenue Strengthens</h1>
            <p>Largan Precision, a leading maker of optical lenses, announced its August total revenue was NT$5.968 billion. This is a 10% increase from the previous month and the highest this year. However, it is a 15% decrease compared to last year. The company expects more orders in September than in August. GSEO also had a strong August, with revenue up 13.27% from July and 2.23% from last year, thanks to the usual busy season. Canon's August revenue reached a new high in 99 months.</p>
            <p>Optical companies are showing good sales results. Largan's total revenue for August was NT$5.968 billion, a 10% increase from July, making it the highest this year. But it was 15% lower than the same month last year. For the first eight months of the year, Largan's total revenue was NT$37.663 billion, which is 8% higher than the same period last year.</p>
            <p>Largan said today that orders in September will be a little better than in August. The chairman, Mr. Lin En-ping, said earlier that the busy season would be similar to last year. However, some of their special products will face competition from other companies. In 2026, the company hopes to start a big project for lenses with adjustable apertures, which will improve their existing products.</p>
            <p>Looking at the types of lenses Largan shipped in August, high-end lenses with 20 million pixels or more made up about 10% to 20% of sales. Lenses with 10 million pixels made up about 50% to 60%. Lenses with 8 million pixels made up less than 10%. Other products made up about 20% to 30%.</p>
            <p>GSEO's total revenue for August was NT$2.699 billion, up 13.27% from July and 2.23% from last year. For the first eight months, total revenue was NT$15.174 billion, up 0.22% from last year.</p>
            <p>GSEO said that the third quarter is usually a busy time, and demand is much higher than in the second quarter. For the fourth quarter, it depends on how many new products customers buy after they are released.</p>
            <p>Optical company Canon's August revenue was NT$974 million, up 37.94% from July and 69.81% from last year. This is the highest in 99 months. For the first eight months, total revenue was NT$5.508 billion, up 40.09% from last year.</p>
            <p>The demand for digital cameras is increasing. Canon is benefiting from the busy season in the industry. Also, a big Japanese camera brand will release new cameras in mid-September. The market expects this to help Canon's sales and keep its business strong in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Canon is also actively developing products for machine vision and drones. They have orders for robots until the second half of 2026. For drones, they will start selling whole drones instead of just parts, possibly starting in the second quarter of 2026. Canon expects that revenue from machine vision and drones will make up 5% to 10% of their total revenue in 2026, and they aim for 20% in 2027. This will be a strong new reason for their future growth.</p>

            <h1>Catering Industry's Revenue Up 3% in First 7 Months; Ministry Expects Positive Growth for Full Year</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that the catering industry's revenue has reached new highs for three years in a row. From January to July this year, the industry's total revenue increased by 3.0% compared to last year. They expect the whole year to show continued positive growth. To handle business difficulties, catering businesses are also using new technologies, such as phone or tablet ordering systems and robot waiters.</p>
            <p>The Department of Statistics of the Ministry of Economic Affairs released a report today. It shows that as the pandemic slowly ended, more people wanted to eat out. In 2022, the catering industry's revenue grew a lot, by 19.1%. This was more than before the pandemic (in 2019). In 2023, it went over NT$1 trillion, growing by more than 20% from the year before. In 2024, it grew by 3.6% because the starting point for comparison was already high. From January to July this year, it continued to grow by 3.0% each year. They expect the whole year to keep growing.</p>
            <p>According to the Department of Statistics' survey in May 2024, on the "Operating Status of Wholesale, Retail, and Catering Industries," the main problems for catering businesses (multiple choices were allowed) were: food ingredient costs changing a lot (65.6%), not enough workers (61.5%), high staff turnover (55.6%), high labor costs (51.1%), and strong competition from other businesses (47.4%).</p>
            <p>Compared to May 2022, the biggest increases in problems were not enough workers (up 21.4%), high staff turnover (up 13.3%), and strong competition from other businesses (up 8.3%). This shows that the rising costs of food and labor, along with competition, are the main difficulties for most catering businesses now. Managing costs well and making the dining experience better to attract more customers are key ways for catering businesses to become stronger.</p>
            <p>To offer different dining options and meet customer needs, the Department of Statistics said that chain businesses are opening more restaurants under different brands. This helps them grow and get a bigger share of the market. According to the Taiwan Chain and Franchise Association, in recent years (not including the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021), the number of chain and franchise brands and stores in Taiwan's catering service industry has grown steadily. However, facing rising costs for ingredients and staff, businesses are less willing to join franchises. As weaker businesses close and stronger ones remain, the number of brands and stores decreased by 5.6% and 7.2% respectively in 2024.</p>
            <p>If we look at the percentage of company-owned stores compared to franchised stores, the percentage of company-owned stores clearly went up after the pandemic. It increased from 26.5% in 2022 to 30.2% in 2024. At the same time, the percentage of franchised stores decreased from 73.5% in 2022 to 69.8% in 2024. This shows that catering chain businesses are changing from quickly opening many franchised stores to directly owning stores, which helps them control costs better.</p>
            <p>The Department of Statistics said that with the internet and mobile phones being more common, and the pandemic leading to more contactless services, businesses are continuing to use digital changes. This helps them work better and give customers easier experiences.</p>
            <p>According to the survey results from the Department of Statistics, in May 2024, the most common digital services used by catering businesses were electronic invoices (80.0%) and POS systems (77.7%). Other services included mobile payment (61.2%), online ordering systems (41.2%), and online reservation systems (39.9%). Among these, electronic invoices saw the biggest increase, up 8.5% compared to May 2022.</p>
            <p>To deal with business challenges and problems, the Department of Statistics stated that catering businesses are also actively using new technologies. The survey results show that in May 2024, 41.9% of businesses used phone or tablet ordering systems, 17.7% used robot waiters, and 5.8% set up self-checkout machines. Among these, the use of phone or tablet ordering systems increased the most, by 9.0% compared to May 2023.</p>

            <h1>Lin Chih-sheng Took on Coach Lin Chen-hsien's Mission at 22 and Played Hard Until 43</h1>
            <p>Lin Chih-sheng, a 43-year-old baseball player for the Wei Chuan Dragons in Taiwan's professional baseball league, began his retirement games today. He remembered that when he was 22, his coach, Lin Chen-hsien, told him he must play until he was 40. Lin Chih-sheng feels he has completed that goal. He has thought many times about what to say in his farewell speech on September 7th. He said, "It will not be perfect, but I will try my best."</p>
            <p>The Wei Chuan Dragons team started Lin Chih-sheng's retirement series today at the Taipei Dome. Lin Chih-sheng is known as the "Home Run King" of the league. There will be different themes for each of the three days. After the game on September 7th, there will be a retirement ceremony. For the first game of the series, Lin Chih-sheng started as the number 5 batter and played first base.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Lin Chih-sheng spoke to reporters. He said he felt "calm" and didn't have any special feelings yet. But he had thought many times about what to say in his speech on the 7th. He wants to thank many people, but he hasn't written it all down yet. He feels that the true emotions will come out at that moment.</p>
            <p>When asked if he thought about any specific memory or person that made him feel emotional, Lin Chih-sheng smiled and said, "It's a secret." He has many things he wants to say himself. He added that his final speech "will definitely not be perfect, but I will try my best."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-sheng recalled that when he was 22, he joined the La New Bears team in the professional baseball league. His coach at the time, Lin Chen-hsien, told him, "You must play until you are 40." Looking back at all the things that happened during his career, when he was 39, he asked to be removed from the CTBC Brothers' 60-player list. At that time, he was not sure if any team would still want him. He is thankful to the Wei Chuan Dragons team for giving him a chance. He also told Lin Chen-hsien, "I have completed the mission you gave me back then."</p>
