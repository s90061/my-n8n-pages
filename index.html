A newspaper reported that Ko Chien-ming, a leader in the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), once said that after some lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) might be removed from office, they would face "Article 100 of the Criminal Code." But other DPP members have said this is not true.

DPP lawmaker Wang Shih-chien said he believes Ko just made a mistake. He explained that Article 100 was a very old law that the DPP and many important people worked hard to get rid of. It is now gone forever.

DPP spokesperson Wu Cheng also said that democracy cannot go backward. He explained that Article 100 was a bad law from the past. It allowed people to be punished even if they just thought about changing the country's government, which could even lead to death. Many people fought against this law, and it was removed in 1991. The DPP believes in human rights, so they will not bring back such a bad law.

The man, Mr. Hsieh, had a special order against him to protect his wife. He was arrested on July 6 for breaking this order by damaging things at his wife's home, but he was let go because it was his first time breaking the order and he didn't physically hurt anyone then.

Police caught Mr. Hsieh later that day in Changhua, and he is now in jail.

The Victims of Crime Protection Association sent staff and volunteers to the hospital to help the family. They also went with the family to talk to the police and prosecutor.
