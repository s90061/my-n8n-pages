**Ministry of Labor Helps with Disaster Recovery, Provides 1620 Temporary Jobs in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan**

The Ministry of Labor is helping with recovery after Typhoon Danas. They have offered three main types of support: temporary disaster relief jobs, training before and during employment, and temporary delays for business loan payments. For example, in the Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan areas, 1620 temporary job opportunities have been approved. People in these jobs can earn up to NT$28,590 per month.

To help people affected by Typhoon Danas, the Ministry of Labor contacted local governments to find out how many workers were needed for rebuilding. They are also offering short-term jobs for people who lost their jobs in the affected areas. People who live or work in the disaster areas and do not have a job can apply at public employment service centers. They will be helped to find suitable temporary jobs quickly.

The Ministry of Labor also offers help with job training. Unemployed people in disaster areas can join training courses for free and may receive a living allowance. Workers who still have jobs in disaster areas can also take part in certain training programs for free. Finally, if people who received a business loan from the Ministry of Labor are having trouble paying it back because of the disaster, they can ask to delay payments for up to six months. The Ministry of Labor will help with the interest during this delay.

**Trump to Visit UK for Second Time, Buckingham Palace Announces 3-Day Visit from September 17**

Buckingham Palace announced today that former US President Donald Trump will visit the UK for a second state visit from September 17 to 19. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will host Mr. Trump and Melania Trump at Windsor Castle. More details will be shared later.

Trump received this invitation from King Charles III through UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer when they met in Washington D.C. in February. French President Emmanuel Macron recently had a state visit to London and spoke in the UK Parliament. However, Trump's visit will happen when Parliament is not meeting, so he will not speak in the House of Commons.

Trump will be the first elected political leader in recent history to be hosted twice for a state visit by a British monarch. His first state visit was in June 2019, when Queen Elizabeth II, King Charles III's mother, invited him.

When Trump visited the UK before, there were large protests. In 2018, police spent over 14 million British pounds (about 550 million New Taiwan Dollars) and used 10,000 police officers across the country for his visit. Most people in the UK have a negative opinion of Trump, according to polls.
