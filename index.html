            <h1>Taiwanese Students Win 1 Gold and 3 Silver Medals at the 36th International Biology Olympiad</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Lin Xingjian, Manila, July 27) The 36th International Biology Olympiad was held in the Philippines. Four students representing Taiwan won 1 gold and 3 silver medals. They competed against nearly 300 top students from around the world. After the award ceremony, the whole team went on stage with the flag of the Republic of China for a photo.</p>
            <p>The International Biology Olympiad took place from July 20 to 27 at Ateneo de Manila University in Manila. Over 300 students from almost 80 countries competed in the event.</p>
            <p>The organizers held the award ceremony on the evening of July 26. Chen Chun-ying, who studies at Taipei Municipal Jianguo High School, won a gold medal. Lin Po-chen from The Affiliated Senior High School of National Taiwan Normal University, Hung Tzu-chin from Taipei First Girls High School, and Kuo Che-yu, also from Jianguo High School, each won a silver medal.</p>
            <p>Kuo Che-yu could not receive his award in person because he flew to Thailand for another competition.</p>
            <p>Lee Shih-ping, head of the education division at the Taiwan Representative Office in the Philippines, was also there to congratulate the Taiwanese students. He also passed on a congratulatory message from Minister of Education Cheng Ying-yao.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-ying explained that the competition had two parts: theory and practical tests. The questions were difficult. He did well by using his experience from previous exams and following his teachers' advice on how to answer.</p>
            <p>Lin Po-chen said that his trip to the Philippines showed him many things he had imagined about Southeast Asia, especially the local culture and customs of the Philippines. He felt that the people there were friendly, similar to people in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Hung Tzu-chin said she was very happy to have the chance to compete. She learned a lot along the way and also found out what she needs to improve. She will continue to work hard.</p>
            <p>During the award ceremony, Ateneo de Manila University also invited the famous Bayanihan dance group from the Philippines to perform traditional Filipino dances, such as the Candle Dance and the Bamboo Dance.</p>
            <p>Besides the competition, the organizers also took the students to the countryside to explore biodiversity in real life.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Education's rules for "Preferential Admission for Excellent Students Participating in International Math and Science Olympiads and International Science Exhibitions," students who win gold, silver, or bronze medals can enter any university department without taking exams, or be recommended to them. They also receive scholarships of NT$200,000, NT$100,000, and NT$50,000 respectively. (Editor: Chang Chih-hsuan) 1140727</p>

            <h1>All 25 Recall Cases on July 26 Did Not Pass; Scholar Ogasawara Yoshiyuki Says It's a Complete Win for the KMT</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Dai Ya-chen, Tokyo, July 27) The first round of recall votes for 24 KMT (Kuomintang) lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an were held yesterday. All the recall attempts failed. Ogasawara Yoshiyuki, an honorary professor at National Tsing Hua University and a Japanese scholar, said that the results show a complete victory for the KMT. He believes that the DPP's (Democratic Progressive Party) policy of resisting China and protecting Taiwan was rejected. He also thinks that China's influence in Taiwan might increase in the future.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara told Sankei Shimbun that private groups started these recall efforts, and the ruling DPP supported them. In early June, it seemed that the recall supporters were stronger. The KMT had planned to use their own recall efforts to stop the others, but they could not get enough signatures. Also, the party's main office did not show enough leadership, which made the situation difficult for them at first. However, KMT lawmakers began to organize and hold small meetings against the recalls, which helped them get back on track.</p>
            <p>He said that President Lai Ching-te began a series of speeches across Taiwan in late June, focusing on "national unity." However, some people understood one of his comments as "opposition parties are impurities and should be filtered out." This made opposition supporters angry and gave them a chance to fight back.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara pointed out that the voting results marked a turning point in the whole situation. As it got closer to the end, the KMT slowly pushed back, and those who supported the recalls lost their momentum.</p>
            <p>He stated that the groups supporting the recalls had hoped to recall at least six people, or even ten. If not, they would have a hard time in future by-elections. Now, since no one was recalled, there will be no by-elections, and the recall supporters have clearly lost completely. Although there will be another recall vote for seven KMT lawmakers on August 23, they faced difficulties getting enough signatures at the start, so it is not likely to succeed.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara explained that public opinion in Taiwan is currently split into an "M-shape." This means support for President Lai and opposition to him, as well as support for the ruling party and opposition parties, are quite even. The result of this recall vote depended on which group of voters in this "M-shape" could be encouraged to vote.</p>
            <p>He noted that at the events, those who supported the recalls seemed more excited and likely to vote. On the other hand, many voters had doubts. They questioned if it was right to try to remove lawmakers who were just elected in January of last year. It was hard to know until the very end if these doubtful voters would come out to vote. The KMT successfully encouraged these people to cast their votes against the recalls.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara said that the KMT argued that if the DPP gained a majority again in the Legislative Yuan, it would lose its ability to watch over the government, making the DPP more controlling. Supporters of the KMT and the TPP (Taiwan People's Party) even directly called the Lai Ching-te government "dictatorial." From outside Taiwan, some people questioned if it was right to use the word "dictatorship" so easily in Taiwan, where democracy is protected. However, many opposition supporters believe the DPP government has become too strong and even uses the law wrongly to stop those who disagree, moving towards dictatorship.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara pointed out that the recall efforts covered 24 electoral districts, which was almost like a "small election for lawmakers." Those who supported the recalls made two main points: first, they believed the opposition parties in the Legislative Yuan were harming democracy; second, they thought that if these "pro-China" lawmakers were not removed now, Taiwan would be in trouble. They felt a strong sense of danger. However, even with such clear arguments, none of the recall attempts succeeded. This means that Taiwanese voters did not agree with their ideas. This will have a big effect and create a very difficult situation for Lai Ching-te's government.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara said that because no one was recalled, it must be admitted that most voters did not agree with the idea that "KMT lawmakers are pro-China." Although some people might think that the failed recalls just mean "everything goes back to how it was," he does not agree.</p>
            <p>He explained that looking back at Taiwan's politics, last year's presidential and legislative elections showed that the DPP's strong position, which lasted for 10 years since the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement, has ended. With the rise of Ko Wen-je, the founder of the TPP, the DPP's strong position was shaken. This recent result further confirms that the time of the DPP's dominance is over. This change is expected to have a great impact on next year's local elections and the 2028 presidential election.</p>
            <p>He stressed that even though the DPP is no longer dominant, Taiwanese society's "Taiwanese identity" has not changed. According to the latest poll from National Chengchi University, Taiwanese people's self-identity and their desire to keep things as they are have not changed. What has truly changed is that the power between political parties is now more balanced.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara pointed out that one reason for the DPP's decreasing power is the common belief in Taiwanese society that "one party being in power for a long time has risks." Currently, young people are the most critical of the DPP. They have not started identifying with China and clearly do not want unification. However, they are unsure about the DPP's method of using the "resisting China and protecting Taiwan" idea to control politics and gain power.</p>
            <p>He said that young people who support Ko Wen-je are unhappy that the DPP has not solved problems like low salaries, unstable jobs, and high housing prices effectively. They generally believe, "Even though we don't want unification, it is necessary to talk with China. We also don't think China will attack Taiwan immediately. Instead, the situation is tense because the DPP government is tough on China." Of course, many young people also support the Lai government's decision to "never bow to China." This shows that young people are also divided among themselves.</p>
            <p>Ogasawara warned that the DPP's past policy of "resisting China and protecting Taiwan" was, in a way, rejected in this recall vote. For China, this will be a very good situation, and the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to influence Taiwan might become stronger in the future. (Editor: Chen Yen-chun) 1140727</p>
