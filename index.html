            <h1>Cheng Li-wen, who used to be with the DPP, becomes the KMT Chairperson</h1>
            <p>Former KMT lawmaker Cheng Li-wen started her political career with the DPP. She came from the student movement generation. After leaving the DPP, she joined the KMT and held many important positions in the party and government. This time, she surprised everyone by winning the KMT chairperson election. She won against other candidates, like former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin, because she was seen as a strong fighter.</p>
            <p>The results of the KMT chairperson election are out. Former KMT lawmaker Cheng Li-wen won against other candidates, including former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin and KMT lawmaker Lo Chih-chiang. She is now the new KMT chairperson. She is also the second woman to become KMT chairperson through a direct vote by party members, after former chairperson Hung Hsiu-chu.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was born in Yunlin and grew up in Tainan. When she studied law at National Taiwan University, she took part in the Wild Lily Student Movement. After university, she joined the DPP. She worked as a National Assembly member and deputy director of the DPP Youth Department. But in 2002, she left the DPP because she was suspended for her comments on the "Tu Hsing-che ear-licking case."</p>
            <p>After leaving the DPP, Cheng Li-wen was not active in politics for some time. On March 27, 2004, the Pan-Blue political group protested on Ketagalan Boulevard about unfair presidential election results. Cheng Li-wen was the host of this event, which showed she was now supporting the Pan-Blue group. Later that year, she ran for a lawmaker position in Kaohsiung City but lost.</p>
            <p>However, Cheng Li-wen's good speaking skills, sharp hosting, and clear arguments were noticed by Lien Chan, who was the KMT chairperson at that time. In 2005, she was invited to join the KMT. After that, she worked as the KMT Culture and Communication Committee chairperson and spokesperson. In the 2008 lawmaker election, the KMT nominated her as a proportional representation lawmaker, and she won. But in 2012, she ran for a regional lawmaker position in Taichung City and lost to DPP lawmaker Ho Hsin-chun.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was brave to run in difficult election areas. This made her seem like a strong fighter, which was unusual for the KMT. After losing the lawmaker election, Premier Chen Chun invited her to be the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan. She earned a lot of trust from high-ranking officials.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Cheng Li-wen stopped being the Executive Yuan spokesperson. She then worked in media and hosted TV shows. In the 2020 lawmaker election, Wu Den-yih, who was the KMT chairperson then, nominated her as a proportional representation lawmaker for the tenth Legislative Yuan. She won again and returned to the Legislative Yuan. Later, she became the KMT Legislative Yuan caucus whip.</p>
            <p>During the tenth Legislative Yuan session, the COVID-19 pandemic started around the world. After Cheng Li-wen became the caucus whip, she was a strong voice for the party. She asked tough questions and always stood at the front to argue and speak for the party.</p>
            <p>In this KMT chairperson election, Cheng Li-wen joined as a surprising new candidate. She actively visited local communities and showed a fighting spirit that was different from traditional KMT members. She received a lot of support from people in the military, government, and education sectors. In the end, she beat her rivals and became the party chairperson.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen has successfully become the party chairperson. However, she did not come from the traditional KMT background. It will be a challenge for her to manage the KMT, which has a complex structure and strong local groups. She will also need to carefully handle the relationship with the Taiwan People's Party to help the KMT win back power in 2028. Her real test has just begun.</p>
