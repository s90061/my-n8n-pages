            <h1>Kaohsiung Badminton Masters: Wang Po-Wei Wins First Super 100 Title with a Comeback</h1>
            <p>(Kaohsiung, September 28, Central News Agency) Wang Po-Wei, a Taiwanese badminton player, won his first Super 100 title today. He won the men's singles final at the 3rd BWF Super 100 Kaohsiung Masters. He beat Panitchaphon Teeraratsakul from Thailand, who was the top player, with scores of 12-21, 21-18, and 21-12.</p>
            <p>Wang Po-Wei is 23 years old and ranked 62nd in the world. He is from Penghu and plays for Land Bank team. He has won 3 BWF tournaments before, but they were lower-level events like Future Series or International Series.</p>
            <p>In this year's Kaohsiung Masters, Wang Po-Wei played very well. In the final, he played against Panitchaphon Teeraratsakul, a new Thai player who uses his left hand. Teeraratsakul is ranked 48th in the world. They had played once before, and Teeraratsakul won that match.</p>
            <p>Wang Po-Wei lost the first game. In the second game, he changed his plan. His opponent was good at strong attacks. Wang Po-Wei decided to hit the shuttlecock to different corners of the court. This made his opponent run a lot and didn't give him many chances to attack. This also made his opponent tired.</p>
            <p>This new plan worked. Wang Po-Wei won the second game. In the third game, his opponent looked very tired and almost had a muscle cramp. Wang Po-Wei then made an amazing comeback and won the championship.</p>
            <p>After the match, Wang Po-Wei talked to the media. He said that changing his tactics in the second game was very important. His opponent kept hitting hard, which made him very tired. Wang Po-Wei said, "So, I purposely moved my opponent around and didn't give him chances to hit flat shots. And I successfully won the second game."</p>
            <p>Wang Po-Wei also laughed and said, "Actually, in the third game, both of us were quite tired. But I kept going because of my strong will. Also, the cheers from all the fans helped me a lot. On the other hand, my opponent seemed to lose spirit after he missed a few hard shots."</p>

            <h1>Nuclear Talks Stuck: Iran's Religious Leaders Face Big Problems</h1>
            <p>(United Nations, New York, September 28, Central News Agency) Iran's religious leaders are facing their hardest problem since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. People inside the country are very unhappy, and talks about the nuclear agreement are stuck. These two things together are making the country more alone and divided.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the United Nations (UN) started to punish Iran again on September 27. This happened after Iran had final talks with the UK, France, and Germany, but they could not solve the problem with Iran's nuclear plans.</p>
            <p>Four Iranian officials and two people close to the government believe that if talks with Western countries fail, Iran will become even more cut off from the world economy. This will also make the public even angrier.</p>
            <p>However, if Iran agrees to what Western countries want, it might cause problems among Iran's leaders. It could also weaken their belief in "not giving in to Western pressure," which has been a strong part of Iran's policy for many years.</p>
            <p>One official said, "The religious leaders are in a difficult situation. The future of the Islamic Republic is in danger." The official added, "Our people cannot handle more economic problems or another war."</p>
            <p>Another official said that the Iranian government is also worried. If nuclear talks with Western countries break down, Israel might attack Iran's nuclear sites again.</p>
            <p>In June this year, Israel attacked Iran from the air, starting a 12-day fight. Then, the United States also attacked three of Iran's nuclear sites. This shocked the Iranian government. The fighting between Israel and Iran started just a few days before Iran was supposed to have its sixth round of nuclear talks with the United States.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have warned that if Iran starts enriching uranium again, which could lead to making nuclear weapons, they will attack Iran without hesitation.</p>
            <p>Gholamali Jafarzade Imenabadi, a former Iranian lawmaker, recently told Iranian media, "Considering Israel's strong stance and America's firm support for Israel, I think there is a high chance of war."</p>

            <h1>Mudslides Might Have Harmful Metals: Public Health Experts Give Advice on Food Safety</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, September 28, Central News Agency) After the dammed lake disaster in Guangfu Township, Hualien County, people must be careful to prevent risks. The Public Health Professionals Association warns that mudslide disasters are different from regular floods. They might have harmful heavy metals. They tell people not to drink well water or groundwater directly. Also, do not eat crops covered by mud.</p>
            <p>Guangfu Township in Hualien County suffered serious mudslide damage because the Mata'an Stream dammed lake overflowed. The Taipei Public Health Professionals Association recently sent out a press release. They said that rebuilding after the disaster is not just about fixing buildings. It is also important to pay attention to public health and the environment. This will help avoid more problems or long-term health risks.</p>
            <p>The Public Health Professionals Association points out that the risk of pollution from mudslide disasters is different from regular floods. Mudslide disasters carry a lot of soil and dirt, which can cause hidden pollution. For example, after the 921 earthquake, some mudslide dirt showed high levels of heavy metals. Also, in Japan after heavy rain in 2018, and during floods in Turkey, mud sometimes had heavy metals or farm chemicals.</p>
            <p>The Public Health Professionals Association thinks that there is no clear proof of serious chemical or heavy metal pollution in the Hualien disaster area yet. However, rocks in Taiwan's mountains might have small amounts of elements like arsenic, lead, and cadmium. After landslides, these might mix with mud and settle on farmland or in rivers. Also, if mudslides pass through farms or factories, they might carry pesticides, leftover fertilizers, or oil and chemicals from factories. This means there is a possible risk of pollution.</p>
            <p>The Public Health Professionals Association asks everyone to follow safety rules. Because of Taiwan's geology and what we know from disasters around the world, they suggest taking steps to prevent risks. They ask environmental and agricultural agencies to test water and soil immediately. This is to make sure farmland and water sources are safe. Before the test results are ready, people living there should not grow food on land covered by mud. Also, they should not drink well water or groundwater directly.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Public Health Professionals Association reminds "Shovel Superheroes" (volunteers), medical staff, police, and firefighters who are helping with cleaning and rebuilding. They are in mud, dust, and mold for a long time. They need to wear masks, waterproof gloves, and boots. They should also change dirty clothes quickly. If they have a fever, diarrhea, red skin, or trouble breathing, they should see a doctor right away to avoid getting sicker.</p>
            <p>Also, they should prevent getting too tired. The Public Health Professionals Association says that hard work like lifting and cleaning can hurt muscles and bones. They should have shifts to avoid working too long. People helping in the disaster area might also feel stressed or have secondary trauma. There should be ways for them to get emotional support. They should be encouraged to share their feelings and support each other.</p>
