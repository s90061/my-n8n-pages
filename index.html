<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8837233">https://udn.com/news/story/6809/8837233</a>

On June 28, the special team investigating the rebellion case against former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol began questioning him in person. The investigation started at 10:14 AM. Yoon Suk-yeol had previously asked to enter the building through an underground parking lot to avoid the public, but he appeared directly at the main entrance of the Seoul High Prosecutors' Office. He did not answer questions from reporters.

The special team will first investigate if Yoon Suk-yeol ordered the Presidential Security Service to stop the Public Officials Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) from arresting him. On January 3, the Presidential Security Service formed a human and car wall to prevent the CIO and police from entering the official residence in Hannam-dong. On January 15, when the CIO tried to arrest him a second time, Yoon Suk-yeol was also accused of asking security officials if they could shoot while having lunch with them.

The special team will also check if Yoon Suk-yeol told the security service to delete secret phone records about the martial law commander. This involves breaking the Presidential Security Service Law by making someone misuse their power. They will also look into meetings held before and after martial law. The team will also find out if Yoon Suk-yeol talked about martial law with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance Choi Sang-mok, and former Minister of Interior and Safety Lee Sang-min.

**Emergency Room Doctors Leaving: Most Are 30-39 Years Old, Over 40% Go to Clinics**

<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8837191">https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8837191</a>

Earlier this year, emergency rooms faced very difficult overcrowding. The Emergency Medicine Association warned that a large number of doctors might leave if the problem continued. The association says that over 100 emergency room doctors might leave this year. Almost half of them will go to clinics, and most of them are between 30 and 39 years old.

The Emergency Medicine Association held its general meeting after 31 years. Chairman Hsu Chien-ching said that emergency medicine is changing, and new ways of care are appearing quickly. These include remote healthcare, emergency care at home, AI medical tools, and robot help. He believes these changes will move emergency care beyond hospitals to communities, disaster response, and serious illness care. This will create a smart healthcare network that helps patients everywhere.

However, the past year has been very tough for emergency care. Hospitals are too full, staff numbers are dropping, and wards are closing. This has made emergency medical teams very tired. Hsu Chien-ching said it is sad that many good colleagues are leaving. He added that this is a warning for the whole healthcare system, not just individual hospitals. The association will try to get more money for serious illness care and staff resources.

Lee Chih-huang, the secretary-general of the Emergency Medicine Association, said that from January to May this year, 61 doctors left. From July to December, another 45 are expected to leave. More than 40% of them will work in clinics, about 35% will go to other hospitals, and almost 10% will open their own clinics. Looking at their experience, nearly 40% have over 10 years of experience, and about 27% have less than 3 years. This data is only from 44 training hospitals, so the actual number of doctors leaving might be higher.

The association also compared where doctors are registered to work. The percentage of emergency doctors working in hospitals went down from 83.22% in 2024 to 80.67% in 2025. This shows that more emergency doctors are moving to places like clinics or health centers that are not hospitals. The biggest increases are in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung and Taipei areas. In the south and east, most doctors still work in hospitals.

Lee Chih-huang said that out of 59 doctors who left hospital emergency rooms for non-emergency or non-hospital jobs, 26 were general Western medicine doctors, and 11 were family medicine doctors. The rest were from skin or ear, nose, and throat specialties. Most of those who left were 30 to 39 years old. 17 had less than 5 years of experience in emergency medicine, and 15 had over 21 years.

**Trump to Tell Countries Their Tariff Rates; South Korean Official Believes "Sincere" Nations May Get Delay**

<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/124373/8837172">https://udn.com/news/story/124373/8837172</a>

On June 27, US President Trump said that in about a week and a half, he would send letters to countries. These letters will tell them the tariff rates they must pay to do business in the US. He also mentioned that the delay period for matching tariffs could be longer or shorter. A high-level South Korean official said it's still not clear if South Korea's tariff delay, which ends on July 8, will be extended. South Korea has been stressing that it is "sincere" in trade talks with the US.

According to Yonhap News Agency, Trump told reporters, "So, sometime in the next week and a half or so, or sooner, we're going to be sending out a letter. We've talked to many countries, so we're just going to tell them what price they're going to have to pay to do business in the United States."

When asked if the tariff delay might be extended, Trump replied, "We can do whatever we want. We can extend it. We can shorten it. I'd rather shorten it, I'd just like to send everyone a letter saying, 'Congratulations, you're paying 25%.'"

A senior South Korean official in Washington told reporters, "I don't think we are in a situation where we can feel at ease right now. It is still uncertain whether the Trump administration will extend the delay for all countries and continue talks when the July 8 deadline comes."

The official added that some countries might reach agreements, while others might get an extended delay. Countries that don't get an extension could face higher tariffs. "So, various possibilities still seem to exist," he said. He also predicted that countries that show "sincerity" in trade talks might get their delays extended. Those seen as insincere might face some punishment.

The official also said, "Compared to other countries, due to our internal political situation, (Korea-US) trade talks have made limited progress. Although it's less than two weeks, there's still enough time, and I understand President Trump will make the final decision."`;
