            <h1>National Securities Finance Plans to Add Money to Rakuten Bank; Financial Supervisory Commission Says They Respect Company Decisions</h1>
            <p>Rakuten Bank, which is only online, keeps losing money. National Securities Finance plans to get more money. But some shareholders are worried their shares will become less valuable. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said they respect how companies make their own decisions. They also said that if a bank loses more than one-third of its money, the government will tell it to get more money by a certain date.</p>
            <p>Media asked about National Securities Finance's plan to give more money to Rakuten Bank. They also asked about different opinions from shareholders regarding when and how to do it. They wanted to know what the FSC thinks.</p>
            <p>Hou Lih-yang, who is the deputy head of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said in a regular meeting that when financial companies decide to get more money, it is a company decision. The FSC respects these decisions.</p>
            <p>He explained that according to the Banking Act, if a bank loses more than one-third of its money, the FSC will ask the company to add more money by a deadline. The exact time limit depends on each case. If a company has not yet lost one-third of its money, it can decide to add money based on its financial situation. He said that doing it on your own is different from being forced to do it.</p>
            <p>Hou Lih-yang said that if financial companies make their capital stronger earlier, the regulators are happy. But if and how much a company adds money is up to the company. When a company adds money, it must follow certain steps. At least the board of directors must agree, and sometimes shareholders must also agree. They also need to ask the FSC for permission, and the FSC will check their request.</p>
            <p>People are asking if there are other ways to add money besides selling new shares. Hou Lih-yang said it depends on whether it follows the Banking Act. If they sell bonds, it cannot be counted as capital.</p>

            <h1>Former Canadian Defense Minister, Who Once Tweeted with Taiwan's Flag, Will Visit Taiwan for Security Talk</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 24) The "Ketagalan Forum: 2025 Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue" will start on August 5th. Scholars and politicians from Europe, America, and Asia will join. Former Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney will talk about new security matters in the Indo-Pacific area. He will speak with Tomohiko Taniguchi, who was an advisor to the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and others.</p>
            <p>The "Ketagalan Forum: 2025 Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue," organized by the Prospect Foundation, will take place on August 5th. Based on the meeting plan, former Canadian Defense Minister Jason Kenney will join the first part, "New Situation for Indo-Pacific Geopolitical Security." He will talk with scholars from think tanks in the Philippines and India, and Tomohiko Taniguchi, who was a foreign policy advisor to the late former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and is now a special professor at the University of Tsukuba in Japan.</p>
            <p>Kenney believes in a strong approach to national security. In 2015, when he was the Minister of Defense, he announced that Canadian soldiers would be sent to Ukraine to train their military. He also sent soldiers to the International Security and Peacekeeping Center for the Ukrainian army.</p>
            <p>Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan gave 25,000 masks to Alberta, Canada, in 2020. At that time, Kenney was the Premier of Alberta. He wrote a tweet thanking Taiwan for donating masks to Alberta to fight the virus. He even put the flag of the Republic of China next to the Canadian flag.</p>
            <p>This year, scholars and politicians from Europe, America, and Asia will come to Taiwan to speak. The second session, "Dealing with 'Hybrid Warfare' and Making Society Stronger in Defense," will have scholars from places like the American Enterprise Institute, the Atlantic Council, the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and the Global Risk Mitigation Foundation think tank in Hawaii, USA, talking together. A French politician who supports Taiwan will also give a special speech.</p>
            <p>The third session, "The Effect of Economy, Technology, and Industry Diplomacy on International Politics," will have scholars from institutions like Sciences Po Lyon in France, the Main School of Fire Service in Poland, and the Central European Institute of Asian Studies in Slovakia.</p>
