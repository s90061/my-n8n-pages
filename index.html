            <h1>Trump's 100% Chip Tax Could Help European Car Chip Makers, Says German Expert</h1>
            <p>Berlin, August 7th. U.S. President Trump said he will put a 100% tax on computer chips imported into the U.S. This news got a lot of attention around the world. Peter Fintl, a German expert on computer chips, thinks this might make phones and other electronic devices more expensive. But he also said that Europe is good at making chips for cars, so European companies might actually gain from this.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Donald Trump said he would put a 100% tax on all computer chips and semiconductors coming into the U.S. However, companies would not have to pay this tax if they promised to build factories in the U.S. or if they have already started building them there.</p>
            <p>Peter Fintl told the German magazine "Der Spiegel" that Trump's new tax threat has caused a lot of worry in the Asian tech world. He said, "Even big companies from Taiwan and South Korea, which already have factories in the U.S., are not sure how much of their products they need to make in the U.S. to avoid the high tax."</p>
            <p>He said this plan is very unclear. Not only are Asian companies confused, but European chip makers are also affected. Even though European companies have been building factories in the U.S. in recent years, many details are still not clear. There will be more talks and discussions about this later.</p>
            <p>Fintl pointed out that making computer chips is a global business. Chemicals come from Japan, raw materials from China, and equipment from Europe. The chips are then made and packaged in Asian countries. This way of making chips relies a lot on free trade and countries working together. If there are trade barriers like taxes, it will make the supply chain less efficient and add costs. These costs will then make products more expensive for buyers.</p>
            <p>However, when it comes to older, more common chips used in cars, Europe might turn this problem into an opportunity. Fintl noted that important chips for electric cars, like control chips, system-on-chips, and power semiconductors, mostly come from European makers such as Infineon and Bosch. These chips are very important for the fast-growing electric car industry.</p>
            <p>Trump's high tax plan makes the global chip supply chain less stable. But if American companies want to avoid the high taxes on chips from Asia, they might buy car chips from European makers they already work with. In this trade fight, Europe could actually benefit.</p>
            <p>Regarding Trump's goal to make America's own chip supply chain, Fintl openly said it is "possible in theory, but very hard to do in reality." He explained that the chip industry is global with different countries doing different parts of the work because it is the best and cheapest way to give people strong and affordable electronic products.</p>
            <p>Fintl suggested that as global competition in chips grows, Europe should create its own plan to face these challenges. It should also stay independent in important future technologies like artificial intelligence. He stressed that Europe can only stand strong in this global power game if the European Union works together.</p>

            <h1>US 11th Airborne Division Gets Stronger for Arctic Fights; Can Operate All Over the World, Including Near China</h1>
            <p>Anchorage. "Whoever controls Alaska will control the world." This old U.S. military saying from the last century is now more true than ever, as the Arctic has become an important area for the U.S., China, and Russia to compete. The U.S. 11th Airborne Division has the important job of being able to go anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere within 8 hours. This is not just for cold weather fights, but also for possible operations near China.</p>
            <p><h2>The Return of the Arctic Soldiers: The 11th Airborne Division Is Reborn</h2></p>
            <p>The U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division started during World War II. After the Berlin Wall fell, the world became more peaceful, and the division was closed down for a while, then started again. After the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. military focused on the Middle East. Soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division were sent to Iraq and Afghanistan. Because of this, their skills for fighting in the Arctic were largely forgotten and almost disappeared.</p>
            <p>General Joseph Hilbert, who leads the 11th Airborne Division, remembered: "It wasn't until 2015-2016 that we saw the Arctic becoming a place of competition again. Especially when Russia and China's military activities started entering U.S. air defense zones, we realized we had lost our skills for fighting in very cold, high-latitude areas."</p>
            <p>Because of this, the U.S. government released a national strategy for the Arctic. It said that the military needed to get back its ability to fight in very cold and Arctic conditions. So, in 2022, the 11th Airborne Division was "re-activated." Its main bases are Fort Wainwright and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. This showed that the "Arctic power" of the U.S. was back.</p>
            <p>The 11th Airborne Division sees Alaska as a place to launch forces. From here, they can reach almost any place in the Northern Hemisphere within 8 hours. Also, Alaska is farther west than Hawaii, so the division can get to most parts of Asia faster than the 25th Infantry Division based in Hawaii.</p>
            <p><h2>Northern Soldiers Can Also Operate Near China</h2></p>
            <p>The 11th Airborne Division can operate all over the world, from the Arctic to the warm jungles of Asia. In late July, General Hilbert told reporters in Alaska about the division's history and current role. He also answered a direct question: Is the division ready to fight in places like China or North Korea?</p>
            <p>"We must be ready for the worst situations, no matter where they happen. We need to build our skills everywhere and understand that the world is a dangerous place. This is why we must train, to make sure our soldiers are not surprised by the fighting environment."</p>
            <p>Hilbert stressed that the 11th Airborne Division's job is to always be ready to fight globally, to stop conflicts. If they cannot stop a conflict, they must be ready to fight for their country at any time. Also, the 11th Airborne Division has special skills for fighting in very cold, high-latitude areas, and they must share these skills with the rest of the army.</p>
            <p>The reporter's question had a clear reason.</p>
            <p><h2>China's Actions in the Arctic Worry the U.S. Military</h2></p>
            <p>In 2018, China first published its Arctic strategy. It called itself a "near-Arctic state" and focused on investing in the Arctic economy and doing scientific research there. However, in recent years, military cooperation between China and Russia has grown. They have done joint bomber patrols. Since 2024, the Chinese coast guard has gone into the Arctic for the first time and patrolled with the Russian military. Both sides have also done joint military exercises.</p>
            <p>A report from the U.S. Department of Defense in 2023 said that China's coast guard has more than 150 patrol ships, both for close to shore and far at sea, weighing over 1000 tons in total. This includes over 20 ships that used to be part of the Chinese navy, equipped with helicopter facilities and strong water cannons.</p>
            <p>Beijing is looking at the Northern Sea Route, which has become very popular recently. As the Arctic ice melts, the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage are opening up more. These routes can make shipping times between Asia, Europe, and America much shorter. They avoid the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal, saving about one week of travel time, or about 24% faster.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Arctic has a lot of oil, natural gas, and minerals. This makes it a key area for economic competition and energy safety. With China controlling the export of rare earth metals, Arctic energy is once again very important in the world. This further increases Alaska's important location.</p>
            <p>As the 11th Airborne Division, located in Alaska, rebuilds its Arctic fighting abilities, it trains intensely every January and February. This makes sure soldiers are ready for extreme conditions, just like a real battlefield.</p>
            <p><h2>The Lesson from the Battle of Chosin Reservoir: Cold Can Kill More Than Bullets</h2></p>
            <p>General Hilbert remembered that the U.S. Army faced its coldest battles in places like the Chosin Reservoir in Korea. At that time, they learned that extreme cold could kill more people than enemy bullets. Today, in the area where India and China control their borders, both sides face each other in high, very cold places. So, having the ability to fight in Arctic conditions is very important, not only for the U.S. military but also for its allies.</p>
            <p>The Battle of Chosin Reservoir happened in 1950. The main fighting was in the Chosin and Koto-ri areas of North Korea. Chinese forces crossed the Yalu River and surrounded the United Nations troops, mostly from the U.S. and South Korea. Both sides fought very hard, and many people were hurt or died. Hilbert noted that over 8,000 U.S. soldiers got frostbite during that time.</p>
            <p>"When we train in Alaska, we focus on 'adapting,' not just surviving," Hilbert said.</p>
            <p><h2>Airborne Soldiers Train Around the World</h2></p>
            <p>Imagine flying at night on a C-17 transport plane from Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. You put on parachute gear on the plane. After landing in Hawaii's Big Island, you train with the local military there. This is part of the "Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center" (JPMRC) exercise that the 11th Airborne Division takes part in.</p>
            <p>The 11th Airborne Division also joins the "North Wind" exercise with Japan in Hokkaido. They also fly from Fairbanks, Alaska's second-largest city, for 8 hours across the Arctic directly to Finland. There, they take part in NATO's "Arctic Forge" exercise, which practices group defense. They also train in warm places like Indonesia and Thailand. Their training covers many different extreme environments.</p>
            <p>"The main point is that we are building our skills and getting ready for possible future conflicts," Hilbert said many times.</p>

            <h1>OpenAI Releases New GPT-5 Model, Now Available to Everyone</h1>
            <p>San Francisco, August 7th. OpenAI has launched its new model, GPT-5. Starting today, everyone can use it, even those who don't pay. The company says this model is the best in the world for writing, coding, and helping with medical tasks. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said that once you use GPT-5, it will be hard to go back to GPT-4.</p>
            <p>OpenAI released GPT-4 in March 2023. After that, they released the "o" series and models like GPT-4.1 and 4.5. Today, they officially launched GPT-5. Its main features are that it's smarter, more useful, and safer. It also "hallucinates" less, meaning it makes up fewer answers.</p>
            <p>At a press event, OpenAI staff showed how GPT-5 can design and create a website for English speakers to learn French. They gave it ideas like making it look nice, having lots of ways to interact, tracking daily learning progress, using interesting themes, and creating small quizzes. GPT-5 could quickly make the website application, and users could change it based on what they needed.</p>
            <p>Also, Sam Altman talked with a woman who had cancer. She shared that last year she found out she had different types of cancer. Her reports had many medical words. She asked ChatGPT to help her understand the information first and compare it with what her doctor said, before making important decisions. She described GPT-5 as faster, more complete, and more like a "thinking partner."</p>
            <p>Other OpenAI models can also do these tasks. But Altman compared GPT-5 to how Apple changed to its more detailed and clear Retina display. This means the new model feels more natural and smooth to use.</p>
            <p>Altman also said, "GPT-5 is the first time you feel like you are truly talking to an expert in a specific area."</p>
            <p>Another important feature of GPT-5 is that it will automatically decide if it needs to switch to a reasoning model based on the user's question. This means users no longer have to decide for themselves whether to use a reasoning model or a non-reasoning model, like they did before.</p>
            <p>Starting today, GPT-5 is available to all users, including those who don't pay, as well as Plus, Pro, Team, and Enterprise users. The difference is that Plus users can use it more, while Pro users have no limits and can use GPT-5 Pro.</p>
            <p>If users who don't pay reach their usage limit, they will be switched to GPT-5 mini.</p>
            <p>Also, Microsoft announced that it will add GPT-5 to its office tools, Microsoft 365 Copilot, as well as Copilot for regular users, and the Azure AI Foundry platform for developers.</p>
            <p>Since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022, it is estimated that 700 million people use it every week worldwide.</p>
            <p>Regarding progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), Altman only said that GPT-5 is "a big step on the road to AGI." MIT Technology Review, a magazine about technology, said that there is still a long way to go to reach that goal.</p>
