            <h1>Trump-Putin Meeting to Discuss Russia-Ukraine War; German Chancellor Believes Zelenskyy Will Attend</h1>
            <p>On August 15, US President Trump will meet with Russian President Putin to talk about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. Today, German Chancellor Merz said that Germany believes Ukraine's President Zelenskyy will be at this meeting.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Putin and Trump will meet in Alaska, USA. They want to solve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has been going on for over three years. Ukraine and Europe say that the government in Kyiv must be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>Merz spoke to German TV station ARD. He said, "We hope and expect that the Ukrainian government, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will join this meeting."</p>
            <p>Merz told ARD that Berlin is working closely with Washington. They are trying to make sure Zelenskyy attends the talks.</p>
            <p>He said, "We cannot accept Russia and the US talking or even deciding about land issues without Europe and Ukraine. I believe the US government agrees with us."</p>
            <p>Merz said he hopes these talks will lead to big steps towards a peaceful solution. He even hopes for a "breakthrough."</p>
            <p>He said, "We hope for a breakthrough on August 15. Most important, we hope for a ceasefire and peace talks in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine have had three rounds of talks this year, but they have not reached a ceasefire.</p>

            <h1>6.1 Magnitude Earthquake in Western Turkey; Several Buildings Reported Collapsed</h1>
            <p>Today, Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Management Authority said that a 6.1 magnitude earthquake happened in the Balikesir province in western Turkey. Local news showed pictures of many buildings that fell down because of the earthquake.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that AFAD said the earthquake in Balikesir happened at 7:53 PM local time. It was only 11 kilometers deep. Many provinces, including Istanbul and the tourist city Izmir, felt the earthquake.</p>
            <p>Balikesir province is near Istanbul, which is Turkey's largest city.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Turkish media showed videos of many buildings falling in Balikesir province. Officials have not yet said how much damage there is or if anyone died or was hurt.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press quoted local media saying that buildings fell in Sindirgi, the town where the earthquake started.</p>
            <p>AFAD said there have been many smaller earthquakes (aftershocks) after the main one. One of them was 4.6 magnitude. AFAD told people not to go into damaged buildings.</p>
            <p>Turkey's Interior Minister, Ali Yerlikaya, wrote on X that AFAD's emergency teams have started checking areas around Istanbul and nearby provinces.</p>
            <p>The German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) said the earthquake was 6.19 magnitude and 10 kilometers deep.</p>
            <p>In 2023, Turkey had a strong 7.8 magnitude earthquake. It killed 53,000 people in the south and southeast and destroyed or damaged hundreds of thousands of buildings. That earthquake also killed 6,000 people in northern Syria, which is next to Turkey.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu: New Attack to Remove Hamas from Gaza City Will Start Soon</h1>
            <p>Today, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu said he expects a new attack on Gaza to finish "very quickly." He said that "safe zones" will be made first so that people can move out of Gaza City.</p>
            <p>According to AFP and Reuters, Netanyahu's security cabinet approved a plan to control Gaza City on August 8. Many people did not like this plan. Today, he said he had no other choice but to "finish the job" by defeating the Palestinian group Hamas and freeing the hostages.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said the new attack on the Gaza Strip aims to deal with two main remaining Hamas strongholds: in Gaza City and in the Al-Mawasi central camp. He said this is his only choice because Hamas refuses to stop fighting.</p>
            <p>It is not clear when the Israeli army will start this new attack. Netanyahu said, "We have a very quick timeline for this action. First, we hope to set up safe zones so that people from Gaza City can leave."</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said that the 1 million people who lived in Gaza City before the war will move into these "safe zones." Palestinians say that in the past, even in safe zones, people were not safe from Israeli army attacks.</p>
            <p>Representatives from European countries at the United Nations said that hunger is spreading in Gaza. They believe Israel's plan will only make things worse.</p>
            <p>Denmark, France, Greece, Slovenia, and the UK said in a joint statement: "More military actions will put the lives of all people in Gaza at risk, including the remaining hostages. It will also cause more pain that is not needed. This is a crisis made by people, so we must act fast to stop hunger and send help to Gaza quickly."</p>
