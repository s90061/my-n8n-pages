            <h1>Trump Says Broken Teleprompter Made UN Speech More Interesting</h1>
            <p>President Trump had some unexpected problems during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly today. First, an escalator stopped, and then the teleprompter broke. He later wrote online that these two things might have made his speech more interesting than planned. He also said his speech focused on energy and immigration, and that the UN Assembly was the best place to talk about these important topics.</p>
            <p>The main discussion at the United Nations General Assembly started today. Leaders from different countries, including Donald Trump, spoke one by one.</p>
            <p>After his almost hour-long speech at the UN Assembly today, Trump posted on his social media, "Truth Social." He wrote that his speech was about energy and immigration. He has talked about these issues for a long time, and the UN Assembly was the best place to make these important statements.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned what happened at the UN today. This included the broken teleprompter and the escalator stopping when he and his wife, Melania Trump, were going to the stage.</p>
            <p>He said, "But these two things might have actually made the speech more interesting than it would have been." He added, "It's always an honor to speak at the United Nations, even if their equipment doesn't always work well."</p>
            <p>Regarding immigration, Trump criticized the United Nations in his speech. He said the UN gives money to immigrants who need help. He claimed the UN "funds attacks against Western countries and their borders" and "supports people who enter the United States illegally." He also proudly talked about his strict policies to stop immigration.</p>
            <p>Trump also spoke against green energy in his speech. He said it costs too much money and called renewable energy a "joke."</p>
            <p>He stated, "In my opinion, climate change is the biggest trick everâ€¦ the carbon footprint is a trick made up by bad people who are heading towards total destruction."</p>

            <h1>UN Warns: Unfairness Still a Big Problem, Threatens Democracy</h1>
            <p>The United Nations said today that even though there has been good progress in education and helping poor people, deep-rooted unfairness is making people lose trust in governments and democracy around the world.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, 30 years ago, world leaders met in Copenhagen. They were at the first World Summit for Social Development. They promised to end poverty, create jobs, and bring people together in society.</p>
            <p>The International Labour Organization (ILO), part of the UN, said in its newest report that since that big meeting, the world has become "richer, healthier, and more educated." That meeting was the biggest gathering of world leaders ever.</p>
            <p>But the report also warned that "the good things (from development) are not shared equally, and progress in reducing unfairness has stopped. Serious unfairness still exists around the world." This report was released before another meeting planned for November in Qatar.</p>
            <p>Gilbert Houngbo, the head of the ILO, said in a statement, "The world has clearly made progress. But we must not forget that millions of people still do not have jobs and respect. Social justice is not just a moral duty. It is also key for a safe economy, strong communities, and peace."</p>
            <p>The report listed important successes from the last 30 years. For example, the number of children aged 5 to 14 who work has gone down by half, from 20% to 10%.</p>
            <p>The report also showed that the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide has dropped from 39% to 10%. Also, the number of children finishing primary school has gone up by 17%.</p>
            <p>However, the ILO also warned that problems are still "serious and continuing." The report said that efforts to make jobs better have stopped. Around the world, 58% of workers have informal jobs, which is only a 2% drop since 1995. The number of people forced to work has also gone up.</p>
            <p>Even though fewer people are unemployed, especially in rich countries, the ILO still warned that "the quality of work is getting worse in many placesâ€¦ This makes economic safety, security, and rights weaker."</p>

            <h1>EU and WHO: Painkillers During Pregnancy Not Linked to Autism, Against Trump's Claims</h1>
            <p>Today, health groups in the European Union and the UK said that it is safe to take paracetamol during pregnancy. This goes against what former US President Trump said. He warned that this common painkiller might be linked to autism.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) said the evidence connecting paracetamol and autism is still not clear. They also said that people should be careful before making any conclusions.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that autism is linked to childhood vaccines and to pregnant women taking Tylenol, which is a painkiller. He brought these ideas, which do not have scientific proof, into important discussions about US health policies.</p>
            <p>The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said today that there is no new proof to change their current advice for pregnant women using paracetamol (which is called Tylenol in the US).</p>
            <p>The EMA said in a statement, "The current evidence does not show a link between using paracetamol during pregnancy and autism." They also added that pregnant women can use this medicine if they need it, but they should take the smallest amount that works and not too often.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the UK health authority also said that using this medicine is safe.</p>
            <p>When asked about a possible link between paracetamol use during pregnancy and autism, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic said at a press conference in Geneva, "The existing evidence is still not consistent."</p>
            <p>He mentioned some studies, which he did not name, that showed a possible link. But later studies could not confirm this. He said, "This lack of consistent results reminds us to be careful when we try to say one thing causes another."</p>
            <p>Viktor Ahlqvist, who led the biggest study so far on the possible link between paracetamol use during pregnancy and autism, said that the Trump government "seems to have misunderstood the existing evidence."</p>
            <p>Ahlqvist said, "Our study did not find proof that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism." This study looked at information from 2.5 million pregnancies in Sweden.</p>
            <p>Ahlqvist also pointed out that taking any medicine during pregnancy can be connected to problems for children. But he said this is often not because of the medicine itself. Instead, it is because of other health problems the pregnant woman has, which is why she takes the medicine.</p>
