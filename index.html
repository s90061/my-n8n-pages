            <h1>Accused of Pressuring Public Banks, Lin Kuo-cheng Denies: Inquired Within Reasonable Scope</h1>
            <p>A news report says that Lin Kuo-cheng, a member of Taiwanâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Party in the lawmaking body, might have put pressure on public banks. The report also says he asked for special papers called "proxy votes" for a golf club. Lin Kuo-cheng said today in a statement that he only called to ask about something a voter requested. He said this was done in a normal and fair way. He also said that the report has harmed his good name and that he will think about taking legal action.</p>
            <p>Lin Kuo-cheng recently got attention for speaking badly about President Lai Ching-te at a party meeting. Mirror Media reported yesterday that Lin Kuo-cheng has other problems too. The report said he recently put pressure on public banks to get proxy votes for the election of leaders at the Taipei Golf Club. This suggests he might be using his public power for his own personal gain.</p>
            <p>Regarding Mirror Mediaâ€™s report, Lin Kuo-cheng strongly stated today that the report is not true. He made three points. First, he said that Mirror Media printed the report without checking with him first. This is very wrong for a news company and goes against how they should check facts. He wants to show his strong disagreement.</p>
            <p>Lin Kuo-cheng explained that helping voters with their requests is a normal part of his job. He said his office received a request from a voter, and they called to ask within legal limits. He said he never forced anyone, never put pressure on anyone, and never used his public power in a wrong way. If Mirror Media has any proof, they should show it directly and not just hint or try to make him look bad.</p>
            <p>Lin Kuo-cheng said that several other members of the lawmaking body from different parties also helped with this kind of voter service. He added that Mirror Media reported only on him without checking the facts, which has hurt his good name. He is sad and strongly condemns this false report and will keep the right to take legal action.</p>

            <h1>Second Phase of Erren River Waste Cleanup Targets 4 Sites in Basin</h1>
            <p>The Tainan City Government announced today that the central government has given over 1.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars for the "Second Phase of Erren River Waste Cleanup Project." The plan is to remove 22,000 tons of waste from the Erren River by 2028. The project will focus on four specific places in the river area that still need to be cleaned.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Environmental Protection Bureau said today that the second phase of the Erren River cleanup will focus on four sites in Tainan and Kaohsiung that are still dirty. Tainan City will manage the cleanup. They will use new technology to separate different types of waste. This will help make the cleanup cheaper and less harmful to the environment.</p>
            <p>The Erren River was once one of the most polluted rivers in Taiwan. Years ago, illegal businesses that melted down old metal caused a lot of pollution. In the year 2000, the government started a special group called the "Erren River Illegal Metal Recycling Pollution Cleanup Team." This group worked hard to stop illegal activities. The river cleanup was also part of the "Taiwan River Basin and Ocean Management Plan Phase One." This plan helped create local groups to watch the river and stop pollution from starting.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said that after many years of cleaning the Erren River, its pollution level went down. In 2002, 100% of it was heavily polluted, but in 2024, only 21.5% was. However, some parts of the river still have industrial waste and harmful pollutants that need to be removed. In the future, they will check the environment more carefully and protect nature. This will help the Erren River become clean again and bring back life to its banks.</p>

            <h1>Man Drinks A Glass of Red Wine Daily, Thinks He's Not a Heavy Drinker, but Anemia is Alcoholic Liver Disease</h1>
            <p>Mr. Chen, who is over 60 years old, drinks a glass of red wine every day. He believes he is not a heavy drinker. During a health check, doctors found that his red blood cells were larger than normal, and he had anemia. But his Vitamin B12 and folic acid levels were normal. The doctors then found out he had alcoholic liver disease. A doctor warns that there is no safe amount of alcohol. People should not think it is okay if they do not drink a lot.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang Ben-chu, who is the head of the Gastroenterology and Hepatology Department at Shu-Tien Clinic, spoke at a health education meeting today. He said that red blood cells are made with the help of Vitamin B12 and folic acid. He explained that folic acid needs to be changed by the liver before red blood cells can use it.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang explained that even if people with alcoholic liver disease have enough Vitamin B12 and folic acid in their blood, problems with their liver can cause a lack of active folic acid. This can then affect how red blood cells are made, leading to anemia where the red blood cells are too large.</p>
            <p>He gave an example of Mr. Chen, who is over 60. He drinks red wine every day. His family was worried about his liver, so they took him for a health check. The results showed he had large red blood cells and a small amount of anemia. This kind of unhealthy condition is often caused by not having enough Vitamin B12 or folic acid. But when doctors did more blood tests, his levels were normal. This showed that his stomach and intestines were absorbing nutrients well, but his liver was already sick.</p>
            <p>"There is no safe amount of alcohol!" Dr. Kang warned. Even if someone does not drink a lot, drinking alcohol regularly for a long time can still harm the liver. He explained that the liver processes alcohol. During this process, a substance called acetaldehyde is created. Acetaldehyde can hurt liver cells and cause them to become inflamed, which leads to alcoholic liver disease.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang said that at the beginning, alcoholic liver disease often does not show clear signs. It is usually found during a health check when blood test results are not normal. People might have anemia with large red blood cells, problems with their liver function, or liver inflammation. An ultrasound scan might show a fatty liver or an enlarged liver. If the disease gets worse and leads to cirrhosis, which is scarring of the liver, people must be careful. This is because it can lead to the "three steps of liver disease": hepatitis (inflammation of the liver), cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), and liver cancer. These signs should not be ignored.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kang strongly stated that the most important step to treat alcoholic liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If the disease is still only a fatty liver, stopping alcohol, eating healthy, and exercising regularly can help the liver become healthy again. But if the disease becomes cirrhosis, it cannot be reversed, and the liver cannot become completely healthy again.</p>
