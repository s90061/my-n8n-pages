            <h1>Nuclear Power Plant Exercise Focuses on Water for Fuel and Backup Power</h1>
            <p>The 31st nuclear safety exercise at the Third Nuclear Power Plant started today. The first day's drill was inside the plant. It pretended that a nuclear accident happened, where the fuel pool was damaged by natural disasters like an earthquake or a tsunami. Taipower said that after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, they improved how they put water into the fuel pool and also made their backup power stronger.</p>
            <p>Today, the Third Nuclear Power Plant had its yearly emergency plan exercise. It pretended there was a complex nuclear accident. This accident involved natural disasters like an earthquake and a tsunami, which damaged the spent fuel pool. They practiced how to get ready and what to do. The first day's practice was inside the power plant.</p>
            <p>Taipower explained that the exercise focused on several things. These included turning on backup power, putting water into the spent fuel pool in an emergency, fighting fires, clearing roads with special machines, and helping people hurt by radiation. They also thought about the Noto Peninsula earthquake in Japan to make their plans stronger and be more ready. In today's exercise, there was a big earthquake. After the earthquake, two units lost power from outside. Unit 2 of the Third Nuclear Power Plant had a leak, and the water in its pool kept going down.</p>
            <p>Workers from Taipower explained that after both units of the Third Nuclear Power Plant stop working, all the used nuclear fuel is kept in the spent fuel pool. The two units of the Third Nuclear Power Plant can hold 2160 fuel bundles. Right now, each unit has about 1900 fuel bundles. These are kept in the water pool to stay cool and to stop radiation from spreading. This is why the safety of the spent fuel pool is very important.</p>
            <p>Taipower staff said that the old water refilling system had two water sources. These were the storage tank for changing fuel water and the unit that stores condensed water. Water was sent to the pool through pipes. After the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, Taipower made their water refilling plans better. They added new water sources: a fire water storage tank and a raw water pool. They also added options to use fresh water from Longluan Lake or seawater from near the power plant.</p>
            <p>For power, they bought 12 portable diesel generators that use 480 volts. These can give power to the original pumps. They also have portable diesel pumps and pumps on fire trucks. These can be used to power different ways of refilling water. The portable diesel generators are stored in different places. They are kept in two warehouses that are 24 and 26 meters above sea level. This is to stop them from being damaged by a tsunami.</p>
            <p>The nuclear safety exercise will move outside the plant tomorrow. They will go to places like Daguan Community, Hengchun Elementary School, Manzhou Elementary School, Fangliao High School, and Fangliao Hospital. The exercise will include practicing how to move vulnerable people, closing tourist spots and asking visitors to leave, sending supplies to supplies to isolated areas, and giving medical help for radiation injuries.</p>
            <p>Taipower also said that they invited scholars and experts to check the exercise. After the exercise, these experts will give their advice to the Third Nuclear Power Plant so it can improve. This is to make sure that if a nuclear accident happens, the power plant can quickly get ready and handle the emergency well. This will protect the safety of the nuclear power plant and the health of people living nearby.</p>

            <h1>Air Force Says Report About First F-16V Jets Arriving on Double Ten Day Is Not True</h1>
            <p>The Air Force is buying 66 F-16V (block70) fighter jets from the United States. There was a rumor that the first two jets would arrive in Taiwan around Double Ten National Day. The Air Force said today that this report is only guessing and is not true. They will keep meeting with the US and check the production line themselves. This is to help with the work of bringing the jets back later.</p>
            <p>The Air Force spent NT$110 billion on a project called "Phoenix Rising." They used this money to upgrade 141 F-16A/B jets to F-16V (block20). This upgrade is now finished. At the same time, the Air Force also started a project called "Phoenix Soaring." Under this project, they are buying 66 new F-16V (block70) jets from the United States. These new jets will be placed at the Zhihhang Air Force Base in Taitung.</p>
            <p>Today, the media reported that the first two F-16V (block70) jets would arrive in Taiwan and be given to the Air Force around the Double Ten National Day.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the Air Force answered questions from CNA. They said that they have regular meetings with the US project office to know about how the production is going and any risks with putting systems together. Also, their staff at the factory check the production line in person. This helps them plan training for their pilots and get ready for the jets to fly back to Taiwan later, following the schedule.</p>
            <p>The Air Force clearly stated that the news about the jets flying back to Taiwan is just guessing and is not true.</p>
            <p>For how the jets will be delivered in the future, the Air Force will do it like they did for the F-16A/B jets in 1997. For single-seat jets, American staff will fly them. For two-seat jets, American staff and Air Force pilots will fly together.</p>
            <p>Military sources said earlier that when the F-16A/B jets flew from the US to Taiwan in 1997, they refilled fuel in the air 19 times. They refilled about every hour, and the fuel level had to stay safe. The journey was split into three parts: The first part was from Fort Worth, Texas, to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii. This was 3784 miles, took 8 hours and 50 minutes, and needed 9 air refills. The second part was from Hawaii to Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. This was 3790 miles, took 8 hours and 20 minutes, and needed 6 air refills. The third part was from Guam to Chiayi Air Force Base. This was 1744 miles, took 4 hours and 40 minutes, and needed 4 air refills.</p>

The 12th point was a lucky shot that hit the net. So, he won the first game.</p>
            <p>In the second game, Lin Yun-ju attacked very strongly. He was good at both his powerful forehand shots and his special backhand spin shots. When he was leading 3-2, he quickly won 8 points to 1. This helped him win the next two games in a row.</p>
            <p>Lin Yun-ju was playing very confidently. In the third game, he was behind 0-2 at the start. But then he won 6 points in a row. Even when Lebrun called a timeout, it didn't help.
