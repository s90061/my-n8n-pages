            <h1>Trump: Companies Should Report Finances Every Six Months, Not Every Three</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that American companies should not share their financial reports every three months. Instead, they should do it every six months. He believes this would help save money.</p>
            <p>On his social media platform "Truth Social," Trump wrote that companies should only need to submit financial reports every six months, after getting permission from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They should not be forced to do it every quarter.</p>
            <p>Trump stated, "This will save money and let managers focus on running the company well." He also said, "Companies in China plan for 50 to 100 years, but we run our companies based on every three months." Bloomberg News reported that Trump had this same idea to change quarterly reports to half-yearly reports during his first time as president.</p>

            <h1>US and China Reach Agreement on TikTok's Future</h1>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Bessent announced that the US and China have made a basic agreement about TikTok. TikTok is a very popular video app owned by the Chinese company ByteDance. This announcement came after two days of talks in Madrid, Spain, where the two countries discussed taxes and economic rules.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that TikTok might be stopped in the US as early as September 17th. This would happen unless another US company takes ownership of it. This new agreement means TikTok can likely keep working in the US.</p>
            <p>Bessent told reporters, "This plan is about moving TikTok's ownership to be controlled by the US." He did not share more details. US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said that the first deadline for TikTok might be moved back a little bit to finish this agreement. Bessent made it clear that if there was no such agreement, the deadline would not be moved.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will talk on the phone on September 19th. Earlier today, the US had threatened to ban TikTok if China did not stop asking for lower taxes and fewer rules on technology in return for the ownership change. Bessent added that the US and China will probably have more talks about trade and economic rules in a few days. He also said that both sides are talking about how to work together to stop money laundering and the illegal drug fentanyl.</p>

            <h1>India and US to Discuss Trade to Solve Tax Problems</h1>
            <p>India and the United States are trying to fix their disagreements about import taxes. Indian news sources say that officials from both countries will meet tomorrow in New Delhi, the capital of India, to talk about trade.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that India has the most people in the world. Most products that India sends to the US currently have high US import taxes. The two countries have not yet made a trade agreement to lower these taxes.</p>
            <p>Last month, US President Donald Trump decided to increase the import taxes on Indian products by 50%. He did this to punish India for still buying oil from Russia. Trump believes that selling oil is a big way for Russia to get money for its war in Ukraine. This action made the relationship between India and the US more tense.</p>
            <p>Despite this, the leaders of both the US and India have recently said they still want to keep talking to each other. According to "The Indian Express" newspaper, Rajesh Agarwal, an official from India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry, said today that Indian and US officials will meet tomorrow to discuss trade matters.</p>
            <p>NDTV news channel said that Brendan Lynch, who is an Assistant US Trade Representative for South and Central Asian Affairs, is part of the American team. The report also stressed that this meeting is just a first step before a full series of talks happens later.</p>
