            <h1>Markets Watch Trade Talks and Russian Energy Exports, International Oil Prices Fall Slightly</h1>
            <p>(New York, July 21st, Central News Agency) Global oil prices went down a little today. This happened because trade talks in the United States were not moving forward well. Also, new rules from the European Union did not stop Russia from selling its oil and gas. These things made people worried about how much oil the world needs.</p>
            <p>At the New York stock market, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery dropped by 14 cents. It is now $67.20 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price of Brent crude oil from the North Sea for September delivery went down by 7 cents. It is now $69.21 for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>New Round of Russia-Ukraine Peace Talks, Zelenskyy Says Scheduled for July 23</h1>
            <p>(Kyiv, July 21st, Central News Agency) Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said today that Russia and Ukraine will have new peace talks on July 23rd.</p>
            <p>News agency AFP reported that the first two rounds of talks between Russia and Ukraine happened in Istanbul, Turkey. These talks did not help much to end the war.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said in his usual speech that he talked with Rustem Umerov today. Umerov is the head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. They discussed holding new talks with Russia in Turkey. Zelenskyy said, "Umerov told me these talks are planned for the 23rd."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that more details about the new peace talks will be given tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Representatives from Russia and Ukraine had two rounds of talks in Istanbul on May 16th and June 2nd. They did not agree on stopping the fighting. However, they did agree to keep working together to exchange prisoners of war and dead bodies.</p>
            <p>Last week, US President Trump said that if Russia and Ukraine do not agree to stop fighting within 50 days, the US will add strong taxes on Russian goods. After this, the Kremlin said that Russia is ready for more talks.</p>
            <p>Today, Russia's TASS news agency reported, quoting people who know, that Russia and Ukraine plan to have another round of talks on July 24th. The groups of people representing them might arrive in Istanbul on the 23rd.</p>

            <h1>US Treasury Secretary Says No Rush to Sign Trade Deal, Talks with China to Focus on Buying Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 21st, Central News Agency) Today, the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, said that the US cares more about how good a trade deal is, not how fast it is made. He also said that in the next talks between the US and China, they might discuss China buying oil from Russia and Iran. This shows that the talks will change from trade to national security.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Scott Bessent said that new taxes from the US will start on August 1st. This will happen if countries that trade with the US do not make a deal with Washington.</p>
            <p>Today, he spoke with CNBC, a business news channel. He said, "We will not rush to make a deal."</p>
            <p>Bessent was asked if the US might move the August 1st deadline if talks with other countries go well. He said that President Trump will decide everything.</p>
            <p>He said, "We will see what the President decides. But if we still have the August 1st taxes, I think higher taxes will put more pressure on those countries to make better deals."</p>
            <p>About the talks between the US and China, Bessent said that the two sides "will have talks soon."</p>
            <p>He said, "I think trade is in a good place. Now we can start talking about other issues. Sadly, China buys a lot of oil from Iran and Russia, which are under rules because of their actions. So, we might start talking about this problem."</p>
            <p>Bessent was also asked about new rules against Russia. He hinted that the US might use taxes as a way to control things. This means they would put high taxes on any country that buys oil and gas from Russia, which is under rules.</p>
            <p>Bessent told CNBC that "any country that buys Russian oil under rules will face very high extra taxes, up to 100%." If the US puts these extra taxes in place, he would ask Europe to do the same.</p>
            <p>About Japan, Bessent said that the Trump government cares more about getting the best deals for American people, not about Japan's internal politics.</p>
