            <h1>Traditional Chinese Medicine Joins Gyms to Enter the NT$30 Billion Sports Business</h1>
            <p>Not everyone goes to a gym, but many people visit Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) clinics. Now, the TCM industry is trying to enter the sports business, which is worth about 30 billion New Taiwan Dollars. They are looking for new ways to help people with their fitness and health.</p>
            <p>Wu Jun-ching, a doctor who runs a TCM clinic and also works in emergency medicine, said that many people who see a TCM doctor could also be interested in fitness. He explained that less than 5% of gym members often go, but about 70% of people in Taiwan have seen a TCM doctor. He believes that combining TCM with fitness is a new start for the health industry, calling it a "blue ocean beyond a blue ocean."</p>
            <p>Many young people sit for long periods and have a lot of stress. Because of this, pain has become a common problem. As people learn more about staying healthy to prevent sickness, many know that exercise can help reduce pain. Dr. Wu said that many office workers who start exercising often feel that it does not work well or even makes them feel more pain. The problem might not be the exercise itself, but that their bodies are not ready. At such times, TCM can help fix the basic problems.</p>
            <p>Dr. Wu also believes that with more older people, they need to move to stay active, and muscle strength is very important. For older people, a gym might feel new, but a TCM clinic feels like an old friend. If they combine gradual exercise classes with advice from a doctor, a TCM gym could be a safe way for older people to start exercising.</p>
            <p>Li Wei-yi, another TCM clinic director, also said that TCM gyms are not meant to make very strong people. Instead, they offer useful exercise advice for people of all ages with different needs. Even if someone just wants to sit comfortably without pain or climb stairs without getting tired, they can find a suitable exercise plan. A good gym, like a good TCM clinic, is not just for athletes; anyone can come in.</p>
            <p>Dr. Li explained that the goal of combining TCM and gyms is not just to stop pain, but to prevent it from coming back. Office workers who sit a lot often have stiff shoulders and back pain. In the past, they used massage or acupuncture to feel better, but this only helped for a short time. He said, "We do not just give acupuncture or medicine. We also give exercise plans and 'homework' to help people keep exercising."</p>
            <p>Dr. Li thinks that the main idea of a TCM gym is to change from getting passive treatment to actively getting better. This means patients will go from the doctor's office to the gym. With a professional coach's guidance, they can strengthen their lower back muscles and learn how to stand and exercise correctly. Only by building strong muscles can they truly say goodbye to pain.</p>
            <p>Grace, a Pilates coach, said that traditional gyms usually only offer simple exercise training. They do not have combined services like food advice or TCM treatment. From her experience, she has seen many students who want to lose weight. If they only exercise but do not change their body's condition and daily habits, their weight loss often slows down.</p>
            <p>Grace said that combining TCM and exercise is like using both internal and external methods. Also, with professional AI machines, they can accurately check body fat and muscle amount. They can even find out if fascia problems are making the body unbalanced. Then, they can give suitable exercises, like core training or other fitness plans, to help people become healthier and look better more effectively.</p>

            <h1>Melania Trump's Letter to Putin Asking for Peace for Children is Made Public</h1>
            <p>At a meeting in Alaska, former U.S. President Trump gave Russian President Putin a special gift. It was a letter written by his wife, First Lady Melania Trump. In the letter, she asked the Russian leader to bring peace for children.</p>
            <p>News reports said that Trump and Putin's meeting yesterday did not achieve much. Today, Melania Trump's office shared the news story from Fox News, which showed the short letter, on social media platform X.</p>
            <p>According to Fox News, after Trump gave this "peace letter" to Putin, Putin opened and read it right away. People from both sides were watching.</p>
            <p>The letter said: "In today's world, some children must laugh softly, not letting the surrounding darkness bother them." Melania signed the letter, but it did not mention Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The letter continued: "Mr. Putin, you alone can make their happy laughter return. By keeping these children innocent, you are doing something good not only for Russia but for all people."</p>
            <p>The letter also said: "This important idea is bigger than all human differences. And Mr. Putin, today you have the power to make this vision happen quickly. Now is the time."</p>
            <p>In July of this year, Trump had said that his wife, who was born in Slovenia, helped him change his opinion about Putin.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I went home and told the First Lady, 'You know what, I talked to Putin today, and we had a very good conversation.'"</p>
            <p>"Then she replied, 'Oh, really? Another city just got bombed.'"</p>
            <p>Soon after his second term started, Trump tried to make his relationship with Putin friendly again. During his election, he had promised to end the war in Ukraine in just 24 hours.</p>

            <h1>Is Solar Power Most Expensive in Taiwan? Ministry Says Different International Systems Make Direct Comparison Unfair</h1>
            <p>Some news reports said that solar power is the most expensive in Taiwan. Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs released a statement to explain. They said that different countries use different ways to support renewable energy. Because of this, it is not right to compare their prices directly. The Ministry also stated that the price of solar power in Taiwan has gone down by 60%.</p>
            <p>The news reports also mentioned that if Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) built solar power plants, the cost would be 50% lower. The Energy Administration, part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, explained that Taiwan's system for buying renewable energy was set up in 2009. This was the first way they encouraged the use of renewable energy.</p>
            <p>The Ministry said that in 2010, the cost for one unit of solar power was about NT$11.76. But because technology has improved and the market has grown, by 2025, the price has dropped to NT$4.30 per unit. This is a decrease of 60%. Also, about 25% of solar power is now sold directly to businesses in Taiwan. This shows that the renewable energy market is becoming more varied.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration stressed that when countries promote renewable energy, they have different conditions. These include their natural resources, how developed their industry technology is, how their electricity market works, and their government policies. Therefore, comparing prices simply by looking at the numbers can be misleading. For example, countries like India, Japan, and Germany often use market bidding or extra payments. This is different from Taiwan's system, so comparing them directly is not fair.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration also added that the media's idea that "Taipower building it would cut costs by 50%" is not true. Taipower's main job is to keep the electricity supply steady. The cost of solar energy depends on many things. These include how easy it is to get land, how big the project is, how advanced the technology is, and how prices change in the supply chain. It is not true that Taipower managing it alone can greatly reduce costs.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration emphasized that the price for buying renewable electricity is decided every year by a special committee. They follow rules that are fair, open, and strict. They also consider Taiwan's environmental conditions, its goals for renewable energy, and new technologies around the world. This helps them set fair prices for buying renewable energy. In the future, they will keep learning from other countries and change the system as needed. This will help Taiwan reach its goal of having 20% green energy and meet the green power needs of industries.</p>
