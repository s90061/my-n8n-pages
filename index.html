The 2025 World Expo in Osaka, Japan, has welcomed over 10 million visitors, including staff, in its first 78 days. The Expo Association's secretary-general, Hiroki Ishige, said this number was reached faster than expected.
Japanese media reported that the Expo Association held a ceremony today for reaching 10 million visitors. Ishige said, "The number of visitors is more than we thought, and we reached 10 million faster than expected. It's summer now, so we hope everyone will come and enjoy the summer Expo."
He also mentioned a survey of visitors, where "80% said they want to visit again, and most were very happy with the exhibits. Although the weather was bad on the first day and there were Wi-Fi problems, some visitors said they were happy it was fixed quickly, which I am pleased about. Of course, there are still many problems, and we will work to solve them one by one."
The 10 millionth visitors were the Asano family from Yamagata City, Yamagata Prefecture. They received a "Summer Pass" for unlimited visits from July 19 to the end of August, along with sun protection items like umbrellas and hats.
The Expo Association announced that yesterday, June 28, there were about 195,000 visitors, which is the highest number of visitors in one day since the Expo started, even more than the 187,762 on May 31. A fireworks show was held at the Expo yesterday, with fireworks from one of Japan's three big fireworks festivals, "Oomagari Hanabi," attracting many people.
Osaka is hot these days, with temperatures reaching 34 degrees Celsius today. Visitors to the Osaka Expo should take steps to protect themselves from the sun.

**British Woman Runs Across Australia for Charity, Aims for World Record**

Fran Hurndall, a former female football player from the UK, finished her 3800-kilometer charity run across Australia today. She says she has set the fastest record for a woman to do this.
Her team said that Hurndall, who ran from Perth to Sydney in 60 days, had pain from an Achilles tendon injury and infected blisters. She did this to collect money for people who have experienced domestic violence.
Hurndall, 33, said in a statement: "This run was a crazy journey, and the mental and physical struggles were unbelievable. But what I went through is nothing compared to what women who live with the threat of domestic violence every day experience."
A spokesperson for her team said Hurndall finished the run 17 days faster than the woman who set the record in 2023. She plans to apply to Guinness World Records for this achievement.

**Chinese Yuan's Share in Global Payments Falls, Says SWIFT**

SWIFT, a global banking organization, reported that the Chinese yuan's (RMB) share in international payments dropped again in May this year. It went from 4.13% in March and 3.5% in April to 2.89% in May. Its rank also fell from 4th in March to 5th in April, and then to 6th in May. Also, the total amount of RMB payments in May was 23.07% less than in April.
Because of competition between the US and China and US efforts to stop China's technology growth, China has been trying to make the RMB a more global currency and reduce the use of the US dollar. However, Hong Kong and Chinese financial news reported that according to SWIFT, the US dollar was still number one in May, though its share dropped from 49.68% in April to 48.46%.
The Euro stayed in second place, with its share rising from 22.24% in April to 23.56% in May. The British Pound was still third, increasing from 6.51% to 7.06%. The Japanese Yen was fourth, dropping from 4.03% to 3.7%. The Canadian dollar replaced the RMB at fifth place, with its share falling from 3.18% to 3.11%.
Some experts think that the RMB has become stronger since early April because of the US-China trade war. Also, the trade war has hurt China's exports, making Chinese companies prefer to use US dollars for payments. This might be why RMB payments have decreased.
Caijing.com reported that Huang Shijin, SWIFT's Asia-Pacific head, believes that small changes in monthly data are normal and that you cannot make conclusions from just one or two months of data. He said that over a longer time, the use of RMB in SWIFT has actually grown.
Chinese financial experts said that the changes in RMB data over the past two months are linked to seasonal reasons, like China's May Day holiday. In April and May 2024, RMB payment amounts in SWIFT also went down. Also, China's own Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) moves some RMB payments outside of SWIFT, so SWIFT's data does not fully show how much RMB is used internationally.
