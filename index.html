Lawmaker Hsu Chiao-hsin from the KMT party said it was a good meeting that will make Taiwan and the US better friends. She said that relations between Taiwan and the US are important for all parties. The KMT will work actively to create good ways to talk and interact.</p>
            <p>Roger Wicker, who is the chairman of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan for a visit on August 29. Mr. Wicker is the first chairman from this committee to visit Taiwan in nine years, after John McCain came in June 2016. It is also Mr. Wicker's first visit to Taiwan in 24 years. He last came in 2001 when he was a member of the US House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>KMT lawmaker Hsu Chiao-hsin told the media today that she thanked Mr. Wicker and Ms. Fischer for leading their group to Taiwan. She said that the head of parliament, Han Kuo-yu, and the deputy head, Johnny Chiang, brought together members from different political parties in parliament for a special breakfast meeting.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiao-hsin said that relations between Taiwan and the US are important to all political parties. The KMT and its group in parliament will also take part actively, share their ideas, and create good ways to talk and interact.</p>

            <h1>Executive Yuan: New Financial Law Has Contradictions, Over NT$30 Billion Cannot Be Distributed</h1>
            <p>Government spokesperson Li Hui-chih said today that local shared tax revenues for next year will be the highest ever but also the most unfair. Also, because the new formula for sharing money has a problem, over 30 billion New Taiwan Dollars cannot be given out right now. The central government wants to give this money, but it cannot. The law needs to be changed again.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance used the new law's formula to calculate and tell cities and counties how much shared tax money they would get next year. About the over 30 billion NT dollars that cannot be given out, the Ministry of Finance said this money is still meant for local governments. The central government cannot use it for other things. This money will be given out after the law is changed.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih said on Facebook today that the local shared tax revenues for next year will be the highest ever, totaling 848.8 billion NT dollars. This is 402.7 billion NT dollars more than this year, which is over a 90% increase. But because the new law's formula for sharing money has problems, some areas will get much more money. For example, Yunlin County received 11 billion NT dollars this year, but next year it will get 24.6 billion NT dollars, which is a 123% increase.</p>
            <p>With the new formula, Lienchiang County will receive less shared tax money next year. Li Hui-chih said that the Ministry of Finance had to find a way to help Lienchiang County get the same amount as this year.</p>
            <p>She also said that because of the problem with the new law's formula for sharing money, the central government cannot even give out the money. Over 30 billion NT dollars in shared tax revenues cannot be given out. The law needs to be changed again to fix this.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih pointed out that while local shared tax revenues are at a new high, the difference between cities and rural areas is also growing. Since the central government has limited money to give, they must look again at how responsibilities are shared between the central and local governments. Premier Cho Jung-tai also said today that he will invite local leaders next week to talk about how responsibilities are shared.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance released a list showing how the central government's shared tax revenues are given to local governments. Comparing this year and next year, for the six main cities, Taipei City will get a lot more, from 70.702 billion NT dollars to 114.924 billion NT dollars. New Taipei City will also increase from 55.061 billion NT dollars to 95.768 billion NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Taichung City will increase from 45.244 billion NT dollars to 74.104 billion NT dollars. Tainan City will increase from 32.721 billion NT dollars to 49.670 billion NT dollars. Kaohsiung City will increase from 50.741 billion NT dollars to 75.780 billion NT dollars. Taoyuan City will increase from 36.275 billion NT dollars to 65.285 billion NT dollars. Lienchiang County will receive the same amount, 723 million NT dollars, with the central government making up the difference.</p>
