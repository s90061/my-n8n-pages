            <h1>High-Speed Rail Changes Quiet Carriage Rules After 17,000 Warnings</h1>
            <p>Taiwan High-Speed Rail has had "quiet carriages" for more than three weeks. During this time, they have given over 17,000 warnings. High-Speed Rail said today that they will not warn passengers with babies, young children, or those who cannot control themselves due to illness. Also, from today, they will change how they give warnings. They will now use gentle spoken reminders and guidance.</p>
            <p>Today, the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan invited the Ministry of Transportation, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and Taiwan High-Speed Rail. They reported on the different opinions about the quiet carriages, how well the policy has worked in its first month, and future plans for telling people about it.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation's written report said that Taiwan High-Speed Rail changed its passenger rules on August 22nd. The new rules officially started on September 22nd. If passengers are noisy, talk or make video calls on electronic devices, play sounds from apps, or use media in other ways that clearly bother other people, and they do not stop after being told, High-Speed Rail can refuse to carry them, or end their ticket. The first three months are a time for telling people about the rules.</p>
            <p>However, this rule made parents with children worried. Some people also said that High-Speed Rail was not friendly to children. Taiwan High-Speed Rail repeated in its report that they only warn adults who use electronic devices wrongly or are noisy. Children, babies, and passengers who cannot control themselves due to illness will not be warned.</p>
            <p>The quiet carriage rule has caused public discussion. Taiwan High-Speed Rail said they are reviewing the rule. This includes making the way they tell people better. They removed the small "quiet carriage cards" from the net bags. Instead, they will use the T-Life magazine for gentle reminders. They also temporarily took down the "quiet carriageæ‘‡æ‘‡ç‰Œ" (shaking sign) from the food carts. New designs for the signs are being made.</p>
            <p>At the same time, they also changed how warnings are given. Taiwan High-Speed Rail explained that their staff will interact naturally with passengers when giving warnings. "Spoken reminders" and "gentle guidance" will be the main ways to warn people. This will help keep order and also consider how passengers feel.</p>
            <p>Taiwan High-Speed Rail said they will give staff more training on how to talk to people and how to be understanding. This will make their response at the moment and service quality better. They will also use training courses and feedback from real situations to make their service always good and professional.</p>
            <p>According to Taiwan High-Speed Rail's numbers, since the quiet carriage rule started on September 22nd until October 13th, there have been a total of 17,146 warnings. These warnings happened on 3,736 train services. On average, 4.58 passengers were warned on each service.</p>
            <p>The survey shows that 49% of warnings were for talking on the phone in the carriage, 24% for using electronic devices without headphones, and 27% for adults being loud in the carriage.</p>
            <p>Taiwan High-Speed Rail said that their own studies and passenger records show that almost 90% of passengers support the "quiet carriage culture." This shows that "making carriages quieter" is something most people agree on. Passengers generally think High-Speed Rail is doing well by trying to create a "quiet, comfortable, and friendly" travel environment. After being warned, most passengers followed the rules well.</p>

            <h1>Suspect in Los Angeles Wildfire Faces Up to 45 Years in Prison for Arson</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Justice said that a big group of citizens, called a federal grand jury, officially charged Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, today. He is accused of starting the Los Angeles wildfire on purpose. If found guilty, he could go to prison for up to 45 years.</p>
            <p>The Department of Justice explained that Rinderknecht is accused of three big federal crimes. These are "arson causing damage to property," "arson affecting trade between states," and "burning forests." The grand jury added the last two charges today.</p>
            <p>The Palisades Fire happened in January this year. It burned 9,475 hectares of land, destroyed 6,800 homes, and caused 12 deaths. The U.S. Department of Justice's agency that looks into arson cases, the "Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives" (ATF), announced its findings on October 8th. They believe Rinderknecht seriously "started the fire on purpose."</p>
            <p>At the time of the fire, Rinderknecht was an Uber driver. He lived in the "Pacific Palisades" area. Later, he moved to Florida and was arrested there on October 7th. He is expected to appear in federal court in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p>Police believe that Rinderknecht started a small fire at midnight on January 1st this year. Even though it was put out then, the fire stayed hot under the plant roots. On October 7th, strong winds caused it to start burning again and spread, leading to a very serious disaster.</p>
            <p>According to the evidence shown by the prosecutors, on January 1st, the suspect was an Uber driver. After dropping off passengers late at night, he drove to the entrance of the Skull Rock hiking trail. That night, two passengers told the police that he was "very emotional and angry."</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said he walked to the top of the mountain. He used an open flame, possibly a lighter, to light paper or plant leaves. He filmed a video with his phone. In the video, a French rap song called "Un Zder, Un ThÃ©" was playing. The song's words were full of sadness and pain. The music video also showed a trash can burning.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor said that at the same time, the suspect called the police. But because the phone signal in the mountains was bad, he had to call many times before it connected. While he was calling, he used his phone to ask ChatGPT, "If a cigarette causes a fire, is it my fault?"</p>
            <p>The prosecutor said that as Rinderknecht drove away, he passed fire trucks that were coming to put out the fire. The investigation took nine months. Prosecutors have evidence, including videos from the suspect's phone, call records, GPS location, and a picture of a city on fire that the suspect created with ChatGPT.</p>
