New numbers show that the cost of groceries went up again in April. This means people are still paying more for food overall. However, there was some good news for shoppers: the prices of fresh fruits and vegetables actually went down quite a bit.

According to a report, the average price of groceries increased by 0.2% last month. This follows a small decrease in March, so it's a slight rise again for most food items. But when you look at fresh produce, prices dropped by 0.7% for fruits and a significant 1.1% for vegetables. This is good news for healthy eating. Experts say this might be because there are more fresh foods available now.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) Is Changing How Americans Work**

A new report says that artificial intelligence (AI) is having a big effect on jobs and the economy in the United States. AI is not just for tech companies anymore; it's changing how many different types of work are done.

The report explains that AI can help workers do their jobs faster and better. This means that businesses might become more efficient. However, AI could also mean that some jobs change a lot, or even disappear. On the other hand, new jobs might be created that need people to work with AI. For example, some administrative and office support jobs might be done more by AI, while there will be a higher need for people who can develop and manage AI systems. The report suggests that many workers will need to learn new skills to adapt to these changes in the workplace.
