Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities and higher education schools in mainland China. For the first time in nearly ten years, Jinan University in Guangzhou has been removed from this list. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 specialized colleges.

Earlier this year, Minister of Education Cheng Ying-Yao stated at a meeting of university presidents that schools linked to China's United Front Work Department are not purely academic and should not be collaborated with. The Ministry will no longer recognize degrees from such institutions.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Jinan University in Guangzhou from its list of recognized schools. They explained that Jinan University has been managed by China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To ensure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment, free from specific political goals, Jinan University was removed from the list.

The Ministry also repeated that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, orderly, equal, respectful, and mutually beneficial. Schools planning student exchange activities with China should follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China, paying attention to the purpose, organizers, plans, and materials. These activities should not have political goals or content, and schools should avoid being hosted by China or supporting China's political messages.

Additionally, the Ministry said that if schools have questions about activity organizers or plans, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. Taiwan still hopes to help young students from both sides learn and understand each other, but students should be aware of potential risks during exchanges, checking the background of organizers and if there are any specific political aims.
