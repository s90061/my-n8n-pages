Taiwan's central bank has warned that the United States' rapidly increasing national debt could affect global trust in U.S. Treasury bonds. This concern was highlighted in a report by the central bank, noting that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important for global finance, the continued accumulation of debt could pose risks. The bank pointed out that the U.S. national debt has been growing quickly, raising questions about its long-term sustainability and the potential impact on international financial markets. Taiwan, as a significant holder of U.S. debt, is closely watching these developments.

**SoftBank Founder Masayoshi Son Proposes $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC and Trump Team**

Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group, is reportedly seeking to collaborate with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) on an ambitious project: a $1 trillion industrial center for artificial intelligence in the United States. This massive proposal, which Son has discussed with TSMC and former President Donald Trump's team, represents his potentially largest investment yet. The plan aims to establish a significant AI development and manufacturing hub in the U.S., leveraging TSMC's advanced chipmaking capabilities. If realized, this initiative could reshape the global AI landscape and strengthen U.S. technological infrastructure.

**Taiwan Adds Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List, Impacting China's AI Chip Ambitions**

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has officially added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list. This move is seen as a significant blow to China's ambitions in artificial intelligence chip development. The decision reflects ongoing global tensions and restrictions related to trade and technology, particularly concerning advanced semiconductors. By adding these companies to its control list, Taiwan aims to prevent its cutting-edge technology from being used by certain Chinese entities, aligning with broader international efforts to limit China's access to advanced chip technologies.
