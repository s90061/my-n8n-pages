Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing many parts of our world, from how we work to how we live every day. This smart technology, which can learn and solve problems, is no longer just for big tech companies. It is now used in various industries, affecting jobs and creating new opportunities.

In the workplace, AI is taking over repetitive tasks, allowing people to focus on more creative or complex work. For example, AI helps manage customer service, analyze large amounts of data, and even create content like text and images. Some worry that AI will take many jobs, but others believe it will create new roles that require different skills, such as managing AI systems or developing new AI applications.

For individuals, AI is already part of daily life through smart assistants, personalized recommendations on websites, and advanced navigation systems. As AI becomes more common, it means workers need to learn new skills and adapt. Companies are also changing how they do business by using AI to improve efficiency and make better decisions. This big change means we must understand how AI works and how we can use it to our advantage in the future.

**Venice Introduces a New Fee for Day Visitors**

The historic Italian city of Venice has started a new system to manage its large number of tourists. From late April, day-trippers visiting the city will need to pay an entry fee. This new rule aims to protect Venice's unique culture and environment from the effects of too many visitors, especially during busy times.

The fee applies to people who come to Venice just for the day and do not stay overnight. Visitors who have booked a hotel or other accommodation in Venice, along with residents, students, and workers, do not have to pay the fee. This system requires visitors to book their visit online in advance and pay a small charge for certain peak days.

City officials hope this measure will encourage more thoughtful tourism and help keep the city livable for its residents. Over-tourism has been a challenge for Venice for many years, impacting daily life for locals and putting pressure on the city's delicate structures. This new fee is one way the city is trying to find a balance between welcoming visitors and protecting its heritage.

**Cities Are Rethinking Green Spaces for a Better Future**

Around the world, cities are looking at their parks and green areas in new ways. Urban planners are now designing these spaces not just for beauty but also to help with big environmental challenges and improve people's daily lives. The goal is to make cities more resilient to climate change and healthier places to live.

One key reason for this change is climate change. Cities are getting hotter, and heavy rains can cause floods. New green spaces are being designed to act like "sponge cities," which means they can absorb rainwater and help cool down urban areas. They also help improve air quality and support local wildlife, like birds and insects.

Additionally, these green areas are becoming more important for mental health. Studies show that spending time in nature can reduce stress and improve well-being. So, cities are creating more accessible parks, urban farms, and community gardens. These efforts show a growing understanding that nature is essential for a city's health, its environment, and the happiness of its residents.`;
