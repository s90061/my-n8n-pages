            <h1>Rubbish from Other Schools Found at Hsinchu Waldorf Campus; Council Members Ask for Quick Check</h1>
            <p>(Reporter Lu Kang-jun, Hsinchu City, July 24) Today, council members from the Kuomintang (KMT) in Hsinchu City said that waste from other school building projects might be buried at the Hsinchu Waldorf Experimental School. They mentioned that a company called Jujia Construction handled all these school projects. The council members asked prosecutors to investigate this quickly. The Hsinchu City Government said they have reported the issue and are asking for money to cover damages.</p>
            <p>The reporter called Jujia Construction, but no one answered. The company did not reply before this report was finished.</p>
            <p>Today, the KMT group in the Hsinchu City Council held a press conference. Chen Ching-ling, the group leader, said that construction waste and related papers from Yuxian Junior High School were found under the grass at Hsinchu Waldorf School. He said that Jujia Construction worked on both schools. He wondered if high-level city officials gave permission for this to happen at that time.</p>
            <p>Wu Hsu-feng, a KMT council member, said that the police and prosecutors should quickly check if the previous city government team did anything illegal, like giving special benefits to someone. He said they should not blame everything on the construction company.</p>
            <p>Yang Ling-yi, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) council member in Hsinchu City, said that KMT council members again called it a "big hidden treasure." She suggested that the city government should dig up all city construction projects left by the previous government. She said that besides giving information to the police and prosecutors, they should also send all the soil to American laboratories.</p>
            <p>The DPP group in the Hsinchu City Council said that the police and prosecutors are already investigating both the Hsinchu baseball stadium and the Waldorf primary school. They asked the KMT and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) council members to respect the law. The DPP's position has always been the same: if there is any corruption or wrongdoing, the police and prosecutors should deal with it fairly.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu City Public Works Department replied in writing. They said they are currently digging up only a small part of the Waldorf site. So, they can only make judgments based on the evidence they see now. If they need to dig up a larger area in the future and find more waste that shows where it came from, they will give the evidence to the relevant authorities for investigation.</p>
            <p>The Public Works Department pointed out that they have reported Jujia Construction for possibly burying waste at the Waldorf site and have asked for money in a civil lawsuit. They hope the police and prosecutors can quickly investigate to make things clear. This is to stop the contractor from hiding evidence or moving their money away, which would make it impossible to get compensation and hurt their rights.</p>

            <h1>SK Hynix Makes Record Profit in Second Quarter as AI Demand Grows a Lot</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, July 24, CNA) SK Hynix, a big chip company from South Korea, announced today that it made a record profit for the quarter. This happened because the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) went up very quickly.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that SK Hynix is the second-largest maker of memory chips in the world. They are a leader in making high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. They are also an important supplier for the big American company Nvidia.</p>
            <p>SK Hynix said that their operating profit in the second quarter went up by almost 70%. It reached 9.21 trillion Korean won (about 197.3 billion New Taiwan dollars). Their total sales were 22.23 trillion Korean won. Both of these numbers are the highest they have ever had.</p>
            <p>Before this news, TSMC, a big chip company from Taiwan, announced last week that its net profit in the second quarter greatly increased. This was more than people expected. It was mainly because of the strong demand for AI technology. This happened even though the U.S. might put taxes on important chip parts.</p>
            <p>SK Hynix also said that their net profit increased by almost 70% compared to the same time last year. It reached 6.99 trillion Korean won.</p>
            <p>The company's profits went up because they sent out more DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and NAND flash memory than they thought they would.</p>
            <p>South Korea is a main country that sends goods to the U.S. Its two biggest industries, chips and cars, might face big problems. This is because U.S. President Trump has said he might add a 25% tax on these goods.</p>
            <p>A senior manager at SK Hynix said that the U.S. keeps saying it will limit selling chips to China. Because of this, customers are buying chips earlier to "avoid risks from outside." This has actually made things "better than expected" for the company.</p>
            <p>SK Hynix also said that even with political problems between countries, their production situation "has not changed."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Food Expo: Six Areas in Agriculture Hall, 'Chopstick Style' for a Taste Trip</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 24, CNA) The "2025 Taiwan Culinary Exhibition" will start on August 1st at Taipei World Trade Center Hall 1. The Ministry of Agriculture has planned the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall." Its theme is "Traveling with Tastes â€“ Farm, Mountain, and Fishing Village Chopstick Style." Visitors can taste delicious food there and also buy good products from farms all over Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Agriculture held a press conference. They talked about the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall," which is at the Taiwan Culinary Exhibition for the 10th year. It will have six main areas: "Taste Spreading Fragrance," "Perfect Taste Gift," "Smart Farming Beauty," "Trendy Escape," "Chopstick Style," and "Shining Food Time."</p>
            <p>Huang Chao-chin, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, said that since 2016 (year 105 of the Republic of China calendar), the Ministry of Agriculture has set up the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall" every year at the Taiwan Culinary Exhibition. It introduces farm products from different parts of Taiwan to people. It also teaches about food and farming, from where food is grown to when it is eaten. This year, the hall will bring together traditional "Tian Mama" dishes, young farmers' products, seafood and meat products, and food and farm tours from all over Taiwan. There will also be over a hundred local foods and souvenirs from villages. People can use their taste buds to enjoy a journey, taste Taiwan's local stories, and learn about Taiwan's agriculture and local life.</p>
            <p>"Tian Mama" food is the biggest highlight of this year's "Taiwan Agriculture Hall." Among them, "Tian Mama Changying Seafood Restaurant," which has been recommended by Michelin Bib Gourmand for three years in a row (from 2022 to 2024), will show how to make its famous dish, "Milkfish Fillet."</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chia-hsin is the fourth generation of "Changying Seafood Restaurant." Since she was a child, she saw her family raising and selling fish in Beimen, Tainan. She also cooked in the restaurant kitchen. So, she studied tourism and catering in college. After graduating, she came back home to help with her family's business. She said that after joining "Tian Mama" 12 years ago, she learned better how to show what makes their products special. She learned to combine the food with stories about where it came from. Now, she combines food and farm education with tour experiences.</p>
            <p>Among other "Tian Mama" products at the exhibition, "Natural Tea Farm" from New Taipei City has been recognized as a three-star traced restaurant for five years in a row (from 2020 to 2024). It also won the "British Food Award." Also, "Fuli Hecheng" from Fuli Township Farmers' Association was chosen as one of Taiwan's 12 most popular rice brands in 2023. And "Original Dream Tourist Farm" won a bronze medal in the Taiwan International Culinary Food Challenge.</p>
            <p>Su Mao-hsiang, the acting head of the Ministry of Agriculture's Agency of Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation, said that the Ministry of Agriculture started the "Tian Mama" brand in 2001 (when it was still the Council of Agriculture). It helps women in villages make special dishes using local food and local culture. Right now, there are 104 "Tian Mama" businesses across Taiwan. Their sales grow every year, and last year they reached 720 million New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Su Mao-hsiang also said that this year, the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall" will give a NT$50 food coupon for every NT$500 spent. The top prize in a drawing is a NT$16,000 farm tour voucher for four people, a NT$6,000 special accommodation voucher, a one-day food and farm tour, and "Tian Mama" meal coupons. The total value of all prizes is NT$500,000.</p>
