            <h1>UK Punishes 18 Russian Agents, Including a Media Editor</h1>
            <p>The UK's foreign office announced on July 18th that it would punish 18 Russian agents. This is the biggest punishment against Russian agents since 2018. That year, a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned in the UK but survived. One of the people being punished now is a so-called news editor.</p>
            <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Moscow should know this: the UK understands what they are trying to do secretly, and the UK will not allow it. The UK will not change its mind because of Russia's mixed threats and aggressive actions.</p>
            <p>In early March 2018, Russian agents tried to kill Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, in the UK using a special military poison. The father and daughter lived, but a British woman died because she thought the poison was perfume and used it.</p>
            <p>Russia's action to kill people in another country, which even caused a local person to die, made the UK government and its friends very angry. By early April, many countries sent away 153 Russian diplomats. Russian agents often pretend to be diplomats when they work in other countries.</p>
            <p>The UK foreign office's list of people to punish, released on July 18th, includes some Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who were involved in the Skripal poisoning case. The foreign office said that before the poisoning in 2018, Russian agents had used spy software called X-Agent to secretly watch Yulia's phone for five years.</p>
            <p>Besides the 18 agents, the UK foreign office also punished three groups that belong to Russian military intelligence. One of these groups, Unit 26165, was part of Russia's attacks on the city of Mariupol in southeast Ukraine. This includes the terrible event at the Mariupol theater in March 2022, where hundreds of people, including young children, died. They were hiding in the theater from air attacks. Unit 26165 used internet spying to help the Russian army find targets for their missiles.</p>
            <p>Information from the UK Home Office about these three Russian military intelligence groups shows that they attacked NATO countries. They attacked and hacked websites and email systems of governments, parliaments, and political parties in NATO countries. They stole, damaged, removed, changed, or replaced information, or stopped systems from working. National news organizations were also affected.</p>
            <p>The UK Home Office information also shows that sometimes, Russian agents pretend to be hackers from North Korea or China when they do online attacks.</p>
            <p>Also, among the Russian agents punished by the UK government on July 18th, three are important people from "African Initiative." "African Initiative" is a website Russia started in 2023. It says it's a news website for people in Africa and those interested in Africa. It uses social media and other online tools to control information and ideas. Russian military intelligence staff regularly work there.</p>
            <p>On the same day the UK announced the punishments, "African Initiative" put out news. They said that their main editor, assistant editor, and the person who runs the "Smiling and Waving" channel on Telegram were also punished. They suggested this was because "African Initiative" showed that the UK was doing secret "anti-Russian" activities in Africa.</p>
            <p>Telegram is a messaging and social media app that has strong links with Russian intelligence. The "Smiling and Waving" channel, which is connected to "African Initiative," has been shown many times to use false information and control information. It attacks the activities of the United Nations and Western countries in Africa. At the same time, it tries to make Russia look like a good power.</p>
            <p>"African Initiative" is available in English, Russian, French, Spanish, and Arabic. Information from the UK Home Office shows that the main editor and assistant editor of "African Initiative" have been connected to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Wagner Group, a private military company. They also arranged for bloggers and media people to visit Russian-controlled areas in Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Singapore Calls on Military to Fight Cyberattack</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Minister of Defense has announced that military groups have been asked to help fight a cyberattack. This attack is against important systems in the country. Experts believe the spy group trying to do this attack is linked to China.</p>
            <p>Singaporean news said that Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen stated the chosen military groups will work with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA). This is how the government will work together to respond to this danger.</p>
            <p>The news report said that Ng Eng Hen called this cyberattack "one example of a new danger" that the military must handle.</p>
            <p>So far, there are no reports that any of Singapore's systems have been broken into.</p>
            <p>K. Shanmugam, Singapore's Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law, first talked about this cyberattack on July 18th. He said it is a type of "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT) that is very dangerous for Singapore.</p>
            <p>An "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT) is a type of cyberattack. It means that attackers secretly get access to a system and stay there for a long time without being found.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said, "I can say the situation is serious and it is still happening." He directly named the group suspected of the attack as "UNC3886."</p>
            <p>Shanmugam did not give more details in his speech about who supports this group or where the attack started.</p>
            <p>However, Mandiant, a cybersecurity company owned by Google, has described UNC3886 as "a spy group connected to China."</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said that APT attackers often steal private information and damage important services. These services include healthcare, telecommunications, water, transport, and electricity.</p>
            <p>He added, "If the attack works, they can do spying and cause big problems for Singapore and its people."</p>
            <p>Regarding news reports that the UNC3886 hacking group is linked to China, the Chinese Embassy in Singapore said yesterday that they are "very unhappy." They released a statement saying China "strongly opposes any unfair bad comments against China." They also said that "in fact, China is one of the main victims of cyberattacks."</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy: New Peace Talks with Russia Proposed for Next Week</h1>
            <p>(Kyiv, July 19th, CNA) Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said today that Kyiv has suggested new peace talks with Moscow next week. He hopes to make the ceasefire discussions faster.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ukraine and Russia have had two rounds of talks in Istanbul, Turkey, in the last five months. In these talks, they agreed to exchange prisoners of war. However, they have not made much progress in ending the war, which has lasted over three years.</p>
            <p>In his evening speech to the country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, "We must do everything to stop the fighting. Russia should not avoid making decisions anymore."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian team in the first two talks in Istanbul, has invited Russia to a meeting next week to discuss things. Zelenskyy did not give more details.</p>
            <p>Last week, Rustem Umerov, who used to be Ukraine's defense minister, was made the head of the National Security and Defense Council. He was given the job of moving the talks forward.</p>
