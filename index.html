            <h1>Church in Michigan, USA, Shot at and Set on Fire, 2 Dead and 9 Hurt; Gunman Killed</h1>
            <p>Police in the US say that a church in Grand Blanc, Michigan, was shot at and set on fire today. At least 2 people died and 9 people were hurt. The gunman, a man from Michigan, was killed. US President Trump has also written about this event.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that officials said the gunman drove his car directly into a church of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also called the Mormon Church) during a large service. Then he started shooting, and after that, the church caught fire.</p>
            <p>People familiar with the situation told CNN that some people were badly hurt, and children were also among those injured.</p>
            <p>Grand Blanc Police Chief William Renye said the fire is now out. Police believe the gunman started the fire on purpose. He added that "investigators are still trying to find out when the fire started and what caused it." He also thinks that more dead people might be found once officers can safely enter the church.</p>
            <p>Renye also explained that the gunman was killed after fighting with law enforcement officers. It was confirmed that the gunman was a 40-year-old man from Michigan.</p>
            <p>Grand Blanc is north of Detroit, a big city in Michigan. It takes about one hour to drive between the two places.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that US President Donald Trump posted on his social media today, calling the event "very terrible." He also said, "The attacker is dead, but many things are still unclear. This seems to be another attack against Christians in America."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that local police said there is no longer any danger to the public from this incident.</p>

            <h1>New York Mayor Adams Will Not Run for Re-election; Does Not Support Other Candidates</h1>
            <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced today that he will not try to be re-elected. However, in his statement about quitting, he did not directly mention or support any other candidates. This election is just over a month away, and President Trump is watching it closely.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Adams was proud of his achievements, like the drop in violent crime rates, in a video he posted on social media. But he said that because "the media kept guessing" about what he would do next, and because the New York City Campaign Finance Board decided not to give public money to his re-election campaign, he could not continue to run.</p>
            <p>He said, "Even with all these good things we have done, I cannot continue my campaign to be re-elected."</p>
            <p>Just a few days ago, this Democratic mayor, who has served only one term, kept saying he would stay in the race. He said that New Yorkers "don't give up easily."</p>
            <p>However, for a year, people have wondered if he could last until election day. He faced charges of corruption, which a federal judge later removed. Also, some liberal people did not like that he was close to Trump. These things hurt Adams' chance to be re-elected. He did not join the Democratic Party's main election but was trying to be re-elected as an independent.</p>
            <p>In the video, Adams did not directly talk about or support any other candidates. But he warned that "bad forces" are using local government to "divide people."</p>
            <p>Adams leaving the race might help former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo is also a moderate, like Adams. Cuomo says he is the only candidate who can beat the Democratic Party's chosen person, state assembly member Zohran Mamdani.</p>
            <p>But it is not clear yet if Adams' supporters will switch to support Cuomo, and if that would be enough to make a big difference.</p>

            <h1>US Considers Giving Ukraine Long-Range Tomahawk Missiles; Vance Says Trump Will Decide</h1>
            <p>US Vice President JD Vance said today that the United States is thinking about giving Ukraine long-range Tomahawk Cruise Missiles. Ukraine wants these missiles to help defend itself against Russia's attack.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked the US to sell Tomahawk missiles to European countries, which would then give them to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Vance told "Fox News Sunday" that US President Donald Trump will make the final decision on whether to allow this deal.</p>
            <p>Vance said, "We are indeed looking at several requests from European countries."</p>
            <p>Tomahawk missiles can travel up to 2500 kilometers. For Ukraine, getting this weapon would greatly improve its ability to fight against Russia's regular missile and drone attacks.</p>
            <p>However, Russia would almost certainly see giving these weapons to Ukraine as making the conflict worse.</p>
            <p>In the past, Trump has said no to Ukraine's requests for long-range missiles. But he is becoming more frustrated that Russian President Vladimir Putin will not agree to a peace deal.</p>
            <p>Vance also said that Russia's attack on Ukraine has not moved much recently, and they have gained little land.</p>
            <p>He said, "When the (Trump) government started, we strongly pushed for peace, but Russia must face reality. This war has caused many deaths, but Russia has not achieved much."</p>
