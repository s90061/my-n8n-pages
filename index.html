            <h1>Sports Ministry Established, Premier Cho Jung-tai Leads by Example, Invites Everyone to Get Active</h1>
            <p>Today is National Sports Day, and also the day the Sports Ministry was officially opened. Premier Cho Jung-tai posted many sports photos on Facebook, showing himself doing exercises without equipment and playing football. He said he tries to exercise whenever he has free time between work. He asked everyone to get active to be healthy and feel good.</p>
            <p>The Sports Ministry started this morning. President Lai Ching-te had said before that he strongly believes sports show a country's strength. Sports can make people healthy and strong, and bring the country together. The government will work hard to make Taiwan stronger through sports. They will focus on five main goals: greatly increasing money for sports, improving resources for athletes, promoting sports for everyone, strongly supporting equal rights in sports, and greatly developing the sports industry.</p>
            <p>Today, Cho Jung-tai shared many pictures of himself exercising on Facebook. These included doing planks, playing football, and learning fencing. He said that for his health and to have enough energy for his daily work, he tries to use small breaks between meetings and events. He lays out a yoga mat and does muscle exercises without equipment. He also hopes that people will exercise more to be healthy and in good spirits.</p>
            <p>The first head of the Sports Ministry is Li Yang, an Olympic gold medalist in badminton. Cheng Shih-chung, the Director of the Sports Administration, and Huang Chi-huang, the CEO of the National Sports Science Center, are political vice ministers. Hung Chih-chang, the Deputy Director of the Sports Administration, is the executive vice minister.</p>

            <h1>Environmental Groups Call for 52% Carbon Reduction by 2035, Speed Up Net-Zero Efforts</h1>
            <p>Going digital is already happening in many industries. Also, artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching net-zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and businesses. These challenges are important for Taiwan's ability to compete in the future. The Central News Agency (CNA) reporters are looking closely at how the government and different industries are using AI to make work processes better and to create new green ideas. They are seeing Taiwan's industries improve again.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Environment will hold a meeting about NDC3.0. Environmental groups are asking for the carbon reduction goal for 2035 to be raised to 52%. They also want a promise to increase carbon pricing by 2035. They want plans for industries to remove carbon and stop using coal in their processes. This will help speed up the move towards net-zero.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, President Lai Ching-te announced at the Presidential Office's Climate Change Response Committee that by 2032, carbon emissions should be reduced by 32% (plus or minus 2%) compared to 2005. For 2035, the reduction should be 38% (plus or minus 2%).</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Environment is holding a meeting to talk about the "Draft of the Republic of China (Taiwan) 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC3.0)". They will explain the 2035 carbon reduction goal and the NDC 3.0 draft, and gather ideas from different groups. Because of this, environmental groups held a press conference today called "Taiwan NDC3.0 Civil Review".</p>
            <p>Mr. Chao Chia-wei, the director of Taiwan Climate Action Network Research Center, said that NDC3.0 is a key direction for change in the next 10 years. He compared Taiwan's NDC to those of other countries and found three main problems with Taiwan's plan. First, if the goal is net-zero by 2050, then by 2035, carbon reduction should be 52% to follow the net-zero path. Second, there are no clear reduction goals for important areas like industry and energy. Last, the way things are managed is not good enough. For example, the Presidential Office Climate Committee only gives advice and does not truly make changes happen.</p>
            <p>Chao Chia-wei thinks that the Climate Committee has started well in the past year, but it still has problems. For example, there is not enough planning for carbon pricing in 2035, and not enough efforts to stop giving money to fossil fuel companies. Policies that go against carbon reduction, like increasing investment in fossil fuel production, also need to be checked.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Yu-ping, Secretary-General of the Taiwan Environmental Planning Association, believes that solar power is still a very important part of renewable energy. However, she said that it has lost public support from last year to this year. She thinks that land use plans should be followed, and better tools for planning spaces should be developed. These tools would help protect the value of land, culture, and ensure long-term local management. After Typhoon Danas, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs should have created plans to show how green energy can make our energy system stronger.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tang Lin-hsiang, a researcher at the Environmental Rights Foundation, pointed out that Singapore has clearly promised in its NDC that its carbon tax will go up from the current 25 Singapore dollars per ton to 45 Singapore dollars (about NT$1065) by 2026. By 2030, it will reach 50 to 80 Singapore dollars. This shows their strong decision to reduce carbon. However, Taiwan's current carbon fee is only NT$300, and there are many discounts. He thinks the lowest price should be raised as much as possible, and there should be a trend to increase it. This would speed up the push for net-zero.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tang Wei-chieh, a specialist at the Homemakers Union and Foundation, said that the "net-zero green life" plan does not give local governments a clear and important role. Also, the energy transition plan does not include the roles of local people and indigenous groups. He gave an example: the UK has written multi-level management into its NDC, clearly stating the responsibilities and important policies for each area. Canada also clearly states that all parts of society and all levels of government should work together, with each province and territory helping.</p>

            <h1>WB Boxing World Championships: Chen Nien-chin Easily Advances to Quarterfinals in First Match</h1>
            <p>At the WB World Boxing Championships in Liverpool, UK, Taiwanese athlete Chen Nien-chin easily won her first match today in the women's 65kg category. She beat Jenni from Switzerland 5-0 and moved on to the quarterfinals, as she had hoped.</p>
            <p>Chen Nien-chin is 28 years old and won a bronze medal in women's boxing at the Paris Olympics. Today, she competed in the round of 16 at the first World Championships held by World Boxing (WB).</p>
            <p>Chen Nien-chin was the last Taiwanese team member to compete. But when she started, she was very ready for Jenni from Switzerland (Anna Julia Jenni). In the first round, her defense was very good. Her counter-punches hit her opponent at the right time. Four judges gave her 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the second round, her opponent attacked more, trying many times to get close and hit her. But Chen Nien-chin always kept her distance at the right moment. She did not let her opponent succeed. All five judges gave her 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the last round, both boxers were a bit careful with their attacks. Chen Nien-chin, who was ahead after the first two rounds, did not rush. She waited for chances to defend and counter-attack, and she won the match.</p>
            <p>Her coach, Ko Wen-ming, told the Central News Agency that Chen Nien-chin had waited many days to compete, so she was naturally a bit excited. "But she was very calm in the first round. She didn't rush her punches. She used the plan they had made before the match very well," he said.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-ming stressed that the first match is always the hardest. "Now that she has reached the quarterfinals, it's the first step. Of course, the main goal is to win a medal," he added.</p>
