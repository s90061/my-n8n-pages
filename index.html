More and more people are looking for a calmer, less stressful way to live their daily lives. This idea is sometimes called "quiet quitting" for personal life, meaning people are choosing to do less, say "no" more often, and focus on what truly makes them happy, rather than always trying to achieve more or be busy. Instead of filling every hour with activities or social events, individuals are valuing rest, hobbies, and simple moments at home. This trend is a reaction to feeling overwhelmed by work, digital messages, and constant demands. People are realizing that being constantly busy doesn't always lead to happiness or well-being. They are learning to set limits, protect their free time, and enjoy the quiet moments that help them feel refreshed. This shift suggests a growing desire for a healthier balance between doing and being, putting personal peace above constant achievement.

**Work: Hybrid Work: Companies Still Learning the Best Way**

Many companies are still figuring out the best way for their employees to work â€“ whether fully in the office, fully from home, or a mix of both, known as hybrid work. Recent reports show that there isn't one perfect answer, and different companies are trying different things. Some business leaders believe that having everyone in the office helps people work together better and builds a stronger team culture. They think it's easier to share ideas and train new staff when everyone is in the same place. However, other leaders find that giving employees the choice to work from home some days makes them happier and more productive. They also believe it helps attract and keep talented staff, as many people now expect flexibility. The discussion about hybrid work continues, with companies trying to balance business needs with employee well-being and preferences.

**Travel: Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers to Manage Crowds**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started a new rule to help manage the large number of tourists it receives. From now on, visitors who come for just one day will need to pay a small fee to enter the city. This new charge is a trial for certain busy days, especially during spring holidays and summer weekends. The main reason for this fee is to control "overtourism," which is when too many visitors cause problems for local people and the city's fragile buildings. Venice is very popular, but its narrow streets and bridges can become very crowded. By asking day-trippers to pay, the city hopes to encourage people to visit at less busy times or to stay longer, which might help spread out the tourist numbers. This new rule is a way for Venice to protect its unique beauty and ensure a better experience for both residents and visitors.
