            <h1>University Denies Illegal Firings, Union Calls Them "Fake Placement"</h1>
            <p>Teachers from St. John's University and a higher education union went to the Ministry of Education today. They complained that the university's plan was "fake placement" but was actually a way to fire six full-time teachers. However, St. John's University said in a statement that they followed the law when guiding teachers through placement, and they did not fire anyone illegally.</p>
            <p>Ms. Cai Lihui, the head of the St. John's University Teachers' Association, said that they spoke out today not just for themselves, but for all private school teachers. According to Article 27 of the Teachers' Act, a teacher can only be fired if there are no classes for them to teach and no other jobs they can do. If teachers have classes to teach, they should not be forced to leave their jobs.</p>
            <p>Ms. Cai Lihui also said that St. John's University has had more foreign students in recent years. Also, the number of students in their new special programs is said to be among the top three in the country. She does not understand why the university is doing the opposite by firing full-time teachers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin Baiyi, the head of the organization department at the Higher Education Union, said he thinks St. John's University used the class scheduling system and other management methods to wrongly make it seem like some teachers had no classes. Or, they tricked full-time teachers into working for the Chinese Language Center with only one-year contracts, which hurt the teachers' rights.</p>
            <p>One teacher who was affected said that what the school called "placement guidance" was just a formality. If they did not agree to give up their full-time status, they were not even allowed to interview for administrative jobs. This made the "placement" seem like it failed, and then the process to fire them started right away.</p>
            <p>Regarding this, St. John's University released a statement. They said all their actions followed the law. They went through the placement process four times. Only when teachers clearly said they would not accept the placement did the university start the process to fire them, which is allowed by law. They also said that this process is still happening, and no teachers have been fired yet.</p>
            <p>St. John's University said that the problem of fewer children being born is very serious. Some departments have stopped taking new students for many years or do not have any students now. Starting from the 2025 academic year, they will face the reality of having no students and no classes to offer. But they are still trying their best to protect teachers' rights. Some teachers have taught fewer hours than required for a long time, but the university still paid them for those hours as per their contract. The university said they "did not try to get the money back or punish them, always treating them with good intentions."</p>
            <p>The university also strongly said that St. John's University was the first university in the country to sign an agreement with its union. This shows their honesty and willingness to work together. The university strongly protests any false claims from outside, any misunderstanding of conversations, and any attacks on certain people. They also said they will use their right to take legal action if needed.</p>

            <h1>Patient Groups Ask for Easier Access to Medicine for Crohn's Disease; Health Ministry Will Consider It</h1>
            <p>Diseases like Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases often affect young and middle-aged adults. Patient groups recently suggested on an online platform for public policy that the rules for getting medicine for these diseases through health insurance should be made easier. More than 5,000 people supported this idea. Today, the Minister of Health and Welfare, Mr. Chiu Tai-yuan, promised to study the suggestion quickly to help more patients.</p>
            <p>The person who made the suggestion asked the National Health Insurance Administration to change the system for how it pays for medicines for people with "inflammatory bowel disease" (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. They want to remove the current rule that limits treatment to one year. Instead, they want to follow the standard for other diseases where the body attacks itself, like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, which allow for two years or more of treatment. They also asked for different doctors and departments to work together to give better care, which would help patients more and improve their quality of life.</p>
            <p>The person who made the suggestion collected information from an online survey starting July 11th, asking about patients' and doctors' experiences. So far, 129 people have answered, and 75 of them are patients. The information shows that 84% of patients had stomach pain and bloody stools again after they stopped their medicine; 76% felt sad or worried; 64% had problems with school or work; 80.6% of patients hoped to continue their treatment for a longer time; and 61.2% hoped to remove the rule that they must stop medicine for three months before they can apply for it again.</p>
            <p>The public policy online platform suggestion reached enough supporters today. The Taiwan Intestinal Health Association and the Taiwan Gut Health Association together sent out a press release. They said that inflammatory bowel diseases often affect young adults. In these diseases, a person's own immune system attacks their intestines, causing severe stomach pain and bloody stools. Patients often feel like they spend most of their time in the bathroom. They can have narrowed intestines, holes in their intestines, or blockages, and sometimes even a ruptured bowel.</p>
            <p>The press release also said that currently, it is very difficult to get health insurance to pay for these medicines. Patients are often forced to stop their medicine after one year, even when it has just started to work. If they need to get medicine again, they have to wait for their symptoms to return and then wait for a three-month observation period, or sometimes even nearly half a year. This makes patients who could have stable jobs get sick again and again. This causes a lot of stress for both their body and mind, and it also wastes health insurance money.</p>
            <p>Minister Chiu Tai-yuan attended the Ministry of Health and Welfare's anniversary celebration today in the afternoon. He gave out awards for health and welfare and honored excellent public servants. Before the event, he spoke to reporters. He was asked when the suggestion to make it easier to get medicine for Crohn's disease and other inflammatory bowel diseases would be discussed by experts, now that it has enough support. He said that he would study it quickly so that more patients can receive better care.</p>

            <h1>Blue Camp Says Recall Group Leader Made Money in China; Recall Group Says People Can Do Business Abroad</h1>
            <p>The KMT (Kuomintang), also known as the "Blue Camp" in Taiwan, revealed today that Ms. Liu Yu-wen, who speaks for the "End the Black Core" recall group, has a business background in China. The "End the Black Core" group responded with a statement saying that people naturally have the freedom to do business legally with other countries.</p>
            <p>The KMT group in Hualien County held a press conference today. Mr. Wu Jian-zhi, who speaks for the group, said that Ms. Liu Yu-wen says she is against communism and wants to fight for Taiwan's democracy. However, she has a company called "Wenda Culture Communication Co., Ltd." registered in Dongguan, China, and she worked in Beijing. She also performed in plays that toured in China, and Chinese media reported about her. Mr. Wu said, "Fighting China to protect Taiwan" is not true for her; instead, "making money from China" is the real truth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Jian-zhi questioned why Ms. Liu Yu-wen suddenly became a "fighter for democracy" in Taiwan's political disagreements. He said it was very ironic. He also said that her actions, which are different depending on the situation, are very much like the "Green-Communist way of thinking" of the ruling party (DPP) and its supporters.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Jian-zhi said that these people criticize China in Taiwan, but they make money in China. Then, they unfairly accuse KMT politicians and try to remove them from office. He said they are no longer fighting for democracy. Instead, their final goal is to completely defeat the KMT, control all power, and create a government ruled by only one party.</p>
            <p>The "End the Black Core" group released a statement today. It said that people naturally have the freedom to do business legally with foreign countries, which is part of free trade. However, they said that KMT lawmakers are important government officials who often handle secret information. These lawmakers often meet with Chinese groups that try to influence Taiwan. The risk this might cause to national security is much higher than when regular people do business with China.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that based on what people in different jobs have learned from working with China, the group deeply understands how important Taiwan's freedom and democracy are and how hard they were to get.</p>
            <p>The "End the Black Core" group stated that KMT lawmakers are working with Chinese groups that aim to influence Taiwan. They keep attacking and bothering Taiwanese citizens, unfairly sharing private information about people, and using their power (because they have more votes) to strongly pass laws that are against the constitution and hurt good government. This is why the group started the recall movement. They want to remove lawmakers who are not loyal and are not suitable for their jobs.</p>
