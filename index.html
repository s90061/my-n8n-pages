Businesses have also seen that productivity can increase, and they can sometimes save money on office costs. This shift suggests that flexible working is becoming the new standard for many workplaces around the world.

**New Report Calls for More Sustainable Tourism**

A new report recently published shows that there is a growing demand for more sustainable tourism. This means that more and more travelers are thinking about how their trips affect the environment and local communities.

The report highlights that people are increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of traditional tourism, such as pollution and damage to natural sites. They also want to ensure that tourism helps, rather than harms, the cultures and economies of local people.
