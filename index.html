Taiwan's weather agency has warned about high temperatures in 17 areas. As of 11 AM today, New Taipei, Taoyuan, and Hsinchu already had temperatures above 37 degrees Celsius. Luzhu District in Taoyuan recorded the highest at 37.9 degrees Celsius.

Taoyuan has an orange warning, meaning temperatures could reach 38 degrees. Other areas with orange warnings, like Taipei, New Taipei, Taichung, and more, might see temperatures of 36 degrees for a long time. Some areas, including Keelung and Hsinchu City, have a yellow warning, meaning temperatures could go over 36 degrees.

Other cities also saw temperatures above 36 degrees. The weather agency reminded people to be careful in the heat.

**President's Talk on Unity: KMT Says Opposition's Help for Military Pay Ignored**

President Lai Ching-te recently gave his fourth speech on "National Unity," focusing on defense. The Kuomintang (KMT) party, however, said that the President did not mention that opposition parties helped increase soldiers' pay. They believe the President is ignoring good things done by other parties.

The KMT also stated that most of the defense budget, which the President said was frozen, has now been unfrozen. Only a small part for a new submarine is still on hold, waiting for sea tests. The KMT pointed out that the amount cut from this year's defense budget is not the highest ever, as the President claimed.

The KMT emphasized that all political parties support strengthening Taiwan's defense. They also believe that the Parliament needs to check how the money is spent to make sure it is used well.

**Brain Boost? Study Finds Gentle Stimulation Can Improve Math Skills**

Are you not good at math? A new study suggests that a small electric push to the brain might help. This new research, published in a science journal, shows that mild electrical stimulation can make people better at arithmetic. This finding could help us understand how the brain learns math and might offer a way to improve learning for everyone.

Researchers say this discovery could help close learning gaps and create a fairer society where everyone has a chance to learn. The study involved 72 students from Oxford University. Scientists found that students with stronger connections between two parts of their brain (DLPFC and PPC) were better at math.

When researchers used a painless electrical stimulation on the students' brains, those who were not as good at math improved their scores by 25% to 29%. This stimulation helped make brain cells more active and fixed some weaker connections in the brain. Interestingly, the stimulation helped those who struggled with math, but it did not help students who were already good at it. The researchers warn people not to try this at home.
