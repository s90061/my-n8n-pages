            <h1>How to Stay Safe if a Tsunami Comes: US Weather Service Advice</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 30 (CNA) â€“ A strong earthquake with a size of 8.8 happened this morning off the Kamchatka Peninsula in far eastern Russia. Because of this, many places on the west coast of the United States, Alaska, and other Pacific countries received different levels of tsunami warnings. Below is what the U.S. National Weather Service suggests you do if a tsunami is coming.</p>
            <h2>How do Tsunamis Happen?</h2>
            <p>According to the National Ocean Service, which is part of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, a tsunami is a series of very large waves caused by an earthquake or a volcanic eruption under the sea. Earthquakes can suddenly move seawater, creating strong currents and huge waves. The waves get taller as they get closer to the coast.</p>
            <h2>How Long Do Tsunamis Last?</h2>
            <p>A tsunami is made of many waves and can last for a long time. The first wave is not always the biggest. Later waves can suddenly get much higher. A very large tsunami can last for several days. For example, Japan has warned that the tsunami caused by the Kamchatka Peninsula earthquake might last for more than one day.</p>
            <h2>How Is the Tsunami Arrival Time Calculated?</h2>
            <p>According to the U.S. National Weather Service, tsunamis cannot be predicted exactly. Tsunami warning centers base their predictions on the size and location of the earthquake that caused the tsunami. After a tsunami is detected, they use prediction models to guess the wave height, where it will hit, and when it will arrive.</p>
            <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration uses the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system. It also works with a larger international network. This system detects, measures, and reports tsunamis in the ocean in real-time by checking changes in water pressure as the tsunami waves pass.</p>
            <h2>What Should You Do if You Receive a Tsunami Warning?</h2>
            <p>According to the U.S. National Weather Service, the U.S. uses a four-level tsunami alert system, from most serious to least serious: warning, advisory, watch, and information statement.</p>
            <p>People should also **be aware of natural signs that a tsunami is coming. These include a loud noise from the ocean, water levels suddenly going up or down, or the water suddenly pulling back from the shore**.</p>
            <p>"Tsunami warning" is the most serious alert. The National Weather Service explains that it means: "Take action, danger! A tsunami that is expected to cause widespread flooding is happening or will happen soon. Dangerous coastal flooding and strong currents might occur and could last for many hours or days after the first wave arrives."</p>
            <p>**If a tsunami warning is issued, officials suggest that people leave immediately. Go to high ground and as far inland as possible, at least 30 meters (100 feet) above sea level or 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) inland. Follow the instructions from local officials**.</p>
            <p>The National Weather Service reminds people that even though you should go to high ground, **most tall buildings are not built to survive a tsunami. However, if there are no other choices, the higher floors of some strong tall buildings might offer some protection**.</p>
            <p>The Ready.gov website from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security suggests that if you are on a boat at sea during a tsunami warning, **you should go out to water that is deep enough to be safe. If you are in a harbor, you should get off your boat and go to a safe area on land**.</p>
            <p>For international partners in the Pacific and Caribbean, the U.S. only sends a "tsunami threat" notice, not a "warning." According to the National Weather Service, a tsunami threat message will explain how the tsunami might affect people, buildings, and nature. Then, each country decides what kind of alert to issue.

            <h1>Nickel and Molybdenum Prices Rise; Hua Hsin Increases Prices for Some Stainless Steel Rods in August</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30 (CNA) â€“ Hua Hsin Lihua, a company that makes cables and stainless steel, said today that key materials for stainless steel, such as nickel and molybdenum, have become more expensive. Also, the New Taiwan Dollar has become weaker. These things have made the cost of making steel higher for the company. After looking at market conditions and costs, the company will increase the prices for some of its stainless steel rod products in August.</p>
            <p>Hua Hsin said that for 300 series stainless steel rods, the price will go up by NT$2,000 per ton. The added price for free-cutting steel will increase by NT$1,000 per ton, and the added price for 316 steel will also increase by NT$1,000 per ton. The prices for 200 series and 400 series steel will stay the same.</p>
            <p>Hua Hsin explained that even though trade talks between Taiwan and the U.S. are still happening, major steel-exporting countries in Asia have already made agreements with the U.S. People are now less worried about what will happen in the market, which helps the demand for steel get better.
