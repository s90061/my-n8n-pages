On July 6, a person took a bus from Taipei to Tainan during a typhoon. Outside, the wind and rain were very strong. The bus shook a lot on the highway. Strong winds and heavy rain hit the windows, and even the emergency exit on the roof almost opened.

Luckily, everyone on the bus arrived safely in Tainan. The passenger later wrote online to thank the driver for keeping them safe. This post became very popular. The bus company, Ho-Hsin Bus, said they will give the driver a special award and a bonus because of his excellent work.

The bus company also stated that they always follow the weather reports from the Central Weather Administration. They decide if buses should run or stop based on the weather. When this bus left, the weather was still okay. Later that night, Tainan had very strong winds, up to level 16, which caused power outages and damage.

**Fengyuan 5-person death case: Gold buying group leader released on bail, claims innocence, but family friend denies it.**

In Fengyuan, central Taiwan, a family of five people died at home. The police are investigating. A woman named Ms. Li, who organized group purchases of gold, was released on bail for NT$150,000. She said that the oldest sister of the family, Ms. Wang, already had many debts before they met.

Ms. Li said she tried to help Ms. Wang with her money problems. But now, people think Ms. Li is the bad person, even saying she caused the family's death. However, a friend of the Wang family disagreed strongly. They said Ms. Li sold gold that Ms. Wang bought from other shops, and questioned how that helped.

The family friend also mentioned that Ms. Wang had a loan for starting her own handmade candle business. The friend said that Ms. Wang's last message on June 30 said she would "keep fighting." Police are still investigating the case and interviewing many people to understand what happened.
