            <h1>Argentina's Football Team to Play Friendly Match in India, Messi's Participation Unsure</h1>
            <p>The Football Association of Argentina announced today that the country's national team, led by star player Lionel Messi, will travel to Kerala in southern India in November. They will play a friendly match there. However, it is not yet certain if Messi will join the team for this match.</p>
            <p>The plan for Argentina's men's football team to visit India has been in the works for some time. The government of Kerala has said many times that they are actively inviting Argentina to play a friendly match in India before the 2026 World Cup. But the exact date of the match has never been announced.</p>
            <p>However, according to the latest statement from the Argentina Football Association, the men's team, led by Messi, will have friendly matches at two different times later this year. First, they will play friendly matches in the United States in October. After that, they will play friendly matches in Angola and India in November.</p>
            <p>If Argentina's men's team successfully goes to India, it will be their first friendly match there since 2011.</p>
            <p>India Today reported that in 2011, Argentina played a friendly match against Venezuela in Kolkata, India. Messi also played in that game. His smooth football skills impressed the 70,000 fans there. But this time, it is still not known if he will play.</p>
            <p>In early August, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that Messi and his team plan to tour India. They expect to visit Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, and New Delhi. They also plan to meet with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
            <p>Firstpost reported that Argentina's men's team will go to the United States for friendly matches from October 6 to 14. But the cities and opponents are not yet known. From November 10 to 18, they will play in Luanda, the capital of Angola, and in Kerala, India. The opponents for these matches are also not yet announced.</p>

            <h1>Two Women Tore Up Referendum Ballots in Xindian, New Taipei; May Face Fines</h1>
            <p>Today, in Xindian District, New Taipei City, an 84-year-old woman named Ms. Liu tore up her referendum ballot. She made a mistake when marking it. Also, a 52-year-old woman named Ms. Chen tore up her referendum ballot because she found she had received an extra one. Both cases have been sent to the New Taipei City Election Commission for punishment. By law, each woman could face a fine between NT$5,000 and NT$50,000.</p>
            <p>Today was the day for voting on the referendum to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant and on the recall of seven KMT party lawmakers. Around noon in Xindian District, New Taipei City, two incidents happened where people tore up their referendum ballots.</p>
            <p>The Xindian Police Department of New Taipei City explained what happened. At 11:15 AM, Ms. Liu, 84, was at a polling station on Baozhong Road. She marked her ballot incorrectly, got nervous, and tore it up.</p>
            <p>Police also said that at 12:37 PM, Ms. Chen, 52, was at a polling station in Cukeng Village. When she was voting, she realized she had received an extra ballot. She got nervous and didn't know what to do, so she tore up the ballot right there in the voting booth.</p>
            <p>The police stated that election workers at both polling stations saw what happened and told the police. Election supervision members also came to confirm the events. Police then recorded the events according to Article 44 of the Referendum Act. The cases were then sent to the New Taipei City Election Commission for a decision on punishment. Ms. Liu and Ms. Chen left on their own.</p>
            <p>According to Article 44 of the Referendum Act, if someone puts something other than a referendum or election ballot into the ballot box, or purposely tears up a referendum ballot they received, they will be fined between NT$5,000 and NT$50,000.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Wind Power Doesn't Work; Rhode Island Wind Farm 80% Finished is Stopped</h1>
            <p>Today, the US federal government ordered a large wind power farm off the coast of Rhode Island to stop all construction. The wind farm was already 80% finished. Orsted, a Danish company that builds renewable energy projects, said it might take legal action.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that this is the newest action in a series of steps by the Trump government to stop wind power. Yesterday, Trump also said that "wind power simply does not work." Wind power is seen as a clean energy source that helps the environment.</p>
            <p>Orsted said that the "Revolution Wind" project began construction last year after getting all the necessary permissions. Its goal is to provide electricity to more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island, USA.</p>
            <p>Today, Matthew Giacona, the acting head of the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), sent a letter. It ordered "all ongoing activities in the project to stop" to allow time for a review.</p>
            <p>The letter stated, "Specifically, BOEM is looking to address concerns related to protecting the national security interests of the United States." But it did not explain further.</p>
            <p>The letter also said, "You cannot start construction again until BOEM finishes its review."</p>
            <p>Orsted said in a statement that it is "looking at all options to solve this quickly." This includes "possible legal steps."</p>
            <p>Orsted stated that 80% of this wind farm is complete. 45 out of 65 planned wind turbines have been put in place. The company hopes to finish the whole project by the end of next year.</p>
            <p>Since Trump became president in January this year, replacing former President Biden who supported renewable energy, the US wind power industry has faced big problems.</p>
            <p>Trump has stopped federal approvals and financial loans for all offshore and onshore wind power projects. He has also said many times that he does not like wind power. Yesterday in Washington, Trump said, "We will not do wind energy anymore; we will go back to fossil fuels."</p>
