**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation came after his speech, where he stated that the island is "of course" a country, supported by historical and legal evidence.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory, belonging to China since ancient times. They consider the island one of their provinces, without the right to be called a state.

President Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have offered to hold talks with China multiple times, but these offers have been rejected. China refers to Lai as a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, claimed that he deliberately twisted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

Their statement said, "It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly incited confrontation across the strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' false beliefs and heresies full of mistakes and omissions."

It added, "The false ideas created by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and law, will only be discarded into the garbage of history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply stating historical facts. They added that Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis."

They further stated, "We urge the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'."

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

Lai has consistently stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future, and since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has faced increased military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.
