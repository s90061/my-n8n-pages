            <h1>Australia's Great Barrier Reef Coral Decline - Worst in Nearly 40 Years</h1>
            <p>A study released today shows that the coral cover in two out of three areas of Australia's Great Barrier Reef has gone down the most ever recorded in the past year. This is mainly because of a very bad coral bleaching event in 2024, which affected a larger area than ever before.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) said that the southern and northern parts of the Great Barrier Reef had the biggest yearly drop in coral cover since monitoring started 39 years ago. After several years of steady growth, the coral cover dropped by about one-fourth to one-third.</p>
            <p>Mike Emslie, who is in charge of the long-term monitoring project, said, "We are now seeing bigger changes in hard coral cover." He noted that this has been happening for about 15 years, which shows that the ecosystem is under stress.</p>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system. It stretches for about 2,400 kilometers off the coast of Queensland in northern Australia.</p>
            <p>Since 2016, the Great Barrier Reef has had five summers of large-scale coral bleaching. This is when large areas of coral turn white because of high temperatures, which puts them at a higher risk of dying.</p>
            <p>The AIMS report says that the coral bleaching event in 2024 was the worst ever. All three main areas had bleaching that was from serious to extreme.</p>
            <p>Even though the United Nations has suggested adding the Great Barrier Reef to UNESCO's list of endangered World Heritage sites, it has not been officially added yet.</p>
            <p>For many years, the Australian government has tried to prevent the Great Barrier Reef from being listed as an endangered World Heritage site. This is because the Great Barrier Reef brings about 6.4 billion Australian dollars (around 124.5 billion New Taiwan dollars) to the Australian economy each year.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi County Wife Accused of Stabbing Husband to Death - Autopsy on 8th to Confirm Cause of Death</h1>
            <p>In Chiayi County, a couple argued again about money early this morning. The wife, Ms. Huang, is thought to have used a fruit knife to stab her husband, Mr. Zhuang, to death. Police and prosecutors checked his body and found many sharp wounds on his neck, chest, and back. An autopsy is planned for the 8th to find out the exact cause of death.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi District Prosecutors Office said that after police, prosecutors, and a forensic doctor checked Mr. Zhuang's body, they found many sharp wounds, mostly on his neck, chest, and back. The hospital had already closed the wounds, so the depth could not be checked. An autopsy is planned for the 8th to find out the cause of death.</p>
            <p>The Shuishang Branch of the Chiayi County Police Bureau stated that they received a 110 call around 1 AM about someone needing urgent help in Sanhe Village, Shuishang Township. When officers arrived, they found Mr. Zhuang, 36, with knife wounds. They quickly called the fire department to take him to the hospital, but he died after getting emergency treatment. Ms. Huang, Mr. Zhuang's 30-year-old wife, is the person suspected of doing the crime.</p>
            <p>The police said that when officers arrived, they found Mr. Zhuang lying on the floor in a room on the third floor, with a lot of blood around. They immediately tried to save him. Ms. Huang, who is suspected of the crime, was sitting still nearby. The couple's three sons, aged 7, 5, and 2, had already been taken downstairs by family members. The knife thought to be used in the crime, a fruit knife, was found on the living room floor downstairs.</p>
            <p>The police stated that Mr. Zhuang had many knife wounds, and several deep wounds on his chest and back. After questioning, the case was sent to the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office for investigation under the charge of murder.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors said that Mr. Zhuang and Ms. Huang had often argued over small things from 2019 to 2024. They had reported each other to the police for domestic violence. In 2019, their family was listed as high-risk, but this status was removed the next year.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors found out that Mr. Zhuang and Ms. Huang worked as food delivery drivers to support their family. However, after Ms. Huang gave birth to their third son two years ago, she almost stopped working in delivery. Mr. Zhuang did all the delivery work to earn money. Recently, because of a storm in early July and continuous heavy rain, Mr. Zhuang did not get many delivery orders. The couple started arguing about money again. Mr. Zhuang would curse at Ms. Huang. It is thought that they argued about money again early this morning, which sadly led to the death.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors stated that after this murder, they immediately told the social welfare department and asked social workers to investigate. The three young children are currently being looked after by relatives. After starting an urgent placement evaluation, the 2-year-old child will be cared for by relatives, and the 7-year-old and 5-year-old sons need urgent placement.</p>

            <p>The Beidawu Mountain Trail has many collapsed areas and sections where the path has been washed away because of heavy rain. The Pingtung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency announced today that the trail will be closed until December 31st of this year.

            <p>The Pingtung Branch of the Forestry Agency released a press statement saying that the Beidawu Mountain Trail was originally closed until the 10th. However, during the disaster check, they found collapses at 0.45 kilometers, 0.55 kilometers, 0.65 kilometers, 2.45 kilometers, and 6.1 kilometers on the trail. Also, a wooden bridge at 1.5 kilometers was damaged by falling rocks, and at 2.6 kilometers, the path was washed away and became narrower. Parts of the connecting road leading to the trail have also been hollowed out.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung Branch mentioned that the closure of the Beidawu Mountain Trail will be extended until December 31st of this year. People who have paid for accommodation can ask for a full refund through the mountain cabin application system.</p>
            <p>In addition, other trails managed by the Pingtung Branch of the Forestry Agency, such as Liuyi Mountain Trail, Lingshan Trail, Shuangxi Arboretum Trail, Shimengshan Trail, and Gaoshifo Trail, are open again starting today. For the western part of the Jinshuiying Trail, some sections of the Dahan Forest Road have collapsed. It will be checked and confirmed after the road is fixed and open again.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung Branch advised people that the soil in the mountain areas is still very wet these days. There is still a risk of falling rocks, landslides, and fallen trees. People should avoid going to the mountain areas for now.</p>
