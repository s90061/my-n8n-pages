New reports show that people in the United States spent less money in April. This suggests that the economy might be slowing down a little. While inflation, which means prices going up, is not increasing as fast as before, prices are still much higher than they used to be. This makes many households careful with their money.

The report, called the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, is an important measure of inflation. It shows that overall, prices went up by 2.7% compared to last year. This is still above the government's target of 2%. Because of these higher costs, many families are choosing to save more and spend less on non-essential items. This trend could influence decisions made by the central bank about interest rates in the coming months.

**AI is Changing the Way We Work**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly changing many jobs around the world. Companies are using AI tools to make work faster and more efficient. For example, AI can now do repetitive tasks like writing basic reports or analyzing large amounts of data. This means that some jobs may change, and some may even disappear.

However, AI is also creating new opportunities. Workers are now focusing more on tasks that require creativity, problem-solving, and human interaction. Many experts believe that people will need to learn new skills to work alongside AI. Companies are investing in training programs to help their employees adapt to these new technologies. The goal is for AI to help people do their jobs better, not completely replace them.

**Venice Starts New Fee for Day Visitors**

The famous city of Venice, Italy, has started a new system to manage its large number of tourists. From late April, day-trippers visiting the city must pay a 5-euro fee. This new rule is part of an effort to deal with "overtourism," which is when too many visitors go to one place, causing problems for local residents and the environment.

The fee is mostly for people who come to Venice for just one day and do not stay overnight. Officials hope this will encourage tourists to stay longer or choose different times to visit, reducing crowds during peak hours. Many other popular destinations around the world are also looking for ways to protect their unique culture and natural beauty while still welcoming visitors.
