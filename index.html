            <h1>S&P 500 and Nasdaq Hit New Highs; Investment Firm Says Taiwan Stocks Will See Money Move to Other Shares</h1>
            <p>The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq reached new high points. This happened because people hope the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates. US stocks rose sharply. Nvidia and TSMC's ADRs also went up a little. On August 12, Taiwan stocks rose by 22.86 points, closing at 24158.36 points. An investment firm said that large AI stocks, which are free from tariffs, made the Taiwan stock index go higher. They think that money will soon move to other stocks that have not gone up as much.</p>
            <p>People were worried about President Trump's tariffs in the US. But inflation in the US in July stayed mostly the same. This made the market more hopeful that the Federal Reserve (Fed) would lower interest rates. US stocks all rose at the end of the day. The S&P 500 index and Nasdaq hit new highs, and the Dow Jones also went up by almost 500 points.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 483.52 points, which is 1.10%. The S&P 500 index went up by 72.31 points, or 1.13%. The Nasdaq index increased by 296.51 points, or 1.39%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 169.72 points, or 2.99%.</p>
            <p>Nvidia's stock price went up slightly by 0.55%, closing at 183.16 US dollars. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) rose by 0.91%, closing at 244.29 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Taiwan stocks increased by 22.86 points on August 12, closing at 24158.36 points. The total value of shares traded was 420.044 billion New Taiwan dollars. Three major groups of investors sold a total of 6.101 billion New Taiwan dollars more than they bought. Among them, dealers bought 478 million more, investment trusts bought 50 million more, but foreign investors and Chinese investors sold 6.629 billion more.</p>
            <p>An investment analyst said that the increase in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) in July was as expected. The chance of the Fed lowering interest rates in September is still over 90%. This made the US Dow Jones index go up strongly. More than 90% of US company reports for the second quarter are out. 80% of these companies earned more money than expected. This helps keep US stocks strong at high levels.</p>
            <p>The analyst also pointed out that the Taiwan Weighted Index has been getting higher. On August 12, it reached 24263.92 points during the day, which is close to its highest point ever, 24416 points. However, only about 26.5% of stocks are above their yearly average price. Currently, the rise in the index is mostly due to large AI stocks that are not affected by tariffs. It is expected that money will soon move to stocks that have not directly benefited and have lower starting prices.</p>

            <h1>US Media Reveals How Countries Talked to Trump: Lobbyists Failed, Leader Meetings Worked Better</h1>
            <p>Foreign governments spent a lot of money to talk to Donald Trump to lower tariffs, but most of them did not succeed. An article from Politico shows different ways countries tried to talk to Trump. It says the best way to talk to Trump is for a leader to meet him in person. The President of Mexico is a good example of this. Cambodia, on the other hand, used a law firm to connect with the chief of staff at the Office of the Trade Representative. This led to a big drop in their tariffs.</p>
            <p>This year, many countries quickly hired people who are close to former US President Trump. They wanted to protect their country's interests as the new government changed global trade rules. However, most of them still faced higher tariffs.</p>
            <p>Looking at the latest results, Trump set a 15% tariff for major trade partners. For other countries in the world, he charged tariffs from 10% to 41%. The old ways of talking to officials in Washington D.C. did not seem to work well.</p>
            <p>US political news outlet Politico reported on August 9 that since the US presidential election last year, at least 30 countries have hired people who have connections with Trump. These include important trade partners like South Korea and Japan, as well as smaller countries like Bosnia and Ecuador. But hiring these people did not seem to have a clear effect on whether they could avoid high tariffs.</p>
            <p>Mukesh Aghi, who leads the "US-India Strategic Partnership Forum" lobbying group, said that the current leaders in Washington D.C. seem to be changing the usual ways of doing things. The old methods do not seem to work anymore, and the new methods are making it harder for India.</p>
            <p>In April this year, India hired Jason Miller, who has worked as an advisor for Trump for a long time. However, in the last two weeks, India was still greatly affected by Trump's tariffs.</p>
            <p>The US and India could not agree on a trade deal. Also, Trump decided to add a lot more tariffs because India bought oil from Russia. So, India's tariffs are expected to go up to 50%.</p>
            <p>Documents given to the US Justice Department show that India signed a one-year contract with Miller. The contract was worth 1.8 million US dollars (about 53.9 million New Taiwan dollars). In return, India would get advice on strategy, planning, help with government relations, image management, and public relations.</p>
            <p>What happened with Canada and Mexico is very clear. Different parts of Canada hired many lobbyists, but they were still hit hard by Trump's tariffs. Mexico did not hire lobbyists. Instead, President Claudia Sheinbaum used her personal friendship with Trump. This direct way worked better.</p>
            <p>Mexico played a more direct role in stopping the powerful painkiller fentanyl from coming into the US. But in the end, it was Canada, to the north, that faced higher tariffs. Tariffs on Canadian goods are now 35%, while Mexico's tariffs stayed at 25%. Most of Mexico's products are also free from tariffs under their current free trade agreement.</p>
            <p>A Republican lobbyist who works on Trump's tariff issues said that to make progress with Trump, you need to think differently.</p>
            <p>He talked about how the Mexican president was successful. He advised not to be against Trump. He said: "It's better to think this way: the President wants to change the trade relationship between the two countries. This is his goal, and you must work with him within his way of thinking."</p>
            <p>It is especially important for leaders to talk directly to Trump about their positions. Lobbyist Tami Overby said, "In my opinion, the best way to talk to President Trump is for a leader to meet him face-to-face."</p>
            <p>"President Trump always seems to like talking about his relationships with other leaders. It does not matter if our country has a good relationship with that country or not. He will decide based on whether he feels he has a good relationship with the other person. And he sees himself as someone who makes deals."</p>
            <p>Many companies that foreign governments hired before Trump became president are very important in the lobbying world in Washington D.C. Many countries hired experienced trade lobbyists or people connected to Trump before the US presidential election.</p>
            <p>One of these companies is Mercury Public Affairs. This company used to be the office of White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles on K Street, also known as "Lobbying Avenue" in Washington D.C. Since last November, this company has signed agreements with five new foreign governments, including South Korea, Ecuador, and Libya.</p>
            <p>Mercury Public Affairs also lobbied for the Japanese government. Japan hired more than 20 lobbying and public relations companies in the US. Japan was one of the first major partners to sign a trade agreement with the US, and their tariffs dropped from 25% at the start to 15%.</p>
            <p>According to documents given to the Justice Department under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, Ballard Partners, which used to be where US Attorney General Pam Bondi worked, helped Trump talk to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the phone just two days after the US election.</p>
            <p>Another lobbying company close to Trump, BGR Group, has signed six new foreign government clients since Trump won the election last year.</p>
            <p>Some of these clients, like Angola and South Korea, saw their tariffs go down between April and August. However, this company also received 300,000 US dollars to lobby for the Indian government, but most of this was about the growing tension between India and Pakistan.</p>
            <p>Some Southeast Asian countries that hired lobbying companies did better. Many of these countries got lower tariffs compared to the first tariffs announced in April. But these tariffs were still higher than before and generally higher than in other regions. In other words, the lobbyists might have helped their clients avoid the worst situation, but it's hard to call it a true victory.</p>
            <p>Countries like Cambodia hired US lobbying companies to get closer to Trump's government. They also worked with business groups in the Commerce Department and Treasury Department that talked to lower-level officials in Trump's government.</p>
            <p>Documents from the US Justice Department show that on the same day Trump announced his matching tariffs, the Washington D.C. law firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP contacted Sam Mulopulos, who was the chief of staff for the US Trade Representative's Office, on behalf of the Cambodian government.</p>
            <p>The documents show that in the following months, this law firm sent many text messages to Mulopulos. These messages were to help arrange meetings with Cambodian negotiators, get updates on tariff talks, and set up meetings with members of Congress, like Republican Representative Adrian Smith.</p>
            <p>In the end, Cambodia's tariffs dropped from 49% to 19%. This was one of the biggest drops for any country.</p>
            <p>The Trump administration said that the countries with the biggest tariff drops were those willing to make the most compromises. A former diplomat who worked with various Southeast Asian governments said that Vietnamese representatives set up more than 20 meetings with government officials. The number of meetings increased a few days after Trump announced the matching tariffs.</p>
            <p>Vietnam got a small win, with tariffs dropping from 46% to 20%. But Vietnamese officials said the final number was still higher than the rate first agreed upon. An Asian diplomat thought that the lobbying by Southeast Asian countries changed Trump's government's first trade plan. This plan was to pull Southeast Asia out of Beijing's influence and mainly stop China from illegally relabeling products and other illegal activities.</p>
            <p>Also, many countries started working with lobbying companies for the first time. These companies made money by using their connections with Trump or his close group of people.</p>
            <p>This year, the government of Pakistan hired seven new lobbying companies. These included companies owned by Keith Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard, and George Sorial, a former executive at the Trump Organization. Before this, these two had never registered as foreign agents. But Pakistan agreed to pay them 50,000 US dollars per month under a contract.</p>
            <p>Finally, Pakistan's matching tariffs dropped from 29% to 19%. This is a big difference compared to its old rival, India.</p>
            <p>Also, documents from the US Justice Department show that foreign governments, including Guyana and Japan, signed contracts with the lobbying company "Continental Strategy" this spring. Guyana pays Continental Strategy 50,000 US dollars each month. Its tariff rate dropped from 38% in April to 15% in August.</p>
            <p>"Continental Strategy" is led by Carlos Trujillo, a diplomat who worked in Trump's first government, and Alberto Martinez, a former senior aide to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Coming: Beware of Strong Winds and Heavy Rain; Eastern Taiwan and South of Chiayi Most Affected</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Central Weather Administration (CWA) said that today during the day will be when Tropical Storm Yang-Liu brings the strongest winds and rain. Eastern Taiwan, areas south of Chiayi, and Penghu will be most affected. There will be heavy rain or very heavy local rain. Especially in Hualien, Taitung, and the southern mountains, there is a chance of very heavy rain or more.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that Tropical Storm Yang-Liu, the 11th typhoon of the season, has become a little stronger. Its center is now southeast of Taitung, moving northwest. Its stormy area has already reached the coast southeast of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that at 6 AM today, the stormy area had already touched Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula on land. The winds and rain in eastern Taiwan will get much stronger. Around noon, the center of the typhoon is expected to land in Taitung. During the day, the winds and rain will be strongest. Eastern Taiwan, areas south of Chiayi, and Penghu will be most affected. There will be heavy rain or very heavy local rain. In Hualien, Taitung, and the southern mountains, there is a chance of very heavy rain or more.</p>
            <p>For areas north of Yunlin, as well as Kinmen and Matsu, there will also be some short showers or thunderstorms. In mountain areas, there might be heavy local rain. The CWA asks everyone to get ready for the typhoon and to check the latest weather forecasts from the CWA.</p>
            <p>The CWA said that in the evening, the typhoon's center will move to the sea west of Penghu, and then it will go towards mainland China. Its strength will slowly become weaker. Tonight, the wind and rain on Taiwan's main island will calm down, but Penghu and Kinmen will still have strong winds and rain.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, the CWA said that in areas south of Chiayi and eastern Taiwan, the highest temperatures will be around 27 to 30 degrees Celsius. Areas north of Yunlin will feel hot and muggy because of a "downwind sinking effect," with high temperatures above 32 or 33 degrees Celsius. Miaoli to Changhua and Kinmen have a chance of local high temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. People should drink more water.</p>
            <p>Because of the typhoon and its outer winds, the CWA said that some areas in Taitung (including Green Island and Orchid Island) might have average winds of force 12 or gusts of force 14 or higher. Some areas south of Yunlin, Hualien, and Penghu have a chance of average winds of force 9 or gusts of force 11 or higher. Other areas might also have average winds of force 6 or gusts of force 8 or higher. From tonight until early tomorrow morning, Kinmen County also has a chance of average winds of force 9 or higher, or gusts of force 11 or higher.</p>
            <p>The waves on all seas will get much bigger. Waves can be over 4 meters high, especially along the eastern and southeastern coasts, where they can be over 6 meters high. There is a chance of long waves along the north coast of Keelung, eastern Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), the Hengchun Peninsula, and the Matsu coast. People must be very careful and avoid going to the beach.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Environment's air quality forecast, today the typhoon and its outer winds will cause pollutants to gather slightly more in central Taiwan and the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area, which is on the downwind side. In the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area, strong winds might cause dust from the ground to rise, so pollutant levels could be higher for a short time. The air quality in the Hsinchu-Miaoli, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Yilan, Hualien-Taitung areas, and Matsu, Kinmen, and Penghu is "Good." The air quality in northern, central, and Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan areas is "Normal." You can find more details at https://www.moenv.gov.tw.</p>
