A new study from Oxford University suggests that too much screen time may not be as bad for teenagers' mental health as many people thought. The research, which looked at a lot of information carefully, found no direct link between the time adolescents spend on screens and worse mental health issues like sadness or worry.

This discovery is different from what many believed before. It looked at daily screen use by teenagers and compared it to their feelings of well-being. The study found that while some young people might have mental health problems, their screen time was not the main cause. The researchers say that focusing too much on screen time might stop us from looking at other, more important things that affect mental health.

**Remote Work Makes Employees Happier, Not Just More Productive**

A recent report shows that working from home or in a mix of home and office (hybrid work) is not only about how much work people do, but also makes workers happier. The study, by Scoop Technologies and Boston Consulting Group, found that flexible work options greatly improve how employees feel and their general well-being.

Many companies are now using hybrid work models, where employees spend some days in the office and some at home. This report suggests that being able to choose where you work helps reduce stress and balance work and life better. It shows that working from home is not just a passing trend but is becoming a normal part of how we work, leading to more satisfied employees.

**Europe's Most Popular Travel Spots Face Overtourism Issues**

Popular travel destinations in Europe are facing a growing problem: too many tourists. Cities like Venice, Rome, and Barcelona are seeing so many visitors that it can harm local communities and the environment. This issue, called "overtourism," makes life difficult for residents and can damage historical sites.

To help with this, travel experts suggest some ideas. One is to visit places that are not as famous but are still beautiful and interesting. Another idea is to travel when fewer people usually go, like during the spring or autumn, instead of the busy summer months. Also, tourists can help by supporting local businesses and being polite to local people, which helps make travel more sustainable and enjoyable for everyone.
