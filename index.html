            <h1>US July Price Increase Rate Stays at 2.7%, Core Inflation Reaches 5-Month High</h1>
            <p>(Washington, August 12, Central News Agency) Data from the US Department of Labor today showed that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) went up by 2.7% in July compared to last year. This was lower than what experts expected. But, as new taxes by US President Trump start to affect the economy, the core CPI reached its highest point in five months.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the US Department of Labor announced today that the CPI in July increased by 2.7% compared to the same time last year, which is the same as in June. People are starting to doubt how true this data is. Officials from the Federal Reserve (Fed) are looking at how Trump's new taxes this year have caused changes.</p>
            <p>Experts paid close attention to this CPI report. They wanted to see if the US economy was slowing down after the government's job report in July showed that the main job market was weak.</p>
            <p>The 2.7% increase in US CPI in July was a little lower than the 2.8% that analysts surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal had predicted.</p>
            <p>In July, the prices for energy and gasoline went down, but the price for housing went up.</p>
            <p>Also, if we take out the changing prices of food and energy, the core CPI increased by 0.3% in July, which is faster than the 0.2% in June. Trump's new taxes made prices of imported goods higher, while grocery prices went down.</p>
            <p>Compared to last year, core inflation went up by 3.1%, which is also a larger increase than before.</p>
            <p>According to the CPI report, prices that went up in July include healthcare, airplane tickets, and home improvements.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that high inflation makes things difficult for the Federal Reserve. After Trump announced new taxes in April, job growth in the US slowed down a lot in spring. The stop in new jobs has made financial markets think the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that if inflation keeps getting worse, the Federal Reserve might wait and see. This has made Trump unhappy, as he does not care about the Federal Reserve's independence and wants them to lower interest rates.</p>

            <h1>North Koreans Who Escaped Send Money to Family, But It's Against the Law, Causing Debate About Laws and Helping People</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, August 12, Central News Agency) A study shows that about 40% of North Koreans who escaped to South Korea have sent money to their families still in North Korea in the last five years. They used people called brokers to do this. But for the last two years, South Korean police have started to check this very strictly. This has caused arguments about balancing laws and helping people.</p>
            <p>The North Korea Human Rights Database (NKDB) asked 362 adult North Korean defectors between October 7 and November 6, 2024. 40.6% of them said they had sent money to their families in North Korea in the last five years. Most of them (76.2%) sent money because their families asked for it. The money sent to North Korea was mostly for daily living and medical costs.</p>
            <p>These North Koreans who escaped sent money mainly through people of Korean descent in China or other North Koreans who had also escaped and were in South Korea. For the 61 North Koreans who did this in 2024, they sent money 1 to 2 times on average that year. Each time, they sent about 3.24 million Korean Won (about 70,000 New Taiwan Dollars). However, Joo Soo-yeon, a North Korean defector who was investigated by South Korean police for being a broker, said that only about 40% of the money actually reaches the families.</p>
            <p>Joo Soo-yeon started living in South Korea in 2010. She first helped other defectors find their families in North Korea. Slowly, she became a broker. She said today at a press conference for foreign media that as the Chinese government became stricter about North Koreans escaping, more North Koreans came to South Korea. Because of this, the amount of money sent from South Korea to North Korea has clearly gone up.</p>
            <p>But in 2023, the South Korean government started to focus on investigating North Koreans sending money to North Korea. They fine people and punish them for breaking foreign exchange laws. This has started to break down the system of brokers. Joo Soo-yeon said that in the 15 months she has been investigated, about 70% of the old ways to send money have disappeared.</p>
            <p>Hwang In-hyeong, a lawyer who helps with these cases, said that current laws say only banks and registered companies can exchange money and send it. But these North Koreans have no other way. They are sending money to people in North Korea because they want to help them, not to make money. So, the law can be understood in different ways.</p>
            <p>In fact, the Supreme Court of Korea has said that if there is no profit, buying and selling foreign money or travel checks issued by other countries is not seen as money exchange business.</p>
            <p>Hwang In-hyeong argues that North Koreans should not be punished for giving money to help others. Even if brokers in North Korea or China make money or cheat people, or if the money goes to North Korean officials, it might break laws about national security. But the reason for this is not the brokers in South Korea. It is because North Korea is a closed country and its people are alone. This forces them to use the bad system of North Korean officials to get a little bit of hope for their families.</p>
            <p>It is even more ironic that because the South Korean government is catching brokers, the trusted brokers who have worked for many years are easier to find because they move larger amounts of money. This means North Koreans now only have choices that are not proven and whose trustworthiness is unknown. If this happens, it might become harder to know where the money goes, and the right to live for North Korean people might be in danger.</p>
            <p>The relationship between North and South Korea is difficult, and the UN Security Council has put limits on North Korea. This makes it hard for defectors to legally send money to their families and friends in North Korea. So, they have to take risks. In the NKDB survey, some people said they "will accept the punishment and keep sending money." This shows how helpless they feel. There is still much to discuss about how to find a balance and solution between law and helping people.</p>

            <h1>British Aircraft Carrier Docks at US Base in Japan, Deepening UK-Japan Partnership</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, August 12, Central News Agency) The newest British Navy aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, arrived today at the US military base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. This is the second time a British aircraft carrier has docked in Yokosuka, after HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2021. Before docking, British fighter jets landed on a Japanese warship for the first time. This shows that the "near alliance" between the UK and Japan is getting stronger.</p>
            <p>The Nikkei newspaper reported that the HMS Prince of Wales docked at the US Yokosuka base this morning. The HMS Dauntless, a British Navy Type 45 destroyer that is part of the aircraft carrier group, docked at the nearby Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Yokosuka base. The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force held a welcome ceremony at their base.</p>
            <p>Julia Longbottom, the British Ambassador to Japan, said at the ceremony, "We will make our cooperation stronger and hope to respond quickly to different problems." She also said that a Norwegian Navy ship came with the British aircraft carrier group. "This shows that cooperation among many countries in the Indo-Pacific region is becoming more important."</p>
            <p>After leaving Yokosuka, the HMS Prince of Wales will dock at the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal (in Koto Ward, Tokyo). It is expected to leave Japan on September 2.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the relationship between Japan's Self-Defense Forces and the British military has become stronger. In the 2010s, they signed an "Information Protection Agreement" to share secret information. After that, they signed an "Agreement on the Reciprocal Provision of Supplies and Services" (ACSA) to share military supplies like fuel. In 2023, the "Reciprocal Access Agreement" (RAA), a defense and security agreement for shared military training and actions between the UK and Japan, came into effect.</p>
            <p>The UK and Japan are making their defense cooperation stronger mainly because Japan and Europe have similar security problems. One reason for this is Russia's invasion of Ukraine. North Korea gives military help to Russia, and Russia helps North Korea with military technology in return. Also, Japan and Europe both face problems like China's growing military and too much steel production.</p>
            <p>For Japan, among European countries, the UK was the first to start defense cooperation with Japan. A new generation of fighter jets, expected to be used in 2035, will be developed together by Japan, the UK, and Italy. These three countries hope to have long-term security cooperation through the development and use of these fighter jets.</p>
            <p>The report said that this visit by the British aircraft carrier group to Japan is part of a plan to make UK-Japan cooperation stronger. Before docking, the British military participated in joint training with the Japan Self-Defense Forces in the Western Pacific. An F-35B stealth fighter jet landed on the Japanese warship "Kaga."</p>
            <p>The Kaga has a deck where F-35B stealth fighter jets can land and take off. This means it can act like an aircraft carrier, which helps improve Japan's ability to defend its islands.</p>
            <p>Before this, US fighter jets had landed on the Kaga. This is the first time a British fighter jet has landed on the Kaga. The British military showed videos of the training on their social media platform X. They specifically wanted to show people around the world that the cooperation between the UK and Japanese forces has become like a "near alliance."</p>
            <p>The Japan Self-Defense Forces are also strengthening ties with other European militaries apart from the UK military. The number of joint training exercises announced by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force shows that they trained with European NATO member countries 18 times in 2024, and 10 times in 2023.</p>
            <p>Before, Japan mainly did joint training with its ally the US or other Asian countries. Joint training with European countries was only with countries like France that have land in the Pacific.</p>
            <p>In 2024, besides France, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force trained with the navies of the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. This year, joint training with European countries has become even more common. In May, a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer sailed with British and Italian ships in the South China Sea for joint exercises.</p>
            <p>The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force is also sending more ships to Europe. In August 2024, a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force training ship sailed to the Mediterranean Sea and trained with ships from Canada, Turkey, and Romania, which are part of a permanent NATO force.</p>
