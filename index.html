        <h2>Trump: US and China are "Getting Along Well"</h2>
        <p>US President Donald Trump today said that some hostile actions by Beijing are not a big deal. He said, "that's how the world works." This included his thoughts on two Chinese citizens who were caught trying to smuggle dangerous germs into the US last month.</p>
        <p>Trump told Fox News that Washington also does similar things. He said, "Don't you think we do the same? We do, we do a lot of good things... This is how the world works. This world is tricky." Trump said this when asked about China stealing ideas, hacking US phone systems, and problems with the COVID-19 virus.</p>
        <p>Trump also spoke about the ongoing trade disagreements between the US and China. He seemed happy with the situation, saying, "We are getting along well with China." He added, "I think it's very good to get along well with China, but they are paying a lot of money in tariffs."</p>

        <h2>Trump: Deadline for Reciprocal Tariffs Will Not Be Extended</h2>
        <p>US President Donald Trump said today that the 90-day pause for reciprocal tariffs will not be extended past July 9. Trump explained that after this deadline, unless countries have a special agreement with the United States, Washington will start applying extra taxes on their goods.</p>
        <p>He said that letters about these new tariffs will be sent "very soon." Trump also mentioned that the US will decide the tariff amount based on how countries treat the US. Some countries might face high tariffs, like 25%, 35%, or even 50%.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Trump had played down the July 9 deadline. He noted that it's hard to make agreements with every single country in the world. He said talks are still happening, but it's not possible to talk with all 200 countries.</p>

        <h2>US Media: NBA Player Malik Beasley Investigated for Gambling Scandal, Pistons Contract Talks Stop</h2>
        <p>ESPN, a sports channel, reported today that Malik Beasley, a basketball player for the Detroit Pistons, is being investigated by federal lawyers. This is because he is suspected of betting on NBA games and special parts of games (called 'prop bets').</p>
        <p>The accusations are about things that happened when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023-24 season. Beasley's lawyer, Steve Haney, told ESPN that being investigated doesn't mean he has been charged with a crime. He added that Beasley is innocent until proven guilty, and so far, he has not been charged.</p>
        <p>Beasley is 28 years old and has played in the NBA for nine seasons. He was going to sign a new contract with the Pistons for three years and 42 million US dollars. However, because of the investigation, these contract talks have now stopped.</p>
