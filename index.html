            <h1>Cheng Li-wen Becomes KMT Chairperson; DPP Offers Two Hopes and One Warning</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) party has a new leader. Former lawmaker Cheng Li-wen won the election for KMT chairperson today. Later in the evening, Wu Zheng, a spokesperson for the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that the DPP has "two hopes and one warning" for the new KMT chairperson. The DPP hopes the KMT will discuss political issues in a sensible way and put the country's needs before their party's. They also hope the KMT will work together to face challenges to Taiwan's safety.</p>
            <p>In a press release tonight, Wu Zheng explained the two hopes. First, the DPP hopes the new KMT chairperson will strongly support Taiwan's independence and protect Taiwan's safety more than their party's interests. Second, the DPP hopes the KMT will act reasonably and actively in parliament. They should not block things because of strong beliefs. Also, they should not suggest laws that would harm Taiwan or go against the constitution.</p>
            <p>For the warning, Wu Zheng said that during the KMT chairperson election, it was clear that China tried to get involved and influence it. He reminded the new KMT chairperson and all party members to be very careful. He said that when it comes to national safety, there is no room for error, and no unclear areas. Both parties should work together to make the country safer and stop China from trying to influence Taiwan. He also said that the KMT should not help China's plan to change how people think, just for their own party's benefit.</p>

            <h1>Trump's Asia Trip: CNN Reports Staff Are Thinking About a Meeting with Kim Jong Un</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. - CNN reported today that President Trump's team is privately talking about whether he might meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia. This information comes from people who know about the discussions.</p>
            <p>Reuters also shared this report, saying that U.S. officials have not yet started to plan the details or contacted North Korea directly. Earlier this year, efforts by the U.S. to get things going did not work because North Korea reportedly refused to accept letters from Trump to Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>After meeting with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House in August, Trump openly said he was interested in meeting the North Korean leader. Reuters could not immediately check CNN's report, and the White House has not yet commented.</p>
            <p>Regarding Trump's trip to Asia, CNN said that as trade problems between the U.S. and China are growing, the White House is focusing more on arranging his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>However, Trump has always said, both in public and private, that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un. U.S. officials have also been open to the idea of Trump meeting the North Korean leader during his Asia trip. During Trump's first time in office, officials arranged for the two leaders to shake hands in the Korean Demilitarized Zone less than 48 hours after Trump sent an invitation on Twitter. This shows that things can change very quickly.</p>
            <p>North Korean state media also reported that last month, Kim Jong Un spoke at North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. He also said he was open to meeting Trump. At that time, he said, "Personally, I have good memories of U.S. President Trump. If the U.S. can let go of its empty desire for no nuclear weapons and is willing to work for peace with North Korea, based on understanding the real situation, then we have no reason not to sit down and talk with the U.S."</p>

            <h1>Rakuten Monkeys Win First Game in Taiwan Series; Wei Neng-di to Start Game 2 Against CTBC Brothers' Li Bo-deng</h1>
            <p>Taipei - The Rakuten Monkeys baseball team won the first game of the championship series today. Their coach, Kubo Kenshi, said that the fans in the left outfield were even louder than the home team's fans, and he was very thankful for them. Tomorrow, the Monkeys will have Wei Neng-di start as pitcher against Li Bo-deng, a foreign pitcher for the CTBC Brothers.</p>
            <p>The Rakuten Monkeys beat the CTBC Brothers 3-0 in the first game of the championship series today, getting an important first win. Kubo Kenshi said, "Our players have been playing through the challenge series, so they might be a little tired. But no one said anything; everyone tried their best on the field. Our coaching team was also there to help the players."</p>
            <p>Kubo Kenshi also thanked the Monkeys fans who cheered loudly in the visitors' section in the left outfield today. He said, "From the start of practice, I saw our Rakuten fans filling up from the first level to the top. Their cheering today was as loud as the home team's fans. I am very thankful they came to cheer for us."</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, the Monkeys will have their ace pitcher, Wei Neng-di (Pedro Fernandez), start against the Brothers' pitcher, Li Bo-deng (Brandon Leibrandt). This season, Wei Neng-di was the best pitcher for wins and strikeouts in the CPBL, with 15 wins and 168 strikeouts, and an ERA of 2.01. Li Bo-deng started 14 games this season, winning 7 and losing 3, with an ERA of 1.94.</p>
            <p>In today's game, the Monkeys scored after Lin Li stole a base in the first inning and Lin Zi-wei stole a base in the third inning. Kubo Kenshi said that these two stolen bases were sometimes planned and sometimes the players decided to do them themselves. He added, "Both players who stole bases were very brave. Making those decisions was key to scoring today."</p>
            <p>Also, in the fourth inning, after Chen Chen-wei hit a single, he ran to second base when the left fielder Zeng Song-en and second baseman Yue Dong-hua were not paying attention. Kubo Kenshi pointed out that Chen Chen-wei saw what the other team's left fielder (Zeng Song-en) was doing and also thought about his throwing strength. "He found where the other team made a mistake and successfully moved to the next base. It was a very good run."</p>
