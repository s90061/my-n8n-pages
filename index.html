            <p>John Wall, a basketball star from the NBA, announced his retirement today on social media. In the past, Wall was one of the fastest point guards in the whole league. He was chosen for the All-Star team five times.</p>
            <p>Wall posted a video on his Instagram page to say he was retiring. In the video, he said, "Every jersey I wore meant more than just wins and stats. It stood for a deeper meaning."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Today, I will leave the court, but I will not leave basketball. Basketball will always be a part of my life. New chances are coming, and I feel now is the right time to confidently move to the next part of my life."</p>
            <p>Wall will turn 35 next month. He played for the Washington Wizards, Houston Rockets, and Los Angeles Clippers. Later in his career, he had many problems with knee injuries. He has not played since the 2022-2023 season.</p>
            <p>Wall was called "Wall-Star." He was chosen for the All-Star team five times during his career. In his 11 seasons in the NBA, he played in 647 games. On average, he scored 18.7 points, gave 8.9 assists, got 4.2 rebounds, and made 1.6 steals per game.</p>

            <h1>Expert: If Ukraine Loses Donbas Defense, It Could Be Like Czechoslovakia Losing Sudetenland in 1938</h1>
            <p>It is said that Russia wants Ukraine to give up Donbas as one way to end the war. A Czech expert says that if Ukraine loses its important defenses in Donbas, Russia will be able to attack Ukraine's open land even more. This would be like when Czechoslovakia lost the Sudetenland in 1938 and was then taken over by the Nazis.</p>
            <p>After talks between the leaders of the US and Russia, it was reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Ukraine giving up Donbas as one condition to end the war.</p>
            <p>Zde켿ka Petr치코, an expert from the University of Defense in Brno, told the Czech News Agency (캛TK) today, "Let's not talk about money for a moment. Even though Donbas is an industrial area with coal and oil, what is more important for Ukraine is that this area creates a key line of defense."</p>
            <p>This defense line means the military structures that Ukraine built in important parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This line was slowly built after the conflict started in 2014 between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian groups who wanted to separate. It was made much stronger after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 to stop the Russian army from moving west.</p>
            <p>This defense line covers Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the north. The middle part includes the area around Lyman, and the southern part is near Pokrovsk.</p>
            <p>Petr치코 said that this defense line is very important for Ukraine's protection. "If Ukraine loses this defense line, the land will become completely unprotected against another Russian attack, and new defense points cannot be built."</p>
            <p>Petr치코 compared this situation to Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement in 1938. At that time, because Czechoslovakia lost its border defenses in the Sudetenland, Nazi Germany could easily take over the entire country.</p>
            <p>In the current international talks, one topic being discussed is how to ensure Ukraine's safety. Petr치코 said that these safety guarantees are not clearly defined yet. They only say that they should be strong. "But in reality, Russia is stronger on the battlefield. So, if we talk about safety guarantees, they must be in a way that Russia can also accept."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyj, representatives from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Finland, along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, met at the White House on August 18th. They talked about how to end the war, which has lasted more than three years. The result of the meeting was that Zelenskyj and Putin will be set up to meet.</p>
