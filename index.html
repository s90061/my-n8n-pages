            <h1>Germany Beats Finland, Goes to EuroBasket Final with Schroder's 26 Points and 12 Assists</h1>
            <p>Germany showed its strength and experience today. They won against Finland 98-86. This means they are the first team to reach the EuroBasket championship game.</p>
            <p>This is the first time Germany has reached the EuroBasket final since 2005. They are trying to win their second championship after their first win in 1993.</p>
            <p>Dennis Schroder, an NBA player for the Sacramento Kings and a point guard for world champion Germany, scored 26 points and made 12 assists. He led his team and stopped Finland's surprise journey to the championship. Schroder made 4 three-point shots and all 10 free throws.</p>
            <p>Another NBA player for Germany, Franz Wagner, a forward for the Orlando Magic, scored 22 points. In the second quarter, he made two three-point shots in a row. This helped Germany get a big lead of 49-30, which was their biggest lead in the whole game.</p>
            <p>For Finland, Olivier Nkamhoua played best with 22 points. Lauri Markkanen, a forward for the Jazz, scored 16 points. In the late part of the third quarter, Finland got closer, with only a 6-point difference. Even though Finland tried hard to catch up, they could not stop Germany from moving forward.</p>
            <p>Germany will play against Greece or Turkey in the championship game. The game between Greece and Turkey will happen later today.</p>

            <h1>Suspect Arrested in Shooting of U.S. Conservative Influencer Kirk, Bullets Had Anti-Fascist Slogans</h1>
            <p>Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and friend of U.S. President Trump, was recently shot and killed at an event in Utah. Today, authorities confirmed that they have arrested a suspect. They also revealed that the bullets used in the crime had anti-fascist messages on them.</p>
            <p>Kirk, who was 31 years old, died after being shot in the neck while speaking at Utah Valley University in Utah. A video from the event shows him talking to a crowd. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and he fell into his chair. The camera quickly moved away, and the people listening became very scared.</p>
            <p>Kirk was an important friend of Donald Trump. He was also a famous internet personality and a leader in the youth conservative movement. He had millions of followers on social media. People liked him because he edited videos smartly, and he was good at responding to people who tried to interrupt him or who had different ideas.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, U.S. authorities said today that after Kirk was shot, they found two unused bullets. These bullets had anti-fascist messages written on their cases.</p>
            <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox said in a press conference that one bullet case said, "Hey, fascist! Take this!" The other one had "Bella Ciao" written on it. This seems to be a reference to "Bella Ciao," an Italian anti-fascist song from World War II.</p>
            <p>Cox also said that authorities have arrested Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Kirk's shooting. On the evening of September 11, one of Robinson's family members contacted a family friend. This friend then told the Washington County Sheriff's Office that Robinson had told them, or suggested, that he was involved in the crime.</p>
            <p>He also said that Robinson's family told investigators that Robinson had become "more political" in recent years. The family member remembered that during a dinner, Robinson had talked about Kirk coming to Utah Valley University and why he did not like Kirk or his ideas.</p>
            <p>Robinson reportedly told his family that he thought "Kirk was full of hate and spread hate."</p>
