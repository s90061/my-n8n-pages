From July this year, McDonald's in Taiwan will start using paper wraps and bags for some popular items like Big Macs, Filet-O-Fish, Chicken McNuggets, and Apple Pies. This change is to reduce trash and be better for the environment. The new paper wraps will not have a plastic layer inside. Instead, they will use natural starch or silicon materials.

McDonald's has been testing this new packaging for a while. They hope to save about 10,000 trees and use 86 tons less plastic each year. This is a big step for the company to be more environmentally friendly.

Also, more than 200 McDonald's restaurants now offer reusable cups for people who eat inside. Other fast-food chains like KFC and Burger King also have similar ways to reduce plastic waste, showing a trend towards more sustainable practices in the industry.

**Three Taiwan Scenic Spots Get Green Tourism Award**

Taiwan is proud to announce that three of its beautiful places â€“ Sun Moon Lake, Penghu, and the North Coast and Guanyin Mountain â€“ have received the "Green Destinations Awards" this year. This award means these places are good at protecting nature and supporting local communities.

To get this award, the scenic areas had to work for two to three years. They had to follow 84 rules about being green and sustainable. Experts from other countries then checked their efforts. The awards are given in four levels: Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze.

Sun Moon Lake received the Silver award again, showing they continue to work on being green. Penghu got the Silver award for the first time, making it the first island in Taiwan to get this special award. The North Coast and Guanyin Mountain received the Bronze award. Taiwan plans to continue making its tourist spots more sustainable and friendly to the environment and local people.

**Shein May Secretly Apply to List on Hong Kong Stock Exchange**

Shein, a fast-fashion company from China, has reportedly applied to be listed on the stock exchange in Hong Kong in secret last week. The company is waiting for approval from Chinese government officials. Some reports say Shein is doing this to put pressure on officials in the UK to let them list their shares in London.

Shein tried to list in London 18 months ago, but it has not been approved yet. This is because there are some problems between Chinese and British regulators. If the UK officials say yes, London is still Shein's first choice because it has many different kinds of investors from around the world.

A secret application means the company can keep its money information private for longer. It also helps them finish the official checks without telling everything to the public right away.
