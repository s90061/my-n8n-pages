            <h1>UK Foreign Secretary: China is a Security Threat, Including Bullying Abroad and Spying</h1>
            <p>British lawyers recently said that a case against two men accused of spying for China would be stopped. This is because the government had not officially called China a national security threat. Today, the UK Foreign Secretary, Yvette Cooper, said that China does pose a security threat to the UK.</p>
            <p>The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported that the UK Labour Party won the election last July. But after they took power, they did not call China a threat. This is because the Labour government's foreign office promised to work with Beijing on things like health and becoming carbon neutral.</p>
            <p>Yvette Cooper said on BBC Radio 4 that she wants to be clear. "We know that China is a threat to the UK's national security. This includes stopping people from speaking freely in other countries, spying, and bad online actions. We have said this before."</p>
            <p>She also said, "Of course, they are also trading partners. They are important partners for dealing with big issues like climate change. But I am very sad about this case because I really wanted to see a trial happen."</p>
            <p>Christopher Cash, 30, who used to be the director of the China Research Group in the UK Parliament, and Christopher Berry, 33, a teacher, were first arrested in March 2023. In April last year, they were accused of giving secret political information to Chinese spies. But both men said they were not guilty.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that British lawyers had charged these two men under the Official Secrets Act. This law says it is a crime to give any documents to an "enemy country" if those documents could help that country.</p>
            <p>But last month, British lawyers suddenly stopped the charges against the two men. This was only a few weeks before they were supposed to go to trial.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on October 6th that the previous government's policy was to call China a "challenge of our time." They never clearly called China an enemy country.</p>
            <p>The Conservative Party, which was in power until last year, and other opposition parties said that Starmer's Labour government purposefully stopped the trial. They did this to avoid making China angry.</p>
            <p>On October 7th, British lawyers said they had "done everything they could" to take the case to court. But in the end, the case could not go forward because the government refused to call China an enemy country.</p>

            <h1>Taishin Shin Kong Financial Group Asks Public and Government to Work Together to Keep Nvidia</h1>
            <p>Nvidia chose the T17 and T18 areas in Taipei's Beitou-Shilin Technology Park to build its Taiwan headquarters. However, Shin Kong Life Insurance already has the right to use this land. Lin Wei-chun, the general manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings, said today that he hopes all parties will not talk through the media. He asked the public and the Taipei City Government to sit down together and work to solve problems so that Nvidia stays. This is very important for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Nvidia plans to put its Taiwan headquarters at the T17 and T18 sites in the Beitou-Shilin Technology Park. The Taipei City Government hopes to agree with Shin Kong Life Insurance to end their contract. Then, they want to give the land use rights to Nvidia. If not, when Shin Kong and Taishin Life Insurance companies combine in the future, they still will not agree to change or end the contract.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Government said that Shin Kong Life Insurance asked for NT$14 billion to end the contract. But Wei Bao-sheng, the chairman of Shin Kong Life Insurance, said today that this number is not correct. He also said Shin Kong Life Insurance has never purposefully delayed starting construction. He hopes to work with the Taipei City Government based on the original contract agreements.</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun, the general manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings, spoke to the media tonight at the 2025 Taipei 101 National Day event. He said that Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings "strongly supports" Nvidia setting up its Taiwan headquarters. He hopes that all involved parties will not talk through the media. The most important thing now is for the public and the Taipei City Government to sit down and work together to keep Nvidia in Taiwan. He said, "This is a very important matter for Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun added that the Taipei City Government is worried about giving unfair advantages. Shin Kong Life Insurance is also worried about going against trust. To deal with these problems, he asked the central government to talk and help. They should make clear the laws and responsibilities. They should work together to keep Nvidia. Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holdings will not make negative comments or feel bad about the situation.</p>
            <p>Lin Wei-chun stressed that he hopes the public and the government work as partners for the good of Taiwan. They should try to solve the problems and "keep Nvidia here."</p>

            <h1>Japan's LDP-Komeito Alliance Ends; Yuichiro Tamaki: I am Ready to Be Prime Minister</h1>
            <p>Today, Japan's ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, officially announced they are separating. This causes a big change for the upcoming election to choose a new Prime Minister. Yuichiro Tamaki, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party for the People, wrote on social media platform X. He said he would vote for himself in the election for Prime Minister. He also said twice, "I am ready to be the Prime Minister of Japan." This statement quickly became a popular topic.</p>
            <p>The LDP and Komeito have ruled together for over 20 years, except for a short time when the Democratic Party was in power (from 2009 to 2012). But today, this long-term government has ended. Since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he would resign on September 7th, Japanese politics has been very unstable for more than a month.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the LDP and Komeito held talks between their party leaders to discuss working together. However, they disagreed strongly on the issue of political donations. Tetsuo Saito, the leader of Komeito, officially told Sanae Takaichi, the head of the LDP, that Komeito would leave the ruling alliance. This means the LDP-Komeito partnership, which lasted for 26 years, is officially over. This was a big surprise in Japanese politics.</p>
            <p>Regarding the election for Prime Minister, Jun Azumi, the secretary-general of the Constitutional Democratic Party, had suggested a plan for opposition parties to work together. He said that the candidate "does not have to be limited to Yoshihiko Noda, the leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party." He also said that Yuichiro Tamaki could be a possible candidate for Prime Minister supported by the opposition parties.</p>
            <p>After the news that the LDP and Komeito were ending their partnership, Yuichiro Tamaki immediately posted on X. He said, "I am determined to be the Prime Minister of Japan. Because of this, if we form a government in the future, the partner parties must agree with us on important policies, especially national security."</p>
            <p>He also asked the Constitutional Democratic Party to clearly state their position. He said, "The Constitutional Democratic Party has listed me as one of the candidates for Prime Minister, and I feel this is a big responsibility. So, I hope the Constitutional Democratic Party will talk within their party and make a clear decision on long-standing unclear policy issues. These include their past views on the 'Peace and Security Legislation' (which they saw as against the constitution), their basic understanding of security, and whether they accept nuclear power. I want them to act in line with the Democratic Party for the People's policies."</p>
            <p>Tamaki stressed that being in power means taking responsibility for everything that happens in the country. He said one cannot talk about fighting rising prices but ignore security policies, especially since US President Donald Trump will visit Japan at the end of this month. He repeated, "I am determined to be the Prime Minister. Because of this, I ask that we must agree on the basic policies for how the country is run. We cannot be unclear about this."</p>
            <p>The election for Japan's Prime Minister takes place in full meetings of both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The person who gets more than half of the votes becomes Prime Minister. If no one gets more than half, the top two candidates have a second vote, and the one with more votes wins. If the results are different in the two houses, the decision of the House of Representatives is final.</p>
            <p>Looking at the current number of seats in the House of Representatives, the LDP has 196 seats. They still need 37 more seats to reach more than half (233 seats). Even with Komeito's 24 seats in the past, they were still 13 seats short. Now that Komeito has left the ruling group, the gap is even bigger. On the other hand, the largest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party, has 148 seats, which is 48 fewer than the LDP. If they join with the Japan Innovation Party (35 seats) and the Democratic Party for the People (27 seats), they would have a total of 210 seats, more than the LDP.</p>
            <p>Tetsuo Saito stated that even though they are leaving the ruling group, they will not be against the LDP because they want to continue good policies. They will decide whether to support budget plans, laws, and policies based on what they contain. However, if Komeito disagrees with the LDP on certain issues, the four parties (Constitutional Democratic Party, Japan Innovation Party, Democratic Party for the People, and Komeito) could work together. They would have 234 seats, which is just enough to get more than half.</p>
            <p>Tetsuo Saito revealed today that in the election for Prime Minister, he will not write Sanae Takaichi's name. Instead, he will vote for himself.</p>
            <p>Yuichiro Tamaki spoke live on X tonight. He said that after the LDP-Komeito alliance broke up, even if there is a second round of voting, the LDP alone will only have 196 votes. This makes the situation more difficult.</p>
            <p>Tamaki then said, "Some people asked if the Democratic Party for the People would join the ruling alliance. But this idea was based on the thought that 'if we join the LDP-Komeito alliance, we could get more than half of the votes in parliament'."</p>
            <p>He said, "Now that the LDP is ruling alone and has lost Komeito, even if the Democratic Party for the People joins, they cannot get more than half. So, the question of 'whether the Democratic Party for the People joins the government' has a completely different meaning now." This shows that working with the LDP, which has lost Komeito, is now much less important.</p>
