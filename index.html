            <h1>Fear of situation in Madagascar, Air France announces flight suspension</h1>
            <p>Air France announced today that it has stopped all flights to Madagascar. This is because there might be a military takeover in the country. The flights are stopped from today until at least October 14.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Air France said in a statement, "Because of the safety situation there, Air France has stopped all flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. This stop is expected to last until October 13, 2025."</p>
            <p>Today, the President's office in Madagascar said that someone is trying to take power illegally and by force in the country. They did not give more details. Yesterday, some soldiers joined the protests that Generation Z started in September.</p>
            <p>These protests started because of a lack of water and electricity. They were inspired by similar movements by young people in Kenya and Nepal. Later, the protests became stronger. People in Madagascar are asking President Andry Rajoelina to leave his job. They also want him to say sorry for using violence against protesters. They are also asking to close the Senate and the election committee.</p>
            <p>According to the United Nations, at least 22 people have died and 100 people have been hurt since the protests began in September. The government in Madagascar does not agree with these numbers. President Rajoelina said this month that 12 people have died.</p>

            <h1>Research: China's rare earth control temporarily no impact in short term; observe negotiations before implementation</h1>
            <p>TrendForce, a research company, said today that China's control over rare earth exports will not affect things much in the short term. This is because companies that make raw materials and computer chips have enough rare earth materials saved up. The company also said that we need to watch if there are more talks or changes before the new rules start. This will show how it affects the export of semiconductors that use rare earth products.</p>
            <p>On October 9, China announced that it will control the export of rare earth materials and technologies. At the same time, US President Trump said that from November, he will add a new 100% tax on goods coming from China.</p>
            <p>TrendForce pointed out that China's control on rare earth exports might affect how semiconductors are made. The new rules will start on December 1. These rules do not stop exports directly. Instead, companies need to ask for a special permit to export. Also, advanced computer chips smaller than 14 nanometers will be checked one by one.</p>
            <p>TrendForce said that there is still a chance to talk and change the rules. Also, rare earths are raw materials. They need many steps to be made into other materials like targets or mixed materials for making semiconductors. Companies that make raw materials and computer chips have these materials already. So, the company thinks there will be no big problems in the short time. We still need to watch if there are more talks or changes before the rules start. This will show how it affects the export of semiconductors that use rare earth products.</p>

            <h1>Semiconductor subsidiary frozen by Netherlands, China's Wingtech: diplomatic solution launched</h1>
            <p>Tonight, Wingtech Technology, a Chinese semiconductor company, made a statement. This was after the Netherlands froze its control over Nexperia, its Dutch subsidiary, for one year. Wingtech said that the Dutch government stopped Nexperia's global business because of "baseless national security" reasons. The company said it will not give in to outside political pressure. It has started all legal and diplomatic ways to ask the Dutch government to remove this "wrong order" right away.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology's statement also said that "some foreign managers" at Nexperia are trying to change who owns the company using legal methods. Wingtech said that what these managers want is "strongly linked to the Dutch government's order."</p>
            <p>Jiemian News reported that Wingtech Technology said in its statement tonight that the Dutch government stopped Nexperia's global business. They did this because of "baseless national security" reasons. Wingtech called this "too much interference based on political bias," not on real risks. This action goes strongly against the rules of market economy, fair competition, and international trade that the European Union always supports.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology also said in its statement that "some foreign managers" at Nexperia are trying to change who owns the company using legal methods. Wingtech said that what these managers want is "strongly linked to the Dutch government's order." Wingtech believes this is truly "taking away shareholders' rights and changing the company's legal management structure by using political pressure." The company strongly criticizes these actions, which it calls "taking power under the name of following rules."</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology said that it will never give in to outside political pressure. It has started all legal and diplomatic ways. It asks the Dutch government to remove the "wrong order" right away. It also asks the government to stop treating Chinese companies unfairly all the time. Wingtech wants to keep the global semiconductor industry open and working together.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology announced today that on September 30, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy gave an "Order" to Nexperia. This order tells Nexperia and all its 30 companies around the world (including subsidiaries, branches, and offices) not to change their assets, intellectual property, business, or staff. This order is for one year.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in the Netherlands also made a decision. It ruled that Wingtech Technology temporarily loses its power over Nexperia's 99 shares, keeping only 1 share. This means Wingtech temporarily loses control over Nexperia, including rights like managing and voting. Some reports say that Zhang Xue-zheng, the CEO of Nexperia, also had his job and powers stopped. However, Wingtech's right to earn money from Nexperia is not affected.</p>
            <p>Chinese financial news mentioned what people in the industry think. They believe the Netherlands did this because it is worried about semiconductor technology being taken out of the country. Nexperia is a very important company for making semiconductors for cars. Its technology is used in important areas of public services. In 2022, the UK also asked Wingtech Technology to give up its shares in a technology company it bought. The reason was national security.</p>
