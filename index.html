China's Water Ministry announced on July 1st that from July to August, the country will likely see "more floods in the north and dry weather in the south." They expect heavy floods in northern areas, with some places having strong rain and floods many times. Strong typhoons might also hit the north, making the risk of disasters high.

At the same time, areas in the middle and lower parts of the Yangtze River, like Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, and the Qiantang River and Min River, might experience dry periods. The Yellow River, Huai River, Hai River, and Liao River in the north could have floods.

The ministry expects 4 to 5 typhoons to land in or greatly affect China during this time. They are preparing for these weather changes to keep people safe.

**Quad Meeting in Washington Aims to Counter China**

In Washington, the United States Secretary of State hosted foreign ministers from Australia, India, and Japan on July 1st. These four countries, known as the Quad, are working together to deal with China's growing power.

Even though there are some disagreements about trade between the US and the other three countries, they are worried about China's increasing influence. The meeting focused on working together to make the Indo-Pacific region free and open.

The Quad members discussed how to protect their independence, make the seas safer, and build strong supply chains that can handle problems. This meeting shows how important the Indo-Pacific area is to these countries.

**President Lai's Speech on Unity; Opposition Party Responds**

Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te gave his fourth speech in a series called "Uniting the Nation" on July 1st. This speech was about national defense.

The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) quickly responded to the President's speech. They said that most of the defense budget items that were put on hold by the parliament have now been approved, except for one submarine project that is still being tested. The TPP stated that the President was wrong to say that the opposition parties are not supporting national defense or cutting the budget.

The TPP emphasized that supporting the military is important for everyone in Taiwan. However, they also believe that the government should spend money wisely. They said that putting a budget on hold is a way to ask government departments to review their plans and make sure taxpayer money is used well.
