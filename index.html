            <h1>Thailand's Foreign Minister Visits Malaysia to Discuss Easing Tensions Between Thailand and Cambodia</h1>
            <p>Thailand's Prime Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said that Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow will go to Malaysia today. He will attend a meeting led by Malaysia. The goal of this meeting is to reduce problems at the border between Thailand and Cambodia.</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Post reported that Anutin said Thailand is happy about Malaysia's efforts to bring peace. However, Thailand will stick to its four conditions before making any lasting agreement with Cambodia.</p>
            <p>These four conditions are: Cambodia must take away its heavy weapons, clear landmines from the border, stop scams that cross the border, and move Cambodian people who are living on Thai land.</p>
            <p>For many years, Thailand and Cambodia have argued over who owns land in several areas without clear borders. In July, these land arguments led to fighting at the border, and at least 48 people died. Malaysia helped the two countries, and they agreed to stop fighting on July 28. But small fights still happen sometimes.</p>
            <p>Also, on July 9, Sihasak said that Thailand will look into how to hold a public vote. This vote would be about whether to cancel two agreements signed with Cambodia about border lines. Anutin said they would wait for the parliament's study results first.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Thai army is still removing landmines near the border with Cambodia. The Nation newspaper reported that the Thai army said yesterday they found three dangerous PMN-1 landmines in a border village in Sa Kaeo province.</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Post had reported earlier that this landmine clearing work is mainly to make Cambodian people who are living illegally on Thai land leave.</p>
            <p>The Burapha Task Force of the Thai army reported that these landmines are old but can still cause harm. Experts have removed them following normal safety rules.</p>
            <p>The Thai army said these landmines were left from past fights. Cambodian authorities had stopped Thai soldiers from entering some border areas before, so they could not clear all of them. After checking, they confirmed these landmines came from Cambodia. The Thai army also said that finding these landmines shows how important it is for Thailand and Cambodia to work together to clear landmines quickly.</p>

            <h1>Many Pastors and Members of China's Zion Church Arrested, About 30 Taken Away</h1>
            <p>About 30 pastors and church members of China's Zion Church have been taken by the police since October 9. This is part of many arrests. Fu Xiqiu, who started and leads China Aid Association, said this is the biggest, most organized, and harshest crackdown on independent house churches in cities since the 1980s.</p>
            <p>According to China Aid News, since October 9, Chinese authorities have raided many unregistered churches. This includes Zion Church in at least nine provinces and cities like Beijing, Sichuan, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan, and Fujian. Over 30 pastors, preachers, and Christian leaders have been taken. They are now all held in Beihai, Guangxi.</p>
            <p>Early on October 10, the police suddenly searched the home of Pastor Jin Mingri, the head pastor of Beijing Zion Church. People who know about the situation said the police focused on questioning three pastors: Jin Mingri, Wang Lin, and Yin Huibin. They tried to find proof in their daily work and church activities to start a case. The crimes they are accused of include " illegally using computer networks," "illegal business operations," and "fraud."</p>
            <p>The report quoted experts who said that the authorities want to avoid using any crimes directly related to religion. Instead, they use laws like "illegal business operations." This makes church activities seem less religious. This way, they can make their crackdown on house churches seem legal and official. This also helps them avoid being watched by other countries about religious freedom.</p>
            <p>Since October 9, Zion Church has released statements for three days in a row. They are asking the Chinese government to stop arresting, threatening, and bothering their church and other house churches across the country right away. They also ask for all arrested and missing pastors and followers to be set free without conditions. They want the government to protect the basic right of citizens to believe in their religion as the law says.</p>
            <p>The report said Zion Church started in 2007. It is an unregistered house church. It has an impact in over 40 cities in China, and more than 5,000 people attend its Sunday services. In 2019, its main church in Beijing was forced to close. Pastor Jin Mingri was put on a "border control" list, which meant he could not leave the country to see his family. Starting in early 2025, branches of Zion Church in many cities across the country have been investigated, and people have been called in for questioning.</p>
            <p>Fu Xiqiu said in a statement on October 11 that this new round of arrests across the country reminds him of the dark times after the Cultural Revolution over 40 years ago, when city churches first started again. But today's persecution is much stricter. It uses digital monitoring, help from different provinces, and accusations like "fraud" to put peaceful church members in jail for crimes.</p>
            <p>The China Aid Association strongly criticizes this. They ask the US government, allied countries, and international groups to speak out immediately. They want them to protest to China at the highest level of diplomacy.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of National Defense: Navy Soldier Shared Secrets with China; Damage Controlled and New Security System Built</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of National Defense said that a soldier from the Hai Feng Brigade took secret photos and gave them to China. The Ministry said that they found out about this case in July 2023 when another soldier reported it. They quickly solved the problem. They also acted to control the damage from the leaked information. This included changing, altering, or stopping plans to make the impact less. At the same time, they made a new system to check if all staff are allowed to see secret information. This will make their overall security stronger.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the Ministry of National Defense released a press release. It talked about news reports that "a Hai Feng Brigade soldier took secret photos and gave them to Chinese agents." The Political Warfare Bureau received a report from a soldier in July 2023. A person named Lin was trying to trick soldiers into giving away military secrets. The Bureau told the National Security Bureau to work with the Investigation Bureau to look into it. They also asked the Taichung Branch of the High Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. Together, they found this illegal spy group.</p>
            <p>Also, for the leaked information, the Ministry of National Defense has taken proper steps to control the damage. They changed, modified, or ended plans to make the effect less harmful.</p>
            <p>About China's attempts to spy, the Ministry of National Defense said they have created a system to check the security of all staff who deal with secrets. They have also made rules for checking the safety of military personnel who handle secrets. This is based on their important roles or how secret the information they see is. This helps them manage the current safety situation of their staff carefully.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense said that China's attempts to spy on Taiwan have not stopped. They said that a few soldiers were tempted by money and betrayed the country. These soldiers should get the strongest punishment. The Ministry of National Defense will continue to teach soldiers about security. They will help soldiers be more aware of security and love their country more. They will also work closely with the national security team to make the country's overall security stronger.</p>
