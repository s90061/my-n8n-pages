            <h1>German Chancellor Says US Will Help Ukraine's Safety and Suggests Talks in Europe</h1>
            <p>Today, German Chancellor Merz said that the United States is ready to help make sure Ukraine stays safe. He also said that American President Trump's idea of a meeting between the US, Russia, and Ukraine could happen in Europe. The goal of this meeting would be to find a way to make peace.</p>
            <p>News reports said that President Trump had talked with Merz and other European leaders. This call was about Trump's meeting with Russian President Putin, which happened the day before in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Merz later told a German TV channel that it was good news. He said the US is ready to be part of these safety plans for Ukraine. This means Europe will not have to do it alone.</p>
            <p>Merz added that Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is expected to meet with Trump in Washington on August 18. After that, Merz believes a three-way meeting with Putin, Trump, and Zelenskyy should happen soon to work towards a peace deal.</p>
            <p>He said that if they succeed, it would be more valuable than just a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>Merz mentioned that the "date and place are not decided yet." He said, "We have suggested that a place in Europe could be found."</p>
            <p>At the same time, leaders from eight countries in Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea region made a public statement today. They said they strongly support Ukraine. They also support President Trump's efforts to use talking to end Russia's attack.</p>
            <p>In their statement, leaders from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said that to have peace between Russia and Ukraine, there needs to be a stop to fighting and safety for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The statement read: "We are happy to hear President Trump say that the US is ready to help with safety guarantees. There should be no limits on Ukraine's armed forces or on how Ukraine's military works with other countries."</p>

            <p>According to news from the Kremlin, Putin spoke with important officials in Moscow. This was the day after the meeting between the US and Russia. Putin said that the talks with the US were "at the right time" and "very helpful."</p>
            <p>Putin mentioned, "For a long time, we haven't had such direct talks at this level." He also said, "We had the chance to calmly and clearly say our position again in detail."</p>
            <p>Putin stated, "This discussion was very open and specific. I believe it brought us closer to making the necessary decisions."</p>

            <h1>Boy Saved in Mountain Accident, Grandfather and Friend Die</h1>
            <p>Today, a mountain accident happened on Kalakoluan Mountain in Hsinyi Township, Nantou County. A 70-year-old man and a 63-year-old female hiker were rescued and brought down the mountain. However, they showed no signs of life when they arrived at the hospital, and they died after doctors tried to save them. An 8-year-old boy who was with them had symptoms of feeling very cold (hypothermia). But he was in stable condition and is now in the hospital getting care.</p>
            <p>At noon today, the Nantou County Fire Department received a call. The 8-year-old boy, his grandfather, and another female hiker started their trip from Hualien County on August 8. They planned to climb the Southern Three Sections of the mountains. They expected to come down on August 17 at Dongpu, which is in Hsinyi Township, Nantou County. During their trip, a typhoon hit, and they were very cold for a long time. It is thought that they lost their strength because of this. The fire department believed the people were in great danger and the place was far away, so they immediately asked for a helicopter to help.</p>
            <p>The National Airborne Service Corps sent a helicopter. It arrived at Kalakoluan Mountain in the afternoon. The helicopter landed and helped the old man, the female hiker, and the boy get off the mountain. Then, an ambulance took them to the hospital. But the old man and the female hiker had no signs of life before they reached the hospital, and they passed away even after rescue efforts. The boy had hypothermia, but his condition was stable. The police are still looking into what exactly happened during the accident.</p>
            <p>The Fire Agency wants to remind everyone that weather in the mountains can change very quickly. It is very important to get ready fully before you go. They suggest that people should think about how strong they are and not try to climb routes that are too difficult for them. They also advise carrying devices that use satellites to talk to others. This can help you quickly share your location in an emergency, which saves important time for rescue teams.</p>
