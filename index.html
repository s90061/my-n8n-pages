            <h1>Exploration Team Reaches Matai'an Stream Landslide Dam Area After 5 Days; Dam's Stability Still Insufficient</h1>
            <p>Monitoring information from the Hualien Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency shows that since the Matai'an Stream landslide dam burst, the water level has dropped by 118 meters. The water stored in the lake has not changed much. However, the dam itself is still not stable enough. The exploration team arrived at the lake area this afternoon.</p>
            <p>On September 30th, the Hualien Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency sent an exploration team. They walked uphill to find a route to the Matai'an Stream landslide dam. Huang Qunce, the branch director, said the nine-person team included experienced forest rangers, members from the Eastern Search and Rescue Committee of the Taiwan Mountain Rescue Association, and mountain guides.</p>
            <p>Huang Qunce explained that there is no clear path to the Matai'an Stream landslide dam, and the land is rough. The main goal this time was to find a route to go up the mountain. They used the Eastern Search and Rescue team's knowledge of ropes to help the exploration team get there safely.</p>
            <p>Huang Qunce stated that the team expects to finish their mission and come down the mountain in 11 days. Today is the fifth day, and they have successfully reached the lake area. However, the phone signal in the mountains is poor. They only know that there is a lot of dust in the lake area. The full situation will be reported when the team returns from the mountain.</p>
            <p>The Hualien Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency reported that drone photos taken today show the Matai'an Stream landslide dam's water level is 1020 meters high. The lake covers an area of 12.6 hectares and holds 5.9 million tons of water. Since the dam broke, the water level has gone down by 118 meters. The amount of water is now about 6.4% of its original volume. The lake itself has not changed much.</p>
            <p>The Hualien Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency also said that the natural dam and the water flow seem normal, and water is flowing out steadily from the overflow opening. However, considering that the slopes on both sides of the overflow channel are still eroding and are unstable, and water continues to flow into the lake, as well as the unsettled situation of sand and soil downstream, a red alert is still in place.</p>

            <h1>Chen Chi-yu's Appeal Rejected; Remanded for Third Time in Taiyen Green Energy Solar Power Scandal</h1>
            <p>The Tainan District Court decided on September 26th to keep Chen Chi-yu, former chairman of Taiyen Green Energy, and two other people in custody for another two months. This is the third time they have been held. Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang, former general manager of Taiyen Green Energy, appealed this decision. Today, the Tainan Branch of the High Court rejected their appeal.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang are accused of breaking the Securities Exchange Act. They appealed the Tainan District Court's decision to keep them in custody for a third time. Today, the Tainan Branch of the High Court rejected their appeal, and this decision cannot be appealed again.</p>
            <p>The Tainan Branch of the High Court believes that Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang might still try to run away or avoid punishment. Also, not all witnesses have been questioned completely, and Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang have some influence over them. This could lead to them working with others or destroying evidence, which would risk a wrong judgment. Additionally, to avoid or lessen their punishment, Chen Chi-yu and Su Kun-huang might still try to work with other suspects or witnesses or destroy evidence.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Prosecutor's Office is investigating the Taiyen Green Energy solar power scandal. On February 27th, they charged five people, including Chen Chi-yu. Because Chen Chi-yu denied what he did, the prosecutors asked for a 12-year prison sentence for him and a 10-year sentence for Su Kun-huang. For Guo, the former vice general manager of Taiyen Green Energy, Su Chun-jen, and Dai, the person in charge of Chaoyang Development Company and Weicheng Development Company, the prosecutors asked for suitable punishments.</p>
            <p>After the case was moved to the court, the Tainan District Court decided on February 28th to hold Chen Chi-yu, Su Kun-huang, and Su Chun-jen without visits or communication. Guo, the former vice general manager of Taiyen Green Energy, and Dai, the person in charge of Chaoyang Development Company and Weicheng Development Company, were released on bail of NT$3 million each. They were also told where they must live, and they could not leave the country or go to sea. They also had to wear electronic monitoring devices.</p>
            <p>Chen Chi-yu and two others asked to be released on bail. On September 22nd, the Tainan District Court decided to let them out on bail from NT$4 million to NT$6 million. They also had to stay in a specific place, could not leave the country or go to sea, and had to wear electronic monitoring devices. Chen Chi-yu and the others completed the bail process on September 24th. However, the Tainan Prosecutor's Office immediately appealed this decision. On September 25th, the Tainan Branch of the High Court cancelled the original decision and sent the case back to the Tainan District Court. The Tainan District Court then decided to keep them in custody for another two months, from September 28th to November 27th, and banned visits and communication.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei City Councilors Visit Singapore to Learn About Smart Cities and Transformation</h1>
            <p>Several New Taipei City Councilors visited Singapore as a group. During their visit, they went to many companies and talked with people. Weng Chen-chou, one of the councilors, said that through these discussions, they learned a lot about how Singapore uses new technology to build smart cities. He hopes to bring this knowledge back to New Taipei City to help it grow and change.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City Councilors Cho Kuan-ting, Weng Chen-chou, Lee Yu-hsiang, Chang Chin-hao, and Chen Po-wei, who is an honorary advisor to the Legislative Yuan, visited Singapore this week. They visited several companies, including Microsoft Singapore's office, SJ Surbana Jurong Group, UOB Bank, and SMRT Singapore Metro.</p>
            <p>Weng Chen-chou told the Central News Agency that through their talks, they understood deeply how Singapore uses new technology to create smart cities. He hopes to bring this experience back to New Taipei City to help the city grow and change.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting said that "smart city" is a common goal for many cities in Taiwan. However, making it really happen is a big challenge. He learned a lot from this visit, and it helped him understand more about how to use AI in government policies and management.</p>
            <p>Also, the 2025 Formula 1 Singapore Grand Prix is happening from October 3rd to 5th. Drivers from different teams are competing on the Marina Bay Street Circuit. There are also many concerts and other events happening, which bring fans from all over the world.</p>
            <p>Weng Chen-chou shared that Kaohsiung is Taiwan's most successful example of "concert economy" recently. Both Singapore and Kaohsiung have used big international events and large concerts to boost tourism and local spending. He hopes to learn from Singapore's success to help New Taipei City create its own concert economy, making local businesses better and the economy stronger.</p>
            <p>Speaking about cooperation between Taiwan and Singapore, he pointed out that both places are very similar in many ways. For example, their economies depend a lot on trade, and they both have limited natural resources. Also, both have smart people and good technology, which gives them a good chance to develop high-tech industries.</p>
            <p>Weng Chen-chou said he believes that by working more closely in AI industries and education, both sides can together create a good example of a "small country with great wisdom" in technology.</p>
