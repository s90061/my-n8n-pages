            <h1>Putin Criticizes US for Pressuring Brazil Over Ukraine War, Claims Interference in Internal Politics</h1>
            <p>Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin openly criticized the United States government. He said that the US is using the war in Ukraine to put unfair trade taxes on Brazil. He believes that the real reason for these actions is not about world politics, but about political fights inside Brazil.</p>
            <p>According to CNN Brazil news, Putin attended an event in China to remember 80 years since the end of World War II. At a press conference, he said that the trade between Brazil and the US is fair. He disagreed with the US saying that trade is not equal as a reason for high taxes.</p>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump signed a law to put a 50% tax on Brazil. This law did not clearly mention the Ukraine war. But in recent years, Brazil has bought much more oil and fertilizer from Russia. It has become one of the main buyers of Russian oil. Numbers from Brazil's Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Services show that Brazil bought diesel from Russia worth $16.9 million in 2021. This amount grew to $5.3 billion in 2024, which is more than 300 times higher.</p>
            <p>Lourival Sant'Anna, an international analyst for CNN, said that the US might put trade restrictions on Brazil's Russian oil imports as early as next week. Something similar happened to India. The US raised taxes from 25% to 50% because India worked with Russia.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the US is not truly acting because of the war between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, he believes the US is using the war as an excuse to get involved in Brazil's internal politics. He pointed out that Brazil has political problems right now, especially the disagreement between the current government and former President Jair Bolsonaro. He said this has nothing to do with Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Trump sent a letter to Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. In the letter, he called Bolsonaro's trial a "witch hunt." He also said that Brazil was not respecting American citizens' freedom of speech and fair elections. The US government also used the "Magnitsky Act" to punish a judge from Brazil's Supreme Court, Alexandre Moraes. They said he used unfair censorship, held people without reason, and had political trials.</p>
            <p>Because the US is putting high taxes on Brazil due to the war, the Brazilian government has started a process to get back at them. Brazil also wants to work with BRICS countries to change the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is to protect its own power and fair trade rules. Even though businesses are worried that these actions might make trade problems worse, the Brazilian government still believes in talking and following the law.</p>

            <h1>Former AIT Military Officer Discusses Taiwan's Defense Strategy: Local Units Should Have More Power to Decide and Act</h1>
            <p>Modern wars happen very fast, and if you wait too long, it can be dangerous. Marvin Park, a former military officer at AIT, said that Taiwan's military is very centralized. This means soldiers at the front line must wait for orders from higher up before they act, which makes them too slow. He suggests that Taiwan could learn from the US military's "shoot and scoot" idea. This means giving lower-level soldiers the power to make their own decisions and act. He believes that only by continuously shooting and moving can soldiers stay safe.</p>
            <p>From 2023 to 2024, Marvin Park worked as the Director for Taiwan Affairs at the White House National Security Council. Before that, from 2016 to 2019, he was a naval officer at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). Yesterday, he spoke with CNA about military cooperation between the US and Taiwan and ideas for Taiwan's defense.</p>
            <p>Park said, "If you stay in the same place, you will not survive. This is because China has satellites, airplanes, and drones. They will find you and attack you." He also suggested that Taiwan's military should change how it trains and its culture. It should trust that soldiers at the front and lower levels can make good decisions.</p>
            <p>He specifically talked about the US military's idea of "shoot and scoot" for its lowest-ranking soldiers. He stressed how important it is to have "decentralized command and control" and to first get the mission details.</p>
            <p>He said, "Soldiers must shoot, then move. Then they need to check the situation again, shoot again, move again, and hide to stay alive. They should not wait for a general or commander to give permission before acting."</p>
            <p>Regarding mission details, Park explained that Taiwan has bought large weapons like anti-ship cruise missiles in recent years. Besides working with mobile missile launchers and radar units, the youngest officers on the battlefield must be able to make decisions on their own after getting the mission details.</p>
            <p>The mission details could be: after firing an attack, if a Chinese warship is seen on the computer, soldiers should fire immediately. Then they should quickly take apart their equipment and move to a different place. This will make the weapons work best and stop the enemy from attacking them back. It will also help them stay alive.</p>
            <p>However, he pointed out, "But your military is not trained that way."</p>
            <p>Besides quick reactions, Park also reminded Taiwan that it needs to make its ability to fight for a long time stronger. He said Taiwan is different from Ukraine. Ukraine can get supplies from its neighbor, Poland. But Taiwan is surrounded by the sea.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Strait might be full of sea mines, submarines, and different blockades. So, Taiwan must be able to provide for itself on the island to continue fighting. He said that making advanced missiles takes too long and is too hard. Taiwan should instead make many drones, bullets, and cannons. It also needs to build a full supply system to keep fighting and buy time.</p>
            <p>He said, "But if you just wait, hope, and pray for the American navy or air force to send supplies, then the win or loss depends on political luck. Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't. We cannot put our hopes there."</p>
            <p>Park served in the military for over 25 years. After he returned to the US from Taiwan in 2019, he worked as the Head of the China, Taiwan, and North Korea section at the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV). He also was a senior military advisor for the Taiwan Team at the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
            <p>Now, he is a senior vice president at "American Global Strategies," a company that advises on world politics. He is also a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Robert O'Brien, who was a White House National Security Advisor during Trump's first term, helped start "American Global Strategies."</p>

            <h1>Chinese Military Parade: US Experts Say China Wants a New World Order and Stronger Claims on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held a big military parade. Chinese leader Xi Jinping appeared on stage with the leaders of Russia and North Korea. Xi Jinping also gave a speech about the war against Japan. Today, American experts said that China wants to make its claims over Taiwan stronger. It also wants to show its military power. They said China wants to show that it is a strong supporter in a new world system, taking the place of the United States.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, Taipei time, the Chinese Communist Party held a military parade in Beijing. This parade was to celebrate the 80th anniversary of "The Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." Many new weapons were shown. Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un all appeared together on the stage.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping also gave a speech. He said that under the banner of the united front against Japan, which the Chinese Communist Party started, the Chinese people won their first complete victory against foreign invaders in modern history. He also said that China will quickly build a world-class army. This army will strongly protect the country's power, unity, and land. It will also help China become a great nation again.</p>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump said that the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea on stage together were "planning against the United States." He believed that the US helped China gain freedom in the past. Therefore, Xi Jinping's speech about the war should have mentioned the United States.</p>
            <p>Richard Bush, a former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution in Washington, explained to CNA that Xi Jinping wanted to send a few messages. These included that "China is strong and getting stronger." He also wanted to show that China is a strong support in a new world system and is "taking the place of the United States."</p>
            <p>Bonnie Glaser, who leads the Indo-Pacific program at The German Marshall Fund in Washington, also said in an interview that Xi Jinping was trying to do many things. These included sharing China's story of World War II. He wanted to show the important part China and the Soviet Union played in defeating fascism, while making the role of other Allied countries seem less important.</p>
            <p>Glaser also pointed out that China wants to achieve other goals. These include pushing for a different world order with a big plan called the "Global Governance Initiative." China also wants to make the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" seem more valid. This is to make its claims over Taiwan stronger. Finally, China wants to show its growing military power.</p>
            <p>Earlier, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, Xi Jinping first presented his idea for a "Global Governance Initiative." He said that countries should "follow international law." He also stated that China wants to work with all countries to build a fairer global governance system.</p>
            <p>Also, this year marks 80 years since World War II ended. In May, Xi Jinping wrote an article saying that "Taiwan's return to China" was a result of World War II. He used the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" to support this idea.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticized this, calling it a wrong idea that goes against the facts. They repeated that international legal papers like the 1943 "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" all confirmed that the Republic of China has power over Taiwan. At that time, the People's Republic of China did not even exist. It did not take part in the war against Japan in World War II. Therefore, it has no right to claim to be "part of the post-war order."</p>
