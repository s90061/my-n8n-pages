**China's Mohe Reaches Over 35Â°C, "Arctic Village" Guesthouses Install Air Conditioning**

Recently, a heatwave has hit many parts of China, even Mohe City in Heilongjiang, the northernmost part, where temperatures went over 35 degrees Celsius. Guesthouse owners there are now putting air conditioners in rooms because of the hot weather that has been happening more often in recent years.

According to Chinese media reports today, a guesthouse owner named Xue in Beiji Village, Mohe, said that he grew up there and remembers summers rarely getting hotter than 30 degrees Celsius. But this year, it has already been 35 degrees several times. He even heard tourists from the south, who came to Mohe to escape the heat, say it was hotter than where they live.

Another guesthouse owner, Ms. Zeng, who has run a guesthouse in Beiji Village for many years, shared that she put air conditioners in her new guesthouse earlier this year, "even if used only a few days a year." This helped her attract guests from other guesthouses without air conditioning. Both owners said that only a few homes and businesses in Mohe have air conditioning. Mr. Xue mentioned that there are only two brands of air conditioners available in Beiji Village, and installers come from Mohe City, 70 kilometers away. Mohe also had its highest temperature ever, 39.3 degrees Celsius, in 2010. Genhe in Inner Mongolia, known as "China's cold pole," also recently reached 40 degrees Celsius.

**Four Areas in Changhua Still Flooded at Noon, Puxin Residents Worry About More Floods**

A community basement on Jingkou Road in Puxin Township, Changhua County, flooded yesterday due to heavy rain. Many residents' cars and motorcycles were damaged, causing big losses. Today, residents are worried that if heavy rain continues, the flooding might happen again. The county government reported that four areas were still flooded by noon.

Yesterday morning, heavy rain in Changhua County caused drainage systems to overflow. Water flowed into a community basement on Jingkou Road in Puxin Township, reaching above waist height. This damaged some residents' cars and motorcycles. This morning, residents were busy cleaning, moving out damaged items, and clearing mud.

Some residents are worried because the water from yesterday was just pumped out, but then it rained heavily again this morning. They are concerned that water will flood their homes again, which makes them feel helpless. The Changhua County government reported that as of noon today, four areas were still flooded and being watched: Changchun Road in Shiguan Village, Shengang Township; the access road under the Zhongzhang Bridge in Quanxing Village; Lane 457, Haiyu Road in Lukang Township; and Lane 128, Sanmin Road in Shetou Village, Shetou Township. These areas have 30 centimeters of standing water, and traffic is being controlled.
