            <h1>Lin Chih-kang Brings Two Gloves to Championship Series, His Desire to Play is Stronger</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Taipei, October 18) Lin Chih-kang, a versatile player for the CTBC Brothers in Taiwan's professional baseball league, is called a "special player." Today, he brought two gloves for the championship series. Last year, he did not get a chance to play in the series. This year, his mindset is different, and he wants to play much more. He said that Yu Te-lung, another versatile player from the Rakuten Monkeys, is someone he looks up to and respects.</p>
            <p>The Brothers team is trying to win the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) Championship Series, also known as the Taiwan Series. Yesterday, they announced their 32-player roster, and Lin Chih-kang was a key player on the list. The Brothers' head coach, Keiichi Hirano, said that Lin Chih-kang is very useful because he can play almost every position on the field, and he can even be a catcher. For the team, he is a "special player."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-kang was also on the Brothers' championship series roster last year, but he did not play in any games. This year, he is back on the team for the championship series. Lin Chih-kang told a Central News Agency reporter that his feelings are very different between the two years. Last year, he just wanted to do his job well, and he was chosen because he played well. This year, he has a very strong desire to earn his place on the championship series roster.</p>
            <p>During practice yesterday, Coach Hirano also spent a lot of time guiding Lin Chih-kang. Lin Chih-kang said that he generally understands what to do at each position. The head coach also gave him technical advice, telling him how he could play even better.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-kang has played many different positions. In one game, he even brought four gloves. Today, he brought two gloves. He said that he hopes he won't need to play as a catcher. He feels both nervous and excited about the championship series. If he gets a chance to play, he will do his best to help the team.</p>
            <p>The Brothers' opponent for the championship, the Monkeys, also has a versatile player named Yu Te-lung. Lin Chih-kang openly said that Yu Te-lung is a respected player he looks up to. Yu Te-lung plays in different positions depending on the game. Lin Chih-kang believes that a player needs to be very good at adjusting their mindset and adapting to different situations. By doing what they can control well, they will get more chances to play.</p>

            <h1>National Museum of Taiwan Literature Thanks Donors for 2025; Collection Now Has Over 130,000 Items</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Jung-hsiang, Tainan, October 18) The National Museum of Taiwan Literature today honored 29 groups of people who donated literary items in 2025. These items cover 100 years, from the Japanese colonial period to today. Because of these donations, the museum's collection has grown to more than 130,000 items in the 22 years since it opened.</p>
            <p>The museum said today that in 2025, it received 27 sets of donated literary items and collected items for 2 projects to create complete collections. These items include handwritten papers, photographs, calligraphy art, oil paintings, family letters, letters from friends who are writers, and other objects related to literature. These items show how Taiwan's literature has grown and the different parts of writers' lives.</p>
            <p>The museum explained that donated items must go through a careful review process before they can be added to the collection. The collected items are also repaired and cared for using science and the newest AI technology. Furthermore, the museum is working hard to make its collection digital. It does this by creating databases, publishing books, holding exhibitions, and making digital games. These different ways help to show the collection in richer ways. The items are also available for people to ask for and use.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the museum invites scholars and artists from different fields to visit and study the items through its "Resident Researcher and Creator Program." This program helps to open new areas for research and writing.</p>
            <p>The museum stated that keeping these cultural items is the main part of a museum's work. It is also the basis for research, planning exhibitions, and many other uses in the future. The National Museum of Taiwan Literature is now 22 years old and has collected over 130,000 items related to Taiwan's literature. The museum hopes that more people will continue to donate items. This will make the national museum's collection available to everyone and become an important resource for studying Taiwan's literary history and for new creative works.</p>
