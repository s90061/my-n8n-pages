            <h1>US FCC Plans New Rules to Ban Chinese Equipment in Undersea Cables</h1>
            <p>The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said today that it plans to create new rules. These rules will stop companies from connecting undersea communication cables that have Chinese technology or equipment to the United States.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said, "Recently, we have seen threats to undersea cable systems from foreign rivals like China. So, we are acting now to protect our undersea cables from damage and attack by foreign rivals, and from online and physical dangers."</p>
            <p>For many years, the US has been worried about China's role in handling internet traffic and the possibility of spying.</p>
            <p>The US has big concerns about the security of data on over 400 undersea cables. These cables carry 99% of all international internet traffic.</p>
            <p>The FCC will also ask for ideas on how to make undersea cables safer from equipment made by foreign rivals. They want to explore more ways to protect them.</p>
            <p>Before this, two undersea fiber optic cables in the Baltic Sea were cut. This made officials start an investigation to see if someone might have cut them on purpose. In 2023, Taiwan said that two Chinese ships cut the only two internet cables for the Matsu Islands.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Good Deals Coming, Will Put Tariffs on Over 150 Countries</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump has been announcing new tariffs for more than 20 trading partners. Taiwan is not on this list. Today, he said that "some good deals will be announced," and India might be one of them. He also said that he will send tariff letters directly to over 150 other countries that have not negotiated with the US.</p>
            <p>In early April, Donald Trump started using "equal tariffs" and charged 11% to 50% tariffs on many countries. After that, he announced a 90-day break to give countries time to talk with the US. Last week, he signed an order to make this break longer until August 1st. He has also been sending tariff letters to leaders of many countries, telling them about the new tariffs that will start on August 1st.</p>
            <p>So far, Trump has announced deals with the UK, Vietnam, and Indonesia. He has also made a trade plan with China. Politico, a news group, reported yesterday that Taiwan, Switzerland, and India have not yet received Trump's tariff letters. This might mean that they are close to making a deal, and it could be announced in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump met with Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, the Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Bahrain, at the White House. He told the media that they would talk about things like trade.</p>
            <p>He also said that the US has made deals with some countries, including the deal with Indonesia announced yesterday. Another deal is coming soon, and it might be with India.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "We will announce some good deals."</p>
            <p>But he also repeated that "every tariff letter sent is a deal." He said the best deal is to just send a letter directly, telling them the tariff they will pay: "30%, 35%, 25%, 20%." Brazil even has a 50% tariff.</p>
            <p>Trump said that for the over 150 other countries that have not really talked with the US, America will send them tariff letters directly. These countries are smaller and "do not trade much with us." They will all have the same tariff rate.</p>
            <p>He said these countries are not like big countries such as China or Japan. The US is talking with China and Japan. But he thinks that for Japan, the US might still use the tariff letter.</p>
            <p>So far, Trump has sent 24 tariff letters in four groups to countries like Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Canada, Brazil, and the EU. Japan and South Korea both have 25% tariffs. Last week, Trump's letter to Indonesia first said there would be a 32% tariff on Indonesian goods going to the US. But yesterday, he announced a deal with Indonesia, saying there will be a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods coming into the US.</p>
            <p>Regarding trade talks between Taiwan and the US, Yen Hui-Hsin, a deputy trade negotiator from Taiwan's Cabinet, said on July 16 that Taiwan should at least try to get a tariff rate that is not higher than that for rivals like Japan and South Korea.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Won't Replace Powell Soon, But Doesn't Rule It Out</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that he does not plan to replace Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), right now. However, Trump also said he is not ruling out any possibilities.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that US media said today that Trump has received political support for firing Powell. He told a group of Republican lawmakers that he plans to replace Powell.</p>
            <p>A White House official told CNBC, a financial news channel, "They (the Republican lawmakers) agreed with firing him (Powell). The President suggested he would do it soon."</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump if he would replace Powell, he answered, "He has done a bad job, but no, I am not talking about that now." He also added, "I am not ruling out anything, but I think it is very unlikely."</p>
            <p>Trump mentioned that, in any case, he can replace the head of the Federal Reserve when Powell's term ends next year.</p>
