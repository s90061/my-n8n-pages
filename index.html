            <h1>Study: Air Pollution Worsens in US and Canada, Wildfires Erase Decades of Improvement</h1>
            <p>A new study released today shows that air pollution around the world is getting worse. The United States and Canada are seeing the biggest increase in pollution. This is because climate change is causing record-breaking wildfires, which are canceling out many years of hard work to make the air cleaner.</p>
            <p>The report, called the "Air Quality Life Index" (AQLI), uses information from satellites to measure tiny particles in the air since 1998. The report uses scientific methods to change these pollution levels into how many years of life people might lose.</p>
            <p>Michael Greenstone, a professor and one of the creators of AQLI, said that these tiny particles are still the biggest danger to human health on Earth. He said it is worse than smoking, bad food for children and mothers, car accidents, and HIV/AIDS. He added that in terms of harm, it is worse than anything else.</p>
            <p>The report found that Canada's terrible wildfires in 2023 caused the amount of tiny particles in the air to go up by more than 50% compared to 2022. In the United States, these particles increased by 20%.</p>
            <p>The information currently goes up to 2023. However, this problem will likely continue. Human activities are making greenhouse gases, which cause the Earth to get hotter and dryer. This leads to more wildfires in both countries. In fact, 2025 has been the second-worst wildfire season in Canada's history.</p>
            <p>Greenstone said that it was surprising to find that in some parts of the world, like Canada, the United States, and even parts of Europe, air pollution has returned like a "zombie" that people thought they had gotten rid of.</p>
            <p>The areas with the worst air pollution in the United States used to be mostly in California. But now, this is changing. The problem is moving to states that are affected by the smoke from Canadian wildfires. These states include Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio, as well as areas further south.</p>
            <p>More than half of Canadians are breathing air that has more tiny particles than the national safety limit (8.8 micrograms per cubic meter each year). This is a big change, as less than 5% of people had this problem in the five years before. The areas most affected are the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, and Alberta. The pollution levels there are similar to Bolivia and Honduras, and they cause people to live about two years less on average.</p>

            <h1>Micron Factory in Taichung Leaks Unknown White Gas, Four Workers Sent to Hospital</h1>
            <p>Today, there was an unexpected gas leak at the Micron Technology factory in Houli, Taichung. An unknown white gas escaped, and four workers felt sick and were taken to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Fire Bureau said that the white gas (which is waste gas) likely came from the factory's production process. The four workers felt sick and vomited after breathing in the gas, but they were awake and knew what was happening. Ambulances took them to the hospital.</p>
            <p>The Fire Bureau received a call about the unknown gas leak on Sanyong Road Section 4 in Houli at 3:25 PM. Seven fire trucks and 18 firefighters quickly went to help. The leak was stopped at 4:29 PM. Also, eight other people went to the hospital by themselves for check-ups.</p>

            <h1>National Disaster Prevention Day Drill: Large Tsunami Hits Yilan, National Alert on September 19</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior announced today that there will be a National Disaster Prevention Day drill. This year, the drill will imagine a very strong earthquake, with a magnitude of 8.5, happening in the Ryukyu Trench. This earthquake would then cause a big tsunami. Starting on September 17, large-scale earthquake and tsunami rescue drills will take place in Yilan County and New Taipei City. Also, a "national alert" message will be sent out at 9:21 AM on September 19.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior held a press conference today after its meeting. Deputy Minister Ma Shih-yuan said that this year's National Disaster Prevention Day focuses on "Survive a Big Earthquake, Prepare Strongly." The main drill will be in Yilan County from September 17 to 19. It will pretend that a magnitude 8.5 earthquake happened in the Ryukyu Trench, causing a tsunami. A second drill will happen at the same time on September 18 and 19 at Xinzhuang Sports Park in New Taipei City. This drill will focus on a large rescue effort after an earthquake. The goal is to check how well rescue teams can work and to make the country's ability to respond to disasters better.</p>
            <p>Ma Shih-yuan explained that the Ministry of Interior will gather rescue teams from different cities and counties. They will also work with private groups and international partners to practice rescuing people from a big earthquake and tsunami. This will use real-life situations to test how well the central government and local governments work together, and how people can help themselves and each other. This shows that everyone is serious about making society strong against disasters.</p>
            <p>Ma Shih-yuan reminded everyone that on September 19 at 9:21 AM, people will get a "national alert" message from the Central Weather Administration. When this happens, people should follow three steps to stay safe during an earthquake: "Drop, Cover, Hold On." Also, at 9:30 AM on the same day, a tsunami alert will be sent out through phone broadcast systems and air raid sirens as part of the drill. From 10:59 AM to 11:01 AM, all TV channels will automatically switch to the Public Television Service (PTS) to show disaster information. This will help people practice what to do and how to react in an emergency.</p>
            <p>Deputy Director-General Feng Chun-yi of the Fire Department said that as part of the National Disaster Prevention Day activities by the Executive Yuan, various disaster prevention drills will be held from September 1 to October 31. For example, on September 2 at 10:30 AM, the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Transportation and Communications, and the Council of Indigenous Peoples will start the National Disaster Prevention Day activities with a press conference in the main hall of Taipei Main Station.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that there will be many different activities to teach people about disaster prevention. These include "Disaster Preparedness Zones" in stores and online, an "Online Earthquake Evacuation Drill for All," and a "Disaster Prevention Knowledge Quiz." These activities will be promoted in many ways to encourage people to join in.</p>
