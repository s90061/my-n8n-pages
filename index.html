            <h1>Trump Orders 2 Nuclear Submarines After Russian Ex-President's Comments</h1>
            <p>On August 1st, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that he has ordered two nuclear submarines to be sent out. This decision comes after what he called "very provocative" statements from a high-ranking Russian official.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump posted on his social media platform, "Truth Social." He said, "Because of the very provocative words from former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev... I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be sent to the right areas, just in case these silly and inflammatory words mean more than just words."</p>
            <p>He added, "Words are very important and often lead to unexpected results. I hope this is not one of those times."</p>
            <p>Trump did not say if he meant submarines powered by nuclear energy or submarines carrying nuclear weapons. He also did not say where they would be sent. The U.S. military has not given any details.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Trump had said he would put new penalties on Russia because it keeps attacking Ukraine. Medvedev strongly criticized Trump for this on July 28th.</p>
            <p>Medvedev wrote on social media platform X that Trump was "playing an ultimatum game." He said Trump "should remember" that Russia is very strong.</p>
            <p>Medvedev said, "Every new ultimatum is a threat, a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country."</p>
            <p>Medvedev was the President of Russia from 2008 to 2012. He is now the Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council. He strongly supports the war in Ukraine started by current President Vladimir Putin.</p>

            <h1>US Envoy Visits Gaza; UN Says Over 1,000 Died Getting Aid</h1>
            <p>On August 1st, Steve Witkoff, a special envoy for U.S. President Trump in the Middle East, visited Gaza. He was there to see aid operations supported by the U.S. This makes him the first well-known U.S. official to visit Gaza since the war began.</p>
            <p>The United Nations says that the dangerous situation in Gaza is partly because of these aid operations.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Witkoff visited a place in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza. This place is run by the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," which is supported by the U.S. and Israel.</p>
            <p>The "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation" started working at the end of May. Many humanitarian groups and foreign governments have criticized it strongly. This week, a global group that watches hunger warned that a famine is spreading in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The United Nations stated that since the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation" began its work, over 1,000 people in the area have died trying to get aid. Most of them were shot by Israeli soldiers who were working near the foundation's locations.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army has said that their soldiers did shoot some Palestinians looking for aid. They also said they have told their soldiers to act better.</p>
            <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, went with Witkoff.</p>
            <p>Chapin Fay, a spokesperson for the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," said in a statement, "President Trump understands what is at risk in Gaza. His main goal is to give food to regular people, not to Hamas (a Palestinian armed group)." The statement also included photos showing Witkoff wearing a gray camouflage shirt, a bulletproof vest, and a baseball cap that said "Make America Great Again" with Trump's name on the back.</p>
            <p>Witkoff posted on social media platform X, "This trip is to give @POTUS (Trump) a clear understanding of the humanitarian situation and to help plan how to give food and medical help to the people of Gaza."</p>

            <h1>US, Russia, Japan Team of 4 Goes to Space Station; Will Practice Moon Landing</h1>
            <p>On August 1st, NASA (U.S. space agency) and SpaceX sent a team of four people to the International Space Station (ISS). This is their newest research trip to the orbiting laboratory.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, U.S. astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian astronaut Oleg Platonov from Roscosmos, went into space at 11:43 AM. They rode in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, which was on a Falcon 9 rocket. They launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
            <p>This mission, called Crew-11, is the 11th time a crew has changed at the ISS under NASA's Commercial Crew Program. This program works with private companies to continue space travel after the space shuttle era.</p>
            <p>During their six-month stay, the astronauts on the Crew-11 mission will practice what it might be like to land near the South Pole of the Moon. This is part of the U.S.-led "Artemis" program.</p>
            <p>They will use small handheld controls and different screens to see how changes in gravity affect an astronaut's ability to fly a spacecraft. This includes future moon landers.</p>
            <p>The Crew-11 mission is also bringing pomegranate seeds from Armenia. These seeds will be compared to a group of seeds on Earth to study how low gravity affects how plants grow.</p>
            <p>The International Space Station will stop being used after 2030. Its orbit will slowly get lower until it breaks apart in the atmosphere over "Point Nemo" in the remote Pacific Ocean. "Point Nemo" is often called the spacecraft graveyard.</p>
