            <h1>Zhubei Air Smells Like Burning Plastic; Environmental Agency Investigates Leak</h1>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau said tonight that many parts of Zhubei City have air that smells like burning plastic. They first checked and found it was not from open burning. It seems like an unusual smell is leaking out, and they will keep looking for the source of the pollution.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu County Environmental Protection Bureau stated in a message that they have checked different parts of Guangming 6th Road, Zhuangjing North and South Roads, Jiafeng North and South Roads, the area around the High-Speed Rail station, Dongxing Road, and Shixing Road. They have not found any likely source of the pollution.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said that by looking at the sensor results, they first thought it was not open burning. It is more likely that an unusual smell is leaking. However, because the sensors did not show clear changes over time or in different places, they cannot find the pollution source using only the sensor results. They will continue to investigate.</p>

            <h1>Fed Governor Cook Ignores Trump's Attempt to Fire Her, Says He Has No Power</h1>
            <p>Lisa Cook, a member of the U.S. Federal Reserve, today did not accept former President Donald Trump's attempt to fire her. She said that Trump does not have the legal power to interfere with a member of the independent Federal Reserve in this way.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that last week, Trump asked Cook to resign herself. Last night, he posted on his social media platform, "Truth Social," accusing Cook of lying about a mortgage agreement. He then said he was firing her, and it would start "immediately."</p>
            <p>Today, Cook's lawyer, Abbe Lowell, released a statement to Agence France-Presse. It said, "I will not resign. President Trump said he fired me 'for good reason,' but there is no good reason under the law, and he does not have the power to do so."</p>
            <p>Lowell promised that they would "take all necessary steps to stop his (Trump's) illegal actions."</p>
            <p>According to U.S. federal law, Federal Reserve officials can only be fired "for good reason." This means if they do something wrong or do not do their job well.</p>
            <p>Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court, with its conservative judges, allowed Trump to fire members of other independent government agencies. However, their decision specifically did not include the Federal Reserve.</p>
