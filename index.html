            <h1>Nine High-Ranking Chinese Military Officers Punished for Being Disloyal</h1>
            <p>(Shanghai, October 18) Next week, an important meeting of the Chinese Communist Party will happen. On October 17, China's Ministry of National Defense said that nine important military officers, including He Weidong, who is a top military leader, have been removed from the Party. Their cases have been sent to the courts.</p>
            <p>The "PLA Daily," a newspaper for the Chinese military, wrote today that these officers "lost their beliefs and were not loyal." The newspaper also said that even if someone has a high position, they cannot escape punishment.</p>
            <p>On October 17, Zhang Xiaogang, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, said that the Party decided to remove these nine people from the Party. These people include: He Weidong, a high-level member and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission; Miao Hua, an important military member and former head of a military department; He Hongjun, former second-in-command of a military department; Wang Xiubin, former second-in-command of a military command center; Lin Xiangyang, former leader of an army region; Qin Shutong, former political leader of the Army; Yuan Huazhi, former political leader of the Navy; Wang Houbin, former leader of the Rocket Force; and Wang Chunning, former leader of the Armed Police Force. Their cases, which are about possible crimes, have been sent to military courts to be looked at.</p>
            <p>The PLA Daily newspaper said that this action shows the Party's and military's strong decision to fight corruption until the end. It also makes it clear that no corrupt people will be allowed in the military. This is a big success in the fight against corruption for the Party and the military.</p>
            <p>The newspaper also said that He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, and the other nine officers broke Party rules badly. They are thought to have done very serious crimes related to their jobs. A lot of money was involved, and their actions were very bad, causing a lot of damage. These officers were important leaders in the Party and military. They forgot their first promises, lost their Party principles, lost their beliefs, and were not loyal. They seriously let down the Party and military leaders. They greatly harmed the rule that the Party controls the military and the system where the Military Commission's Chairman is in charge. They also damaged the good political feeling in the military and hurt the unity of all soldiers. This has caused big problems for the Party's work, the country's defense, the military's development, and the reputation of high-level officers.</p>
            <p>The newspaper said that corruption is the biggest danger for the Chinese Communist Party, and fighting corruption is the most complete way the Party can change itself. The fight against corruption is important for the Party's full control over the military, for what the People's Army stands for, and for the long-term peace of the Party and the country. Since 2012, the entire military and armed police have been very strict about managing the Party and the military. They have worked to improve politics like a reform movement. They have fought corruption everywhere, with no limits and no tolerance. They have been very determined and forceful, which has led to great achievements in building the military politically in this new time.</p>
            <p>The newspaper also said that the corruption problems of He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, and others are like a bad spread from previous corrupt leaders, Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou. The current fight against corruption continues the efforts to fix problems since 2012 and is making the People's Army stronger. The deep investigation into He Weidong, Miao Hua, He Hongjun, and others clearly shows that everyone is treated the same by Party rules and national laws, no matter how high their position or how much power they have. If someone is corrupt, they will not be excused. There is no special "pass" to avoid punishment, and no "untouchable" leaders.</p>

            <h1>Yang Ming Chiao Tung University High School Opens, Shows New Way for High School Education</h1>
            <p>(Hsinchu County, October 18) In August this year, National Zhubei Senior High School officially changed its name to "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Zhubei Senior High School." Today, the school held a ceremony to celebrate this change. This event was the first anniversary of the new Yang Ming Chiao Tung University High School. It was also Zhubei Senior High School's 34th birthday.</p>
            <p>Chen Ruey-rong, the principal of the new Yang Ming Chiao Tung University High School, said in his speech that changing the name is not the only thing. The school will focus on "different subjects, new ideas, and international studies." They want to create a new way of high school education in the Hsinchu area and in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chen Yong-fu, who is a Vice President at Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, said that working with the high school will be very good. He hopes the Yang Ming Chiao Tung University High School will become "the best high school connected to a university." He truly believes that this teamwork will become better and better.</p>
            <p>The Yang Ming Chiao Tung University High School said that it has already started special classes. These are a class for science and medicine that uses two languages, and a class for electrical engineering and computer science. In the future, Yang Ming Chiao Tung University will help the high school students take international AP courses. This will make international education easy to get and not too expensive for more students.</p>
            <p>The school also said that since the change in August, the sign at the school's entrance now says "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Affiliated Senior High School." The outside of the main office building, the pillars, and other parts have also been changed. The school's name is written in a special style by a calligrapher named Zhao Shixiong.</p>

            <h1>US Pressure Works; Decision on Global Shipping Carbon Fee Delayed for One Year</h1>
            <p>(London, October 17) The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a part of the United Nations, decided today to wait one more year to vote on a fee for carbon pollution from ships around the world. The United States put pressure on them, so countries could not agree on this important plan to lower carbon.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that this delay is bad news for the European Union and countries like Brazil. These countries really want to reduce carbon from shipping and want to set up a way to charge for carbon.</p>
            <p>The United States and Saudi Arabia, which are two big oil-producing countries, strongly disagreed with putting a carbon fee on shipping during the IMO meeting in London. After talking for several days, Saudi Arabia suggested today to delay the vote for one year. More than half of the countries agreed: 57 voted yes, and 49 voted no.</p>
            <p>Before this, countries like China, Greece, Cyprus, Japan, and South Korea said they supported a global carbon fee system for shipping. But today, when they voted on Saudi Arabia's idea, China voted to delay it, and some other countries chose not to vote.</p>
            <p>Even if countries agree next year, it is still not clear when the carbon fee for shipping will actually start. The IMO first thought it would begin charging fees for ship carbon in 2028.</p>
            <p>The IMO is working on a plan called the "Net-Zero Framework." It wants to lower the amount of greenhouse gases that global shipping releases. This plan will set required yearly limits on greenhouse gases for large ships. If a ship goes over the limit, it must buy special permits to make up for the extra pollution. The plan also has clear rules to help new, cleaner fuels be used and to make it less risky to invest in newer, better ships.</p>
            <p>The IMO originally planned to officially approve this plan today in London. But because Saudi Arabia's idea was accepted, the talks will be put off for one year.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, US President Trump told the countries in the IMO to say no to this plan. He also wrote online that Washington "will not accept this worldwide green trick tax, and will never follow it in any way."</p>
            <p>The Trump government wants to have a bigger role in global shipping. In the past, it has also used special taxes on goods from other countries to make other countries agree to its wishes.</p>
            <p>The IMO has 176 member countries. Its job is to keep international shipping safe and to stop pollution in the oceans. Shipping makes about 3% of the world's carbon dioxide. Now, about 90% of all trade around the world happens by sea.</p>
