            <h1>Putin Joins China Parade While Russia Attacks Ukraine from the Air</h1>
            <p>Ukraine and Poland said today that Russia launched many air attacks on Ukraine late last night. These attacks hurt at least four railway workers and made Poland quickly send out its fighter jets to protect itself.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that these air attacks happened while Russian President Vladimir Putin was in Beijing. He was there for a military parade to remember the end of World War II. Chinese President Xi Jinping warned that the world must choose between "peace and war."</p>
            <p>Ukrainian officials and news reported that alarms sounded for hours in many parts of the country. People heard explosions in nine regions, from Kyiv to Lviv and Volyn in the west.</p>
            <p>Poland, which is Ukraine's neighbor to the west and a member of NATO, sent its own and allied fighter jets into the air to stay safe.</p>
            <p>Poland's Armed Forces Command said on social media platform X, "The Russian Federation has once again attacked targets inside Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Ukraine's state railway company said on Telegram that four railway workers were hurt and had to go to the hospital because of the Russian attacks in Kirovohrad region. It also warned that dozens of train routes would be delayed because railway facilities were damaged.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's emergency services said that Russian attacks in Znamianka district of Kirovohrad region hurt five people and damaged 28 homes.</p>
            <p>Public transportation in Khmelnytskyi, a city in the west, was also "seriously stopped" because of the air attacks. Local government said there was a fire and buildings like homes were damaged.</p>
            <p>Russia did not comment on this immediately. Since Russia fully invaded Ukraine in February 2022, both sides have repeatedly said they do not attack civilians.</p>

            <h1>Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation Supports "Taiwan Online News Self-Regulation Alliance" to Show Commitment to Self-Control</h1>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation, along with 22 other news media organizations from different fields, announced today the creation of the "Taiwan Online News Self-Regulation Alliance." This alliance aims to build professional rules, a clear system for self-regulation, a platform for public complaints, and a news trust badge system. These efforts are to rebuild public trust in the media.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Television (TITV) and Alian Indigenous Radio Station (Alian Radio), which are part of the Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation (IPCF), have actively joined since the planning stage. They became founding members of the alliance, showing the indigenous media's promise to be responsible, professional, and culturally aware.</p>
            <p>On the day the alliance was formed, its self-regulation system was also announced. This system brings new energy to Taiwan's media world. First, a public complaint system will be set up. This allows the public to share their thoughts directly, making media more accountable and encouraging public involvement. Second, a self-regulation and advisory committee will be formed. This committee will include media representatives, outside experts, and community groups to help deal with disagreements and create rules. Finally, a "News Self-Regulation Trust Badge" will be used to promote a trusted system for online news.</p>
            <p>Minister of Digital Affairs, Lin Yi-ching, stated in a press release: "A democratic country needs freedom of speech, but it cannot let wrong and false information spread widely, which could harm the safety of the entire country."</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation also believes that the involvement of indigenous media (TITV, Alian Radio) is very important. For a long time, issues about indigenous people have often been ignored or reported incorrectly. Only when indigenous media speak can both cultural background and truth be kept. By joining the self-regulation alliance, they not only show their strong belief in professional media ethics but also bring diverse ideas and deep cultural understanding to Taiwan's media world as guardians of culture.</p>
            <p>The Indigenous Peoples Cultural Foundation will continue to use culture as its base. Through the power of media, it will lead the voices of indigenous groups to a wider public stage. It will also work with all its partners to protect the truth and seek fairness, bringing more trust and hope to a democratic society.</p>
