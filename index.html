            <h1>Aid Ship "Handala" Approaches Gaza, Israeli Military Says It Will Intercept</h1>
            <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition announced today that its aid ship, recently sent to the Gaza Strip, is getting close to the area. It is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. This action is against Israel's blockade.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that this aid ship is named after a famous Palestinian cartoon character, Handala. It is now only 194 kilometers from its destination. This is closer to Gaza than another ship from the same group, "Madleen," which was stopped in June.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Navy stated that they will stop the "Handala" from reaching Gaza.</p>
            <p>An Israeli military spokesperson told AFP today that the army "is carrying out legal maritime security actions in the Gaza area. They are also ready for any situation and will act according to political orders."</p>
            <p>The "Handala" carries 19 activists and 2 journalists from different countries. It started its journey from Sicily on July 13. Its goal is to break Israel's blockade on Gaza and give aid to the people there.</p>
            <p>The crew of the "Handala" posted on social media platform X that if the Israeli military stops the ship and holds the people on board, they will start a hunger strike.</p>

            <h1>Japan: US$550 Billion Investment Plan May Fund Taiwanese Chipmakers Building Factories in US</h1>
            <p>Akazawa Ryozo, Japan's Minister for Economic Revitalization, who works on trade talks with the United States, said today that a trade agreement with the US includes a US$550 billion investment plan. This money could help Taiwanese companies build factories for computer chips in the United States.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tokyo has agreed to this big investment plan for the US. It includes investments in companies, loans, and promises to pay back money. In return, Washington will lower taxes on goods coming from Japan to the US. However, the exact details of this plan are still not clear.</p>
            <p>Akazawa told NHK, "Japan, the United States, and other countries that share similar goals are working together. We want to build supply chains for industries that are very important for our economic safety."</p>
            <p>He pointed out that because of this, the money from Japan's investment plan in the US is not only for American or Japanese companies.</p>
            <p>Akazawa said, "For example, if a Taiwanese company that makes computer chips builds a factory in the United States, and it uses Japanese parts, or if its products are made specially for Japan's needs, that is also fine." But he did not name any specific Taiwanese company.</p>
            <p>Japan will make these investments through two state-owned banks: the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). Japan recently changed its laws. This change allows JBIC to give money to foreign companies that are seen as very important for Japan's supply chain.</p>
            <p>Akazawa told NHK that only about 1% to 2% of the US$550 billion investment plan will be direct investments in companies (equity investment). This means that most of the money will be given as loans and guarantees.</p>
            <p>When asked about a statement from the White House that said "the US will keep 90% of investment profits," Akazawa stressed that this number only refers to profits from the direct investments in companies. He said this is a very small part of the total money.</p>
            <p>Akazawa said that Japan originally wanted to get 50% of the investment profits. But in the whole agreement, losing some profit is a small thing compared to avoiding about 10 trillion Japanese Yen (about US$67.7 billion) in import taxes.</p>
            <p>He also said that Japan plans to start this US$550 billion investment within President Trump's current term.</p>
