            <h1>Zhang Zhaoyuan Hits Two Home Runs, Gets MVP; Hawks and Monkeys Game Ends in a Tie Due to Rain</h1>
            <p>On July 27th, the Rakuten Monkeys and TSG Hawks baseball teams played a game in Taoyuan. The game ended in a 7-7 tie after the top of the 9th inning because of rain. Hawks catcher Zhang Zhaoyuan hit two home runs in one game for the first time in his career. He also got 4 RBIs (runs batted in) and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the game.</p>
            <p>The Hawks played at the Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. In the first inning, Steven Moya hit the ball well, and the Hawks scored first. In the bottom of the first, Lin Chih-ping of the Monkeys hit the ball well to tie the game. In the bottom of the third, Chen Chen-wei of the Monkeys hit a double, and then Lin Chih-ping hit a single to score a run, making the Monkeys lead. In the top of the fourth, Zhang Zhaoyuan hit a solo home run for the Hawks, tying the game again.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Monkeys saw that the Hawks' pitchers were having problems. They got players on base with walks and hits, filling all the bases. Lin Tzu-wei got a walk with the bases full, which brought in a run to take the lead. Lin Chih-ping then hit a sacrifice fly, bringing in another run. Lin Hung-yu hit a single that scored a run, and Liang Chia-jung hit another single to score the team's sixth run.</p>
            <p>In the top of the fifth inning, the Hawks scored to catch up. Wang Po-jung hit a timely single to get one run back. Then, Zhang Zhaoyuan hit his second home run of the game, a three-run home run, which tied the score again for his team. In the top of the seventh, Tseng Yu-ching hit a single for the Hawks, putting them in the lead. In the bottom of the eighth, Liang Chia-jung hit a sacrifice fly for the Monkeys, tying the game again. After the top of the ninth inning, the game was called a tie because of rain.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhaoyuan had three hits in the game, including two home runs, and got four RBIs. He has hit three home runs in his last two games. Zhang Zhaoyuan said that his body feels good lately. He explained that yesterday, against Monkeys pitcher Chen Kuan-yu, the ball was in a good spot, and he was able to hit a home run. For the two home runs he hit in this game against pitcher Huang Tzu-peng, he had a good plan and timing, and he hit pitches that were not thrown well.</p>
            <p>When asked if he plays especially well at Taoyuan Baseball Stadium, Zhang Zhaoyuan said it might be because the LED lights there are brighter, so he can see the ball better. He also said that the Monkeys are a tough opponent, and a team cannot feel sure about winning until the game is completely over, because the Monkeys will take any small chance they get.</p>
            <p>Hawks pitcher Huang Tzu-hao started the game and gave up 4 runs in 3 innings, but he did not get a win or a loss. Zhang Zhaoyuan said that the rain made the pitcher's mound sticky, and Huang Tzu-hao's shoes kept getting stuck. Also, because there were many fans, he might have been a bit nervous, which caused his control to be a bit off. Otherwise, he is usually a pitcher with good control.

            <h1>Poland's Prime Minister Warns: China and Russia Could Be Ready for Global Conflict by 2027</h1>
            <p>(Warsaw, July 27, Central News Agency) After talking with high-ranking military leaders from NATO, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that Russia and China might be ready for a big global conflict as early as 2027. Because of this, Poland and other European countries must prepare for "all kinds of situations" that could happen in the next two years.</p>
            <p>The Kyiv Post reported that Tusk made these comments shortly after meeting with Alexus Grynkewich, a US Air Force General and the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) for NATO, in Warsaw on July 25th.</p>
            <p>Tusk visited Pabianice, a city in central Poland, yesterday. He said, "I expected to get exact information from Grynkewich, and I did get it. This means that based on all the reports from NATO and the United States, Russia and China will be ready for a global conflict as early as 2027. That is in two years."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Poland and Europe, especially Poland, must be ready for all kinds of situations that might happen in the next two years."</p>
            <p>European countries, led mainly by Poland and other NATO countries in Eastern Europe, have agreed to spend much more on their military. This is in response to the United States asking Europe to take more responsibility for its own safety.</p>
            <p>The government in Warsaw has also taken steps to help its people get ready for a possible large-scale conflict. For example, they have made military training more widely available and created guides to help people survive if there is a war.</p>
            <p>However, governments are not just worried about the risk of a traditional war starting.</p>
            <p>Since Russia fully invaded Ukraine, Poland and its neighboring countries have been targets of Russia's "hybrid warfare." This includes actions like sabotage, cyber attacks, and spreading false information. These events are often very serious but are not considered full-scale war.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the clearest example of this is the crisis at the eastern border of the European Union (EU) with Russia and its ally, Belarus. Russia and Belarus are accused of purposely making this crisis worse by sending migrants from Africa and Asia to the land borders of Poland and the Baltic countries.</p>
            <p>When Tusk spoke in Pabianice, he talked about the situation at Poland's eastern border. He said this situation is proof that Russia is preparing for a possible global conflict in 2027.</p>
            <p>Grynkewich has warned many times that 2027 could be a year of crisis, with possible conflicts involving Russia and China. He was in Warsaw on July 25th to meet with Tusk and other important government officials. (Translator: Hung Pei-ying / Editor: Chen Cheng-chien) July 27, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Banks Aim for Rich Clients, Managed Assets Reach NT$1.6 Trillion by June</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 27, Central News Agency) Banks are working hard to get business from very rich clients. Data from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) shows that by the end of June, 15 Taiwanese banks managed assets (AUM) worth NT$1,623.3 billion for clients with over NT$100 million. This was an increase of NT$60.3 billion in one month. First Commercial Bank managed NT$242.7 billion, making it the top bank in this area for nine months in a row.</p>
            <p>In August 2020, the FSC started the "Wealth Management 2.0" plan, which aims to be as good as Singapore and Hong Kong. This plan allowed banks to apply to manage money for very rich clients who have over NT$100 million. By the end of June this year, 15 banks had started offering these services. These banks include CTBC Bank, Mega Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Cathay United Bank, First Commercial Bank, Land Bank of Taiwan, UBS Taipei Branch, E.SUN Bank, Taipei Fubon Bank, Yuanta Bank, Hua Nan Bank, HSBC (Taiwan), Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan), Taishin Bank, and DBS Bank.</p>
            <p>By the end of June, the 15 Taiwanese banks managed NT$1,622.3 billion for these rich clients. In May, this amount dropped by NT$10.9 billion, but in June, it increased by NT$60.3 billion. The number of rich clients grew to 15,035 people, an increase of 609 in one month.</p>
            <p>Hou Li-yang, the deputy director-general of the FSC's Banking Bureau, looked at how these rich clients' assets were placed by the end of June. He said that most of the money was in deposits (47.4%). After that came funds (15.7%), bonds (13%), insurance (11%), and overseas structured products (6.2%).</p>
            <p>The 47.4% share for deposits is the highest this year. This is mainly because people are being careful about the market right now. Hou Li-yang noted that compared to June last year, the share of bonds and funds has gone up. This might be because people expect interest rates to keep going down, so they are buying more fixed-income products like overseas bonds to get higher interest.</p>
            <p>For the performance of wealth management for rich clients by Taiwanese banks, the top three were First Commercial Bank, CTBC Bank, and E.SUN Bank. E.SUN Bank is a new name in the top three. First Commercial Bank managed NT$242.7 billion for rich clients and has been number one for nine months. It has 2,465 rich clients. CTBC Bank managed NT$239.2 billion and has 2,299 rich clients. E.SUN Bank was third, managing NT$225.3 billion, and it has 2,586 rich clients.</p>
            <p>In addition, for the stock brokerage industry, the FSC has allowed 8 securities firms to offer services for rich clients. Since these services started in 2020, the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau announced that by the end of June, there were 1,268 rich clients. The total amount of money traded was about NT$331.5 billion, which is 59% more than the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Kao Ching-ping, the deputy director-general of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, explained that stockbrokers are actively trying to get rich clients. Also, the global stock market is doing well. This has led to a big increase in money traded through "sub-brokerage" services compared to last year. In the last year, NT$18.2 billion was used to buy and sell overseas bonds through sub-brokerage services.</p>
            <p>As for the performance of individual securities firms, the top three rankings were the same as in May: SinoPac Securities, Cathay Securities, and Mega Securities. Since they started these services until the end of June, the total money traded by each was NT$167.7 billion, NT$82.4 billion, and NT$36.5 billion, respectively. The other five securities firms together traded NT$44.9 billion. (Editor: Yang Kai-hsiang) July 27, 2025.</p>
