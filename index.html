            <h1>Trump Meets Zelenskyy: Russian Planes in NATO Airspace Should Be Shot Down</h1>
            <p>On September 23, US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met at the United Nations General Assembly. They talked about the war between Russia and Ukraine. Before the meeting, Trump told reporters that he thinks if Russian planes fly into NATO countries' airspace, they should be shot down. However, when asked if he would support NATO allies, he said "it depends."</p>
            <p>The main discussions at the UN General Assembly started today, and many leaders, including Trump, gave speeches. After his speech, Trump had several meetings, including one with Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Trump and Zelenskyy spoke briefly to reporters before their meeting and answered questions. The White House said their meeting lasted about an hour.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that he had many meetings planned for the day, and the one with Ukraine was very important. Zelenskyy thanked Trump for trying to end the war. He said he would tell Trump about the situation of Ukrainian soldiers and discuss how to end the war and ensure Ukraine's safety.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy mentioned that there was good news from the Ukrainian army recently, and he hoped to end the war with Trump's help. He also said that more pressure and sanctions were needed against Russia. He supported Trump's idea for European countries to stop buying energy from Russia.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy pointed out that he talked with the leader of Slovakia. They believed that if Slovakia had other options, it would stop buying energy from Russia.</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that since Russia fully attacked Ukraine in 2022, the 27 countries of the European Union have mostly stopped buying Russian oil. Only Hungary and Slovakia still buy Russian oil.</p>
            <p>Also, after several Russian drones flew into Polish airspace, Russian fighter jets were seen in Estonian airspace on September 19.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump if NATO countries should shoot down Russian military planes that enter their airspace, Trump said, "Yes." But when asked if the US would support or help NATO allies in this situation, he replied, "It depends."</p>
            <p>When asked about his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and if he still trusted him, Trump said, "I will tell you in about a month."</p>
            <p>When asked about the progress of the war since his last meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump said the biggest progress was that Russia's economy was now very bad, "it's falling apart." He also said Ukraine has done a very good job stopping Russia's large army.</p>
            <p>He added that it looked like the war would continue for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Woman Attacked in London Gets Earlier Interview; Police Admit Initial Response Was Poor</h1>
            <p>London, September 23 (Central News Agency) â€“ A Taiwanese woman was randomly attacked by people in London on the evening of September 20. The police did not go to the scene after receiving the report. They had also planned to take her statement five days later. Today, London police admitted that their first response was not good. They will talk with the victim and have already started taking her statement earlier than planned.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police told Central News Agency, "We understand the pain this event caused the victim. We also agree that our first response to the incident was not as good as we expect. We will talk more with her about this situation as we continue our investigation."</p>
            <p>Around the time the Central News Agency received the police statement in the evening, police arrived at Ms. Chen's home. They said they could take her statement now. Staff from the Taiwan Representative Office in the UK also quickly arrived to help. Police had first told Ms. Chen that they would not be available to take her statement until September 25.</p>
            <p>Her statement was finished around 8 PM today. Ms. Chen told Central News Agency that the police asked many detailed questions and said an officer would contact her again later.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen suggested that Taiwanese people living in the UK, if they face similar situations in the future, can report them on the Metropolitan Police's "Hate Crime" reporting platform. This might make the police respond faster.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen, a 25-year-old from Taiwan, is legally living and working in the UK with a Post-Study Work (PSW) visa. On the evening of September 20, on her way home, she was randomly attacked by four white teenage girls in central London. She was kicked and punched while on the ground. Her hair was pulled, and her head was repeatedly pushed against a wall.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen told Central News Agency today that after the police received the report, they did not come to the scene to understand what happened. Her friend, who helped report the incident, said the police seemed to think that if there was no "immediate danger to life," officers did not need to rush to the scene.</p>
            <p>The police contacted Ms. Chen almost three hours after the incident. They told her that if she wanted to give a statement, she had to make an appointment. But because many people were waiting, the police could only come to her home to take her statement on the morning of September 25 at the earliest, while she was recovering at home. Ms. Chen told Central News Agency that perhaps because of severe emotional trauma, her memory of the incident is now becoming less clear. She felt helpless that she could not tell the police what happened earlier.</p>
            <p>This morning, Central News Agency also asked the police why the victim had to wait several days to give a statement and if there had been an increase in violent attacks on ethnic minorities in Greater London recently. The police responded within an hour, saying they would look into the situation further.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police sent an email to Central News Agency this evening. They said the police are investigating an attack on a woman that happened on Saturday, September 20, on Collier Street in Islington, London. The attack "is thought to be racially motivated."</p>
            <p>The spokesperson stated that as part of the investigation, officers are keeping in touch with the victim. No one has been arrested yet. The police ask any witnesses or anyone with information to call 101 and provide case number CAD 7097/20SEP. The Metropolitan Police is committed to fighting "all forms of hate crime."</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, there have been several protests in London against illegal immigration. In mid-September, a large protest with an estimated 110,000 people took place. One of the main figures was Tommy Robinson, a leader of the far-right in the UK who has been convicted of crimes. During the event, nearly 30 police officers on duty were violently attacked.</p>
            <p>Although some people are worried that hate crimes related to race and immigration might be increasing in the UK, data from the Metropolitan Police shows that in the 12 months up to the end of August this year, the number of hate crimes in Greater London decreased by 17.4% compared to the same period last year. The number of cases that resulted in successful prosecution increased by about 5%.</p>
            <p>Police statistics show that from the summer of 2022 to the summer of 2025, a total of nearly 96,000 hate crimes happened in London over three years. The reasons for hate crimes are not only about race, but also include hatred towards religious beliefs and people with disabilities.</p>
