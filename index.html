            <h1>White House: Trump's Son-in-Law and Envoy Go to Egypt to Finalize Hostage Release Details</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 4th (CNA) â€” White House officials said that President Trumpâ€™s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and special envoy, Steve Witkoff, will travel to Egypt today.

            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, a White House official confirmed that Kushner and Witkoff are going to the Middle East. They will finish the details of the hostage release. They will also discuss the agreement that Trump is pushing to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas.</p>
            <p>After Hamas said it was willing to free all hostages and talk about the peace plan in detail, Trump asked for an immediate stop to the fighting in Gaza.</p>

            <h1>Nearly 4,000 Kilograms of Bad Pig Intestines Found in 4 Counties and Cities; Food and Drug Administration Takes 5 Actions to Stop It</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 4th (CNA) â€” Nearly 4,000 kilograms of bad pig intestines from Baowei Company in Pingtung were spread across four counties and cities in Taiwan. The Food and Drug Administration announced tonight that Taoyuan had the most, with 2,159 kilograms. Other areas included Taipei with 1,330 kilograms, Pingtung County with 180 kilograms, and Kaohsiung with 126 kilograms. The Food and Drug Administration has set up five main ways to stop this, including full tracking of the product.</p>
            <p>During the Mid-Autumn Festival, food safety was not good. The Pingtung Prosecutor's Office said in a press release that the person in charge and employees of a company in Pingtung used industrial-grade hydrogen peroxide to bleach some sick pig large intestines. Then, they sold them to other companies that did not know about it, to make illegal money.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's Food and Drug Administration gave two press releases tonight. They explained the case of "Baowei Food Co., Ltd." which is believed to have used industrial-grade hydrogen peroxide to process pig intestines. Investigators found hydrogen peroxide at the site and are still investigating. Health authorities have sealed 11,664 kilograms of pig intestines in the work area and 940 kilograms in storage.</p>
            <p>"The insides supplied by the slaughterhouse are not from sick pigs; they are safe to eat," said Wei Ren-ting, director of the Food and Drug Administration's Southern Regional Management Center. He stressed that according to staff from the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, veterinarians check pig insides on the slaughter line for sickness or problems. If they find problems and the insides are not fit for people to eat, blue coloring is put on them. Then, they are sent to be processed so they do not enter the food chain.</p>
            <p>People were worried about where the bad pig intestines went, fearing they might eat them at barbecues. Wei Ren-ting told CNA that Baowei Company's records for pig intestines only had names or short forms, and contact information for receiving goods.</p>
            <p>But from sales records, Wei Ren-ting said that a total of 3,795 kilograms went to four counties and cities. Mr. Chen from Ningxia Market in Taipei bought 1,330 kilograms, which is still being checked and confirmed. Qiu O-hui in Pingtung County sold 180 kilograms to private buyers and has no stock left. Wu O-jie in Kaohsiung City has no stock left from 126 kilograms.</p>
            <p>The company that bought the most was Dachangshun Food Co., Ltd. in Taoyuan City, which bought 2,159 kilograms. Wei Ren-ting said that the products taken off the market today were mainly this batch from Taoyuan City. By 9 PM tonight, all of them had been taken off the market. Other batches are being dealt with quickly.</p>
            <p>Wei Ren-ting pointed out that the Food and Drug Administration is also taking five big actions: full tracking, immediate removal and sealing, testing, harsh punishment for bad businesses, and more public information and education. They are asking businesses for records of what they bought and sold, and checking where the products came from. All bad products will be taken off shelves and stopped from being sold right away. Any products still in stock will be sealed to make sure they do not reach customers.</p>
            <p>Also, Wei Ren-ting stressed that health authorities have been asked to do more tests in markets, restaurants, and shops. They need to check for any industrial hydrogen peroxide left in the products. The results of these tests will be made public as soon as they are ready. Businesses involved will be sent to court under the "Food Safety and Health Management Act." The worst punishment can be up to 7 years in prison and a fine of up to 80 million New Taiwan Dollars. They will also be put on a food safety blacklist and stopped from doing business. The Food and Drug Administration will keep checking where food comes from and remind customers to buy food from legal sources.</p>
            <p>The Food and Drug Administration asks people to call the 1919 Food Safety hotline or report to local health authorities if they are worried or find any bad products.</p>

            <h1>BBC World Service Seeks New Money, Tries to Use Part of Defense Budget</h1>
            <p>London, October 4th (CNA) â€” The BBC World Service is finding it hard to get enough money because the government has cut funds for aid to other countries. Now, there are reports that the company's leaders are asking the government to use some of the defense budget for the World Service's work.</p>
            <p>The British newspaper "The Guardian" said that leaders at the BBC World Service believe some of their work is important for "national security." This includes watching media (especially media related to countries like Russia and China), fighting false information, and stopping foreign groups from controlling information.</p>
            <p>According to information from the UK Ministry of Defence, the government plans to increase the amount of money spent on defense to 2.6% of the country's total economic output (GDP) before the new financial year starts in April 2027. Currently, the UK spends about 2.3% of its GDP on defense.</p>
            <p>Also, NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) agreed at a meeting in The Hague in June this year that member countries should aim to spend 5% of their GDP on security and defense. Of this, 3.5% of GDP should be for core defense spending. The other 1.5% of GDP should be for things like building new infrastructure, making society stronger, and other security matters. The British government has said it plans to reach this goal by 2035.</p>
            <p>The 1.5% of GDP goal for NATO's security and defense spending can be understood in different ways. Leaders at the BBC World Service argue that their work is also part of national security.</p>
            <p>The government is trying to "reduce waste" and "make systems work better." Even though the BBC World Service received a little more money from the government for the 2025 to 2026 financial year, the company was still asked to "cut costs" in the first half of this year. They had to create a budget plan to save 70 million British Pounds (nearly 2.87 billion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>About one-third of the BBC World Service's budget comes from the British Foreign Office. Most of the other two-thirds comes from "licence fees" that British people pay every month to watch TV. About 80% of the money from the Foreign Office comes from the government's Official Development Assistance (ODA) for other countries.</p>
            <p>However, the British government announced this spring that it would cut its ODA spending. The amount spent will go down from 0.5% of the country's total income (GNI) to 0.3%. One reason for this change is to put more money into defense spending.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported in January that the BBC World Service might need to cut 130 jobs to save money. The report mentioned that the licence fee was "frozen" for two years, and the increase in the fee has not kept up with the rising costs of making TV shows. This is one reason why the BBC had a money problem of 492 million British Pounds in the 2024 to 2025 financial year.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Munro, the Director of the BBC World Service, recently spoke at an event during the ruling Labour Party's yearly meeting. He said he is trying to get different parts of the British government to help pay for the BBC World Service. This would help share the financial pressure.</p>
            <p>A BBC spokesperson said that the BBC World Service shows Britain's great cultural influence around the world. It also helps Britain's economy and plays an important part in keeping countries safe and stable globally. The BBC is asking the Foreign Office for money and will continue to talk with the government about the long-term future of the BBC World Service.</p>
