            <h1>Taiwan-US Tariffs: Cheng Li-Chun Confirms US-Standard Imported Cars Are Part of Negotiations</h1>
            <p>On August 25, Vice Premier Cheng Li-Chun explained that talks between Taiwan and the U.S. about tariffs include more than just taxes on American cars. They also cover non-tariff trade barriers. This means things like safety and air pollution rules for imported US-made cars are being discussed. She said that once the talks are finished, all details will be fully explained to the public and to the parliament.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament) asked Premier Cho Jung-Tai and other ministers to report on the progress, goals, and rules of the Taiwan-US tariff talks. They also asked for an assessment of how these talks might affect Taiwan's industries.</p>
            <p>Wang Ding-Yu, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party, asked about rumors that the U.S. wants Taiwan to allow US-made cars to be imported without tariffs. He said that for buyers, no tariffs on whole cars would make them cheaper. He also mentioned that the U.S. has made similar requests to Japan and South Korea. He asked if these talks would include letting cars from the U.S. come into Taiwan without import taxes.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-Chun said that the U.S. does expect Taiwan to open its markets. Taiwan will discuss this based on what is best for its industries, people's health, and food safety. She explained that for US cars, besides tariffs, there are also non-tariff barriers. Importing US-standard cars involves rules about safety and air pollution. "These are all part of the talks," she stated. After the talks are finished, all the details will be fully explained to the parliament and the public.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-Chun noted that the talks are currently in a technical discussion phase and a final meeting has not yet happened. After she returned on August 1st, there have been three video calls. The goal of the talks is to lower tariffs equally for both sides and to avoid adding new taxes. This is because 90% of Taiwan's trade deficit comes from ICT and semiconductors. These are connected to the U.S.'s 232 tariff policy, so this will also be discussed. Once a certain agreement is reached, the U.S. will arrange a final meeting.</p>
            <p>Wang Ding-Yu then asked if the final meeting is expected to be in September. Cheng Li-Chun replied that they hope it can happen as soon as possible, but it depends on both sides. She hopes they can achieve lower tax rates again. She could not discuss all the details of the talks to ensure the best possible outcome. She said, "The three video conferences have made some progress," and hopes to move to the most important final meeting soon. Discussions are still ongoing.</p>
            <p>Wang Ding-Yu also mentioned that BYD and other Chinese electric cars should not be allowed into Taiwan through Thailand as a way to avoid rules or be sold cheaply. This would not only affect the talks but also national security and information security. He said that no matter what name they use or where they come from, "Taiwan will definitely not let you sell them cheaply here."</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-Tai explained two rules: First, products made in Taiwan must meet yearly stricter local production rates. Second, Chinese products, no matter if they try to bypass rules, change their brand, or change their name, will be strictly controlled. This is to protect Taiwan's industry, economic safety, and its place in the supply chain. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Chin-Tsang emphasized that Chinese brand cars will be fully stopped from entering Taiwan, no matter where they come from.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that many businesses are still running misleading advertisements to the public. He has asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs to talk to these businesses and tell them not to make such misleading ads. Wang Ding-Yu said that those who are lobbying and doing hidden marketing should be identified so the public knows who is being paid to do these things. Cho Jung-Tai responded that they will strictly enforce this.</p>

            <h1>AI Net Zero / Dongda Tea House Low-Carbon Packaging Reform: Reaching Young Market and Continuing Century-Old Tea Aroma</h1>
            <p>Companies are now changing to digital ways of working. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and reaching "net zero" carbon emissions are two big challenges for the government and businesses. These are very important for Taiwan's future success. A team from the Central News Agency is reporting on how the government and different businesses are using AI to make production better and create new green ideas, showing Taiwan's industry moving forward again.</p>
            <p>Dongda Tea House started its first tea garden in 1903. For over 100 years, the family has passed down the business. Now, the fourth generation owner is dealing with the challenges of changing a traditional business and the need to reduce carbon emissions. She has updated the packaging to be low-carbon and made other changes. This has helped the tea house keep its old tea traditions and successfully attract younger customers. It has also helped Taiwan's tea scent reach other countries.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi, 36, grew up in a tea factory in Nantou County's Mingjian Township. She still clearly remembers her childhood. "When school was out, I would go with my family to pick and make tea. I always remember the warm sun and the smell of tea," she said. Her childhood with tea prepared her for her future. Even though she worked as a nurse for a while, she eventually came back to her family's business to take over as the fourth generation.</p>
            <p>From nurse to tea house owner: Finding a new way for a century-old tea factory.</p>
            <p>Before dawn, tea pickers are ready to go to the tea gardens to pick fresh tea leaves. After picking, the tea leaves need to dry in the sun and inside, so they lose some water. Then, they are tossed and turned in a step called "lang qing" to help them ferment. After that, they go through other steps like frying and rolling. This whole process needs careful timing, speed, and strength, and relies on people's skills and detailed work.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi worked as a nurse in a hospital for many years. When she visited home on her days off, she saw that the tea factory needed more workers and her parents were getting older. She started thinking about the future of the century-old tea factory. She said, "The tea industry is really hard work. But it's even sadder that many tea factories close because young people don't want to come back home to work."</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi's father once said directly that if his children were willing to take over, he would completely update the tea-making equipment. Otherwise, he would continue until he could no longer do it. Li Fang-Yi and her brother did not want their father's 100 years of hard work to end. They decided to come back home and take over together. Her brother focuses on making the tea, while she takes care of branding, marketing, and finding new customers.</p>
            <p>However, Li Fang-Yi quickly realized that the challenges for traditional businesses were not just about workers and keeping old customers. The most important thing was how to find new markets to keep the century-old tea tradition alive.</p>
            <p>Listening to what the market needs: Using small packages and eco-friendly tea bags to attract new generations.</p>
            <p>"You don't need a whole set of teapots and cups to make tea. Young people only need hot water to enjoy good tea," Li Fang-Yi said. She explained that just having good quality tea is not enough to get customers to buy it. Convenience and good design are also very important for new generations when they choose products.</p>
            <p>When Li Fang-Yi first took over, she actively went to trade shows but often failed. Most of the stalls looked similar, so it was hard to attract customers. People often said no, using reasons like "I just tried some" or "the package is too big." These comments became the starting point for her changes.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi saw trade shows as a battleground. She changed the traditional way of selling tea in large packages. Instead, she offered small packages and tea bags made from PLA corn fiber. This made it easier for people to buy and use the tea. It also focused on food safety and being good for the environment. These changes quickly became popular with young people, and more people started buying their tea again.</p>
            <p>Opportunity for packaging changes: Replacing metal cans with book-style boxes to reduce carbon footprint.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi said that tea is usually packaged in metal cans. But these cans can easily get dents, take up a lot of space, and their appearance is not consistent because of different sizes, colors, and stickers. Also, metal cans are hard to recycle, and customers often complained about the extra cost to deal with them.</p>
            <p>With help from the Ministry of Economic Affairs' International Trade Administration for designing low-carbon export product packaging, Dongda Tea House was inspired by the idea of storing century-old tea skills in a book. They launched a book-style box with a flip cover. The first products to get this new packaging were 12 items from the Yunding Hand-Picked, Oolong Essence, and Artisan Tea Selection series. These are special and more expensive teas. The new design combines the classic Chinese elegance that older people like with the modern, simple style that younger people prefer. This made the brand look more consistent and greatly reduced weight and carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi said that a large metal can used to weigh 112.8 grams, but the new book-style box weighs only 49.4 grams. A small metal can was 78 grams, and after changing, it became 34 grams. Each paper box can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.2341 kilograms. This improves the carbon footprint by 19%, which is like driving 1 kilometer or using a laptop for about 30 hours.</p>
            <p>In the past, vacuum-sealed tea bags were often put into plastic fruit nets inside metal cans to stop them from breaking. Because the new book-style boxes fit the vacuum bags well, Dongda stopped using the fruit nets. This saves over 20,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent each year, which is like the carbon emissions from a car driving around the Earth's equator 2.5 times.</p>
            <p>Also, Dongda stopped using laminating film and clear stickers. After taking out the product, the packaging can be recycled directly without needing to be taken apart. This makes recycling easier. They also started using art paper and eco-friendly ink, which helps them control the carbon emissions from printing.</p>
            <p>She said that flat storage reduces transport and storage costs. Shipping boxes now use eco-friendly kraft paper tape, which improves the carbon footprint by 33%. By making all carbon management better and combining good tea with low carbon, the overall quality has improved. This meets the needs of young people and has successfully brought in more customers.</p>
            <p>Finding balance between tradition and innovation: Making more people love Taiwan tea.</p>
            <p>Dongda Tea House has built its 100-year foundation on skillful work and honest business. Today, it has a system of working with tea farmers and a large-scale production line. It not only sells tea to wholesalers and retailers in Taiwan but also has places overseas, with Japan being its main export market.</p>
            <p>Li Fang-Yi said that making tea combines old ways and new ideas. For a brand to continue in today's market, it needs to constantly find a balance between the two.</p>
            <p>"What we do is not just sell tea; it's about continuing a culture, a scent," she said. She hopes that through low-carbon packaging and strategies for younger people, the scent of Taiwan tea will continue to spread. "Drinking tea should not be limited by age; it should give more people the chance to taste and then love Taiwan tea."</p>

            <h1>Strengthening Asymmetric Warfare Capability: Dongyin Area Command Establishes Drone Club</h1>
            <p>On August 25, the Dongyin Area Command announced that it has recently started a "Drone Club." This is to make their fighting power stronger in unexpected ways. It also follows the Ministry of National Defense's plan to use drones and become good at using new types of military power. The club will teach soldiers how to fly drones and train people at lower levels to use them.</p>
            <p>The Dongyin Area Command released a press statement. It said that the courses teach soldiers about how drones work, how to fly them, and how they can be used in battles. Professional instructors will explain these things and show how to check the drones and fly them. Soldiers will practice flying to learn about checking the drone's parts and how to control it. This will help them gain practical experience.</p>
            <p>Commander Feng Shao-Yi said that drones are an important new type of military power. They make it much easier to watch and gather information, and they make battlefields more clear. He said that all levels of the military should continue to offer these kinds of courses to train people to operate drones. This will add new strength to their overall defense capabilities.</p>
