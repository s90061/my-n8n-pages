(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Taoyuan, July 15) The professional baseball team Rakuten Monkeys sent pitcher Huang Zi-peng to the minor league on July 13. The head coach, Ku Kubokenji, said that Huang Zi-peng's problem seems to be his pitching control, which needs to be fixed. So, Huang Zi-peng will practice in the minor league. As for when Lin Li will come back to play, he will decide with the team's trainer.

Rakuten Monkeys pitcher Huang Zi-peng started a game on July 5. He pitched for 3.1 innings, and the other team hit 10 times, scoring 7 runs. He lost the game and was sent to the minor league on July 13.

Rakuten Monkeys head coach Ku Kubokenji spoke to reporters before today's game. He said that they had planned to send Huang Zi-peng to the minor league for practice, but they changed their minds a bit later because of some reasons. About what Huang Zi-peng needs to fix, Ku Kubokenji said he could not share all the small details, but generally, it is about his pitching control.

Rakuten Monkeys foreign pitcher Marcelo Martinez let in too many runs when he started a game on July 12. He pitched for 4.1 innings, and the other team hit 8 times, including one home run, scoring 8 runs (7 earned runs). He lost the game.

Ku Kubokenji said that maybe the time between his two starting games was too long, so he did not practice as well. It could also be because he played in Kaohsiung, where the weather is hotter, which also affected him.

Also, about player Lin Li's condition, Ku Kubokenji said that Lin Li feels a bit worse this year than last year. But he did not give a time for his return. He lets Lin Li talk with the team's trainer, and he will come back when he feels ready. (Editor: Li Shu-hua) 1140715

***Nissan Faces Problems, Plans to Close Oppama Factory in Japan by 2027***

(Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 15, comprehensive foreign reports) Nissan, the Japanese car company, said today that it will close its Oppama factory in Yokosuka City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, by the end of the 2027 financial year.

According to Agence France-Presse, Nissan lost 671 billion Japanese Yen (about 4.5 billion US dollars) last year. The company has already announced that it will cut 15% of its workers around the world. In May this year, Nissan said it would combine its 17 assembly factories worldwide into 10.

Nissan said in a statement today that it will stop making cars at the Oppama factory by the end of the 2027 financial year. It will move its production lines to another existing factory in Kyushu.

This year, talks between Nissan and Honda about working together did not happen. Nissan is now trying to make its company better and make fewer cars.

The Oppama factory started in 1961 and is one of Nissan's main factories. It can make 240,000 cars a year. But because Nissan is not selling many cars, the factory has not been used much.

Earlier this year, US President Trump put a 25% tax on Japanese cars. Among the main Japanese car companies, Nissan is thought to be most affected. Experts say this is because Nissan's customers usually care more about prices.

One possible way for Nissan to get better is to work with Foxconn, a big electronics company from Taiwan. Foxconn is known for putting together iPhones and is now getting into the car business.

Foxconn said in February that it is open to buying shares from Renault, which owns a large part of Nissan. (Intern translator: Luo Wei-jie / Editor: Chen Cheng-chien) 1140715
