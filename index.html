            <h1>Typhoon Willow Hits Taiwan; Taoyuan Airport Prepares with Tied Airbridges and Checks</h1>
            <p>Taoyuan Airport Corporation said that Typhoon Willow has arrived in Taiwan. All airport teams have started preparing for the typhoon, including tying down airbridges. Because of the typhoon, 49 passenger flights and 15 cargo flights have been canceled. Also, as of 3:19 PM, 26 flights had to land at other airports.</p>
            <p>The airport company released a statement this afternoon. It said that Typhoon Willow is here. According to their numbers, 663 flights were planned for today. However, 64 flights were canceled because of the typhoon. These include 49 passenger flights and 15 cargo flights. The airport advises travelers and people picking up passengers to check the latest flight information before leaving. They should also confirm transportation to the airport to make sure their trip goes smoothly.</p>
            <p>The airport company also said that before the typhoon warning was issued, they had already started many preparations. These included checking airport facilities like electricity, air conditioning, water systems, trains, and airbridges. They also checked construction areas, main drainage lines, and areas on the airfield more closely.</p>
            <p>The airport company stated that forecasts from the Taoyuan Aviation Weather Station showed strong crosswinds starting at 11 AM due to Typhoon Willow. Flights leaving the airport could take off without problems. But for flights arriving, some had to fly around or land at other airports for safety reasons. As of 3:19 PM, 26 flights changed their landing place because of wind shear. Also, from 11:50 AM, the viewing platforms on the 5th floor of Terminal 2 (north and south sides) were closed. There is no set time for them to open again.</p>
            <p>The airport company said that airlines will change their flight schedules as needed based on the newest weather information. They remind travelers to check their airline's notices and use the airport's official website or app to find out about flight changes. The airport company's website will also keep updating information about flight changes and transportation options for travelers and the public.</p>
            <p>This morning, the airport company held its third emergency meeting. The chairman, Yang Wei-fu, led the meeting. He heard reports on the typhoon's path and how different departments and local airlines were preparing. He told all teams to be more careful, follow typhoon safety rules, and be alert. If any problems happen, they should report them right away to keep the airport safe and protect travelers' rights.</p>

            <h1>Dong Ruey-bin: Using Technology to Fight Fraud, Hopes Telecoms Lower SMS Short Code Fees</h1>
            <p>Dong Ruey-bin, the chairman of Mega Financial Holding Co. and head of the Bankers Association, said today that financial scams are always changing. Banks are working to stop fraud by being more careful when people open accounts and helping customers in person. They also need better technology to fight fraud. For example, Mega Bank has started using a special short code for text messages to prevent fraud. However, each message costs NT$0.4, which means the yearly cost is almost ten million NT dollars. Because of this, the Bankers Association has asked the three main telecom companies to lower these costs.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance held the "2025 Financial Technology Anti-Fraud Summit." Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Kung Ming-hsin, and Dong Ruey-bin both gave speeches. They announced the start of the Bankers Association's anti-fraud contact platform and joined the "Police-Bank Cooperation 165" plan. The goal is to hold 165 anti-fraud events by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>Dong Ruey-bin said that today's financial scams are becoming more complex. They have changed from old phone scams and fake dating scams to using AI to trick people out of their money. This is a big problem for Taiwan and other countries. The Bankers Association is actively helping with the Executive Yuan's "New Generation Anti-Fraud Strategy Action Plan 2.0." They want financial institutions to act as a first line of defense against fraud. They do this by checking with customers in person and other ways to stop people from being cheated.</p>
            <p>Dong Ruey-bin admitted that people working directly with customers face a lot of pressure. It is very hard to stop any amount of money from being lost to fraud. Statistics show that in 2023, financial institutions across Taiwan stopped more than 11,000 fraud cases, saving about NT$7.6 billion. In 2024, they stopped over 13,000 cases, saving more than NT$10 billion. In the first half of 2025, they stopped about 7,600 cases, saving NT$5.9 billion.</p>
            <p>Dong Ruey-bin said that Mega Bank stopped about NT$200 to NT$300 million in the first half of this year. In one case, they stopped over NT$30 million for one person, which was very impressive.</p>
            <p>Dong Ruey-bin believes that financial companies must keep improving how they help customers in person, check new accounts, and watch bank accounts. They also need to make their anti-fraud technology better. For example, they can use computer systems to help find unusual account activities, manage risks for virtual accounts in different ways, and use text message anti-fraud systems.</p>
            <p>Currently, Mega Bank has started using a short code for its text messages to fight fraud. If people receive a text message starting with "68017", they can be sure it is from Mega Bank.</p>
            <p>Dong Ruey-bin also said that Mega Bank sends more than 20 million text messages each year. Adding the short code costs NT$0.4 per message, making the yearly cost almost NT$10 million. For banks that send even more messages, perhaps 100 million messages a year, the cost could be over NT$40 million. So, the Bankers Association has talked to the three telecom companies. They hope that for the good of society, these companies can lower the fees for short code messages.</p>
            <p>Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Kung Ming-hsin, said he hopes that the national anti-fraud team and the financial industry can work together. This way, the government and private companies can stop fraud. They will work hard to teach people about fraud, help them understand different ways financial crimes happen, and warn them about fraud traps to protect their money.</p>
            <p>Kung Ming-hsin mentioned that fraud groups are using new technologies to commit crimes. Their methods are well-organized, large-scale, and happen across different countries. So, future anti-fraud plans must change. Besides working as a team, they need to combine resources from different government departments, financial institutions, and private companies. They also need to use digital technology to create new ways to fight fraud, like using AI. This will save human effort, make their actions more accurate, and help them give warnings and stop fraud before it happens.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Willow Hits Taiwan, Causes 33 Injuries and 1 Missing Fisherman</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow landed in Taimali Township, Taitung County, this afternoon. By about 4 PM, it had moved out to sea from Cigu, Tainan. According to the Central Emergency Operation Center's numbers as of 2 PM, Typhoon Willow caused 33 injuries and one fisherman to go missing.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center held its sixth meeting about Typhoon Willow this afternoon. President Lai Ching-te came to see how government units were responding to the typhoon. Reports showed that as of 2 PM, Willow had caused 33 injuries and 1 missing person. Most injuries were in Kaohsiung City and Taitung County, with 13 people each.</p>
            <p>Regarding the missing person, the report said that a 28-year-old man named Lin and his friends were fishing at Haomei Village seawall in Budai Township, Chiayi County, around 1 PM. Lin was swept away by a wave and disappeared. This area is a warning zone announced by Chiayi County. The Coast Guard and Fire Department are still working hard to find him.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center stated that Typhoon Willow is still affecting Taiwan's land. It has a big impact on the east, south, and outlying islands. Because of the outer edges of the typhoon, areas along the eastern coast should be careful of long waves. Since it is summer holidays, people should not go to the beach to watch waves or do activities in the sea.</p>
            <p>Also, the strong rain from the typhoon will affect the eastern, southern, and central-southern mountain areas. Low-lying coastal areas and places that easily flood should be aware of short periods of heavy rain that can cause flooding. The Central Emergency Operation Center's numbers as of 2:30 PM show that 1,825 warning areas have been set up across the country. Most of these are in mountains and near rivers, especially in Hsinchu County and City, Nantou County, and Taitung County.</p>
            <p>Also, as of 2:30 PM, 102 yellow warnings for mudslides were issued, mainly in Pingtung County and Kaohsiung City, and also in Hualien County and Taitung County. Four yellow warnings for large landslides were also issued in these same four counties.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center said that as of 3 PM, the typhoon caused power outages for over 130,000 homes across the country. More than 76,000 homes have had their power fixed, but over 58,000 homes are still without power. These include homes in Taitung County, Hualien County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, Miaoli County, Taoyuan City, and Nantou County. Taitung County has the most homes without power. If the weather allows, Taiwan Power Company staff at those locations will fix the power right away.</p>
            <p>Regarding fruit and vegetable trading, the Taipei Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market traded 1,294 tons today, which is slightly less (25 tons) than yesterday. The average price per kilogram was NT$63.1, which is NT$5.9 lower than yesterday. The amount supplied today was less because buyers did not need to stock up as much, so market prices went down.</p>
            <p>The Xiluo Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market traded 504 tons today, which is 25 tons more than yesterday. The average price per kilogram was NT$71.9, a slight increase of NT$0.9 from yesterday. The amount supplied today went up because there was still high demand during the typhoon, causing prices to go up slightly. As for stored vegetables, there are currently 5,340 tons in storage. From July 18 to August 13, 1,270 tons have been released.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center reported that as of 1 PM, 64 shelters were opened in Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, Pingtung County, Hualien County, and Taitung County, taking in 905 people.</p>
