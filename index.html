Time magazine announced its 2025 list of the world's 100 most influential companies on June 26, with TSMC making the cut as the only pure-play foundry. AI chip giant NVIDIA and Samsung were not selected.

The list is divided into five categories: Innovators, Disruptors, Leaders, Titans, and Pioneers. TSMC is categorized under "Titans." Time stated that TSMC is the world's largest chip manufacturer, producing the "brains" for devices like smartphones and data centers. Thanks to the continuous surge in demand for its advanced AI chips, TSMC's first-quarter 2025 financial report exceeded analysts' expectations.

These chips have drawn TSMC into the trade dispute between the United States and mainland China. Under pressure from the White House, TSMC committed in March to investing $100 billion in US chip manufacturing facilities, bringing its total US investment to $165 billion. Overall, TSMC plans to build nine new factories in countries like Germany and Japan in 2025.

TSMC's foundry competitors, South Korea's Samsung and the US's Intel, were not on the list, nor was NVIDIA. Other companies included in the AI and semiconductor sectors were Alibaba, ASML, ByteDance, DeepSeek, Huawei, Meta, OpenAI, and Scale AI.

Notably, Pop Mart, a Chinese company known for its globally popular "Labubu" figures, was also on the list of the world's 100 most influential companies. Time reported that Pop Mart currently has 530 themed stores worldwide, and its revenue and profit in 2024 more than doubled compared to 2023.

**Han Kuo-yu Criticizes Malicious Recall as Political Struggle, Declares "Successful Large-Scale Recall, Taiwan's Democracy Will Be Empty"**

As the large-scale recall effort intensifies, Legislator Wan Mei-ling of Taoyuan held an anti-recall rally tonight. Mayor Chang San-cheng, Legislator Hsieh Lung-chieh, and Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu attended, emphasizing Wan's efforts in securing construction projects and welfare for Taoyuan, and her role in promoting beneficial legislation. They stated that this recall attempt is a malicious political struggle. Han Kuo-yu warned that "if the large-scale recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be empty," urging the public to vote "disagree" on July 26.

Han Kuo-yu jokingly referred to Chang San-cheng as the "Wudang Sect leader" and himself as the "Shaolin Sect leader" coming to support Wan Mei-ling, drawing laughter from hundreds of supporters.

Han stated that holding another election so soon after the last one is not democratic politics but political infighting, which is unreasonable. He praised Wan Mei-ling's constituent services, noting her perfect attendance at various meetings despite her busy schedule as a five-term city councilor and two-term legislator. She has secured over NT$55 billion in construction funds for the local area. He questioned if being hardworking means one should be recalled, calling it a violation of democracy.

Han also mentioned that from his position as Legislative Speaker, he is well aware of which legislators are diligent in their questioning. He expressed sadness hearing the Democratic Progressive Party repeatedly shout "large-scale recall, great success." He likened Taiwan's democracy to a wall that has been painstakingly built, and now this recall effort threatens to destroy it.

Han Kuo-yu declared that "if the large-scale recall succeeds, Taiwan's democracy will be empty," and Taiwan will no longer be able to boast about the preciousness of its democracy to the outside world. He urged everyone to vote, stating that not voting is equivalent to not supporting Wan Mei-ling.

**Medical Associations Object to Increased Medical Student Quotas; Ministry of Education: Within Total Control**

Eleven medical associations released a joint statement today expressing dissatisfaction with the Ministry of Education's plan to increase medical student quotas from the current 1,300 to nearly 1,600, warning of potential negative impacts on the healthcare system and teaching quality. The Ministry of Education clarified this evening that the adjustment of medical school admission quotas for three national universities for the 2026 academic year was made in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and does not exceed the Ministry of Education's established total quota of 1,300, meaning the number of general medical students for the 2026 academic year will still be within 1,300.

The 11 medical associations stated in their joint declaration today that the Ministry of Education's decision in June to loosen medical student admission numbers, unilaterally increasing the quotas for post-baccalaureate medical programs at Tsing Hua, NCKU, and National Sun Yat-sen Universities, has caused a backlash among frontline doctors. They strongly oppose expanding the number from 1,300 to nearly 1,600, cautioning that this move could significantly affect the overall healthcare service system and medical education quality.

However, the Ministry of Education responded tonight that since 1998, it has collaborated with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's physician workforce planning, allocating 1,300 spots annually within its authority to 11 university medical departments. The three universitiesâ€”Tsing Hua, NCKU, and National Sun Yat-senâ€”established their post-baccalaureate medical programs in line with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Physician Training Program for Key Specialties with Public Funding," offering public-funded positions. Following a review meeting in 2021, it was decided that after the public-funded program concludes, adjustments to medical student quotas could be made within the total quota, with the Ministry of Health and Welfare's consent for public-funded student admissions.

The Ministry of Education further explained that as the Ministry of Health and Welfare's public-funded program will not be extended beyond 2025, discussions were held with the Ministry of Health and Welfare and other relevant units in February of this year regarding the 2026 academic year admission quotas for the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs. After several inquiries between February and April, the Ministry of Health and Welfare replied that self-funded student quotas could be allocated to the three universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs starting from the 2026 academic year, provided that the total medical student quota of 1,300 set by the Ministry of Education is not exceeded.

Therefore, the Ministry of Education emphasized that considering the substantial resources, courses, and equipment already invested by the three universities, and the fact that students are still enrolled, along with the understanding that the source of public-funded students is not regular high school graduates, it was assessed that this adjustment would not impact existing university medical school admissions. Hence, in consensus with the Ministry of Health and Welfare, 35 self-funded positions were granted to each of the three national universities' post-baccalaureate medical programs, ensuring that the total number of general medical students for the 2026 academic year remains within the 1,300 quota.
