            <h1>Asian Stocks Mostly Rose Even With US Government Shutdown</h1>
            <p>(Hong Kong, October 1, Central News Agency) The US government officially stopped working today because the US Congress could not agree on a spending plan. At the same time, the price of gold reached a new high, Wall Street stock futures went down, and the US dollar became weaker. However, most stock markets in Asia still went up a little.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the idea that some US government services would close made people less hopeful about the US central bank possibly cutting interest rates again.</p>
            <p>Most government shutdowns usually do not affect the market much if they end quickly. But investors are still worried. Especially, the shutdown might delay the report on new jobs, which is supposed to come out on October 3. This report is very important for the US central bank when deciding interest rates.</p>
            <p>Michael Brown, a senior strategist from Pepperstone Group, an Australian financial company, said: "I still think investors should look past the political problems and focus on long-term trends. Basically, the federal budget running out will not have a big effect on the economy. An agreement will be reached in the end, the government will start again, and any delayed economic information will be released on time."</p>
            <p>Stock markets in Taipei, Singapore, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok, and Wellington closed higher today. Stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong were closed because of a holiday.</p>
            <p>Japan's Tokyo stock market closed lower, mainly because bank stocks fell. The main Nikkei index dropped 0.9%, closing at 44550.85 points. Stock markets in Sydney and Jakarta also closed lower.</p>

            <h1>National Taiwan Normal University Offers Aid to Students Helping Hualien Guangfu Rebuild</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, October 1, Central News Agency) A flood caused by a landslide lake at Mata'an River heavily damaged Guangfu Township in Hualien. National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) has started a "Warm Sun Action Subsidy Program." This program gives money for travel, living costs, and equipment. It encourages students to form volunteer teams or go alone to help with rebuilding efforts in Guangfu.</p>
            <p>NTNU released a press statement today saying that rebuilding Guangfu after the disaster needs more than just physical things; it also needs people to support and be with each other. The NTNU Student Affairs Office started the "Warm Sun Action Subsidy Program." It encourages and helps students at the university to form volunteer teams or go by themselves to Hualien. They can help in Guangfu. Through real actions, every bit of care will become power for rebuilding.</p>
            <p>NTNU also said that students helping with the Guangfu rebuilding can apply for money. For travel, they can get money for a round trip from Taipei to Hualien by Ziqiang Express train (which costs 1376 NTD). For living costs, they can get 400 NTD for food and basic needs. There is also money for equipment. Students can ask for money for necessary tools and supplies (they need to show proof of purchase and the school's tax ID number 03735202).</p>
            <p>This program also includes students who have already finished their help. Each student can apply for this help only once. The last day to apply is October 19 at midnight. They plan to accept 200 applications. NTNU also thanked a group of alumni from the 50-60 reunion for their kind donations, which helped the program start well.</p>
