            <h1>Nvidia Tells Chinese Customers That H20 Chip Supply is Limited</h1>
            <p>The Information, a US tech news website, reported today that Nvidia, a big US company that makes AI chips, has told its customers in China that there is not enough supply of H20 chips. Nvidia also does not plan to make more of these chips.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the H20 chip was the strongest AI chip Nvidia could sell to China under US rules about selling things to other countries. But after the US government stopped the sale of H20 chips in April, Nvidia had to stop taking new orders. It also canceled its orders with TSMC, the company that makes the chips for Nvidia, according to two people who know about the situation, as told to The Information.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Nvidia said they are planning to sell H20 chips to China again.</p>
