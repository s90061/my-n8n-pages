            <h1>Tainan Single Elderly Home Damaged, Volunteers Help Repair, 645 People Already Joined</h1>
            <p>Tainan (CNA) â€“ Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Tainan. The city's Social Affairs Bureau started a program to connect volunteers with people who needed help. They wanted to help clean up and repair homes after the typhoon. Today, 20 volunteers helped clean the damaged home of an elderly person living alone in the South District. The city hopes more volunteers will join.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Wei-che and Guo Nai-wen, the head of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the site in the morning. They showed care for the people affected by the disaster and thanked the volunteers who were helping clean.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang said that this typhoon greatly affected people's lives. All city government departments are working hard to repair the damage. He especially thanked volunteers from different places who came to the disaster areas to help people get back to their normal lives quickly.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang added that this typhoon made everyone feel that "we are all in this together." People from places like Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Changhua, New Taipei, and Taoyuan saw how badly Tainan was hit. Some people gave money, and others helped with rescue work. This was very touching.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang also said that the typhoon affected a very large area, and many people still need help. If people in Tainan have free time, they can contact the city government to join the group helping people clean up their homes. Also, it has been raining a lot recently, so people must be careful to prevent dengue fever or other diseases. He hopes everyone can work together to get through this difficult time.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Social Affairs Bureau shared information. After the typhoon, they started the "Tainan City Post-Disaster Volunteer Recruitment Platform." They invited many kind people to join. So far, 645 volunteers have gone to the disaster areas. They move through neighborhoods, bringing hope to people with their hands and smiles. This has become a touching sight after the typhoon.</p>

            <h1>US Nasdaq Reaches New High; Experts Say Taiwan Stock Market Should Watch US Tech Company Earnings This Week</h1>
            <p>Taipei (CNA) â€“ On July 18th, US stock markets had mixed results. The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, went up strongly and reached a new record high. However, TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) fell by 2.12%. The Taiwan stock index futures closed at 23191 points in evening trading, down by 69 points. TSMC futures also dropped slightly by 5 points, closing at 1145 points. Foreign investors' net short positions in Taiwan stock index futures went down to 48,000 contracts.</p>
            <p>Financial experts say that the strong trend in the Taiwan stock market can continue for a short time. In the short term, people should watch if market optimism in Taiwan increases and if there is a lot of trading volume. This week, the focus will be on the earnings reports of US technology companies.</p>
            <p>On July 18th, the US Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 142.30 points, or 0.32%, closing at 44342.19 points. The S&P 500 index fell slightly by 0.57 points, or 0.01%, closing at 6296.79 points. The Nasdaq index for technology stocks went up by 10.01 points, or 0.05%, closing at 20895.66 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell a little by 5.018 points, or 0.09%, closing at 5732.625 points.</p>
            <p>For the net positions in Taiwan stock index futures, the three major groups of investors (foreign and mainland Chinese investors, investment trusts, and dealers) had a total net long position that decreased by 779 contracts to 1042 contracts on July 18th. Among them, foreign investors' net short positions decreased by 4207 contracts to 48,010 contracts.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index went up by 269.85 points on July 18th, closing at 23383.13 points. The total trading value was NT$368.74 billion. The three major investor groups (foreign and mainland Chinese investors, investment trusts, and dealers) all bought more stocks, with a total purchase of NT$41.944 billion. Foreign and mainland Chinese investors bought NT$30.924 billion. Statistics show that foreign investors have bought Taiwan stocks for 4 days in a row.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhi-ling, a fund manager at Prudential, said that the current mood for investing in Taiwan stocks is getting stronger. This is because US stocks continue to reach new highs, the US has eased restrictions on chip sales to China, and major chip company earnings reports are good. She believes the positive trend can continue for a short time.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Securities Investment Consulting pointed out that the US lifted the ban on Nvidia's H20 chip sales. This has made AI-related companies do better, and hardware companies will benefit. Taiwan will definitely continue to profit from this.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead at the Taiwan stock market, Zhang Zhi-ling said that US technology companies will release their earnings reports this week. These include reports from Tesla, Google, and Intel. Their reports and future plans will be important for the market to watch. Evergreen Securities Investment Consulting warned that in the short term, people should be aware if optimism in the Taiwan stock market increases and if trading volume becomes very high.</p>
            <p>Regarding tariffs, Zhang Zhi-ling noted that Taiwan's tariff data has not been released yet. This is still something that can affect investors' feelings. It is also dividend season, and the economic outlook for the third quarter needs to be watched. She suggested looking at stocks that offer dividend protection and and have a clear advantage.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Securities Investment Consulting also mentioned that even though US President Trump has sent many letters about tariffs, when looking at individual countries, they are all affected by tariffs. But overall, most major countries are affected, and the differences between them are not big.</p>
