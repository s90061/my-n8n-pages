Kuang Yu, a company under the Foxconn Group, plans to change its business focus. The company's chairman, Li Guangyao, said they are interested in new business chances, like humanoid robots. They are buying an axial motor factory in Europe and hope to finish the deal by the end of the year. This move will help them enter the axial motor market for robot joints and electric motorcycle motors. Kuang Yu wants to double its revenue in the next three years.

Mr. Li explained that Kuang Yu currently makes stable profits from connectors, PCBs, and EMS, but these are very competitive markets. He believes axial motors have many uses, including industrial fans, large air conditioners, robot motors, and electric two-wheelers. Kuang Yu plans to focus on large joints for humanoid robots, such as hips, thighs, arms, and elbows, and is already talking with robot companies. The company also offers robot drag chains and PCB motor rotor products to fully enter the robot market.

Kuang Yu's revenue in 2024 was NT$21.82 billion, and it expects to reach NT$25 billion this year. With its plans in the robot industry, the company aims to double its revenue to NT$50 billion by 2028.

**President Lai's Comments During Disaster Inspection in Tainan Misunderstood; Resident Says It Was a Direct Talk Between Old Friends**

After Typhoon Danas caused severe damage in Tainan, President Lai Ching-te visited Qigu District on July 11th to check on the recovery efforts. Some media outlets misunderstood his conversation with local residents. Chen Qingcang, the head of Xixing Temple in Xiliao Village, who spoke with the President, said their conversation was direct because they have been close friends for many years.

Typhoon Danas brought strong winds and heavy rain, greatly affecting Tainan. On July 11th, President Lai visited Tainan twice to check the recovery work. In Qigu District, some residents spoke to him. Certain media reported that President Lai said, "Not everything can rely on the military," and criticized the government for not sending the military to help with disaster relief.

Presidential Office spokesperson Kuo Ya-hui explained on the evening of July 11th that the President was reminding people that the military is not allowed to enter private homes according to rules. She said that a certain media outlet ignored the facts and twisted his words, which was unfair to the military working hard on relief efforts.

Chen Qingcang told CNA today that he has known President Lai since he was "Dr. Lai," for decades. Because they are old friends, their conversations are often direct and unpolished, but they understand each other. He added that everyone present that day wanted the best for their hometown and was discussing ways to help with the disaster.

Chen Qingcang mentioned that the typhoon caused severe damage along the coast of Chiayi and Tainan, with about half of the utility poles falling. Taipower brought many workers from other cities to help with repairs. The military also arrived in Qigu on the first day, helping with disaster relief day and night. President Lai visited Tainan twice within four days of the disaster, showing great concern for the people's needs.

**Taiwan Stock Museum Adds New Area for TISA to Meet Growing Interest**

To support the launch of Taiwan's Personal Investment Savings Account (TISA) on June 30th, the Taiwan Depository & Clearing Corporation (TDCC) announced today that the "Taiwan Stock Museum" will add a special TISA section to its fund exhibition. This new area will explain the TISA policy and its details, hoping to encourage more people to use TISA and start managing their finances early.

Lin Ping-hui, Chairman of TDCC, said that to help people invest regularly for the long term, TDCC created the Taiwan Personal Investment Savings Account system and a platform to check accounts. The first products offered are carefully chosen domestic funds to spread risk and lower the minimum amount for regular investments. People can start investing with as little as NT$1,000 per month and benefit from low management fees and no handling fees for life.

Lin Ping-hui stated that in the future, TISA will include more types of financial products, following government policies. It will become a lifelong financial management account for everyone.

To keep promoting financial inclusion, TDCC opened Taiwan's first "Taiwan Stock Museum" in 2012. It regularly holds special exhibitions on different financial products to help people understand their features and risks, improving financial literacy for everyone.

This year, the Taiwan Stock Museum launched a new fund exhibition. It uses digital videos and interactive games to teach about fund features, basic knowledge, how to find information, and how to buy them. This helps people learn about financial literacy in a fun and engaging way.
