            <h1>Sentec Company: Over Half of Sales Now From Low-Earth Orbit Satellites, New Factory Line in Xizhi Starts in Q4</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Pan Zhiyi, Taipei, July 31) Sentec Technology, a company in the low-Earth orbit satellite and wireless communication business, announced its total sales for the first half of the year today. They reached NT$1.13 billion, which is the highest for this period ever. Sales from low-Earth orbit satellite products made up 52.7% of this total. This shows that these products are the main reason for the company's growth. In June alone, sales from low-Earth orbit satellite products grew to 54% of the total.</p>
            <p>Sentec said that to meet the growing demand for low-Earth orbit satellites, they are moving forward with many plans to expand. The second phase of their new factory in Xizhi, Taiwan, is expected to open in the fourth quarter. They have also finished planning to expand their third factory in Qidu and will soon start looking for a company to build it.</p>
            <p>For overseas operations, the plan for building the second factory in Vietnam is expected to be finalized by the end of the third quarter. This will help the company to supply products more easily from overseas and increase its total production capacity.</p>
            <p>Sentec Technology stated that looking at their orders, the amount of orders from low-Earth orbit satellite customers in June was over NT$180 million. This is about 2.5 times the actual sales from low-Earth orbit satellites for that month. Also, recent calculations show that orders for low-Earth orbit satellite products that have not yet been shipped are over NT$400 million. This means that there is still a high demand for low-Earth orbit satellite products and many orders coming in.</p>
            <p>Sentec Technology expects that in the second half of the year, after their sales reach a stable point, shipments of low-Earth orbit satellites will start to increase month by month again. They also hope to see excellent sales results, like "low-Earth orbit satellites breaking through the sky," and continue to be a main driver of growth.</p>
            <p>Sentec Technology said that in the second quarter, their key low-Earth orbit satellite customer started testing communications. This caused some product shipments to be delayed. However, this customer is very serious about Sentec's plans to increase production in the future. They asked for short-term, medium-term, and long-term plans for production growth. They also plan to send people to visit the factories in person to make sure that the expansion work will be finished on time. This shows that they trust Sentec and depend on their future cooperation.</p>
            <p>Sentec's numbers show that its total sales for the second quarter were NT$514 million. This is a 17% drop from the previous quarter. The main reasons for this were that Positive Through Technology was not included in the sales, and some shipments were delayed because of customer communication tests. Also, the strong increase in the New Taiwan Dollar against the US Dollar in the second quarter had some temporary effects. If we use the same exchange rate as the first quarter, the total profit margin for the second quarter was about 49%. This is only a small difference from the first quarter's profit margin of 50.6%.</p>
            <p>Regarding non-operating income and expenses, Sentec said that the amount changed from a positive number in the first quarter to a negative number in the second quarter. This was due to losses from exchange rates. (Editor: Yang Lanxuan) 1140731</p>

            <p>Yuanta Financial Holding also announced today that it donated NT$20 million to a special account for disaster relief under the Ministry of Health and Welfare. This money will help with disaster aid, emergency medical care, housing, and later rebuilding. This is a real action to help the disaster areas and shows the strength and unity of businesses. Yuanta Financial Holding said that after the disaster, they immediately started emergency plans and customer care programs.</p>
            <p>Nanshan Life Insurance and Nanshan General Insurance announced today that they are donating NT$6 million to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's disaster relief account through the Nanshan Life Insurance Charity Foundation. When Typhoon Danas was close to Taiwan, Nanshan Life Insurance and Nanshan General Insurance quickly started their customer service and care measures. These include no interest on policy loans, no interest on home loans, delayed premium payments, fast claim payments, and advance payments for hospital stays, among others.</p>
            <p>To help people affected by the disaster, LINE Bank announced that starting in August, flood-affected households in Taichung, Changhua, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung can apply for a 3-year low-interest personal loan with no contract needed.
