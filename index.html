            <p>Thai officials announced today that they have generally agreed to stop fighting with Cambodia. They also want to start "two-sided talks." This is to end the serious fighting that has been happening for several days. At least 33 people have died in these battles.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, this announcement came after the US President Donald Trump said he had spoken with the leaders of both Cambodia and Thailand. Both sides agreed to have talks and "quickly reach" a ceasefire agreement. Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs then released its statement.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Trump had talked with Thailand's acting Prime Minister, Phumtham Wechayachai. Trump asked both sides to stop fighting. The Ministry also posted a statement on social media X, saying, "Thailand generally agrees to a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>The statement said, "However, Thailand wants to see Cambodia act with good intentions."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that Phumtham asked Trump to "tell Cambodia that Thailand wants to have two-sided talks soon. This is to plan how to stop fighting and finally end the conflict peacefully."</p>
            <p>The border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia has now been going on for three days. More than 150,000 people have had to leave their homes because of the fighting.</p>
