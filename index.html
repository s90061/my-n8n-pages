A KMT official, Huang Pi-yun, has been arrested. She is accused of making fake documents in a case to remove legislator Wu Li-hua from her position. Wu Li-hua said today that KMT leaders should take responsibility for this organized crime. She supports the police investigation and hopes that innocent people are not involved.

The KMT party said that the police searching homes and arresting their staff without clear proof is not fair. They think it goes against the law.

The investigation started in May. Police searched eight places, including the KMT office in Pingtung. They questioned 11 people. One person, Chang Fang-shuo, was also arrested earlier and is still in custody. On July 1st, police searched more KMT offices in other cities and questioned 15 more people, including Huang Pi-yun. Prosecutors believe Huang Pi-yun is guilty of making fake documents and other crimes. They think she might try to contact others or witnesses, so she was arrested. She is the second person to be arrested in this case. Other party workers were released after paying bail.

**French Prime Minister Survives No-Confidence Vote Again**

French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou has survived another vote that tried to remove him from his job. This happened because the far-right party, National Rally (RN), did not support the motion from the left-wing parties.

Only 189 members of parliament voted to remove the government, which was not enough. Since December, Mr. Bayrou has survived 8 such votes. However, his position seems to be less secure now, similar to what happened to the previous Prime Minister who lost his job after only three months.

The National Rally is the biggest party in the French parliament, but they do not have more than half of the seats. They said they would not support this no-confidence vote now. They might try to remove the government later, possibly when discussions about the 2026 budget become more difficult. Mr. Bayrou now has a big task: he needs to cut 40 billion euros from the 2026 budget.

**Scholarships for Local School Enrollment Cause Debate; Education Ministry Says Money Goes to Areas in Need**

Some public high schools are no longer offering "local enrollment scholarships," which has caused disagreement. The Ministry of Education explained that they change the scholarship amounts each year. They are now giving money from schools that already have enough students to areas that need more support.

Some schools are upset because they used these scholarships to attract new students. Now it is hard for them to explain the changes to students and their parents.

The Ministry of Education said that these scholarships help good students in poorer areas go to high schools near their homes. This helps make education more equal between cities and the countryside. They decide how much money each school gets based on where the school is, how many students they have, and the number of classes. The Ministry found that some schools have enough students now, so they decided to move the scholarship money to areas with fewer educational resources. This helps encourage more students in rural areas to study closer to home. The Ministry suggests that schools should wait for official approval of scholarship amounts before telling students and parents to avoid confusion. Schools can also look for other ways to offer financial help to students.
