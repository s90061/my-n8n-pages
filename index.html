            <h1>Global Oil Prices Drop a Little as Trade Talks and Russian Energy Sales Are Watched</h1>
            <p>International oil prices went down a bit today. This happened because people are still worried about how much oil the world needs. This worry comes from two things: trade talks in the United States are not moving forward, and new rules from Europe have not stopped Russia from selling its energy.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for crude oil for delivery in August dropped by 14 cents. It is now 67.20 US dollars for one barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for Brent crude oil for delivery in September dropped slightly by 7 cents. It is now 69.21 US dollars for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>Russia and Ukraine to Hold New Peace Talks on July 23, Says Zelenskyy</h1>
            <p>The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said today that Russia and Ukraine will have another round of peace talks. These talks are set for July 23.</p>
            <p>Before this, Russia and Ukraine had two rounds of talks in Istanbul, Turkey. These talks did not make much progress in ending the war.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zelenskyy said in his regular speech that he spoke with Rustem Umerov today. Mr. Umerov is the head of Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. They discussed holding more talks with Russia in Turkey. Mr. Umerov told him that these talks are planned for the 23rd.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy also said that more information about these new talks will be given tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Representatives from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul on May 16 and June 2. Even though they did not agree to stop fighting, they did agree to keep working on exchanging prisoners and bodies of dead soldiers.</p>
            <p>Last week, the US President, Mr. Trump, said that if Russia and Ukraine do not agree to stop fighting within 50 days, the US will add high taxes on their goods. After this, the government in Russia, the Kremlin, said that Russia is ready for more talks.</p>
            <p>Today, Russia's TASS news agency quoted someone who knows about the plans. They said that Russia and Ukraine are planning new talks for July 24. The people joining the talks might arrive in Istanbul on July 23.</p>

            <h1>US Finance Minister Says No Rush for Trade Deals; China Talks to Focus on Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>The US Finance Minister, Scott Bessent, said today that the United States cares more about good trade deals than about signing them quickly. He also said that the next talks between the US and China might be about China buying oil from Russia and Iran. This means the talks will change from being about trade to being about national safety.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Bessent said that new US taxes on goods will start on August 1. This will happen if countries that trade with the US do not make agreements with Washington.</p>
            <p>Today, he spoke to CNBC, a business news channel. He said, "We will not hurry to make a deal just to have one."</p>
            <p>When asked if the US might give more time after August 1 if talks with a country go well, Mr. Bessent said President Trump will make that decision.</p>
            <p>He said, "We will see what the President decides. But if we go back to the August 1 taxes, I think higher taxes will make those countries try harder to reach better deals."</p>
            <p>About the talks between the US and China, Mr. Bessent said they will have "talks soon."</p>
            <p>He said, "I think trade is in a good situation. Now we can start talking about other problems. Sadly, China buys a lot of oil from Iran and Russia that is not allowed to be sold. So, we might start talking about this problem."</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent was also asked about new rules against Russia. He hinted that the US might choose to put high taxes on goods from any country that buys Russian energy that is not allowed to be sold.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent told CNBC that "any country buying Russian oil that is not allowed will have to pay up to 100% more in taxes." He would ask Europe to do the same if the US puts these extra taxes in place.</p>
            <p>Regarding Japan, Mr. Bessent said that the Trump government is more interested in getting the best conditions for the American people. They are less worried about Japan's own government issues.</p>
