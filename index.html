            <h1>Russian Airline Cancels Over 40 Flights After Hacker Attack</h1>
            <p>Aeroflot, Russia's main airline, was attacked by hackers. A group of hackers who support Ukraine said they were responsible. Because of this, Aeroflot had to cancel more than 40 flights today. Most of these were flights within Russia. The Kremlin said this situation is worrying.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Aeroflot cancelled these flights after saying there was a problem with their computer systems. The cancelled flights included trips to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. At least 10 other flights were delayed.</p>
            <p>Aeroflot did not say how long it would take to fix the problem. However, the departure board at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, Russia's capital, showed many red "cancelled" signs. Many Russians are traveling for their holidays right now.</p>
            <p>A hacker group called "Silent Crow" said they did this attack. They said they worked with a group from Belarus called Cyberpartisans BY. They said the attack was connected to Russia's war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Their statement said: "Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!" Reuters could not check if this statement was true. Ukraine has not said anything about the attack yet.</p>
            <p>Silent Crow has said they were behind several other hacker attacks this year. They have targeted Russia's property database, Russia's national telephone company, a large insurance company, Moscow city's IT department, and the Russian office of the Korean car company KIA.</p>
            <p>Russian prosecutors have confirmed that today's problems were caused by a hacker attack. They have started a criminal investigation.</p>
            <p>Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for the Kremlin, said: "The information we are reading publicly is quite worrying. Hacker threats continue to be a danger for all big companies that offer services to the public."</p>

            <h1>Trump May Put 15% to 20% Tax on Countries Without Trade Deals</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump said today that he might put a standard tax, or tariff, of between 15% and 20% on countries that do not have their own special trade deals with the United States. He said this in Turnberry, Scotland.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news channel, reported that Trump met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Turnberry, Scotland. Trump said: "For the whole world, I would say the tax will be in the range of 15% to 20%... I just want to be friendly."</p>
            <p>Trump also said: "I would say it's probably between 15% and 20%, maybe one of these two numbers."</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, these numbers are much higher than the 10% standard tax that Trump announced in April this year.</p>
            <p>Trump said: "We will basically set taxes for all other countries in the world. This is what they must pay if they want to do business in the United States, because you cannot sit down and make 200 agreements."</p>
