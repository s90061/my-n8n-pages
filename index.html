Taiwan's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lin Chia-lung, recently met with Mr. Hayata Junichi, the mayor of Yamaga City in Kumamoto, Japan. Minister Lin said that Taiwan and Kumamoto are becoming closer. This is because TSMC has built a factory in Kumamoto, and direct flights from Kaohsiung to Kumamoto have started again. He hopes Taiwan and Japan can work together more in many areas in the future.

Mayor Hayata Junichi has worked hard to improve local connections between Taiwan and Japan for a long time, especially in tourism, culture, and school trips. Many schools in Yamaga City have become sister schools with Taiwanese schools, making education cooperation stronger. Minister Lin also mentioned a plan to help young Taiwanese people study in Japan, hoping more can go there to learn and achieve their dreams.

During the meeting, Mayor Hayata gave Minister Lin a special paper fan with his name and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs logo, which Minister Lin found very useful and meaningful. Both sides hope for more cooperation in education, culture, tourism, and trade to create a better future for Taiwan and Japan.

**Taiwan Says Cancelling Residency for Former Chinese Citizens is a Big Decision**

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) has responded to news reports about former Chinese citizens possibly losing their residency in Taiwan if they do not provide proof that they have given up their original Chinese citizenship. The MAC said that taking away someone's Taiwanese residency is a serious matter. They stated that the government will not just cancel people's residency or deport them without following proper procedures.

The MAC explained that Taiwan has a rule that people can only have one citizenship, either Taiwanese or Chinese. This rule helps manage interactions between Taiwan and China. They also noted that most former Chinese citizens living in Taiwan, about 130,000 out of 140,000, have already given their proof of giving up their Chinese citizenship as required by law. The government wants to be fair to everyone and not let a small group have two citizenships and get benefits from both sides.

The MAC also said that the government has been clear about its policies and has offered help to those who could not get their documents due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have given people more time or allowed them to sign a special document instead. The government is also trying to find about 1,668 people who have not submitted their documents and might need help, especially those who are vulnerable or lack information. The MAC emphasized that the goal is to help these individuals complete the necessary steps to have full and legal Taiwanese residency.
