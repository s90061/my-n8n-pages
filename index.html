            <h1>U12 World Cup: Taiwan Wins with 9 Stolen Bases, Beats Australia for Second Straight Win in Preliminaries</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 26 (CNA) In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Taiwan played its second game today against Australia. Taiwan used speed well, stealing bases 9 times. They connected their attacks and won the game 13-0 in 5 innings. This is their second win in a row. Tomorrow, they will play against Japan. Head coach Zhang Zijian said they need to focus more.</p>
            <p>The U12 Baseball World Cup is happening in Tainan at the Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. Taiwan won their first game yesterday against Cuba, and today they played against Australia.</p>
            <p>In the first inning, the Taiwan team scored points quickly. Hu Cheng-en got a hit and then stole second base. Li Quan-en got a walk, and they used a double-steal plan. They scored their first point with a sacrifice fly. Gu Meng-jie got a walk, and they did another double-steal. Then, they scored more points with another sacrifice fly. Xie Cheng-jun hit a double, bringing in the team's third point.</p>
            <p>In the second inning, the Taiwan team started to attack again. After one out, Hu Cheng-en got a walk and stole second base. Li Quan-en hit the ball, moving the runners. They scored a point from a ground ball. Then, they got hit by a pitch, stole a base, and got more walks, filling all the bases and scoring more points. Lin Shu-yan hit a triple, bringing in 3 points at once. Then, they scored their ninth point with another hit.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team scored 2 more points in the 3rd inning and 2 more in the 5th inning, making the score gap bigger and winning the game easily. Taiwan used five different pitchers today: Huang Yu-qian, Chen Yu-shen, Hou Dong-you, Li Yun-run, and Wang Wei. They only allowed Australia to get 1 hit and did not let them score any points.</p>
            <p>After the game, coach Zhang Zijian was interviewed. He said that at the start of the game, they were careful. They put Huang Yu-qian, a good pitcher, to start. As the score got bigger, they also thought about a second plan to let all their pitchers play. For their attacks, their hitting and running plans worked well, and everyone played nicely.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team has won 2 games in the preliminary round. Tomorrow, they will play against Japan, who also has 2 wins. Coach Zhang Zijian said they have watched Japan's games carefully. When they play against Japan, they need to focus more. Their plan for hitting and running must show their strong desire to win so they can beat Japan.</p>

            <h1>Gao Hong-an's Recall Vote Fails; Expert Says Blue and White Parties Worked Together Well on the Ground</h1>
            <p>Hsinchu City, July 26 (CNA) The vote to remove Hsinchu Mayor Gao Hong-an from her job, who is currently suspended, failed. Experts think that recall votes depend on loyal supporters and how well parties can gather people. In Hsinchu City, the Blue and White political groups worked together again for this recall vote. They spread out in neighborhoods to tell people to vote against the recall, showing strong local support.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission recently announced the number of voters in each area and the 25% approval needed for the recall to pass. In Gao Hong-an's area, there are 360,311 voters. 25% of this is 90,078 people. According to the Election Commission's website, at 8 PM today, 212,025 people voted. The turnout was 58.84%. There were 86,291 "yes" votes and 124,360 "no" votes.</p>
            <p>Local people noticed that the recall group in Hsinchu worked with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The DPP members in the Hsinchu City Council strongly criticized Gao Hong-an. From June, they held many press conferences to closely watch the city government's work. They focused on arguments about corruption and bad governance. But after mid-July, their criticism became less sharp, and their overall influence went down.</p>
            <p>Local people think that even though the recall group in Hsinchu had help from the DPP and many volunteers, recall votes are about how well core supporters can be brought out. In the Hsinchu City Council, more than 10 members from the Blue and White parties, plus independent members who support Gao Hong-an, worked with local party members. They spread out in neighborhoods to tell people to vote against the recall. They showed strong "ant army" power on the ground.</p>
            <p>Du Sheng-tsung, a professor at Ming Chuan University who follows Hsinchu City elections, said that Gao Hong-an was elected Hsinchu Mayor in 2022 with 98,121 votes. This time, she continued to work with the Blue party. Together, they got over 120,000 "no" votes against the recall, showing strong group effort. The DPP and the recall group got 86,000 "yes" votes, but they did not get support from middle voters or voters who usually support the Green party.</p>
            <p>Du Sheng-tsung pointed out that many people felt this nationwide recall was an unfair political attack. Even though Gao Hong-an kept her position as mayor, she still has a long way to go. Besides facing legal issues, she also needs to lead the city government to make good policies and finish important building projects.</p>
            <p>Chen Qing-ling, the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) group in the Hsinchu City Council, told CNA that Hsinchu citizens voted for Gao Hong-an in 2022 and should give her four years to show what she can do. Before the election, when he went to different areas to talk to people, he felt a lot of support. This time, the Blue and White parties worked together actively and successfully got "no" votes for the recall.</p>
            <p>Li Guo-zhang, the leader of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) in Hsinchu and a city council member, believes that Gao Hong-an was "unfairly involved" as a local leader in this big recall. Many middle-ground or light-green voters felt that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) wanted to be "the only big party and act like a dictator" in this recall. The Blue and White parties agree to keep working together to keep Taiwan's politics stable.</p>
