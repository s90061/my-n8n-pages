            <h1>Song Xin-hao Scores 29 Points, NCCU Beats Beijing Tsinghua University to Win Asian University Basketball League Title</h1>
            <p>In the Asian University Basketball League held in Hangzhou, China, National Chengchi University (NCCU) Griffins, the only team from Taiwan, won the championship game today. Song Xin-hao scored 29 points, the most in the game, helping NCCU beat Beijing Tsinghua University 82-79.</p>
            <p>The Asian University Basketball League (AUBL) is supported by Joseph Tsai, who is from Taiwan and is the chairman of Alibaba Group. The NCCU Griffins, who have won the UBA University Basketball League five times in a row this year, were the only team representing Taiwan. They showed their strong power on this big stage. They also beat Etugen University from Mongolia in the semi-finals yesterday, which allowed them to play in the championship game against Beijing Tsinghua University.</p>
            <p>When the first quarter started, NCCU's main guard, Song Xin-hao, took charge of the offense. Another guard, Hsu Te-chi, also scored well. The foreign player, Boboka, played strongly near the basket. Together, they helped NCCU stay close in points and led by 3 points at halftime.</p>
            <p>After halftime, both teams played strong defense, which made it hard to score many points. But NCCU still found ways to score. In the fourth quarter, they even led by 15 points, looking like they would win easily. However, NCCU then made many mistakes, and their opponents scored 11 points in a row to catch up. With 19.4 seconds left, the difference was only 4 points, and the game became very close again.</p>
            <p>But with 18.2 seconds left, Lin Zi-hao made two free throws for NCCU, securing the win. Song Xin-hao also made a very important block, stopping the opponent's comeback. NCCU won by 3 points, taking home the Asian University Basketball League championship.</p>
            <p>In this game, Song Xin-hao continued his great performance from yesterday, scoring a game-high 29 points, along with 12 rebounds and 6 assists. He was key to NCCU's victory. Hsu Te-chi, another guard, made 4 three-pointers, scoring 20 points, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists. Boboka, the strong player near the basket, achieved a "double-double" with 10 points and 11 rebounds.</p>

            <h1>Tamsui Fireworks and Folk Song Concert Attract Over 80,000 People to Fisherman's Wharf</h1>
            <p>The last event of the Tamsui Fisherman's Wharf Midsummer Fun series happened tonight. From a folk song concert to a big fireworks show, more than 80,000 people came to enjoy it. New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that after the Danjiang Bridge and Danbei Road are finished, Tamsui will attract even more people to live there.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei Midsummer Fun event held fireworks shows and other activities for three weeks. Tonight was the last one. It started with a concert called "Next Stop, Let's Sing Folk Songs Together." Then, at 8 PM, the "Bridge of Lovers" themed fireworks show lit up the Tamsui River. Because of this, people started coming in large numbers from the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih spoke at the folk song concert in the evening. He said that when he first started working in New Taipei, Tamsui only had about 120,000 people. Now, it has 200,000 people. He also said that after the Danjiang Bridge is finished and opens next March, the Bali Light Rail and the second phase of the Danhai Light Rail will be built. When Danbei Road is also finished, the transportation network will be complete. Tamsui will then be a better place to live, with less traffic, and more people will want to live there.</p>
            <p>After that, the "Bridge of Lovers" fireworks show began at 8 PM. The city government said that the show was inspired by the Qixi Festival's magpie bridge. It combined different types of fireworks effects and lights on the water to create a special summer night declaration of love. Arch-shaped fireworks looked like a love bridge, and they were combined with lights along the bridge and moving fireworks. This made it look like lovers were walking hand in hand over the bridge.</p>
            <p>The city government said that 12-inch high-altitude fireworks, along with large peony and dahlia-like light beads, went off together, creating a beautiful rain of flowers in the night sky. This showed feelings growing stronger. On the water, tiger tail and spinning wheel fireworks made a magnificent tree of a thousand flowers. Thousands of bright flowers bloomed on the Tamsui River. The whole fireworks show used moving patterns to connect fireworks at low, middle, and high altitudes, creating a creative and romantic midsummer celebration.</p>
            <p>The city government estimated that over 80,000 people watched the fireworks from both the Bali and Tamsui sides. Even though there were many people and cars, traffic flowed smoothly thanks to the police and MRT staff.</p>
