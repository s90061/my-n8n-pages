            <h1>Is the 'America Party' Stopped? Elon Musk Reportedly Focuses on Business, Avoids Problems with Republicans</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal, quoting people who know the situation, reported that rich businessman Elon Musk is quietly putting aside his plans to start a third political party in the United States. He reportedly wants to focus on his own companies. He also does not want to have problems with powerful Republicans by forming a new party.</p>
            <p>In July, after a public disagreement with President Trump about a big bill called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (which was about tax cuts and spending), Musk announced on the social media site X that he would start the "America Party." This party was meant to represent American voters who were not happy with the two main parties, the Democrats and the Republicans. He planned for it to join the midterm elections next year.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk's view has now changed. According to people who know, Musk thought about starting a party. But he also knew that this step could hurt his relationship with Vice President J.D. Vance. Many people see Vance as a possible future leader of the "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) political group.</p>
            <p>Some sources said that Musk and his business partners told people close to them that Musk might use his great wealth to support Vance. This would happen if Vance decides to run for president in 2028. Musk spent almost 300 million US dollars (about 9.1 billion New Taiwan dollars) to support Donald Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election.</p>
            <p>Friends say that Musk has not officially given up the idea of creating a new party. They also say he might change his mind as the midterm elections get closer.</p>
            <p>Musk and his spokesperson did not reply when asked for comments.</p>
            <p>If Musk truly gives up on starting a third political party, it would be a big success for the Republican Party before next year's midterm elections. In the past, third parties often made the votes of the two main parties less strong. For Vance, if he truly wants to be president, keeping Musk on his side would be very important.</p>
            <p>Vance spoke in an interview this month with a conservative website called Gateway Pundit. He said that breaking ties with Trump and the conservative movement would be a wrong step. He added, "So I hope that by the midterm elections, he (Musk) can come back again."</p>
            <p>There are signs that Musk and Trump's relationship is stable again, at least for now. They no longer argue with each other on social media. Musk has not written anything to criticize Trump or Republicans recently. In late July, Trump wrote that he hoped Musk and his businesses would "prosper," saying it was good for the country.</p>
            <p>Also, when Musk first said he would start a third political party, a Taiwanese-American businessman named Andrew Yang talked with him about the plan. However, the exact details are not known.</p>
            <p>Other people who supported the idea of a third political party have not heard anything from Musk himself.</p>
            <p>Mark Cuban, a very rich person from the technology industry, recently told the Wall Street Journal in an email that he had not heard anything about a new party from Musk or his team.</p>
            <p>According to someone who knows, some of Musk's political advisors have not discussed helping to form a political party with the head of Tesla or his close group.</p>
            <p>Steven Nekhaila, who is the chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, said he has not received any news from Musk or his team. He also has not heard about any serious efforts by the rich businessman's friends to create a new party.</p>
            <p>He said, "It's so quiet it's almost strange. It seems like nothing is happening, not at the state level, and not at the local level."</p>

            <h1>US Government Takes Away Security Clearances from 37 Current and Former Officials, Called Illegal</h1>
            <p>The government of US President Trump said today that it has taken away the security clearances of 37 people. These people are current and former officials who worked in national security. This is the newest action against government workers in the intelligence system.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Tulsi Gabbard, wrote a memo. In it, she accused the officials of "making intelligence political or using it like a weapon" to help their own goals or their party's goals. She also said they did not protect secret information. They also did not "follow the professional rules for analyzing spy information." She mentioned other "harmful" actions without giving details.</p>
            <p>The memo did not give any proof to support these accusations.</p>
            <p>Many of the officials named used to have important jobs in national security. Others had less visible jobs. They had left the government many years ago. Some of them worked on things that President Trump had been unhappy about for a long time. For example, the intelligence agencies believed that Russia helped Trump in the 2016 US presidential election.</p>
            <p>Also, several officials signed a letter in 2019 that showed their worries about Trump. This letter became known on social media in July of this year through Laura Loomer, a right-wing person who supports Trump.</p>
            <p>Mark Zaid, a lawyer who works on national security matters, also had his security clearance taken away by the Trump government. He said in a statement, "These decisions are against the law and against the Constitution. They are different from many years of laws and rules that were made to stop these types of actions."</p>
            <p>He also said it was not fair that the government accused these people of "making intelligence political or using it like a weapon."</p>
            <p>Tulsi Gabbard said the action was right. She said it was because President Trump told her to do it.</p>
            <p>She wrote on the social media platform X, "Having a security clearance is a special permission, not a basic right. People in the intelligence system who broke their promise to the Constitution, putting their own interests before the American people, have broken the important trust they promised to keep."</p>
