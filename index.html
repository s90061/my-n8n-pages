            <h1>After the 726 Recall Votes, Taiwanese Groups Abroad Ask for Unity to Face Big Problems</h1>
            <p>(Washington D.C. July 29, CNA) After the big recall votes on July 26, five groups of Taiwanese people living in America and Europe asked everyone to come together again. They also said that Taiwan is talking with the United States about things like taxes on goods. If there is political trouble inside Taiwan, it will make Taiwan's position weaker in these talks. If opposing political parties use their efforts to cause problems in the parliament, it will not help people's lives and might even make the United States support Taiwan less.</p>
            <p>On July 26, people voted on whether to remove 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an from their jobs. All these recall efforts failed. The North America Taiwanese Association, the Federation of Taiwanese Associations in Europe, the North American Taiwanese Women's Association, the Taiwanese Association in Manchester, UK, and the Greater Vancouver Taiwanese Association released a joint statement in the afternoon to share their views.</p>
            <p>The statement said that the people of Taiwan showed their choices through a democratic process. Taiwan faces difficult situations in the world. The groups hope that after the voting, society can unite and protect democracy together.</p>
            <p>"Please respect the results of democracy and value the trust given by voters," these five groups said. They stated that the recall actions showed the anger of citizen groups and their disappointment and distrust in how the opposition lawmakers handled things in parliament. These feelings should be noticed and thought about.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te and his government team are working according to the law and the constitution. They should be respected and given space to continue making changes inside the country and planning for international relations. They need to handle the risks and pressures for the country.</p>
            <p>The North America Taiwanese Association and other groups also said that the real danger to Taiwan's democracy comes from the Chinese Communist Party's control and hidden influence. "Overseas, we strongly feel that the Chinese Communist Party uses many ways to threaten democratic countries."</p>
            <p>According to the statement, the Chinese Communist Party continues to interfere in Taiwan's matters. They do this by controlling public opinion, spreading false information, and training political agents. They want to divide society, cause political trouble, and finally take over Taiwan, destroying its democracy.</p>
            <p>The statement pointed out that Taiwan is having difficult talks with the United States about many things like customs taxes, trade, supply chains, and safety. Any political problems inside Taiwan will make Taiwan weaker in these international talks and make it less trusted.</p>
            <p>The statement said that if the opposing political parties use all their political power to fight against the government and cause chaos in parliament, it will not only hurt people's daily lives but also might make the United States and other democratic countries lose trust and support for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The North America Taiwanese Association and other groups asked the parliament and all political parties to stop unnecessary political games. They should go back to focusing on public policies and people's lives. The government team should stay on a steady path, keep working to develop the country, and connect with other countries, not letting problems shake their beliefs.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the public should be aware of attempts to influence their thoughts and beliefs, often through media. They should keep their ability to understand media well so they are not fooled by political talk and false information. Taiwanese people both inside and outside the country should support each other, talk calmly, and face dangers and problems from outside together.</p>

            <h1>Good Morning World: Heavy Rain Expected in Southern Taiwan Today Due to Southwest Airflow; 13 Areas in Kaohsiung and Pingtung Suspend Work and School</h1>
            <p>In recent days, the mountainous areas of Kaohsiung and Pingtung have had heavy rain from time to time. Because of this, five areas in Kaohsiung, including Liouguei District, and eight townships in Pingtung County, including Wutai Township, will stop work and school today, July 30. The weather office said that the southwest airflow will be strongest on July 30. The rain will spread to areas south of Miaoli, and southern Taiwan should prepare for very heavy rain or more. After recent rains, Tainan has had problems with flooding. Premier Cho Jung-tai visited the affected areas on July 29 and said that the Executive Yuan will set up a "Cloud-Chiayi-Tainan Flood Response Center." This center will help central and local governments work directly to solve problems.</p>
            <p>Cities and provinces in northern China have recently had unusual heavy rainfall. By midnight on July 28, 30 people had died in Beijing because of the disaster. In Luanping County, Hebei Province, a landslide caused the death of 8 people, and 4 more are missing. On July 28, Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping spoke about the floods in northern China. He said the heavy rain caused "many deaths and injuries" in Beijing and other places. China's Premier Li Qiang also said that the Miyun flood in Beijing had "many deaths and injuries." Only after Xi and Li spoke about many deaths did Beijing officials announce that 30 people had died in the floods.</p>
            <p>This year, Taiwan is becoming a "super-aged" society, meaning that one out of every five people is over 65 years old. The job market is greatly affected by this. Young people prefer to be online celebrities or delivery drivers, so industries cannot find enough new, young workers. They have started looking for older workers. A senior manager at a job agency said clearly that people who buy things and society as a whole might not be ready for this change. A store manager in retail once said that his store hired many older workers who were friendly and worked well with others. But customers complained that they were too slow and wanted more young people. Experts suggest starting "aging education" early so that everyone understands that a "super-aged society is not just someone else's problem, but a problem for all of us."</p>
            <p>Many batches of "Fu Yuan Chunky Peanut Butter" from Hsinchu were found to have too much aflatoxin. The Hsinchu City Health Bureau said it has asked the company to take back all the bad products and stop making them. They also asked the company to provide a way for people to return or exchange the products. The company will be fined between 60,000 and 200 million New Taiwan Dollars for breaking the Food Safety and Health Management Act. The Health Bureau pointed out that aflatoxin is a dangerous substance that can cause cancer. It is often found in peanuts and nuts, so it must be controlled very strictly by law.</p>
            <p>A new policy will start on August 1. It will allow people aged 80 and over to hire foreign caregivers without needing a doctor's evaluation. Because some people might choose less sick patients to get caregivers faster, the Ministry of Labor has announced six new rules. These rules will make sure that seriously ill patients get caregivers first. If a family has a seriously ill person and can show proof, their application will be looked at first. Also, finding a local caregiver for families with seriously ill members can be finished in just one day. The Ministry of Health and Welfare stated that during the time a family waits for a foreign caregiver, they can use various long-term care services. However, they must still meet the requirements for long-term care.</p>
            <p>A man named Hu was unhappy that a woman had accused him of threatening her. This woman had worked as an expert for the National Communications Commission during the review of CTi News Channel's license. From November last year, Mr. Hu watched, followed, and threatened the woman for over six months. After the woman told the police, the police gave Mr. Hu a warning in writing. But Mr. Hu did not stop his actions. The woman then asked the court for a protection order, which she received. However, Mr. Hu appeared at the woman's workplace many times, which broke the protection order. So, the woman pressed charges again. The Shilin District Prosecutors Office finished its investigation and charged Mr. Hu on July 29 with stalking and harassment.</p>
            <p>More than two years after new laws about tobacco control started, the first heated tobacco products have been approved under certain conditions. This means that two companies will be able to sell 14 different items legally in Taiwan in the future. However, these companies will need some time to get ready after their products are approved, so they will not be available in stores right away. How people can bring heated tobacco products back from other countries for personal use and how tobacco taxes will work are still being discussed. The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance said that companies will be able to import these products. But for now, travelers are still not allowed to bring heated tobacco products into Taiwan.</p>
            <p>On July 28, a terrible shooting happened in Manhattan, New York. A man who might have had mental health problems went into an office building with a gun. He shot and killed four people, including a police officer and a security guard, and then killed himself. This happened in a high-class office building on Park Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets in Manhattan. Companies like the financial group Blackstone, KPMG U.S., and the headquarters of the National Football League (NFL) are in this building. The shooter is thought to be a 27-year-old man from Hawaii who lived in Las Vegas. The reason for the shooting is still being investigated.</p>
            <p>Yang Yuan-ming, the former president of Central Police University, will retire on July 16. The National Police Agency announced that Huang Ming-chao, the deputy director-general of the National Security Bureau, will take over as president. Also, Liao Hsun-cheng and Lee Wen-chang, who are the police chiefs of New Taipei City and Taichung City, will become deputy directors-general of the National Police Agency. All of them will start their new jobs on August 1. Huang Ming-chao is 62 years old. He graduated from the 51st class of Central Police University and has a master's degree in crime prevention. He has held important jobs before, such as director-general of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, director-general of the National Police Agency, and deputy director-general of the National Security Bureau.</p>
            <p>On July 29, the Semiconductor Industry Association in the United States announced that Dr. C.C. Wei, the chairman and CEO of TSMC, and Dr. Mark Liu, the former chairman of TSMC, will both receive the 2025 Robert N. Noyce Award. Both of them are expected to attend a dinner on November 20 to accept the award. The SIA stated that Dr. Wei and Dr. Liu are very important figures in the semiconductor industry. Together, they have more than 80 years of experience and knowledge in the industry. They have changed the modern semiconductor industry system in the U.S. and other countries and have completely changed how computer chips are made.</p>
            <p>Hu De-fu is descended from the Puyuma and Paiwan indigenous peoples. In 1984, there was a coal mine explosion in Taipei County's Haishan Mine. Hu De-fu found that many of the people who died were Amis miners. He wrote a song to protest the sad lives of indigenous people. After that, he helped start the "Taiwan Indigenous Peoples' Rights Promotion Association." This group worked to give indigenous people their proper name and to return their land. It also led to the first large social movement for indigenous peoples after martial law ended, when over 2,000 tribal members marched and shouted, "We want our land, and we want our name!" On August 1, 1994, the word "Shān Bāo" (mountain people), which was seen as a bad name, was removed from the Constitution and changed to "indigenous people." Three years later, it was changed again to "indigenous peoples."</p>

            <h1>Old Photos: Hu De-fu and the Movement to Give Indigenous People Their Rightful Name</h1>
            <p>(CNA website) On August 1, 1994, the word "Shān Bāo" (mountain people), which was a disrespectful name, was finally removed from the Constitution. It was changed to "indigenous people." Three years later, it was changed again to "indigenous peoples," which is the full and correct name.</p>
            <p>This was a movement that lasted for 10 years. On this journey, the name of Hu De-fu (Kimbo) cannot be forgotten.</p>
            <p>He is from the Puyuma and Paiwan indigenous groups. In 1962, Hu De-fu traveled north from Taitung to study at Tamkang High School. He then became the first student from his hometown to get into the Foreign Languages and Literatures Department at National Taiwan University.</p>
            <p>He had to leave university in his third year because of a brain injury that caused seizures. Later, to help his family, he started singing in cafes. While singing at a coffee center linked to the Colombian Embassy, he met a group of good friends, including Li Shuang-tze, Yang Hsien, and Wu Chu-chu.</p>
            <p>In 1974, Hu De-fu held a concert called "Beautiful Rice Grains" with strong support from Li Shuang-tze. This concert marked the beginning of Taiwan's folk song movement and was a very important moment in his life.</p>
            <p>Li Shuang-tze's words, "Sing your own songs, speak your own words," greatly influenced Hu De-fu. He began to find his people's traditional songs and also wrote his own music.</p>
            <p>In 1984, the Haishan coal mine in Taipei County (now New Taipei City) had an explosion. When Hu De-fu helped with the rescue, he found that most of the people who died were Amis miners. After he went home, he wrote a song called "Why?". He then held a concert in New Park to speak out and support the indigenous people who suffered greatly in the disaster.</p>
            <p>At the end of the same year, even though many police officers tried to stop him, he and Icyang Parod and others started the "Taiwan Indigenous Peoples' Rights Promotion Association" at the MacKay Memorial Hospital hall in Taipei. Hu De-fu was chosen as its first leader. He worked to get the indigenous people their rightful name and their land back.</p>
            <p>On August 25, 1988, the first large social movement for indigenous peoples after martial law ended in Taiwan took place. More than 2,000 indigenous people marched in the streets, shouting, "We want our land, and we want our name!"</p>
            <p>In 1994, then-President Lee Teng-hui first used the term "indigenous people" in public in Pingtung. In July of the same year, thanks to the hard work of National Assembly member Kao Cheng-chih, a change to the Constitution was passed by only one vote. It was officially announced on August 1. This day also became "Indigenous Peoples' Day."</p>
