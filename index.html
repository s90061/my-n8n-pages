<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8837479">News Link</a>

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of recognized universities in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list. The list now has 154 universities and 191 colleges.

The Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools managed by China's United Front Work Department are not focused on academics. He said it is important to stop working with them. The Ministry will no longer accept degrees from these schools.

The Ministry stated that Guangzhou Jinan University has been under the control of China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a proper academic setting, the Ministry removed the university from its list. They stressed that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools should be careful about activities invited by China. They should check the purpose, organizers, and content to make sure there are no political goals. Schools should also avoid getting free trips or helping with China's political messages. If schools are unsure about an event, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. The Ministry still hopes to help young people from both sides learn together. However, they advise students to be aware of possible risks and check the background of event organizers.

**Video: First Car Fire on Kinmen Bridge â€“ CCTV Shows Scary Moment Car Became a Fireball**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7320/8837477">News Link</a>

Today at 2:16 PM, the first car fire accident happened on Kinmen Bridge. A car probably had a flat tire, causing it to slide and hit a road divider. Then, it caught fire. The two people in the car, Mr. Lin and his passenger, safely got out. No one was hurt. The police and firefighters quickly arrived to help and stopped traffic on the bridge. They put out the fire fast. The car was completely burned. Police are looking into what caused the accident.

The Kinmen County Fire Department got a call at 2:10 PM about a car on fire at the Kinmen Bridge. Four fire trucks and 12 firefighters were sent to the scene. When they got there, the car was stuck on the divider and on fire. Luckily, the driver and passenger were already out of the car. Firefighters used two water hoses to put out the fire quickly and cool down the car to prevent it from restarting. The car was completely destroyed, but no one was injured.

Police found that Mr. Lin was driving towards Lieyu on the Kinmen Bridge. About 1 kilometer into the drive, he heard a tire burst. The car then slid, hit the divider, and caught fire for an unknown reason. A breathalyzer test showed that Mr. Lin had not been drinking. The exact cause is still being investigated.

After the accident, police first allowed one-way traffic, then removed the car. Environmental staff cleaned up oil and debris. The road is now fully open again.

The Fire Department reminds drivers to check their car's condition and keep a safe distance from other cars. If there's a car accident or fire, call 119 right away. Explain what happened and if anyone is hurt so that help can arrive quickly.

Kinmen police also advise that if a tire blows out, do not suddenly press the brakes. Instead, take your foot off the gas, slow down, and hold the steering wheel steady. Turn on your hazard lights and try to move to the side of the road. If you can't control the car, you can rub against a guardrail to slow down and avoid flipping over. If your car stops on the side of the road after an accident, follow seven steps to keep everyone safe. These steps include: opening the door, putting out safety signs, leaving the car, calling for help, taking pictures, moving the car if possible, and waiting for help. At night or in bad weather, place warning signs further away to warn other drivers.

**"Too Scared to Cry": Chinese Spouse Xiao Wei Returns to Guizhou and Reveals Late-Night Threat Call**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7331/8837460">News Link</a>

"Xiao Wei," a Chinese woman, was forced to leave Taiwan in April. Her right to live in Taiwan was taken away because she talked about "unifying Taiwan by force" on TikTok. After going back to Guizhou, China, she started sharing her life in the countryside. But she still speaks her mind. She made a video saying a village leader in Guizhou didn't do their job. She complained that she hadn't received money for her land, which was taken for a reservoir. Later, she said she got a threatening phone call from the Chinese police late at night. She sadly said, "I'm so scared, I can't even cry."

In a video today on TikTok, Xiao Wei said she is very scared. She called herself a farmer, an ordinary person, and a good citizen who has not broken any laws. She said she only asked the village committee why she hadn't received her compensation money. But then, at around 12 AM on June 28, she received a threatening call from the Guanzhou police station.

Xiao Wei said in the video that she is a good farmer and cannot handle being scared like this. She questioned why the police station would call her to warn her. "I'm shaking while filming this video. Is there still justice? Is there still fairness?" she asked angrily. She then criticized the Chinese police, saying, "Is it wrong for me to defend my rights legally? How do you people work and enforce laws at the police station? Is this how you treat farmers? Calling to show your power."

Xiao Wei said she is truly scared and cannot stop crying. At the end of the video, she asked for help, saying, "Please, relevant departments, protect us farmers. The more I think about it, the more scared I get. We farmers have no powerful connections, so we can only use the internet to ask for justice. Please pay attention to my situation."`;
