            <h1>France Will Recognize the State of Palestine: Key Points</h1>
            <p>On July 24, French President Macron said that France will announce it recognizes the State of Palestine in September, during the United Nations General Assembly. Experts say this decision might pressure more European countries to do the same. It could also make Hamas act tougher during talks for a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that France will be the biggest Western power and the first G7 country to recognize Palestine. This announcement from France comes as more reports of hunger are coming out of Gaza.</p>
            <p>For over ten years, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been trying to become a full member of the United Nations. In 2012, the UN said Palestine could be a 'permanent observer.' But to become a full member, the Security Council must agree. The United States has used its veto power many times to stop Palestine from becoming a full member.</p>
            <p>Eyal Mayroz, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney, said that Macron's move will put more pressure on other European countries, especially the UK, to do the same. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is facing growing calls from his Labour Party to recognize the State of Palestine.</p>
            <p>Macron's announcement means France will join over 140 countries that recognize Palestine. Many countries, including Russia, China, India, and Malaysia, recognized Palestine in November 1988 when the Palestine National Council announced it was a state. However, the United States and most Western European countries did not recognize it at that time. This was because Washington wanted a two-state solution to happen through talks.</p>
            <p>But things changed when Israel started its military actions in Gaza. Last year, Norway, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia all recognized the State of Palestine.</p>
            <p>Hamas welcomed Macron's decision, calling it a 'positive step' towards justice and self-rule for Palestinians. Mayroz said that more international pressure on Israel might make Hamas take a tougher stand in ceasefire talks.</p>
            <p>However, the Washington Post believes that Macron's announcement does not mean he supports Hamas. At the same time, he asked Hamas to give up its weapons. He had said before that Hamas should not have any role in Gaza after the conflict ends. In April, Macron had already said he supports the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, taking over Gaza.</p>
            <p>Currently, the Palestinian Authority manages some parts of the West Bank. Hamas controls the Gaza Strip. Even though both are part of the Palestinian group, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have always been against each other.</p>
            <p>Even though the Palestinian Authority gets support from many Western countries, it has trouble ruling the parts of the West Bank that Israel controls. Also, many Palestinians do not think highly of it. This is mainly because people question if it is corrupt and not able to do its job well.</p>

            <h1>Singapore Deputy PM Meets US Treasury Secretary, Focuses on Mutually Beneficial Trade and Deeper Economic Cooperation</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Gan Kim Yong, is currently visiting the United States. He said on July 25 that he met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and others. They talked about economic issues that benefit both countries. Earlier, US President Donald Trump announced a list of tariffs, and Singapore's goods were taxed at 10%.</p>
            <p>Since the free trade agreement between Singapore and the United States started in 2004, trade between them has grown. The US sells more goods to Singapore than it buys. Singapore's tax rate on Trump's tariff list is quite low compared to others.</p>
            <p>Today, Gan Kim Yong posted on LinkedIn. He said he met with US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. They discussed economic topics that benefit both Singapore and the United States. They also talked about how to increase trade and find new ways to work together in areas like the digital economy and international cooperation.</p>
            <p>Gan Kim Yong also went to a meeting held by the US Chamber of Commerce. At this meeting, US business leaders talked about how important strong supply chains and a predictable business environment are.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that the United States is always an important and key partner for Singapore. Singapore will continue to talk to the US government and businesses in a good way to work on issues that both sides care about.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Gan Kim Yong spoke at a press conference about how tariffs might affect Singapore's economy. He said, 'I mentioned that the United States might reduce tariffs on medicines that Singapore sends to the US. We are talking with the US to better understand what they want and to find good solutions for Singaporean businesses.' As for semiconductors, Gan Kim Yong said that after they finish talking about medicines, they 'might then discuss semiconductor issues.'</p>
            <p>Singapore is an important trading hub in Asia. It is located in a key place, on the Strait of Malacca, which connects the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Because Singapore relies a lot on international trade, its economic performance often shows how well global trade is doing.</p>

            <h1>NTU Top Student Ding Yen-chen Crushes Opponent, Aims for Universiade Badminton Men's Singles Gold</h1>
            <p>Ding Yen-chen, a new badminton star from Taiwan who studies at National Taiwan University (NTU), won his men's singles semi-final match today at the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade. He beat China's Zhou Xinyu with scores of 15-7 and 15-6. This means he is the second Taiwanese player, after Wang Tzu-wei, to reach the Universiade men's singles final.</p>
            <p>Ding Yen-chen is only 21 years old and studies business management at National Taiwan University. He showed great skill in the men's singles event at the Rhine-Ruhr World University Games in Germany. He won every game without losing a single set. In the quarter-finals, he defeated Malaysia's Yu Yang, which guaranteed him at least a bronze medal by reaching the semi-finals.</p>
            <p>In today's men's singles semi-final, Ding Yen-chen played against China's Zhou Xinyu. In the first set, he was always ahead and quickly built a big lead, winning 15-7. In the second set, Ding Yen-chen continued to play very well, winning 15-6. This secured his spot in the gold medal match. He will now play against France's Enogat Roy for the men's singles gold.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that Taiwanese men's badminton singles players have won medals at the Universiade six times before. Ding Yen-chen wants to be the second player in Taiwan's badminton history to win the Universiade men's singles gold. The first was 'Badminton Prince' Wang Tzu-wei at the 2017 Taipei Universiade.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan's mixed doubles badminton teams also did very well, with three teams reaching the semi-finals. Wu Xuan-yi and Yang Chu-yun had a tough three-set match and beat the Chinese pair Liao Pin-yi and Li Qian. After this, Taiwan was sure to win gold, silver, and bronze medals in mixed doubles. Wu Xuan-yi and Yang Chu-yun will play against Chen Cheng-kuan and Hsu Yin-hui in an all-Taiwanese final for the gold. Lin Yu-chieh and Cheng Yu-chieh, who lost in the semi-finals, won a bronze medal.</p>
