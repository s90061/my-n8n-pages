Many people are changing how they buy food because prices are going up. This situation is often called the cost of living crisis. A recent report showed that grocery inflation, which is how much food prices have increased, was 6.8% in February. While this is lower than before, it is still a high number. Shoppers are trying to save money in various ways. They are buying more store-brand products instead of well-known national brands. They are also choosing cheaper supermarkets more often. For example, discount stores are becoming very popular. Even customers at more expensive stores are looking for ways to cut costs. This trend means that people are carefully checking prices and looking for good deals to manage their household budgets better.

**The Future of Work: Companies Want Staff Back in the Office**

Even though many employees enjoy working from home, more and more companies in the U.S. are asking their staff to return to the office. While the number of people working completely remotely has stayed about the same since early 2023, there is a strong push for a "hybrid" work model. This means employees spend some days in the office and some days at home. Research shows that many company leaders believe coming to the office is important for teamwork and building a good company culture. They also think it helps new employees learn and develop faster. However, many workers value the flexibility of working remotely and are sometimes willing to look for new jobs if they are forced back to the office full-time. This creates a challenge for businesses trying to find the right balance between company needs and employee preferences.
