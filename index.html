            <h1>Mai Meets Harlem Yu Again, Jokes About Causing Him a Stomach Ache Years Ago</h1>
            <p>Artist Mai came back to Taiwan to be on a TV show hosted by Harlem Yu. When they met again, they felt happy. As soon as Mai saw Harlem Yu, she said, "Harlem, you helped us record music back then, and it gave you a stomach ache." Harlem Yu joked back, "Not just a stomach ache, my head hurt too."</p>
            <p>Mai was in Taiwan to film Harlem Yu's TV show called "Ha! The Truth Is Out." She shared a story through a press release. She remembered when she first started working in Taiwan. She first met Harlem on the TV show "Super Sunday" and recorded music with him. She said, "When I first met Harlem, I couldn't speak Chinese at all." But now, she can understand questions and answer them well. Mai also mentioned how Harlem helped her write songs and record music. She directly said, "I made your stomach hurt." Harlem playfully replied, "Not only did my stomach hurt, but my head hurt too, everywhere hurt."</p>
            <p>Harlem also asked Mai about her life change, "Are you going to act again?" Mai said firmly, "Yes! And I am single now."</p>
            <p>In one part of the show, they talked about rules for foreign workers. Mai, as a foreign worker, said that her work permit clearly listed what she could do. It said things "like TV shows, news interviews, and events." She also explained that she "cannot earn money in other places, for example, working at a convenience store."</p>
            <p>"Ha! The Truth Is Out" is a game show. It combines fun challenges with learning how to check facts and understand different true or false information. It helps people learn to find wrong information while having fun. You can watch it every Monday to Wednesday at 9 PM on Public Television Service and PTS+.</p>
            <p>After the show, the episodes are also available on YouTube every Thursday to Saturday at 8 PM.</p>

            <h1>South Korea Will Forgive Over 830,000 People on Liberation Day, Including Former Party Leader Cho Kuk</h1>
            <p>The South Korean government announced today that it will give special forgiveness to many people on August 15th, which is Liberation Day. The list includes Cho Kuk, who used to lead the Progressive Party, and his wife. It also includes business leaders like Choi Shin-won, who was the chairman of SK Networks, and Choi Ji-sung, who was the vice chairman of Samsung Electronics.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News reported that South Korean President Lee Jae-myung had a meeting with his government this afternoon. They agreed on the list of people to be forgiven for Liberation Day. This list was checked by a special committee at the Ministry of Justice. In total, 836,687 people will get special forgiveness. Many of them are members of the ruling party who were investigated or went to prison when former Presidents Moon Jae-in and Yoon Suk-yeol were in charge.</p>
            <p>The report said that this decision was probably made to please supporters and to keep the government strong. Not only were many ruling party members forgiven, but also Cho Kuk and his wife. They had just gone to prison and many people were talking about them. Last December, a court sent Cho Kuk to prison for two years. This was because he cheated to help his children get into university. Because of this, he cannot run for president, even though many thought he might be the next leader.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuk's wife, Jeong Kyung-shim, also received a sentence last December. She got one year in prison and two years of probation. This was for making fake documents for her son's university entry.</p>
            <p>A survey by Realmeter, done from August 4th to 8th, asked 2,506 adults. It showed that President Lee Jae-myung's public support dropped to 56.5%. This was 6.8% lower than the week before. Experts say that young people still feel that what Cho Kuk and his wife did to help their children with school was "not fair" and that they had "double standards." This feeling makes people unhappy with the list of pardons, which then makes fewer people support the president.</p>

            <h1>Strong Competition Causes ASMPT to Close Shenzhen Semiconductor Factory</h1>
            <p>ASMPT, a company from Singapore that makes things for semiconductors and electronics, announced today that it has decided to close its advanced semiconductor equipment factory in Shenzhen, China. The company said this is a plan to make their manufacturing work in China better.</p>
            <p>ASMPT sent out a statement today. It said that to improve its manufacturing in China, it has decided to close the Advanced Semiconductor Equipment (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. in Shenzhen. This factory is part of the company's semiconductor solutions business. About 950 employees will be affected by this closure.</p>
            <p>ASMPT said this was a difficult choice. But, it is a necessary step to make ASMPT's supply chain around the world better. This will help the company deal with changes in the market and what customers need. They believe it will make their manufacturing operations globally more affordable, more flexible, and more resistant to problems.</p>
            <p>ASMPT stated that its other main manufacturing places around the world will continue to operate as usual. They also mentioned that their supply chain is fully prepared. The quality and supply of their products and services will not be affected at all.</p>
            <p>In recent years, many semiconductor companies in China have closed down. This is due to a weak economy, people buying less, and the US trying to limit China's access to advanced technology. News from Hong Kong reported before that in 2022, 5,746 semiconductor companies in China asked to close. This was a big jump of 68% compared to 3,420 companies in 2021.</p>
