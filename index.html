            <h1>US Producer Price Index Drops 0.1% in August, First Decrease Since April</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 10 (Central News Agency) â€“ The US Labor Department announced today that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for August went down by 0.1% from the previous month. This was a surprise, as it's the first monthly drop since April. The decrease happened because energy and trade costs went down.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the Labor Department's data showed that the August PPI was 0.1% lower than the month before. Experts had expected it to go up by 0.3%. The yearly PPI growth in August was 2.6%, which is also lower than in July.</p>
            <p>These numbers come at a time when officials are trying to understand how President Donald Trump's taxes on many goods are affecting the economy.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve will have a meeting about interest rates next week. If inflation stays high, the Fed will not have much room to lower interest rates. However, with inflation slowing down and the job market becoming weaker, many people expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 0.25% this month.</p>
            <p>The Labor Department said that lower prices for services were the main reason for the PPI decrease. Reduced profits from trade services were especially noticeable.</p>
            <p>If we do not include food, energy, and trade services, the PPI went up by 0.3% in August. The yearly increase was 2.8%, which is the biggest yearly rise since March.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, the more important Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released tomorrow.</p>

            <h1>Lin Chia-lung Calls for International Support for Taiwan to Join the United Nations in Romanian Media</h1>
            <p>Prague, September 10 (Central News Agency) â€“ Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung wrote an article for "Newsweek Romania," a major media outlet in Romania. He asked the international community to reject China's wrong interpretation of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758. He also said that Taiwan's important place and contributions in the world should be recognized, and that countries should work with Taiwan to join the United Nations. This is the first time a special article by a Taiwanese government official has been published in Romanian media.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from Taiwan's representative office in Slovakia, the Romanian version of "Newsweek," a well-known American political magazine, published Minister Lin Chia-lung's article on September 10. This happened as the UN General Assembly officially began on September 9. The article was titled "Working with Taiwan for World Peace and Prosperity."</p>
            <p>In his article, Lin Chia-lung asked the international community to say no to China's bad twisting of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. He also said that Taiwan's rightful place and good work in the world should be seen and supported.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung pointed out that Taiwan has been kept out of the United Nations for a long time. This is because China has purposely misunderstood Resolution 2758. He said that this resolution did not decide Taiwan's international status. It also did not stop Taiwan from taking part in the UN and its special groups, like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</p>
            <p>He noted that lately, more and more countries have openly said that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important. They have done this in talks between two countries and in bigger meetings like the G7. They also support Taiwan taking part in world matters in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said that powerful governments are still using tricky tactics to harm the international order. Because of this, peace is not something we can take for granted anymore. He said that democratic countries should work together more to make their societies and systems stronger. Taiwan is actively using smart diplomacy, combining its diplomatic, defense, technology, and economic strengths. It is also building stronger relationships with democratic countries. This helps to strengthen global democratic values and keep international rules safe.</p>
            <p>He also said that Taiwan is an important part of the first island chain. It not only protects democracy and freedom but also has a strong economy and a leading semiconductor industry around the world. This makes Taiwan a key player in keeping the Indo-Pacific region and the whole world stable and rich.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also talked about Taiwan's efforts to build a "non-red supply chain." This means reducing its reliance on governments that are not democratic and making sure key industries are safe. Also, through the "Glorious Nation Project," Taiwan works with its allies. They work together on projects like helping Paraguay build a complete medical information system, helping Eswatini with its oil reserves project, and helping Palau develop smart and green islands. This shows Taiwan's promise to help the world grow in a sustainable way.</p>
            <p>He stated that Taiwan will continue to strongly defend democratic values both at home and abroad. President Lai Ching-te has offered a "Four Pillars of Peace" plan. This plan aims to strengthen defense and society and asks Beijing to start talks again based on fairness and respect.</p>
            <p>Finally, Lin Chia-lung asked the international community to keep its promise of "leaving no one behind." This is especially important as the UN approaches its 80th anniversary and there are only five years left to reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Only by truly including Taiwan can the world work together for a more peaceful, rich, and sustainable future.</p>

            <h1>Changhua and Kinmen Ask Central Government Not to Reduce Local Funding</h1>
            <p>Changhua, September 10 (Central News Agency) â€“ Changhua County Governor Wang Hui-mei said today that the central government has stopped using a formula to calculate some general subsidies. This means that the amount of money the county gets has gone down, and its expenses have gone up. The Finance Department of Kinmen County Government also said that the central government should make sure that all local governments receive at least as much general subsidy as they did in 2025, according to the law.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Executive Yuan spokesperson Li Hui-chih said that the new rules for dividing money between central and local governments have problems. More than NT$30 billion cannot be given out. She said the central government wants to give the money, but it cannot, so the law needs to be changed again. Premier Cho Jung-tai also said he would invite county leaders to talk about the money division law.</p>
            <p>Regarding the law on dividing money and how taxes are shared, Taichung City Mayor Lu Shiow-yen held a press conference today in Taipei. She brought together leaders from 15 cities and counties, including Chiang Wan-an and Hou Yu-ih, from both KMT and NPP parties. They announced a shared statement to protect local subsidies. Wang Hui-mei, who was also at the meeting, explained her stance through a press release from the county government.</p>
            <p>Wang Hui-mei said today that because the central government stopped using the formula for general subsidies, the county's income from subsidies has decreased, and its costs have increased. Local governments are facing unclear information about subsidies and a lack of fair rules for getting them. This will directly affect basic building projects and services for people.</p>
            <p>Wang Hui-mei said that last year, based on the formula, the county should have received NT$18.9 billion in general subsidies. However, as of September 5 this year, it has only received about NT$5.7 billion for ongoing, widespread, basic construction, or operational projects approved by various central government departments. Additionally, NT$2.2 billion in social welfare subsidies for 2026 was confirmed earlier. This means a total shortage of about NT$11 billion. Because this information about subsidies is unclear and unfair, it greatly affects local construction and services for people. She hopes the central government will listen to the people of Changhua.</p>
            <p>Separately, regarding this disagreement, the Kinmen County Government Finance Department said in a written statement in the evening that, according to information from the Ministry of Finance, Kinmen County has received NT$4.835 billion in shared taxes. After the county government did its own calculations, Kinmen still has NT$4.355 billion that has not been given out. They hope the central government will follow the spirit of the new money division law and provide enough money to support the development of the outlying islands.</p>
            <p>The Finance Department also said that Article 30, Section 3 of the new money division law clearly states that the amount of general subsidies must not be less than the year before the new law started. They ask the central government to legally make sure that all local governments receive at least as much general subsidy as they did in 2025. Also, the central government should not easily cut, reduce, or delay subsidies that were already approved. This is to avoid problems with local government plans.</p>
