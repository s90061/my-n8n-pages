            <h1>IAEA Head Visits Singapore to Promote Nuclear Training in Asia</h1>
            <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, visited Singapore. He signed an agreement with officials. The goal is to improve nuclear training in the Asia region. An official from Singapore said that Singapore works hard to keep nuclear safety very high.</p>
            <p>News reports from media like United Daily News said that Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, Grace Fu, and IAEA head Rafael Mariano Grossi signed the agreement yesterday evening. This updates an older training plan called the Third Country Training Programme. They hope to make nuclear-related skills better in the region. This includes improving how they check and understand radiation in the environment.</p>
            <p>Before, Singapore and the IAEA had this training program from 2015 to 2020. They offered training to more than 140 people from 27 countries. The training was about topics like nuclear medicine, nuclear laws, food safety, and controlling pests. For the next five years, the IAEA and Singapore will keep working together. They will create training programs to make the region stronger in areas like human health, using radiation in industry, and checking environmental radiation.</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that Singapore joined the IAEA in 1967. Since then, it has been a member of the IAEA's main decision-making group five times. Singapore helps to make sure nuclear technology is used safely and peacefully. Minister Grace Fu said that Singapore supports the IAEA's efforts to use nuclear energy safely and peacefully around the world. As a responsible country, Singapore actively helps to promote and maintain high nuclear safety standards in Asia and globally.</p>
            <p>Mr. Grossi spoke at the National University of Singapore. After his talk, he said in an interview that the IAEA's work is growing. By updating the plan with Singapore, they want to make sure their work together includes new areas. This was Mr. Grossi's first time visiting Singapore. He met with Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, and other officials who work with energy and technology.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Singapore has not yet decided if it will use nuclear energy. However, it might use nuclear energy in the future if the technology becomes safe and useful enough. Mr. Grossi said that countries in Southeast Asia are looking into different ways to produce nuclear power. He added that Singapore has good technology and a good system.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Lawrence Wong wrote on Facebook that Singapore is looking for ways to get energy that creates less carbon. He said Singapore will continue to work with the IAEA to get better at this and keep high safety rules. (Edited by Tang Shengyang) July 26, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Over 100,000 Chinese Men in Secret Filming Group; Weibo May Be Hiding the News</h1>
            <p>Recently, people in China said on social media that a group called "MaskPark Tree Hole Forum" has more than 100,000 Chinese men. This group shares videos that were filmed in secret. These videos show unknown women filmed in public places and women known to the filmer. Many people talked about this topic on Weibo, even more than the most popular topic. But this news did not appear on Weibo's list of popular topics. People think Weibo might be stopping the news from spreading.</p>
            <p>Southern Metropolis Daily reported on July 25 that many people posted online about "MaskPark Tree Hole Forum." This group is outside China and has over 100,000 Chinese men who share secret videos. The group has 20 smaller parts, all about adult content. The biggest part of the group has 900,000 members.</p>
            <p>Some people said that members of this group upload videos of women they filmed without permission. Pictures shared online showed small cameras hidden inside things like water cups and lighters. Some cameras filmed all day and night. The filming happened in public bathrooms, subways, and shopping centers. The women filmed were of different ages; some were even children. Also, some members uploaded private pictures of their ex-girlfriends, girlfriends, wives, daughters, and other family members.</p>
            <p>The report quoted a person named Momo, who knows about the group. She said this secret filming group shared many videos of strangers' private body parts. Some of these private videos could be sold for money. This also led to people selling hidden cameras. Momo said, "People in the group would contact sellers to buy these hidden cameras. Before, you could find about 10 groups like this. The biggest one had 220,000 members."</p>
            <p>The report said this issue was on social media's popular topics on July 18 and 23. After that, the group put up backup websites to avoid being closed. Now, the biggest "MaskPark Tree Hole Forum" group has been shut down. But sources say many smaller groups still exist.</p>
            <p>One woman who was a victim said that in May this year, she got a message from an unknown account. The person said they had her private videos and photos and gave her the website link to the "MaskPark Tree Hole Forum" group. She found her private photos, videos, and social media pages posted in the group by her ex-boyfriend.</p>
            <p>The victim said her ex-boyfriend deleted the proof. Because of this, when she reported it to the police later, nothing happened. She said the members of the group were very careful. They could not take screenshots of chats in the group. All members used fake names and only talked through IDs, which made it very hard to find them.</p>
            <p>She noticed that in early May, there were over 80,000 members. By the end of June, before the news came out, the number of members was more than 100,000.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Beijing News wrote an opinion piece. It said that even though Telegram's company and computers are in other countries, and people can use fake names to hide, many of the people who uploaded, shared, or made money from these videos, and the victims, might be in China. So, they should follow Chinese law. It said that people who are doing illegal things "should be arrested quickly."</p>
            <p>Now, many people on Chinese social media want more Chinese news companies to report on this issue. Many people also talked about the "Little Cabbage" event in China in 2022. They also mentioned the BBC's report in 2023 about a group of Chinese men in Japan who sold secretly filmed videos. They are asking for people to pay attention to the problem of secret filming.</p>
            <p>Three years ago, Phoenix Weekly reported about an online group in China called "Little Cabbage." It had about 50,000 members. People in this group called underage girls "little cabbages." They would talk to these girls and then ask them for private photos. After that, they would sell these private photos in the group.</p>
            <p>In 2023, the BBC reported that Chinese people in Japan were selling short videos that showed bad acts. These videos were often filmed in public places like subways and buses in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. They could get 30 to 100 videos each month from people in China. The website had over 10,000 members who paid money, and most of them were Chinese men.</p>
            <p>As of noon today, the news topic "Overseas forum spreads large number of Chinese women's private photos" had 250 million views on Weibo and 260,000 discussions. But it was not on Weibo's list of popular topics. The most popular topic on Weibo's list only had 120 million views and 38,000 discussions. (Edited by Zhang Shuling) July 26, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Election Worker in Hualien Removed for Stamping Voter Seals on Separate Paper</h1>
            <p>Today, people in Hualien voted to decide if a lawmaker should leave office. At a voting place in Fengshan Activity Center, an election worker used voters' stamps on another piece of A4 paper. The worker said it was to count how many people voted. People asked, "Are they trying to keep a list of us?" The Election Commission in Hualien County said the worker was immediately removed from their job.</p>
            <p>Lawmaker Chen Pei-yu from the Democratic Progressive Party heard from people that the election worker in Fengshan Activity Center did something strange. After the worker stamped a voter's seal on the official list, they also stamped it on a separate A4 paper. The worker said it was to count the number of people who voted.</p>
            <p>When voters asked about it there, the election worker said, "All the paper will go back to the election center. It has no legal power." When people asked to destroy the papers right there, the election worker said, "The election center has already taken them and will deal with them later. Thank you for asking and for telling us."</p>
            <p>People who complained asked, "Did the election worker make a mistake, or did a boss tell them to do this? Is this used to track people? This kind of action is bad for democracy and fair rules. Hualien is really too much."</p>
            <p>About these complaints, Li Wei, the head of the Hualien County Election Commission, told news reporters that this worker was in charge of the voting place. When voters get their ballot, election workers usually stamp or sign the voter list. This helps to count how many people voted. But stamping on white paper should be something that person did on their own. It was the first time they heard about it. They think the worker might not have had enough experience.</p>
            <p>Li Wei said that at about 1 PM, the election worker was removed from their job, and someone else took their place. They have also kept the papers as proof. A special group will meet to decide what to do next. Also, this might be against laws about personal information or laws about fair voting. So, after they collect all the facts, they will send the case to the district prosecutor's office. (Edited by Huang Shiya) July 26, 2025.</p>
