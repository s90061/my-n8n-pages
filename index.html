            <h1>After Mid-Autumn Festival, Egg Supply Goes Up, Price Drops by NT$2 per Catty</h1>
            <p>After the Mid-Autumn Festival, there are more eggs available. The Taipei Egg Dealers' Association decided today to lower both the farm price and the wholesale price by NT$2 per catty.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture shared new information about egg production and sales. There are now 37.06 million laying hens. Every day, they can provide 126,000 boxes of eggs (200 eggs per box). This is the first time the supply has increased after staying at 124,000 boxes for seven weeks. The current supply is 6,000 boxes (1.2 million eggs) more than the daily need of 120,000 boxes.</p>
            <p>Lin Tian-lai, the chairman of the Taipei Egg Dealers' Association, told the media that after the Mid-Autumn Festival, people usually buy fewer eggs. So, starting today, the farm price will drop from NT$33.5 to NT$31.5 per catty. Tomorrow, the wholesale price will drop from NT$43 to NT$41.</p>
            <p>Taipei is the city where most eggs are sold in Taiwan. The prices set by the Taipei Egg Dealers' Association are often used as a guide by other cities and counties.</p>

The total money from these sales was over NT$4.14 billion.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Land Administration Bureau explained that today, with supervision from the Anti-Corruption Office and the Accounting Office, they finished the public bidding for the leftover land in the "Taichung City Shui-nan Airport Original Site District Rezoning Area" and the compensation land in the "Taichung City 13th Da-ching Urban Land Consolidation Area" and "Taichung City 14th Mei-he Village Urban Land Consolidation Area."</p>

It will also be used for public construction projects, helping the whole area grow, so all citizens can benefit from the development.</p>
