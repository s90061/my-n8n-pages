            <h1>Korean Media: Taiwan's GDP Per Person Will Overtake Korea's; Wu Cheng-wen: Korea is Also a Partner</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 17 (CNA) â€“ Korean news reports say that Taiwan's GDP per person is expected to be higher than South Korea's this year. This is because TSMC is helping Taiwan's industries join the AI supply chain. Wu Cheng-wen, who leads the National Science and Technology Council, said that fast computing needs DRAM memory. He also said that Korea's HBM memory is important for Taiwan. He hopes Korea will also be strong and be a key partner in the democratic supply chain.</p>
            <p>Korean media reported that in 2025, Korea's GDP per person is expected to be lower than Taiwan's. This would be the first time in 22 years. Experts say that TSMC is making Taiwan's tech companies very important in the world's AI supply chain. This could make the difference in GDP per person between Taiwan and Korea bigger.</p>
            <p>According to The Korea Economic Daily, Korea's GDP per person in 2025 is expected to be $37,430. This is less than Taiwan's expected GDP per person, which is $38,066.</p>
            <p>Today, Wu Cheng-wen spoke after the 17th meeting of the National Science and Technology Council. When asked about Taiwan possibly having a higher GDP per person than Korea, he said that Taiwan does not need to see Korea as a rival. Korea is also a partner for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng-wen gave an example. For fast computing systems, DRAM memory is always used. Korea's HBM memory is a very important partner for Taiwan. He hopes Korea will also work hard.</p>
            <p>Wu Cheng-wen said, 'Don't feel sad if Taiwan's economy grows more than Korea's. That's not good.' He hopes Korea does well and continues to be a good partner for Taiwan. He hopes Korea will be as strong as Taiwan and an important partner in the democratic supply chain.</p>

            <h1>3,000-Year-Old Gold Bracelet Missing from Egyptian Museum; Airports and Ports Increase Searches</h1>
            <p>Cairo, September 17 (CNA) â€“ The Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities has announced that a 3,000-year-old gold bracelet is missing. It was in a repair lab at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the bracelet is a gold band with round blue lapis lazuli beads. It is from the time of Pharaoh Amenemope, who ruled during Egypt's 21st dynasty (between 1070 and 945 BC).</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Antiquities did not say when the item was last seen in a statement given last night.</p>
            <p>The Ministry said that an internal investigation has started. All offices that deal with old things at Egypt's airports, sea ports, and land borders have been told about the missing bracelet.</p>
            <p>The Ministry also said that they did not tell the public about this immediately to help the investigation. Now, they are checking all the items in the lab.</p>
            <p>The Egyptian Museum in Tahrir Square has more than 170,000 old items. This includes the famous gold burial mask of Pharaoh Amenemope.</p>
