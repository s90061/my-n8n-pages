            <h1>12 Migrants Missing After Jumping From Boat Near Balearic Islands</h1>
            <p>Spanish officials said today that 12 migrants disappeared after jumping from a boat. This happened while they were traveling to the Balearic Islands, a popular tourist spot in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

            <h1>India Stops Sending Packages to US Due to Trump's Tariff Rules</h1>
            <p>The Indian government announced today that it will stop sending packages to the United States. This decision comes because of problems caused by President Donald Trump's tariff rules.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that India made this announcement less than a week before new rules from the Trump administration take effect. These new rules will remove special tax exemptions for some small packages.</p>
            <p>India's Ministry of Communications said that the US authorities have not given enough information about important processes. These processes include how to collect tariffs (taxes) and how to handle money transfers. Because of this, India will stop related services.</p>
            <p>The Indian Postal Department stated that starting August 25th, they will stop accepting "all types of postal items" sent to the US. However, letters, documents, and gifts worth less than 100 US dollars (about 3,036 New Taiwan dollars) are still allowed.</p>
            <p>Many European postal and delivery companies have also done similar things. For example, La Poste, the French postal service, recently said it would stop sending packages to the US starting August 25th.</p>
            <p>Based on an order signed by Trump, starting August 29th, packages sent to the US through channels other than the international postal network will have all normal tariffs applied if they are worth 800 US dollars or less.</p>
