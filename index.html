            <h1>US Plans New Rules to Stop Chinese Equipment in Undersea Cables</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 16, Central News Agency) The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said today that it is planning to make new rules. These rules would stop companies from connecting undersea communication cables that use Chinese technology or equipment to the United States.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a statement: "In recent years, we have seen that undersea cable systems are at risk from foreign enemies, like China. So, we are taking action to protect our undersea cables. This will keep them safe from damage and attacks by foreign enemies and from online and physical dangers."</p>
            <p>For many years, the US has been worried about China's role in handling internet traffic. They are also concerned about possible spying.</p>
            <p>The US has many worries about the safety of data on over 400 undersea cables. These cables carry 99% of all international internet traffic.</p>
            <p>The FCC will also ask for ideas on how to make undersea cables safer. They want to know how to protect them more from equipment used by foreign enemies. They will look into other ways to protect the cables.</p>
            <p>Before this, two undersea fiber optic communication cables in the Baltic Sea were cut. This made officials start an investigation to see if someone caused the damage. In 2023, Taiwan said that two Chinese ships cut the only two internet cables to the Matsu Islands. (Translator: Ji Jinling / Editor: Chen Zhengjian) 1140717</p>
