            <h1>Philippines: Protests Over Water Project Scandal, Military on High Alert</h1>
            <p>Recently, many people in the Philippines have protested. This happened because of a corruption problem with water projects. The Philippine military is now on "red alert." This means they are ready to stop anyone who tries to take over the government.</p>
            <p>Francel Margareth Padilla, who speaks for the Philippine military, said today on a radio show that the army has been on "red alert" since September 12. They are ready to help the police keep peace and order in the country.</p>
            <p>But Padilla also said that this is a normal safety step for the military. People should not be worried.</p>
            <p>"Red alert" is the highest level of safety for the Philippine military. All soldiers must be ready, and they cannot take time off.</p>
            <p>These protests started because of a problem in August. Money for water projects was stolen. At least 15 building companies are thought to have worked with government workers and lawmakers. They took money for the projects. This caused bad work and even "fake projects" that had money but were never built.</p>
            <p>The country's money department believes that bad building work has cost the Philippines about 118.5 billion pesos (around 62.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars) since 2023.</p>
            <p>Many places in the Philippines flood often. Low areas can even flood up to one story high. This has caused people to die and lose their things many times. People were already very angry. Also, some family members of the building companies showed off their money online. This made everyone even angrier. So, many protests happened in the main city area of Manila recently.</p>
            <p>News reports say that groups who do not like President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. have asked the military to stop supporting the government. They want the military to try and take power.</p>
            <p>Since 1986, the Philippines has had two big "People Power" movements. One of these made Marcos Jr.'s father lose power. There have also been more than 10 times when the military tried to take power but failed. Talking about the military taking power is still a sensitive topic in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Defense Minister Gilberto Teodoro and Army Chief Romeo Brawner Jr. made a statement together on September 12. They said that the army is always loyal to the country and its laws.</p>
            <p>These protests might continue. Padilla said that the military is working closely with the police and other government groups. They are watching to make sure bad groups or people planning trouble do not join the protests to try and take over the government.</p>
            <p>She said that the military respects people's right to protest peacefully. But they will not let anyone cause violence or try to break the country apart.</p>

            <h1>Mongolian Boy with Cleft Lip and Palate Wants to Help Others After Leaving "Alien" Label</h1>
            <p>Tamir Buyan is a 15-year-old boy from Mongolia. When he was young, some people called him an "alien" because he was born with a cleft lip and palate. After five operations and getting better, he can now smile. He has stopped feeling bad about what people said. He says that having a cleft lip and palate makes him special, not worse. He believes it is actually a good thing. He hopes to help other people in the future, like holding an umbrella for them.</p>
            <p>Today, the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation held an event for their 2026 charity calendar. They gave awards and started selling the calendar. Twelve artists with face and head conditions from Taiwan and other countries spoke. They asked everyone to buy the charity calendar. This is to encourage people with face and head conditions to bravely follow their dreams. Tamir Buyan, from Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, was one of the winners from another country. He wore traditional Mongolian clothes and flew 3417 kilometers to Taiwan to get his award.</p>
            <p>Buyan had problems from birth because of his cleft lip and palate. He remembers when he was a small child playing outside. Some children from his neighborhood called him an "alien" to his face. He was only five years old and felt sad and helpless. Luckily, Buyan had a very smart mother. His mother changed the mean words into encouraging ones. She told young Buyan that aliens are very smart and can make flying machines to fly in the sky.</p>
            <p>Buyan got help from the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation for more than 10 years. The foundation gave free medical help. Also, their trained medical team in Mongolia helped him. Because of this, Buyan got the best medical care in his own country. After five operations and getting better, he now has a smile like everyone else. He wants to tell other people with face and head conditions, "You are strong, and you are beautiful just as you are."</p>
            <p>This deep understanding and kindness come from Buyan's past. He used to feel ashamed. Now, he does not care what other people say. Buyan says that being different does not make you weak. Instead, it is a good thing. "Be proud of your story, and never be afraid to show how special you are." His parents are also proud of him because he went from being sad to being sure of himself.</p>
            <p>Buyan's award-winning drawing shows a doctor holding an umbrella. This means the people who have helped him and been kind to him in his life. He says he hopes to be someone who can hold an umbrella for others in the future. Buyan's story shows his own strength. It also shows how good it is when different countries work together to help with medicine. Now, he uses his art to give hope and power to the world.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-ling, who leads the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation, said this is the 22nd year they have made their charity calendar. By selling the calendar, they help people see how much people with face and head conditions can do. They give them courage and help them bravely follow their dreams. They help them become the person they want to be. She asked everyone to buy the charity calendar to support people with face and head conditions.</p>
