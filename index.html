            <h1>Ko Wen-je Says Lin Chin-jung Took Ying Hsiao-wei's Request in Jinghua City Case; Lin Denies It</h1>
            <p>Former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je said that former Taipei Deputy Mayor Lin Chin-jung helped Taipei City Councilor Ying Hsiao-wei with a matter about the Jinghua City project. Ko Wen-je also hinted that Lin Chin-jung might not have told the truth in court. Today, Lin Chin-jung said this was not true. He stated that what he said in court was the same as what the Ministry of Interior thought. Lin believes Ko Wen-je is trying to hurt his reputation as a witness.</p>
            <p>The Taipei court is looking into the Jinghua City case. Yesterday, the court watched videos and listened to recordings of former Taipei Deputy Mayor Peng Chen-sheng's talks with police. The court also called former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who is currently in jail. Ko Wen-je wrote on Facebook about his time in court. He said that when Lin Chin-jung was Taipei's Deputy Mayor and also the head of the city's planning committee, he looked at a meeting request, a complaint, and a suggestion from Ms. Ying Hsiao-wei, a city councilor from the KMT party.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je said that Lin Chin-jung claimed you could not get more building space (ÂÆπÁ©çÁçéÂãµ) by using Article 24 of the Urban Planning Act. But, Ko said, all the workers from the Taipei City Urban Development Department believed you could. Ko Wen-je then said Lin Chin-jung "lied in court" and that his lawyer would bring more proof.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung is now the Deputy Mayor of Kaohsiung. This morning, he released a statement. He said that he never took any requests or helped with any talks for Ying Hsiao-wei about the Jinghua City case. Between June and August in 2018, the Taipei City Urban Development Department was showing a plan to the public. This plan was about changing the main and detailed plans for urban development in the Songshan area. The department also held meetings to explain the plan. During this time, any group could share their thoughts.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung explained that Jinghua City Company sent in a request while the plan was public. After that, he was in charge of the Taipei City Urban Planning Committee. All the committee members shared their ideas, and in the end, they did not agree with Jinghua City Company's ideas. They kept the first decision.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je said that Taipei City government workers all said that you could get more building space according to Article 24 of the Urban Planning Act. But Lin Chin-jung told the court that rules about getting more building space should follow local laws or city rules. Lin Chin-jung answered that his words in court are the same as an official letter the Ministry of Interior sent to all cities and counties last year on May 14. They are also the same as what the Control Yuan said in January last year about the Jinghua City case.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung stressed that he told the court that any extra building space in detailed plans must not go beyond the rules set by the Urban Planning Act's local laws or city self-governing rules. Taipei City already has its own "Taipei City Urban Planning Enforcement Self-Governing Regulations" and "Taipei City Land Use Zoning Control Self-Governing Regulations." So, when someone asks for more building space for a building project, they must follow these city rules. They should not go past what the city rules say. Also, if someone wants to plan or change a detailed plan themselves (following Article 24 of the Urban Planning Act) to get other types of extra building space, there must be clear rules for this.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung thinks that what he said in court is the same as what the Ministry of Interior told all cities and counties on May 14 last year. It also matches what the Control Yuan said in January last year about the Jinghua City case. So, Ko Wen-je saying he "lied in court" is a clear sign that Ko is purposely trying to attack a witness.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Taiwan Thinks China's Military Exercise Spending Grew by Almost 40% in 2024</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that Taiwan believes China spent around 21 billion US dollars (about 647 billion New Taiwan dollars) last year on military training in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, South China Sea, and Western Pacific. This is almost 40% more than in 2023. Taiwan made this guess by watching China's military planes and ships and by adding up costs like fuel.</p>
            <p>Reuters got a private study from Taiwan's military. Four officials from Taiwan confirmed it. China is doing more and more military exercises. This makes other countries in the area and the US worried. This study helps us understand where China's money for defense might be going.</p>
            <p>Last year, China said its defense budget was about 1.67 trillion Chinese Yuan (about 7.2 trillion New Taiwan dollars). But, many foreign officials in Western countries think China's official numbers are too low. China also does not say exactly how it spends its defense money.</p>
            <p>Reuters said that China's Ministry of National Defense and the office that deals with Taiwan did not answer their questions about this. Reuters also could not check if Taiwan's estimated numbers were correct on their own. Some experts said that the way the study figured out the costs makes sense. But, because some small details are hard to check, some parts of the study must be guesses.</p>
            <p>This month, Taiwan's military created a report about China's military movements. They looked at information from Taiwan's tracking of China's air and sea actions last year. These actions happened in the Bohai Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and Western Pacific. Then, they guessed the costs based on how much fuel and other things were used each hour.</p>
            <p>The report and officials who heard about it said that China's military spent about 152 billion Chinese Yuan (21.25 billion US dollars) on air and sea training in those areas last year. This amount includes money for repairs and paying soldiers.</p>
            <p>Reuters used this study to guess that the money spent on these exercises was about 9% of China's military spending last year. This is more than the 7% that was guessed for 2023 using the same method.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense gave a statement to Reuters. It said, "China keeps making its military bigger and doing things that cause problems in a subtle way. This greatly hurts peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific area." The ministry did not directly talk about the military spending and numbers in the report.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hsiao Praises Good Farmers' and Fishermen's Groups; Says They Help New Ideas in Agriculture</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Agriculture honored farmers' and fishermen's groups that did very well in helping with money matters in farming. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said that these groups are good friends to farmers and fishermen. She also said they help new ideas in agriculture grow faster. She hopes these groups will support young people to work in farming, which will bring new life to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture held its 19th Agricultural Finance Awards today. They gave out ten different awards, like the "Award for Great Work." Sixty-nine farmers' and fishermen's groups won awards. They were good at running their groups, stopping bad money tricks, and helping with farm insurance.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao went to the event and gave a speech. She said that these awards have been given for almost 20 years. They show how Taiwan's farming money system has changed and become better. She added that giving awards to these groups is not just about good numbers. It shows a long-term promise to the land and to the farmers and fishermen. She said these groups are not just places for money; they are the most trusted friends for farmers and fishermen.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said that farmers' and fishermen's groups know how farmers and fishermen live their daily lives. They know when different crops grow in different seasons. They also know when farmers need money. If there is bad weather or if market prices change, these groups always help quickly. She said this friendly way of handling money is the most important part of Taiwan's farming money system. It also strongly helps Taiwan's agriculture grow for a long time.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao pointed out that the world is changing very fast. Prices are going up, how goods are made and sent is changing, and the climate is different. Taiwan is facing many natural problems. But, she said, these problems can also bring new chances. For example, using more digital tools and trying to have zero carbon pollution are goals that everyone around the world is working on. Farming money groups should not just be good friends to farmers and fishermen. They should also help new ideas in farming grow more quickly.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao used a story about a "cat" to explain. She said, "We should all be like cats. We don't just catch mice in the countryside. We also need to jump very quickly, many times our own height. Sometimes, we need to watch quietly and wait for the right moment. This is like how farmers' and fishermen's groups work. They need to be flexible and strong so they can find chances when things change. They also need to be there for farmers when they need support and help."</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said that farming is the foundation of Taiwan, and farmers and fishermen are the most valuable people. Since President Lai Ching-te and she started their jobs, they have worked to make Taiwan better at competing with other countries. Making the farming money system modern and part of the world is also a key part of this. She hopes that farmers' and fishermen's groups will not only keep farmers and fishermen safe but also help young people to join farming. This will bring new energy, life, and power to Taiwan.</p>
