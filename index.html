<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te stated on Sunday that Taiwan is "of course" a country. He argued that China lacks both historical and legal evidence to support its claims of sovereignty over the island, strongly rejecting Beijing's increasing political and military pressure.

China views democratically-governed Taiwan as "sacred" Chinese territory, asserting it has belonged to China since ancient times and is merely one of its provinces, with no right to be called a state.

President Lai and his administration firmly reject this perspective and have repeatedly offered talks with China, which have been declined. China labels Lai a "separatist."

In the first of a series of ten speeches titled "uniting the country," Lai discussed Taiwan's history, including the ancient connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesian groups, such as native Hawaiians. He used this to illustrate what he believes is Taiwan's distinct development separate from China.

He added that the people of Taiwan have a history of resisting invasion, citing uprisings against Japan's colonial rule from 1895-1945. Furthermore, under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for a mere eight years.

"Of course, Taiwan is a country," Lai declared during a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, also highlighting its presidential elections. "But China insists that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. China maintains that the 1971 United Nations resolution, which removed Taipei's seat and gave it to Beijing, serves as one of the legal foundations for its claims.

Lai, who in March referred to China as a "hostile foreign force," asserted that Beijing's claim about the U.N. resolution being related to Taiwan's sovereignty was "totally wrong," as the resolution only addressed which government was represented at the organization.

Lai also emphasized that China's threat to Taiwan is real, pointing to Beijing's daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he asked, receiving applause.

The defeated Republic of China government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

**Stock market today: S&P 500, Nasdaq fall with focus on Trump Iran decision, Fed rate cuts, China chip tensions**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-sp-500-nasdaq-fall-with-focus-on-trump-iran-decision-fed-rate-cuts-china-chip-tensions-145802639.html">News Link</a>

US stocks turned mostly lower on Friday as investors navigated a flurry of developments across multiple fronts.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose nearly 0.2%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) erased its morning gains to fall 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.7%. All three major averages were set for weekly losses.

Among the various factors weighing on markets was the possibility of direct US military involvement in the Israel-Iran war, now in its second week. President Donald Trump, who returned to the White House on Friday after a summit in Europe, has yet to announce his decision on potential military action in the Middle East.

Adding to the uncertainty, the Wall Street Journal reported that the US is considering revoking waivers that allow global chipmakers to send American technology to China. This potential move could significantly impact chip giants like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM).

Meanwhile, investors are also closely watching for signs of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. Fed officials have indicated that they are prepared to lower rates if economic data shows a sustained slowdown in inflation. However, recent strong jobs data and persistent inflation readings have tempered expectations for immediate rate cuts.

In individual stock news, shares of Nvidia fell after the Wall Street Journal report. Other chipmakers also saw declines. Conversely, defense stocks rose on heightened geopolitical tensions.

The market remains volatile as investors try to make sense of these intertwined global and economic developments.

**Tencent Music Shares Double on Break From China Price Cut Script**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-music-shares-double-break-003025040.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- China tech investors, weary of the nation's constant price competition, can now look to a growing area that is thriving by moving in the opposite direction: online music. Tencent Music Entertainment Group's shares more than doubled, reaching their highest point in almost three years. This surge happened after the company reported strong earnings and surprisingly increased its subscription prices.

This move indicates a possible turning point for Chinese tech companies, which have largely focused on attracting users through aggressive price cutting. Tencent Music's success with higher prices suggests that some companies can now prioritize profitability over market share, especially after a period of strict regulatory crackdowns that affected many tech giants.

The company, a leading online music and audio entertainment platform in China, announced its first-quarter revenue grew by 20% to $1.1 billion, exceeding analysts' estimates. Net profit also rose significantly, driven by a 15% increase in online music paying users and a higher average revenue per paying user (ARPPU). This growth highlights the increasing willingness of Chinese consumers to pay for high-quality digital content.

Analysts view Tencent Music's strategy as a positive sign for the broader Chinese internet sector. It could encourage other tech firms to explore similar approaches, focusing on value and premium services rather than just competing on price. This shift could lead to more sustainable growth and healthier profit margins across the industry.

However, challenges remain. The Chinese economy faces various headwinds, and regulatory scrutiny, though less intense, still exists. Despite these factors, Tencent Music's recent performance offers a glimmer of hope for investors seeking more stable and profitable opportunities in China's dynamic tech landscape.
