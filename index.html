In April, people in the United States spent less money compared to previous months. This suggests that American consumers might be slowing down their spending habits. At the same time, inflation, which means prices are still going up, rose a little bit. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, an important measure of inflation, increased by 0.3% in April. Over the past year, the PCE index has gone up by 2.7%.

This news is important for the Federal Reserve, America's central bank. They are trying to lower inflation to their target of 2%. If spending slows down, it could help bring prices down further. However, because inflation is still above 2%, the Federal Reserve might not lower interest rates as quickly as some people hope. High interest rates make borrowing money more expensive, which can affect things like mortgages and car loans. Businesses are also seeing demand for goods and services cool off slightly, which could lead to some price adjustments.

**US Companies Slow Down on Adopting AI Technology**

After a quick start, many companies in the United States are now taking more time to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Businesses are becoming more careful, thinking about both the high costs and whether AI will really help them. While AI can make things like writing, coding, and data analysis faster, companies are finding it difficult to fit these new tools into their existing systems.

A recent survey shows that fewer US firms are planning to use AI for large projects this year compared to last year. Businesses are facing challenges such as the high price of powerful AI computer chips and finding employees with the right skills to manage AI. Also, many are still unsure about the exact return on investment from AI technology. This careful approach means that while AI is still growing, its spread into workplaces might be slower than first expected. Experts say that businesses will need to clearly see the benefits and find ways to make AI easy to use before it becomes common everywhere.

**Americans Ready to Travel This Summer Despite High Costs**

Millions of Americans are getting ready to travel this summer, even though prices for flights, hotels, and gasoline are quite high. According to AAA, a travel and auto club, a large number of people are planning trips, showing a strong desire to get away. This summer travel season is expected to be very busy, similar to how it was before the pandemic.

Most travelers, about 88%, plan to drive to their destinations. However, air travel is also expected to be very popular, with more people flying compared to last year. While demand for travel is high, so are the costs. Airline ticket prices are up, and hotel rates are higher in many popular areas. Gas prices have also risen recently, which adds to the total cost for those driving. Despite these higher expenses, many people are choosing to prioritize travel, making plans to visit friends and family or explore new places during the warmer months.
