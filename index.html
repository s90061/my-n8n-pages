            <h1>Kenting Park Office Works with Companies to Promote Eco-Tourism, Hopes to Solve Domestic Travel Problems</h1>
            <p>To help solve the problems with domestic tourism in Kenting, the Kenting National Park Headquarters (KNPQ) is working with companies and hotels. They want to encourage eco-tourism. Today, they signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with private companies at Dawan Grassland. They also showed special products from different communities. They hope this will bring new energy to local development.</p>
            <p>Chen Chien-lung, the director of KNPQ, spoke at the meeting. He said that KNPQ has been promoting community eco-tourism for 20 years, and the results have been very good. However, after the COVID-19 pandemic, domestic tourism faced challenges. So, they decided to work with companies and travel agencies. They hope more people can experience the beauty of nature.</p>
            <p>Huang Chin-fei, the head of the Institute of Science Education and Environmental Education at National Kaohsiung Normal University, said that countries around the world are focusing on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) and green management. This time, they helped communities and companies sign an MOU. People who join these tours can get a certificate for low-carbon travel training. This shows that travel can also be low-carbon.</p>
            <p>Today's event by KNPQ was mainly about promoting community eco-tourism. It showed how public and private groups can work together. They signed an MOU, presented community products, held a market and fun activities, and had a coloring contest. All these activities helped them achieve their goal of friendly, low-carbon, and long-lasting tourism.</p>
            <p>At the event, KNPQ showed the new things they helped communities create. They held a "Community Product Launch Forum." The Longshui and Houwan communities both showed new products. The Longshui community made "puffed rice snacks" that mix old traditions with new ideas. They added a special local flavor, "chai-pu" (dried preserved radish). The Houwan community made a "cashew" series. This idea came from the shape of Houwan, which looks like a cashew. Many flavors include local fermented tofu.</p>
            <p>There was also a "Local Community Market." Ten community groups and eco-friendly farmers set up stalls to sell products and talk about their tours. Visitors could experience the local culture, buy eco-friendly products, and take home useful souvenirs with a story.</p>
            <p>According to KNPQ, the MOU signing ceremony was held by KNPQ and Kaohsiung Normal University. They worked with many different private companies. These include Huiying Biomedical Co., Ltd., Brain Future Development Co., Ltd., Go Around International Travel Agency, Grand Chiao Chemical Corporation, Tainan City Structural Engineering Association, Taichung City Structural Engineering Association, and Taiwan Provincial Structural Engineering Association.</p>

            <h1>Azerbaijan and Armenia Make Peace; EU Praises and Asks for Quick Agreement Action</h1>
            <p>Armenia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement with help from the United States. This agreement ends decades of fighting. Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, and Antonio Costa, the head of the European Council, praised this agreement. They also asked for the agreement to be put into action quickly.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Armenia, where most people are Christian, and Azerbaijan, where most people are Muslim, have had problems for a long time. These problems are about their borders and the status of ethnic groups living in separate areas within their countries.</p>
            <p>The two sides fought two wars over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is in Azerbaijan and has been a source of disagreement. In 2023, Azerbaijan quickly attacked and took back this area from Armenian forces. Because of this, more than 100,000 Armenian people had to leave their homes.</p>
            <p>Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa released a joint statement late yesterday. They said that the agreement signed by Armenia and Azerbaijan at the White House earlier is "a big step forward... that will create lasting and stable peace for both countries and the whole region."</p>
            <p>They also said, "Now, it is important to make sure that the agreed actions are carried out on time. This will ensure steady and continuous progress towards full normalization."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump, who helped with the agreement, said that Armenia and Azerbaijan promised to "stop all fighting forever, start business, travel, and diplomatic relations, and respect each other's independence and land."</p>

            <h1>Volcanic Ash from Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula Spreads; China Airlines Redirects 2 New York Flights</h1>
            <p>Because of volcanic ash from Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, China Airlines announced today that two flights had to change their routes to stay safe. These were flight CI011 from New York to Taoyuan on August 8th, and flight CI012 from Taoyuan to New York today. Because of this, the flight time was longer, and the amount of cargo they could carry was limited.</p>
            <p>For the affected passengers, China Airlines stated that they would try their best to arrange new flights or other ways to travel. Also, any luggage that was delayed will be sent to the passenger's chosen address later. China Airlines apologized for any trouble and thanked passengers for their cooperation and understanding.</p>
            <p>China Airlines also said they will keep watching for changes in this flight path in the near future and will change flight plans as needed. They suggest that passengers check the China Airlines website, download the Mobile APP, or use the text message alert function to find the latest flight changes.</p>
