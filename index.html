            <h1>20 People Die in Stampede at Gaza Aid Site, Aid Group Says It Was Planned</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Cairo/Jerusalem, July 16, combined foreign reports) The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by the United States, said that armed people purposefully caused trouble at one of their aid places today. This led to a large crowd pushing and trampling each other, and 20 Palestinians died.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the UN Human Rights Office stated that in the last six weeks, at least 875 people have died around aid distribution points and aid convoys in Gaza. Most of these deaths happened near GHF aid locations.</p>
            <p>The GHF, which is supported by Israel, reported that 19 people died in the crowd crush in Khan Younis city in southern Gaza. Another person died from a knife wound during the event.</p>
            <p>The GHF said in a statement, "We have good reasons to believe that some armed people in the crowd and others connected to Hamas intentionally caused this chaos."</p>
            <p>Palestinian medical staff told Reuters that at least 20 people died because they could not breathe. One medical worker said that a large number of people were pushed and squeezed together in a small area.</p>
            <p>The GHF started giving out food packages after Israel lifted its 11-week block on humanitarian supplies at the end of May. Before this, the GHF had denied criticism from the United Nations, saying the UN was spreading false information.</p>
            <p>The United Nations had said that the way GHF operates is "unsafe by nature" and does not follow fair humanitarian rules.</p>
            <p>The GHF uses private American security and delivery companies to move supplies. This way, they mostly avoid the system run by the United Nations. Israel says that this UN-led system allows armed groups, including Hamas, to take aid meant for normal people. Hamas denies this accusation.
