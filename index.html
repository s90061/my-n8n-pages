            <h1>Jiekou Fintech: We did nothing wrong. If Taishan keeps hurting us without talking, we will sue.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 24 (CNA) Taishan sued Jiekou Fintech company, asking for the return of NT$3.6 billion (about US$111 million) in investment money. The Taipei District Court first ruled in favor of Taishan and allowed them to carry out a temporary order. The second trial will start on July 28. Jiekou Fintech today had their lawyer make five points in a statement. They said Jiekou Fintech used the money legally and did nothing wrong. They also said that creating Jiekou Online Finance and the first civil trial ruling are not related at all.</p>
            <p>Jiekou Fintech said they wanted to talk with Taishan but got no answer. Jiekou Electronic Payment, a part of Jiekou Fintech, is almost making a profit. But Taishan chose to attack them unfairly through the media, which greatly hurts Jiekou Electronic Payment. If Taishan still refuses to talk and keeps harming Jiekou Fintech, Jiekou Fintech might ask Taishan for money to pay for the damage.</p>
            <p>Today, Jiekou Fintech's lawyer made the following statement:</p>
            <p>1. The agreement between Jiekou Fintech and Taishan company was an "investment agreement." So, Jiekou Fintech naturally used the investment money for the overall growth of the Jiekou group. Everything was done legally.</p>
            <p>2. In August 2023, Taishan company sued Jiekou Fintech in the Taipei District Court, asking for the investment money back. Because of this lawsuit, the stock exchange thought Jiekou Fintech's ownership was unclear and refused Jiekou Fintech's plan to be listed. To meet shareholders' hopes for being listed, Jiekou Online Financial Technology Co., Ltd. (Jiekou Online Finance) was created. The plan was for Jiekou Online Finance to be the main company to be listed, with Jiekou Fintech as the biggest shareholder. This plan had already started, and it was reported to the stock exchange. It has nothing to do with the first civil trial ruling between Jiekou Fintech and Taishan company.</p>
            <p>3. Jiekou Fintech has always been open to talking with Taishan company to solve the problem. But they have never received an answer from Taishan company. Until now, Taishan company not only refuses to talk but also keeps using the media to spread false information that hurts Jiekou Fintech and its other companies. Jiekou Fintech truly does not understand their goal. What Taishan company is doing is not how a company should normally run, and it does not protect the interests of all Taishan company shareholders. Jiekou Fintech still hopes to solve the problem and already offered a settlement plan to Taishan company on July 17, 2025. However, they have not yet received any answer from Taishan company.</p>
            <p>4. Jiekou Electronic Payment, a part of Jiekou Fintech, has been successful for a long time and remains the top e-payment company. In the first half of this year, they only lost NT$19 million, which means they are almost making a profit. Their future looks good. Taishan company does not want to solve the problem by talking. Instead, they chose to attack unfairly through the media, which has seriously hurt Jiekou Electronic Payment's interests. If Taishan company still refuses to talk and keeps harming Jiekou Fintech, Jiekou Fintech might ask Taishan company for money to pay for the damage.</p>
            <p>5. About the civil lawsuit between Jiekou Fintech and Taishan company, Jiekou Fintech repeats that they did nothing wrong and do not agree with the reasons given in the first trial's ruling. Those reasons do not help solve the disagreement. The second trial will begin on July 28. Jiekou Fintech hopes that the court will be fair to them, as they have worked hard and done nothing wrong.

            <h1>Education Minister calls China's actions "savage and thuggish" after they tried to steal a congratulatory message from Taiwan's Universiade Taekwondo team.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 24 (CNA) Taiwan's Taekwondo team won a silver medal at the World University Games. However, two Chinese people tried to take a congratulatory message from the Minister of Education. Education Minister Cheng Eng-yao said today that China often interferes with Taiwan's athletes. He called their actions "savage and thuggish," saying that such things would not happen in modern democratic countries.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Taekwondo team won a silver medal today at the World University Games in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. But after they won, two Chinese individuals tried to grab the congratulatory message from the Education Minister that was meant for the athletes. They also argued with Taiwanese reporters.</p>
            <p>Before attending a ceremony for school principals today, Cheng Eng-yao spoke to the media. When asked about the event, he strongly criticized China's actions.</p>
            <p>Cheng Eng-yao said that China has often acted unfairly and caused trouble at international sports events. They always take the "Olympic model" to an extreme. Taiwan rented a place from German private groups to give athletes physical therapy and mental support. China also protested this. Later, Taiwan's representative in Germany, Hsieh Chih-wei, spoke to the mayor of the host city, who then apologized.</p>
            <p>When asked how he felt about the congratulatory message being taken, Cheng Eng-yao thought for a moment. He said his first reaction was anger. He called such behavior "savage" and "thuggish," saying it should not happen in a modern, democratic country.</p>
            <p>Cheng Eng-yao also mentioned that during the Universiade games, students and Taiwanese people living abroad cheered "Go Taiwan!" This also caused a bad reaction from Chinese people there. He said that at a competition where athletes from all over the world join, they should receive applause and honor. Sports events should not be places for political fights. He strongly criticized the actions and hoped that the organizers would punish China in some way.</p>
            <p>Cheng Eng-yao said that Premier Cho Jung-tai, in a meeting this morning, specifically praised the Sports Administration for how they handled the situation. During his interview, Cheng Eng-yao also thanked the Taiwanese reporters who helped stop the Chinese people during the event. (Edited by Li Shu-hua) 20250724</p>

            <h1>Some recall voting places will change on July 26; Central Election Commission suggests 3 ways to check the location.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 24 (CNA) The recall vote on July 26 is coming soon, and there are rumors online that "Taichung voting places have been moved to faraway areas." The Central Election Commission (CEC) said today that there are 5,947 voting places in 9 counties and cities across the country. Some voting places have changed. People can check their voting notice, look online, or ask their local town, township, or district office to confirm the location before going to vote.</p>
            <p>The CEC said in a press release today that the recall votes for 24 Kuomintang lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an will take place on July 26. Voting will be from 8 AM to 4 PM. People should bring their national ID card, personal seal (chop), and voting notice. They should go to the voting place listed on their voting notice.</p>
            <p>The CEC also said that they offer a voting place search service on their official website. People can go online to find the voting place, its full address, and a Google Map. Or they can ask their local town, township, or district office for the voting place location.</p>
            <p>The CEC stated that the 5,947 voting places in 9 counties and cities across Taiwan on July 26 are mostly the same as those used for the 2024 presidential and legislative elections. However, voting places are borrowed temporarily, and their locations change a little each time. If the usual place cannot be used, the town, township, or district office will find a suitable new place nearby, considering people's voting habits and ease of access.</p>
            <p>The CEC said that since it is summer vacation, some school buildings are being repaired or used for events. Because of this, some voting places have changed slightly.</p>
            <p>The CEC said that for voting places that are not using the same location as the last election, they have asked city and county election commissions to work with town, township, and district offices. They will spread the word more through village and neighborhood offices' broadcast systems, social media, and local cable TV. Before voting day, they will put up notices at the old voting place's entrance or in clear spots nearby to tell people the new location. On voting day, special staff will also be at the old voting place to tell or guide voters to the correct voting location. (Edited by Zhai Ssu-chia) 20250724</p>
