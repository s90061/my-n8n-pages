            <h1>Details of US-Europe Trade Deal Revealed; Most European Stocks Close Higher</h1>
            <p>The United States and the European Union shared the details of their trade agreement today. Because of this, most goods that the EU sends to the US will have a 15% tax. The uncertainty about how much tax the US would add is now over. This caused most major stock markets in Europe to close with higher prices today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 21.06 points, or 0.23%. It closed at 9309.20 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up a little, by 16.37 points, or 0.07%. It closed at 24293.34 points.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine's Security: Reuters Says Europe Could Send Troops, Led by US</h1>
            <p>Today, the US military said that military leaders from the United States and some European countries have finished looking at military choices for Ukraine. These choices will be given to their national security advisors to think about. Sources said that one choice is to send European soldiers, and the United States would be in charge of them.</p>
            <p>US President Trump has promised to help protect Ukraine based on any agreement that ends Russia's war there. Reuters had reported earlier that military planners from the US and Europe had started looking into ways to keep Ukraine safe after the conflict.</p>
            <p>The US military said in a statement: "These choices will be given to each country's national security advisors. They will be considered carefully during ongoing diplomatic work."</p>
            <p>Defense leaders from the United States, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine met in Washington from August 19 to 21.</p>
            <p>Reuters was the first to report that the plan to be given to the national security advisors was ready.</p>
            <p>On August 18, Trump made a promise at a meeting to provide security for Kyiv. Ukraine and its European friends were happy about this, but many questions still remain.</p>
            <p>Officials had said that US and European planners need time to find out what plans are possible for the military and acceptable to the Kremlin.</p>
            <p>Sources told Reuters that one choice is to send European troops to Ukraine, but the United States would lead and control them.</p>
            <p>To help reach a peace agreement, Western countries want NATO nations to send troops. However, Russia's Foreign Ministry has said no to this idea.</p>
            <p>Trump had publicly said he would not send US troops to Ukraine. But on August 19, he seemed to open the door for the US to be involved in the military in other ways.</p>
            <p>The US could provide air support in different ways, such as giving Ukraine more defense systems against air attacks and creating a no-fly zone with US fighter jets.</p>

            <h1>Israel Prepares to Take Gaza City; Tells Hospitals and Aid Groups to Plan for Moving People</h1>
            <p>Today, the Israeli army said that they have told health workers and aid groups in the northern part of the Gaza Strip to start making plans to move people from the area. Israel is about to start a military attack to take over Gaza City, which is in the northern Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that, according to a statement from the Israeli army, Israeli military officials this week told "health leaders and international groups in the northern Gaza Strip... to get ready for people to move to the southern Gaza Strip."</p>
            <p>This week, Israel's Defense Ministry approved the attack to take Gaza City. They also called up about 60,000 reserve soldiers. This makes people worry more that the already terrible humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip will get even worse.</p>
            <p>The statement said that the Israeli army has told all groups involved to start planning to move hospital equipment to the southern Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>The statement also said: "Officials told health leaders that hospitals in the southern Gaza Strip are getting ready to take in sick and injured people, and more important medical equipment is being moved there."</p>
