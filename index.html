Many people around the world are changing their shopping habits because prices are still high. This means the cost of everyday items like food and energy continues to increase. As a result, households are carefully looking at their budgets.

People are spending less money on things that are not essential. For example, they might buy fewer new clothes, go out to eat less often, or cut down on entertainment. Instead, they are focusing their spending on basic necessities. This shift shows how rising costs are affecting the daily lives and choices of many families. Businesses are also noticing these changes in consumer behavior.

**AI is Changing Jobs and How We Work**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on the workplace, changing how many jobs are done. Companies are using AI tools to help with tasks that used to take a lot of human time, like writing reports or analyzing data.

This shift means that some parts of jobs might be taken over by AI. However, experts say that AI will also create new kinds of jobs, especially for people who can manage and work with AI systems. This new technology requires workers to learn new skills, like understanding AI tools and using them effectively. The goal is for people and AI to work together, making businesses more efficient and creating new opportunities in the future of work.

**Popular Cities Are Limiting Tourists**
Some of the world's most famous travel destinations are starting to put limits on how many tourists can visit. This is happening because many popular cities are facing "overtourism," which means too many visitors at one time. This can cause problems for local residents and the environment.

For example, Venice in Italy recently started charging a small fee for day-trippers â€“ people who visit for just one day. This is an effort to manage the large crowds and protect the city's unique history and delicate structures. Other places are also looking for ways to encourage more sustainable travel, where tourists respect the local culture and environment, ensuring these beautiful places can be enjoyed for many years to come.
