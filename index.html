            <h1>Israel Finance Minister: If Hamas Refuses to Surrender, Government Should Gradually Annex Gaza</h1>
            <p>Israel's Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said today that if the Palestinian group Hamas does not give up its weapons, the Israeli government should start taking over the Gaza Strip little by little.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Smotrich, a far-right politician, had previously strongly opposed any agreement with Hamas to end the war, which has lasted almost two years. Today, at a press conference in Jerusalem, he shared his plan to "win in Gaza before the end of the year."</p>
            <p>Smotrich's plan suggests that Hamas would get a final warning. They would be told to surrender, give up their weapons, and let go of all the people they took hostage when they attacked Israel in October 2023.</p>
            <p>If Hamas refuses, Smotrich advises that Israel should take over a part of Gaza each week for four weeks. This would give Israel full control over most of the Gaza Strip. According to Smotrich, Palestinian people would first be asked to move to the southern part of Gaza. Then, Israel would block off the northern and central areas to get rid of any remaining Hamas fighters. Finally, they would finish taking over the area.</p>
            <p>He said, "This can be done in three to four months."</p>
            <p>Right now, Israeli soldiers are strongly attacking Gaza City, the largest city in the Gaza Strip. They are trying to take control, and people are increasingly worried about the Palestinian people living there. During the war, most of the more than 2 million people in the Gaza Strip have had to leave their homes, and many have moved more than once.</p>
            <p>Smotrich has asked Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to "immediately accept this plan completely."</p>
            <p>Hamas has criticized this idea. They said it openly supports "forcing our people to move and clearing their race."</p>
            <p>In 2005, Israel removed its army and settlers from the Gaza Strip. Smotrich is one of several far-right members in Israel's current government who have said they support building settlements in Gaza again.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Beats Kenta Nishimoto, Reaches Badminton World Championships Men's Singles Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>In the BWF World Badminton Championships in France, Taiwan's top male player, Chou Tien-chen, won against Japan's Kenta Nishimoto today. The scores were 16-21, 21-15, and 21-13. This win means Chou will play in the men's singles quarterfinals. Next, he will face the famous Danish player Anders Antonsen.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen is currently ranked 6th in the world. He won a bronze medal at the World Championships in 2022. Even though he is now 35 years old, he is still playing very well in international badminton. This season, he reached the semifinals twice in Super 1000 events by the Badminton World Federation (BWF). He also came in second place at the Indonesia Open.</p>
            <p>Chou went to France for the World Championships this time. After winning two matches, he moved into the men's singles Round of 16. He was Taiwan's only hope in the singles event. Today, he played against Japan's Kenta Nishimoto. They know each other well and have played 15 times before. Chou had a slightly better record with 9 wins and 6 losses, but he had lost more often in their recent games.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first game, Chou led 4-1. But he could not keep his lead. After a short break, his opponent got a bigger lead. Chou could not catch up and lost the first game 16-21.</p>
            <p>Luckily, after a quick break, Chou Tien-chen played much better in the second game. He stayed in the lead for almost the whole game and even led by 9 points at one time. Even though his opponent saved 4 game points, Chou won 21-15, making the match score 1-1.</p>
            <p>In the final third game, Chou Tien-chen was ready. He played very well and kept control over his opponent. After the break, he also had a 9-point lead. He secured his win early, finishing the game 21-13. This is his sixth time reaching the men's singles quarterfinals at the World Championships. In his next match, he will play against Anders Antonsen from Denmark, who is ranked 2nd in the world. Chou will try his best to win a medal.</p>

            <h1>Former Director of Freeway Bureau Li Tai-ming Sentenced to 4 Years in Re-trial for Benefiting Contractor</h1>
            <p>The former head of the Freeway Bureau, Li Tai-ming, was accused of helping a construction company unfairly during a project. The project was to add the Wanli-Rueibin interchange to the East-West Expressway. In a third re-trial, the High Court decided that because the case has taken many years, Li Tai-ming's sentence should be reduced under the Speedy Trial Act. The court recently sentenced him to 4 years in prison. He can appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>The court's decision states that in 2008, Li Tai-ming, who was then the director of the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau under the Ministry of Transportation, and Hung Ming-chien, who was then the head of the bureau's Expansion Engineering Office, worked on the project to build the Dahua System Interchange on the Wanli-Rueibin Line of the East-West Expressway.</p>
            <p>The decision says that Li Tai-ming and Hung Ming-chien were accused of using false complaints from construction company owners, Mr. Chen and Mr. Su. Without proper review, they changed the method for building a retaining wall to a "static press piling" method. They also used a special bidding process to give work to the company at a lower price. This helped the company unfairly gain over 3.29 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors charged them with the crime of benefiting others illegally, which is part of the Anti-Corruption Act. The first trial at the New Taipei District Court found Li Tai-ming and others not guilty because there was not enough evidence. But after an appeal, the second trial at the Taiwan High Court changed the decision. Li Tai-ming was sentenced to 6 years in prison, Hung Ming-chien to 5 years and 6 months, Mr. Chen to 4 years, and Mr. Su to 3 years. The Supreme Court canceled these decisions three times and sent the case back to the Taiwan High Court for another re-trial.</p>
            <p>In the third re-trial, the High Court still found Li Tai-ming and the others guilty of benefiting others illegally. The court looked at each person's actions. Mr. Chen and Mr. Su are not public officials, so their sentences could be reduced. Also, because the case has taken many years, their sentences were reduced according to the Speedy Trial Act.</p>
            <p>In this third re-trial, Li Tai-ming was sentenced to 4 years in prison. Hung Ming-chien was sentenced to 3 years and 6 months. Mr. Chen was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months, and Mr. Su to 1 year and 6 months. Any money they gained illegally that has not been taken will be confiscated or claimed. They can appeal this decision.</p>
