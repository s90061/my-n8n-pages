            <h1>UN: Mail to US Drops 81% After Washington Ends Tax Break for Small Packages</h1>
            <p>The United Nations (UN) postal group, Universal Postal Union (UPU), said today that the number of mail items sent to the United States has fallen by 80%. This happened after the US stopped the tax-free rule for small packages at the end of August. Also, 88 postal companies around the world have fully or partly stopped sending these packages.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Trump government said in late July that from August 29, small packages sent to the US would no longer be tax-free. After this, postal companies in many countries, including Australia, the UK, France, Germany, India, Italy, and Japan, said they would stop accepting most packages for the US.</p>
            <p>The UPU stated that based on data exchanged by postal companies through its electronic network, the amount of mail sent to the US on August 29 dropped by 81% compared to a week before.</p>
            <p>What is more, 88 postal companies told the UPU that they have stopped some or all mail services to the US. They will wait until a solution is found. This includes Deutsche Post from Germany, Royal Mail from the UK, and two postal services from Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>
            <p>Masahiko Metoki, the Director General of the UPU, said in a statement that they are working to quickly create a technical solution. This solution will help send packages to the US again.</p>

            <h1>Kuo Yi-Hsuan Beats Hungarian Fighter 3-0, Reaches Round of 16 in WB Boxing World Championships</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's female boxer, Kuo Yi-Hsuan, won her match today at the WB Boxing World Championships in Liverpool, UK. She beat Kata Pap from Hungary 3-0 in the women's 51kg category, moving on to the round of 16. Her coach, Ko Wen-Ming, said he is happy to see her improve.</p>
            <p>The World Boxing (WB) group, now recognized by the International Olympic Committee, is holding its first World Boxing Championships in the UK this week. Taiwan's Kuo Yi-Hsuan competed in the women's 51kg category today in the round of 32. She fought against the strong Hungarian boxer, Kata Pap, hoping to move forward.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first round, Kuo Yi-Hsuan was not doing well, with only 2 judges scoring for her, making her trail 2-3. But in the second and third rounds, she changed her fighting style. She had also learned that Pap was an attacking fighter. So, Kuo Yi-Hsuan decided not to fight head-on. She got most judges to agree with her, changing the score and winning the match 3-0. This let her go to the round of 16.</p>
            <p>Coach Ko Wen-Ming spoke after the match and said that since Kuo Yi-Hsuan joined the national team, her skills have gotten better. Her footwork and fight plans are much improved, and he is very proud as a coach. "She fought very well this time. I think reaching the round of 16 is a great success," he said.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yi-Hsuan will next face Maxi Klotzer from Germany to try and reach the quarterfinals. They fought before in the Olympic qualifiers last year. In that match, Kuo Yi-Hsuan lost in the second round because the referee stopped the fight (RSC). Coach Ko hopes Kuo Yi-Hsuan will show a different fighting style this time. He said, "Back then, she was not as experienced. We will see if she can show something new this time."</p>

            <h1>Hengchun Pole Climbing Event: 17 Teams Compete, Shixin Life Ceremony Team Wins "Smooth Sailing" Flag</h1>
            <p>The pole climbing event in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County, took place tonight at Dongmen Square. Seventeen teams worked together to climb poles in a "human pyramid" style. Cheers filled the air, making it a lively event. The Shixin Life Ceremony Team was the first to reach the top and win the "Smooth Sailing" flag.</p>
            <p>The exciting pole climbing activity started at 8:50 PM with firecrackers. Thousands of people came to watch, cheering and blowing whistles loudly. The competition had two parts. In the first part, all 17 teams successfully took down a red ribbon to qualify.</p>
            <p>In the second part, teams needed to work together and also be strong and fast. They formed human pyramids to send a climber to the top of the pole. As they climbed, they used cloths to wipe off the butter on the pole. Team members climbed hard on their teammates' shoulders to reach for the "Smooth Sailing" flag. The team that reached the top first and hit the gong was the winner.</p>
            <p>During the competition, some teams slipped because of the butter. In the end, the Shixin Life Ceremony Team was the first to hit the gong at the top and win the "Smooth Sailing" flag.</p>
            <p>Besides the pole climbing competition, the Hengchun Township Office, which organized the event, set up a stage. Singers Hsu Fu-Kai and Su Yu-Jung performed, making the event even more lively.</p>
