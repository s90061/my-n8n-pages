            <h1>European School Publication Accused of Promoting Unification; Chen Chang-wen: Freedom of Speech</h1>
            <p>The chairman of Taipei European School, Chen Chang-wen, said today that the Constitution of the Republic of China gives people freedom of speech. This happened after some people criticized a school publication for promoting unification with China.</p>
            <p>News reports said that Chen Chang-wen used the school publication to talk about a wish for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work together for a future of diverse but unified relations. The publication also said that President Lai Ching-te's idea of calling China an "external hostile force" does not follow his duties under the Constitution.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Councilor Chao Yi-hsiang, who is from the Democratic Progressive Party, told Central News Agency that political ideas in a school publication are not right. He said it goes against the rule that schools should stay neutral in politics. He also pointed out that many students at Taipei European School have families from diplomatic or foreign business backgrounds. So, using a school publication to share political views on cross-strait relations seems to have a strong political purpose, which is very unsuitable.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Education stated that this is an internal school publication. They have asked the school to make its own decision and explain the situation to the public when it is appropriate.</p>

            <p>ASOBOiSM told the organizers today that when they performed in Taipei last year, they felt the audience's excitement and the energy of the city. They have always wanted to perform in Taiwan again. Even though this will be their first time performing in Tainan, they are very excited to share their music and create memories with their fans. They said, "I am truly looking forward to it!"</p>
            <p>The Fireball Festival will take place on November 22 and 23 at the Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. The list of performers includes the popular Korean band SE SO NEON and the Japanese band 04 Limited Sazabys, who are coming back to Taiwan after seven years.
