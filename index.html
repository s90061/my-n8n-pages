            <h1>US Nasdaq Reaches New High; Experts Say Taiwan Stocks Should Watch US Tech Company Reports This Week</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Chung Jung-feng, Taipei, July 20) On July 18, US stocks had mixed results. The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, rose sharply and reached a new high. TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADR) fell by 2.12%. Taiwan stock index futures closed at 23191 points in the night session, down 69 points. TSMC futures in the night session fell slightly by 5 points, closing at 1145 points. Foreign investors' net short positions in Taiwan stock index futures went down to 48,000 contracts.</p>
            <p>Experts say that the strong trend for Taiwan stocks can continue in the short term. In the short term, people should watch if positive feelings in the Taiwan stock market increase and if there is a large volume of trading. This week, the focus will be on the financial reports of US technology companies.</p>
            <p>On July 18, the US Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 142.30 points or 0.32%, closing at 44342.19 points. The S&P 500 index fell slightly by 0.57 points or 0.01%, closing at 6296.79 points. The Nasdaq index for technology stocks rose by 10.01 points or 0.05%, closing at 20895.66 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fell slightly by 5.018 points or 0.09%, closing at 5732.625 points.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan stock index futures, the three main types of investors (foreign investors, investment trusts, and dealers) had 779 fewer net long positions on July 18, bringing the total to 1042 contracts. Among them, foreign investors reduced their net short positions by 4207 contracts, to a total of 48,010 contracts.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's stock index rose by 269.85 points on July 18, closing at 23383.13 points. The total value of trades was NT$368.74 billion. The three main types of investors bought a total of NT$41.944 billion. Foreign investors bought NT$30.924 billion. Statistics show that foreign investors have bought Taiwan stocks for four days in a row.</p>
            <p>Chang Chih-ling, a fund manager at Prudential, said that recently, the mood for investing in Taiwan stocks has become stronger. This is because US stocks continue to reach new highs, the US has eased chip rules for China, and leading chip companies have reported good financial results. The positive trend in the short term can continue.</p>
            <p>Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting noted that the US lifted the ban on selling Nvidia H20 chips. This helped AI-related stocks to show good performance, and hardware companies benefited. Taiwan will certainly continue to profit.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead for Taiwan stocks, Chang Chih-ling said that US technology companies will release their financial reports this week. Reports and outlooks from companies like Tesla, Google, and Intel will be important for the market to watch. Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting also reminded investors to watch for rising positive feelings in the Taiwan stock market and if there is a very large amount of trading in the short term.</p>
            <p>Regarding tariffs, Chang Chih-ling pointed out that Taiwan's tariff data is not out yet. This is still one of the things that can affect how investors feel. It is also the season for ex-dividend and ex-right payments. The economic outlook for the third quarter still needs to be observed. Investors can look for stocks that offer protection from dividend yields and have other advantages.</p>
            <p>Yuanta Securities Investment Consulting stated that even though US President Trump has sent out many letters about tariffs, individual countries are all affected by tariffs. But overall, major countries are all affected, and the differences between them are not big.</p>
