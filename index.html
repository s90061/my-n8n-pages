            <h1>The U.S. May Offer Security Guarantees, Zelenskyy Calls It a "Historic" Decision</h1>
            <p>Before meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump tomorrow, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy today praised the U.S. decision to give security guarantees to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, he said on social media platform X, "The United States is ready to join in security guarantees for Ukraine. This is a historic decision."</p>
            <p>He wrote, "With our shared efforts, these security guarantees must be truly practical. They must offer protection from land, air, and sea, and European countries must also take part."</p>
            <p>A group of European allies of Ukraine, including leaders from the UK, France, and Germany, had a video meeting earlier today. Zelenskyy shared this message after the meeting.</p>

            <h1>Macron to Ask Trump About Ukraine Security Guarantees</h1>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron said today that European leaders will ask U.S. President Donald Trump about how much he supports security guarantees for Ukraine. Macron also said he does not think Russia truly wants peace.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that several European leaders will go with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Washington tomorrow to meet with Donald Trump. Macron made these comments at his summer home after a phone call to coordinate their shared position.</p>
            <p>Macron said, "Our goal is to show a united front between Europeans and Ukrainians." He also wants to ask the U.S. "to what extent" they are ready to help with Ukraine's security guarantees in a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>He added that just as Ukraine's land issues cannot be discussed without Ukraine, European security also "cannot be discussed without European countries being involved."</p>
            <p>Macron stressed that European leaders should be present at all future summits about the crisis in Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>U.S. Envoy Says Russia Agrees to Ukraine Getting NATO-like Collective Defense Guarantees</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Ukrainian and European leaders tomorrow to finalize details of possible security guarantees for Kyiv. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, said today that Trump might offer Ukraine protection similar to NATO's. He also said that Russia is open to this idea.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Witkoff told CNN's "State of the Union" program, "We got this promise: the U.S. can offer protection similar to Article 5. This is the first time we've heard that the Russians agree to this."</p>
            <p>Witkoff was talking about Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This article says that an armed attack against one member country should be seen as an armed attack against all member countries. He said that this kind of security guarantee could replace Ukraine becoming a NATO member, which Russian President Vladimir Putin has always been against.</p>
            <p>Russia started a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In recent months, Russia has been making progress in this war, which has caused the most deaths in Europe in 80 years.</p>
            <p>Witkoff and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio were in the meeting when Trump and Putin met in Alaga, U.S., on August 15. Today, before tomorrow's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European allied leaders, they gave several TV interviews.</p>
            <p>Rubio told Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures" program, "We believe we have made some progress, and now we need to follow up on it."</p>
            <p>He continued, "Eventually, this should lead to a meeting of three leaders: Zelenskyy, Putin, and President Trump. We might finish this there. But before we get to that stage, we need to make things move more in that direction."</p>
            <p>Russian officials do not want Western troops in Ukraine, but they have not ruled out giving security guarantees to Kyiv. After their meeting, when Trump and Putin appeared together, Putin said, "I agree with President Trump. He said today that Ukraine's security must be ensured no matter what. Of course, we are ready to work on this."</p>
            <p>Witkoff told "Fox News Sunday" that Russia has also agreed to pass a law saying they will not try to take more Ukrainian land by force.</p>
            <p>He said, "The Russians agreed that after a peace agreement, they would make a law to prevent or show that they will not try to take more Ukrainian land. This would also show that they will not cross any European borders."</p>
