            <h1>White House: Trump will not meet Putin alone; staff will be there</h1>
            <p>The White House has said that US President Donald Trump will not have a private meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin today. This meeting is taking place in Alaska. Instead, high-level staff will be with them for the whole meeting.</p>
            <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Trump's plane, Air Force One, that Trump will not meet Putin alone as planned. Instead, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will join them. More officials will also be at a lunch that follows the meeting.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that changing the meeting from a private one to a larger meeting with more people is a big change.</p>
            <p>During Trump's first time as president, his private talks with Putin were often secret. Only one translator was present, so it was often hard to know what they talked about.</p>
            <p>Also, staff found it hard to know if the two leaders agreed on anything. One time, after a meeting in Germany, Trump even asked his translator to destroy his notes.</p>
            <p>Having Rubio and Witkoff at the meeting in Alaska today means things will be clearer afterwards. This is especially true if Russia's explanation of what happened is different from the US view.</p>
            <p>One of the staff members will write down notes. This is very important for recording high-level meetings in real time.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Putin arrive in Alaska; talks will focus on stopping the Russia-Ukraine war</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Alaska today for talks. This is their first meeting since the war between Russia and Ukraine started. They are expected to talk about stopping the fighting in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war in Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. Trump arrived in Anchorage, Alaska's biggest city, this morning. Putin also arrived on his plane shortly after. They shook hands when they got off their planes and walked together on a red carpet, talking as they went. This is the first time the current presidents of the US and Russia have met since 2021.</p>
            <p>This important meeting was first planned to be just between Trump and Putin. But the plan changed at the last minute. CNN reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff will also join the meeting. This will help make details clearer after the meeting, especially if Russia's ideas about the meeting are different from those of the US.</p>
            <p>The meeting is happening at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. This is the biggest military base in Alaska. This base was used to listen to messages during the Cold War. It has a controlled air space, secure entrances, and can move military units quickly.</p>
            <p>Alaska used to belong to the Russian Empire. The United States bought this land in 1867.</p>

            <h1>US government may use Chips Act money to buy Intel shares to make more chips in the US</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News has reported, citing people who know about it, that the US Trump government is thinking about using money from the "Chips Act" to buy shares in Intel. This is part of a plan to help the semiconductor company and make the US better at making its own chips.</p>
            <p>These people said that the government is mainly discussing using Chips Act money to pay for at least some of the shares in Intel. These talks are still in the early stages, and other ideas are also being considered. It is not yet clear if the government will change existing money given to Intel into shares, find new money from other places, or use a mix of different ways to pay.</p>
            <p>After Bloomberg first reported that the US government was thinking about buying Intel shares, Intel's stock price went up a lot. It rose by 15% in two days, which could be its best week in many decades.</p>
            <p>If this deal happens, it will give Intel's money situation a big boost. People are watching these talks closely because Intel has been cutting jobs and spending less money recently. However, the people who know about this stressed that all the details, including where the money will come from, are still being discussed.</p>
            <p>Intel is already getting the most benefit from the "Chips Act." Under this plan, Intel has received $7.9 billion to help make semiconductors for business. It also got up to $3 billion for a special project from the Pentagon called "Secure Enclave." Also, Intel can ask for $11 billion in loans from the "Chips Act," which became law in 2022.</p>
            <p>Sources said that Intel's CEO is expected to stay in his job after meeting Trump, even though Trump had criticized him before for his links to Chinese companies.</p>
            <p>Another person who knows about the situation said that the Trump government is thinking about quickly using unused "Chips Act" money for things that are important for the national safety of the United States.</p>
            <p>The White House, the Commerce Department, and Intel have not said anything about these reports.</p>
