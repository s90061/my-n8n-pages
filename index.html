            <h1>Russia Attacks Kyiv at Night: 8 People Hurt, Including a Child</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, Ukraine's capital city, said today that Russia attacked Kyiv by air during the night. Eight people in an apartment building were hurt, and one of them was a 3-year-old child.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military department, wrote on Telegram. He said the air attack happened soon after midnight on the 27th. Four of the injured people are now in the hospital, and one of them is badly hurt.</p>
            <p>Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said that all the people who were hurt lived in a tall apartment building. This building is in the Darnytskyi area, on the left side of the Dnipro River in Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Klitschko wrote on Telegram: "The force of the explosion broke windows from the 6th floor to the 11th floor."</p>
            <p>After Ukraine's air force warned about Russian missile and drone attacks, Kyiv and most parts of Ukraine were under air attack warning for several hours during the night.</p>
            <p>Areas in western Ukraine, near Poland, were in danger of missile attacks. Because of this, Poland's army quickly sent out planes to protect its airspace. Poland is a member of NATO.</p>
            <p>Kropyvnytskyi, a city in central Ukraine, was also attacked. Andriy Raikovych, the governor of Kirovohrad region, said that emergency workers are on site. Information about any damage will be shared later today.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear how much damage this attack by Russia caused. Reuters staff in Kyiv heard loud explosions all night, which sounded like air defense systems working.</p>
            <p>Russia has not yet said anything about this attack. In the war that Russia started in February 2022, both Russia and Ukraine say they do not target normal people.</p>
            <p>The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused thousands of normal people to die. Most of them are Ukrainian citizens.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: A High-Level Party Worker Quitting Cannot Solve the Democratic Progressive Party's Problems</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 28 (CNA) After the big recall attempts failed, Lin Yu-chang, the Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), resigned today. Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), said that how the DPP deals with problems inside their party is their own business. But, he added, the DPP's duties to the country, society, and all Taiwanese people cannot be fixed just by a high-level party worker leaving their job.</p>
            <p>The first group of 24 KMT (Kuomintang) lawmakers and Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an, who was suspended, all had their recall cases rejected. Chen Chao-tzu, a DPP lawmaker, wrote on Facebook. She said that if the DPP changes its attitude and shows good will, they should release Ko Wen-je right away. They should also follow the law in cases and stop politics from getting involved. They should accept that the parliament reform has passed. And they should pass the surrogacy law quickly. If they do these things, the TPP and DPP can build a new relationship and work together on different issues.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang spoke this morning and said that people have clearly and strongly responded to the "big bad recall" started by the DPP. He has given a public statement. He asked President Lai Ching-te to apologize to all people right away. He also asked Premier Cho Jung-tai to step down and for the whole government to be changed. He told Ker Chien-ming, the leader of the DPP group in parliament, to know when to leave. Huang said these are the political duties the DPP must take on.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the DPP has seriously divided Taiwanese society recently. This has cost a huge amount that is hard to measure. The TPP puts the country's good before its own party's good or any person's good. They are happy to work with all political parties on any law that helps the country and its people.</p>
            <p>About the failed recalls, Lin Yu-chang, the DPP Secretary-General, said today that as the ruling party, the DPP must take responsibility. He already told President Lai Ching-te yesterday that he would resign. Huang Kuo-chang spoke on a show hosted by Huang Guang-chin and said that Lin Yu-chang's resignation only matters to the DPP. The Secretary-General is an internal party job. How the DPP handles problems inside is their own business, and Huang said, "I don't care about it at all." He repeated that the DPP's responsibilities to the country, society, and all Taiwanese people cannot be solved by just one high-level party worker quitting.</p>
            <p>About Chen Chao-tzu's post, Huang Kuo-chang said that anything not agreed upon or discussed by everyone is just a personal opinion. It is fine for each member to have some ideas or views. He said the TPP's position was very clear on the day of the vote. He added that the DPP must take on the most serious political responsibility.</p>
            <p>Also, media reports say that Huang Kuo-chang played a very important part in the big recall attempts. In the future, cooperation between the KMT and TPP might include supporting Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to become the KMT chairperson. This could be in exchange for a chance to run for New Taipei City Mayor in 2026, or even aiming for Lu and Huang to run for President and Vice President in 2028.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that in New Taipei, he will work hard to do what is needed and become the best choice. Between the TPP, himself, and the KMT, there is good will and honesty to talk about how to work together. He has an open and friendly attitude. The main goal is to make sure President Lai leaves office in 2028. So, he does not want New Taipei City to be controlled by the DPP in 2026, as this would stop their big goal for 2028.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said he will not tell the KMT what to do about their internal matters. He respects their democratic process within the party. He keeps in close touch with Lu Shiow-yen and they work well together. Lu Shiow-yen worked very hard on the recall cases for the three young lawmakers in Taichung City. Huang stressed that he is "not suitable and will absolutely not say anything" about whether the KMT will choose a new party leader or who wants to run for it.</p>

            <h1>Man Gets 1 Year 4 Months in Jail for Breaking Bones of Girlfriend's 4-Year-Old Son</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 28 (CNA) A man named Zang Jun-hao was accused of hitting his girlfriend's 4-year-old son with his hands. The boy was from her previous marriage. Zang also picked the boy up and threw him against a wall. This caused many broken bones in the boy's body. Both the first and second courts decided to give Zang 1 year and 4 months in prison. The Supreme Court recently said no to his appeal, so the decision is final.</p>
            <p>The court's decision said that Zang was dating a woman named Chen. Chen had a son from her last marriage. Early in the morning of February 25, 2024, Zang lost control of his feelings for an unknown reason. He hit the boy's head, face, and chin with his hands. Then he picked the boy up and hit him against a wall. This made the boy get many broken bones, bruises, and cuts on his body.</p>
            <p>The next morning, the principal of the boy's kindergarten noticed something was wrong. She saw the boy was throwing up, had a lump on his head, and clear bruises. He was quickly taken to the hospital for urgent help. After brain surgery, his life was saved. When the Tainan City Social Affairs Bureau found out, they told the police and prosecutors. The Tainan District Prosecutors Office then started an investigation and charged Zang with a crime.</p>
            <p>The first court decided that Zang was guilty of intentionally hurting a child, which is a crime by an adult against a child. Because of the Children and Youths Welfare and Rights Protection Act, his punishment should be made stronger. The court thought about how Zang did not control his feelings, and this caused serious harm to the boy's body and mind. This was a very serious situation. But the court also thought about Zang and Chen reaching an agreement. So, they decided to give him 1 year and 4 months in prison.</p>
            <p>Zang asked for the court's decision to be cancelled. He said he had already followed the agreement reached with the victim's family and also paid the boy's grandmother, who takes care of him. The Tainan High Court disagreed. It said the boy still needs early care and physical therapy. The first court's decision about the punishment was fair, so they said no to Zang's appeal. The Supreme Court also agreed that the first decision was correct and said no to the appeal, making the entire case final.</p>
