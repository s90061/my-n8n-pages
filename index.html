            <h1>Asian Stocks Mostly Up as Markets Await US Inflation Data and US-China Trade Talk Progress</h1>
            <p>Most Asian stock markets went up today. Investors are waiting for new information about prices in the US this week. They are also watching for news about the trade war between the US and China, as their agreement is ending soon.</p>
            <p>News from AFP says that people think US President Donald Trump will say that the 90-day agreement with China will continue. This agreement to stop new trade taxes was made in May. It will end tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Also, the US will share important information about consumer prices (CPI) tomorrow. This information might change what the US central bank (Fed) decides to do in the future. President Trump is asking the Fed to lower interest rates more and more.</p>
            <p>Many economic reports, especially the latest job numbers, show that the US economy is growing slower. Because of this, investors now believe more strongly that the Fed will lower borrowing costs at its meeting in September.</p>
            <p>The agreement between the US and China to stop trade taxes ends tomorrow. Investors think that both countries will agree to continue this agreement.</p>
            <p>Chris Weston, who leads research at Pepperstone Group in Australia, said: "The market fully expects the trade tax agreement to be extended for another 90 days."</p>
            <p>"So, if talks between the two countries do not completely fail, the news that the agreement will continue should not cause big changes in the market."</p>
            <p>Stock markets in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Wellington, and Taipei all closed higher today. However, markets in Seoul, Singapore, and Manila went down. The Tokyo stock market was closed today because of a national holiday.</p>

            <h1>Yilan County Leader Election: Huang Kuo-chang Ready to Talk with KMT About Working Together</h1>
            <p>Today, Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, talked about the 2026 Yilan County leader election. He said that his party is very willing to work with other parties, like the Kuomintang (KMT). He believes they can find the best way to cooperate for Yilan and its people, as long as it is good for the country, its people, and the land.</p>
            <p>He also said that everyone should join together for the public vote on August 23, no matter what party they belong to. He believes this is good for the land, the people, and the country. He thinks this same spirit can continue from 2026 to 2028. He hopes the other parties will work together with honesty and kindness. This way, the Democratic Progressive Party will not be able to have all the power and rule like a dictator in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The public vote on August 23 asks: "Do you agree that the third nuclear power plant should continue to operate after the government has said it is safe?" Huang Kuo-chang went to Yilan Sports Park this afternoon to promote the vote. Chen Wan-hui from the Taiwan People's Party in Yilan, Wu Tsung-hsien, a lawmaker from the KMT, and Chang Sheng-te, the speaker of the Yilan County Council, were also there. They held signs that said, "Let's fight for Taiwan, vote yes for the third nuclear power plant to continue on August 23."</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang spoke to reporters and said that the most important thing is to "fight for Taiwan" on August 23. He asked all Yilan residents to come out and vote. He said that people having power in Taiwan and Yilan is a belief they all share. He also told the people of Yilan to believe that "we love Yilan, we love this land, and we want to protect our fellow citizens in the same way."</p>

            <h1>Will Final Meeting Be with Trump? Cheng Li-chiun: Only After Talks Reach a Certain Point</h1>
            <p>When asked if a final meeting about fair trade taxes would involve talking with US President Trump, Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chiun said that it would only happen after talks have reached a certain point. She cannot speak for the US. Soon, she will talk with high-tech companies. She hopes that Taiwanese companies investing in the US can help Taiwan and the US work together on their supply chains. This could lead to better results in the trade talks.</p>
            <p>Today, Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chiun, Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin, Minister without Portfolio and Chief Negotiator Yang Jen-ni, Deputy Minister of Finance Ruan Ching-hua, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Chin-tsang, Deputy Minister of Labor Lee Chien-hung, and Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture Lin Chia-jung attended a press conference. They talked about the US fair trade tax issues and plans to help industries.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked if the final meeting about trade taxes would involve direct talks with President Trump.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun explained that the US wants other countries to open their markets more. This is very important for the talks. Some countries have no trade taxes on all products, while others have no taxes or special deals on 98% or 99% of products. Taiwan and the US are still talking. The US also hopes Taiwan will lower its taxes. But the details will only be shared after the final decision is made.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun also said that different countries reach agreements in different ways. Sometimes, President Trump talks with other presidents or meets with their representatives. The news about the agreement can be shared in different ways too, like a joint statement, a White House report, or a post by Trump on social media.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun said that Taiwan's technical talks have made some progress. Next, they need to talk more about Section 232, working together on supply chains, and investments. Taiwan hopes to lower trade taxes more and get better terms under Section 232. However, the exact way this will happen will be clear only after both sides agree. She cannot speak for the US right now. The final meeting will only be discussed when the talks have reached a certain stage.</p>
            <p>Also, reporters asked if the government could try to finish the talks within a month. They also asked if companies like TSMC or other related supply chain businesses might help the government in the talks.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun said that industries face pressure every day. The government will try its best to finish the talks quickly. But this depends on both sides. Last week, Taiwan started two video calls for talks. Talks can happen at any time, and this week, they might continue through video or in-person meetings.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-chiun said that the negotiation team will keep working to get better tax rates. They also want to create a fairer market for industries that invest in the US. Soon, she will talk with high-tech companies. She wants to see if, when these companies invest more in the US, they can work together to create more important supply chain partnerships between Taiwan and the US. This kind of plan for working together will help create a good base for the talks and get better results. It will also help build a strong partnership with the US in high technology.</p>
