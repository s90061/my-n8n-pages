            <h1>American Woman Caught Smuggling Drugs for Online Fiance</h1>
            <p>A woman from the United States has been caught trying to smuggle drugs into Taiwan. She said she did it to get money for a man she met online, her fiance, whom she had never seen in person. She accepted a job from someone who said they were her fiance's boss. This person asked her to carry drugs from Laos to Taiwan. The police and Taipei Customs found the drugs and arrested her. They also arrested a man named Ye, who was supposed to receive the drugs, for drug crimes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Bo-chuan, who leads the second team of the Aviation Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Brigade, spoke to the media. He said that in May, Taipei Customs and the Aviation Police Bureau's Security Inspection Team checked the luggage of an American woman (named C) at Taoyuan International Airport. She was transferring from Hong Kong to Taiwan. They found 4.237 kilograms of drugs hidden in her bags. Tests showed it was heroin, a strong illegal drug. This amount of heroin is worth over 30 million New Taiwan Dollars. The police sent the case to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office for breaking drug laws.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Bo-chuan said that C, who is about 50 years old, told them her story. She met her fiance online, but they never met face-to-face. Her fiance was in prison for a crime. Later, she met another person online who said they were her fiance's boss. This person said she needed to send money regularly to her fiance in prison. C was in debt and could not afford to send the money. So, she took the job offer from her fiance's "boss." She flew from the U.S. to Laos for a job interview. The company paid for her flights, food, and accommodation during her wait. She also got thousands of New Taiwan Dollars each day for her expenses.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Bo-chuan added that soon after, C was given a job. She got a suitcase with drugs hidden inside in Laos. Then, she flew to Taiwan, stopping in Hong Kong. The company also paid for her flights, food, and accommodation for this trip. She was told her payment would depend on how well she did the job. However, C could not clearly explain who her "boss" really was or what their job was. The job she described and the pay she was offered did not seem right. She also said she did not know about the drugs. The police did not believe her and arrested her on the spot.</p>
            <p>The Aviation Police Bureau quickly formed a special team. They asked Prosecutor Li Meng-ting from the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to lead the investigation. The special team carefully investigated the case. At the end of the same month, they found and arrested Mr. Ye in Zhongli District, Taoyuan City. He was the person in Taiwan who was supposed to receive the drugs. However, Mr. Ye said a friend asked him to pick up the luggage, and he did not know there were drugs inside. The police think that both C and Mr. Ye were working for a criminal group. After questioning, the police sent the case to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office for breaking drug laws. The woman was officially charged in September.</p>

            <h1>US Federal Reserve Will Likely Cut Interest Rates, Future Plans Unclear</h1>
            <p>The United States Federal Reserve (Fed) is expected to cut interest rates for the first time in 2025 tomorrow. However, there will be many challenges for its future plans. These challenges include increasing political pressure and possible disagreements within the Fed.</p>
            <p>Many people in the market believe that the Fed will announce a 0.25% interest rate cut after its two-day meeting. This is mainly because the job market in the U.S. is not strong.</p>
            <p>But how quickly and how much the interest rates will be cut in the future is still uncertain.</p>
            <p>First, some actions by former U.S. President Donald Trump have made decisions harder for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Just hours before officials were supposed to meet this morning, the situation was still very confusing.</p>
            <p>In recent months, Trump has been pushing the Fed to cut interest rates a lot. In August this year, he fired Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's board. This caused legal problems, and for a time, it seemed she might not be able to attend this meeting.</p>
            <p>Also, after another board member suddenly left last month, Trump suggested Stephen Miran, his main economic advisor, to join the Fed's board. He started a temporary process to appoint him. This appointment was only approved by the Senate at the last moment.</p>

            <h1>China's Shopping List is Key for Upcoming Trump-Xi Meeting</h1>
            <p>Details are now being finalized for U.S. President Trump's official visit to China. A Hong Kong newspaper reported that if China agrees to buy many American products, like Boeing planes and soybeans, this will be very important for Trump's visit to happen. This meeting might take place around the time of the APEC summit.</p>
            <p>If President Trump's visit happens, it will be the first time a U.S. President visits China since November 2017. It will also be Trump's second visit to China. This visit could also open the door for Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the U.S. next year.</p>
            <p>The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, reported on September 17th that China and the U.S. are in the final stages of discussing the plans for this official visit. Whether Trump will go depends on if there are many good results to announce to the public. China buying a lot of American products is a key part of this.</p>
            <p>An unnamed source in the report said that China and the U.S. have made big progress on Trump's visit. This progress happened after the fourth trade talks in Spain. The good results could include a new agreement for China to buy many American goods. It is very likely that American Boeing planes will be on this list.</p>
            <p>The source also said that China officially invited Trump for a state visit in the first week of September. This kind of invitation usually means the visit is "mostly confirmed" and plans are "very advanced." Both sides really want the "Trump-Xi Meeting" to happen. They hope this important diplomatic event will be seen as a big success in their own countries.</p>
            <p>It is thought that President Trump's visit to China will happen around the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. This meeting will be held in South Korea from October 31st to November 1st.</p>
            <p>Another unnamed source mentioned that besides visiting Beijing, China has offered for Trump to take a high-speed train to Shanghai during his visit.</p>
            <p>High-speed trains are seen as a great example of China's development and show its economic progress. The distance between Beijing and Shanghai is 1300 kilometers. The fastest high-speed train only takes 4 hours. This offer also aims to connect with the China International Import Expo, which starts on November 5th at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai.</p>
            <p>It is understood that this idea is being considered. The U.S. side is worried that this might be too tiring for President Trump, who is 79 years old. Others are also worried that this trip might look like a concession to China.</p>
            <p>"Ultimately, President Trump will decide where he wants to go and what he wants to do in China. He seems very excited about this visit himself, but he also needs to listen to his team," a source said.</p>
            <p>Earlier news from foreign media stated that American Boeing is talking with China about selling 500 commercial planes. If this deal happens, it would be the first time China has bought a large number of Boeing planes since Trump became president.</p>
            <p>China buying American soybeans is also a key item on the list. According to Reuters, in 2024, China bought about 20% of its total imported soybeans from the U.S. This is 41% less than the total in 2016. From January to July this year, China bought 42.3 million tons of soybeans from Brazil, but only 16.6 million tons from the U.S.</p>
