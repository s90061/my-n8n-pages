  <p>Lai Po-yu and Tsai Fu-cheng, two young Taiwanese badminton players, won the US Open. This is a BWF Super 300 level tournament. It's the first time in 15 years that a Taiwanese men's doubles team has won this event.</p>
  <p>Their coach said that Lai and Tsai play well together because their styles complete each other. They also have similar personalities, which helps them work as a team. They started playing badminton in kindergarten and have been partners since junior high school.</p>
  <p>In 2023, Lai Po-yu and Tsai Fu-cheng won a silver medal at the World Junior Championships in men's doubles. In 2024, Lai Po-yu won another silver medal in mixed doubles with a different partner. Their coach is happy about their win and believes they have a bright future, but they still need more practice in international games.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #333; border-bottom: 2px solid #eee; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 30px;">New Taipei City to Allow Big Motorcycles in Regular Parking Spots</h3>
  <p>Starting August 1st, big motorcycles in New Taipei City can park in regular motorcycle parking spots in Banqiao and Xindian districts. This is a test to make parking easier for them.</p>
  <p>The head of the New Taipei City Transportation Department, Chung Ming-shih, said that big motorcycles can already park in car spots. They also made special spots for big motorcycles in some areas. But because there aren't enough special spots, they are trying this new rule.</p>
  <p>When big motorcycles park in motorcycle spots, their whole body must stay within the lines. If a motorcycle is too long, it can park diagonally across two spots. However, no vehicles are allowed on sidewalks to keep them clear for people walking. If parked in a paid spot, it will cost NT$30 for every 4 hours.</p>

  <p>A Republican Senator from the US, Markwayne Mullin, said on Sunday that he thinks babies born to illegal immigrants in the US should also leave the country if their parents are deported.</p>
  <p>Mullin made these comments on a TV show. He was answering questions about a recent Supreme Court decision. This decision might allow President Trump to make a rule that limits who can be a US citizen by birth. This rule could start in some states soon.</p>
  <p>The TV show host asked Mullin what would happen to babies born in the US, who are currently US citizens, if their parents are deported. Mullin said, "Well, they should go where their parents go... why would you separate them?"</p>
  <p>The Supreme Court's decision on June 27th means that judges cannot stop Trump from making this rule across the whole country. This decision has made immigrants and lawyers confused about what might happen if birthright citizenship only applies in certain states.</p>
