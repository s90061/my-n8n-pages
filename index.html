            <h1>TPBL Warm-up Games to Start on October 3 in Pingtung, Helping Fans in Cities Without Professional Basketball Teams</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's professional basketball league, TPBL, will hold official warm-up games. These games will be from October 3 to 5. They will take place at the Pingtung County Stadium. The league's Vice Secretary-General, Cheng Po-jen, said that they want to play games in new places. This is to help fans in cities that do not have their own professional basketball teams.</p>
            <p>The first TPBL season finished in late June. After that, the league quickly started talking with P.LEAGUE+ about working together. But the two sides could not agree. So, they decided to go their separate ways again.</p>
            <p>TPBL is now getting ready for its new season. The official warm-up games will be in Pingtung from October 3 to 5. There will be seven teams, and each team will play two games. The schedule is two games on the first day, three games on the second, and two games on the third. The most important opening game will be between the New Taipei Kings and the Kaohsiung Aquas. This game will be a repeat of last season's championship match.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cheng Po-jen, the Vice Secretary-General of TPBL, said that the league had been talking about where to hold the warm-up games since the end of last season. The chairman, Mr. Chuang Ruei-hsiung, also talked to all seven teams. They wanted to move the games out of the cities where the teams usually play. This way, more people could experience professional basketball. They looked at stadiums in Pingtung and Taitung. The stadium in Taitung County needed repairs, so they chose Pingtung.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cheng Po-jen also said that they stopped planning the warm-up games for a while. This was because they were talking with the other league about working together. When they knew that the cooperation would not happen, they quickly checked for available dates at the stadium. The Pingtung County Government supported them and will help host the games. He said that the Pingtung Stadium was just fixed up, and it looks nice. He "hopes to help fans in cities that do not have professional basketball teams."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Says China's Claims About War Contributions Are "Ridiculous" and Against History</h1>
            <p>China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) said the Communist Party helped a lot in the war against Japan. Today, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said that these numbers are wrong. They said these claims are "ridiculous" and do not match history. The MAC said the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) cannot even name the big battles it started or joined. So, making up numbers is really funny.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of the 10th, the MAC wrote a strong reply to the numbers from the TAO's press conference. Earlier that morning, TAO spokesperson Chen Binhua said that the CCP led fights behind enemy lines. This was in cooperation with the Kuomintang (KMT), which led the fights on the main front. Together, they killed more than 697,000 Japanese soldiers.</p>
            <p>The MAC said that the TAO's false statement that "the CCP was the most important part of the Anti-Japanese War" is wrong. The claim that Communist troops killed more than 170,000 Japanese soldiers and another 527,000 (making a total of over 697,000) is completely against facts from history. This shows again that they are trying to trick themselves and others.</p>
            <p>The MAC explained that Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare said in 1964 that about 502,400 Japanese soldiers died in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Manchuria. During the war, General He Yingqin, who was the Army Commander at that time, wrote in his book "The Eight-Year War of Resistance" that about 480,000 Japanese soldiers died.</p>
            <p>The MAC also said that to kill over 697,000 Japanese soldiers, many big battles would have been needed. The government of the Republic of China has clear records of 22 major battles. But the CCP cannot even say which big battles they started or were part of, or how many enemies they killed in each battle. So, making up the number of over 697,000 is truly funny.</p>
            <p>The MAC made it clear that the government of the Republic of China led the war against Japan. The CCP only used that time to get more power for itself. They "stayed away from fighting and did not truly fight." Spreading wrong stories cannot hide the truth that the CCP did not help in the war. The numbers the TAO gave do not match history. Also, taking credit for all Japanese soldiers killed in mainland China is trying to trick themselves and makes them look foolish.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 10th, Chen Binhua said in his regular press conference, "During the 14-year-long, very difficult War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist Party showed the right way forward for China's fight. This was because of its excellent leaders and smart plans." He added, "The fighting behind enemy lines, led by the Chinese Communist Party, and the fighting on the main front, led by the Kuomintang, worked together to attack the enemy."</p>
            <p>Chen Binhua used numbers and said, "From September 1931 to September 1945, soldiers and people fighting against Japan in Northeast China killed over 170,000 Japanese soldiers. The Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and special fighting groups in South China killed over 527,000 Japanese soldiers. This hurt the Japanese attackers a lot and gave people more hope to fight. The large areas behind enemy lines fought against 60% of the Japanese troops in China and slowly became the most important fighting areas."</p>

            <h1>KMT and TPP Controlled Counties and Cities Ask for More or Same Government Funds</h1>
            <p>A new law about how the government shares money has made many city and county leaders unhappy. Today, 15 leaders and deputy leaders from cities and counties controlled by the KMT and TPP political parties held a meeting. They asked that local governments get more control over their own money. They also asked that special government funds and general help money be given out fairly by law. They want these amounts to only go up or stay the same, not go down, compared to before the new law.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance showed how much tax money from the central government each local government gets. Also, using population numbers from July, Taipei City will get the most money next year, over NT$114.92 billion. This means each person in Taipei will get NT$46,000. But New Taipei City, which has the most people, will get less than NT$24,000 per person. Because of problems with the new way of sharing money, Lianjiang County will actually get less money next year. So, the central government decided to first give Lianjiang County extra money to make sure it gets the same amount as before.</p>
            <p>Today, leaders from cities and counties led by the KMT and TPP met in Taichung. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen led the meeting. They held a press conference called "Fifteen Counties and Cities Speak Up! Protect Local Help Money." They released a statement with three main points.</p>
            <p>First, the reason for changing the law about sharing money is to make sure local governments can manage their own money. The special government funds and general help money should be given out fully and fairly, just as the law means. Also, it must be promised that the money from these two sources for each local government will only go up or stay the same, not go down, compared to before the law changed.</p>
            <p>Second, general help money should be given out using a clear, fair, and open way of calculating it. It should not become a system where the central government makes all the rules and checks things by itself, without a clear process.</p>
            <p>Third, the general help money and project money that the central government already agreed to give to local governments should be safe. They should not be cut, taken away, or given late. They asked the central government to quickly give all the money it promised. If not, local projects will be seriously affected.</p>
            <p>New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that how power is shared is very important. He asked if the central government should start to make changes. He said the central government should not offer things and then make local governments pay for them. Instead, they should talk fully, explain things clearly, and work on problems together. Second, general help money should not be given out based on requests. It should use a clear and open way of calculating it. This way, making plans for money and doing work will be easier to understand. The NT$34.5 billion that has not been given out yet should be given out fairly. It should also help small towns and counties that have money problems.</p>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said clearly, "Today we are here to make local governments strong against the central government. We want to fight for local areas to make their own decisions. We do not want to always be controlled by the central government or do what they want." He said they want to speak up for people who are struggling, for education, and for money for public transport. These are all important for people's lives.</p>
            <p>Changhua County Commissioner Wang Hui-mei said that local governments must manage their own money. The amount they get should not be less than before the law changed. It should not make them poorer. Yunlin County Commissioner Chang Li-shan said that power should be given to local areas. She also said it is not good for everyone if the central government unfairly holds back money. Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui asked that decisions not be hidden or made based on political parties.</p>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said, "We hope the central government will stop cutting the money it gives to local governments. We want them to follow the law's goal and the rules. We want them to be open and fair, just like they used to be when they helped local areas." She added that if local governments do well, the central government will also do well, and the country will do well. Everyone should work together.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, reporters asked about what Premier Cho Jung-tai said earlier. He said that if they had agreed to the Executive Yuan's review, these problems could have been solved. Reporters also asked if inviting cities and counties to talk now was too late. Chiang Wan-an said this was trying to avoid the real problem. He said if they truly want local governments to be self-governing and fix the money problems between the central and local governments, they should face the issue and solve it. They should have fewer political arguments and more solutions.</p>
            <p>Also, reporters asked about the formula for sharing money. Taoyuan Deputy Mayor Wang Ming-chu said that the Executive Yuan said there was a problem with the formula. But after Taoyuan City's Finance Department checked, they believe the formula is good. The formula is simple. The total amount for each of the 19 cities and counties is the bottom number. Cities like Taipei, Taichung, New Taipei, and Taoyuan have clear percentages for 90.5%. The formula is not the problem. But if the Executive Yuan wants to cause trouble and not give money, it means they want to cut money. This is not good for the country or for local areas.</p>
