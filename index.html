            <h1>C.C. Wei: Making Humanoid Robots is Hard, Future Business is Much Bigger Than Electric Cars</h1>
            <p>TSMC Chairman and CEO C.C. Wei said today that humanoid robots will not be a main driver for industry growth this year or maybe even next year (2026). This is because designing and making humanoid robots is very complex. However, he mentioned that one of his customers believes the future business opportunities for humanoid robots will be ten times bigger than for electric cars.</p>
            <p>TSMC held a meeting for investors this afternoon. People asked C.C. Wei about his thoughts on the future of humanoid robots. Wei said that it is too early to say that humanoid robots will be a big part of industry growth this year, and maybe even for 2026. He thinks that the first use of humanoid robots might be in healthcare.</p>
            <p>Wei joked that he might need healthcare from a humanoid robot one day. This made the investors laugh.</p>
            <p>He explained that humanoid robots need a "brain" (computer processor) and many sensors. Designing the software and hardware together is very hard. Also, because humanoid robots will work closely with people, their design needs to be very careful.</p>
            <p>But Wei repeated what a customer told him. This customer thinks that the electric car market is not big enough right now. They believe the robot market in the future could be ten times bigger than electric cars. Wei said, "I am very excited about this."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan-US Trade Talks Bring Food Safety Worries; Minister Chiu Tai-yuan Says Decisions Will Be Based on Science</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 17 (CNA) Talks between Taiwan and the US about trade rules have raised worries about food safety. There are rumors that Taiwan might allow more US ground beef and organs to enter, stop putting labels on where food comes from, and allow more Ractopamine in pig kidneys. The Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, said that all decisions will be based on scientific information. He added that the country's development and people's health will be the most important things.</p>
            <p>Today, Minister of Health and Welfare Chiu Tai-yuan went to the Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee. He gave a report and answered questions about two main topics: how hospitals deal with many injured people during big disasters, and how the talks with the US about trade rules will affect food safety in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Wang Yu-min, a lawmaker from the KMT party, said that during the Taiwan-US talks, people are most worried about food safety. She said there are recent rumors that the US wants to remove origin labels, allow US ground beef and organs, and raise the limit for Ractopamine in pig kidneys to 0.09 ppm. She asked the Ministry of Health and Welfare to explain clearly. She also noted that these requests might not follow current food safety laws and rules for medicine in animal products.</p>
            <p>Chiu Tai-yuan said that Taiwan is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). So, Taiwan will follow international rules. He said that the details of the talks are not public yet. The Ministry of Health and Welfare always puts "national development and protecting people's health first." All food safety policies will be based on international standards and scientific facts. They will also carefully consider risks.</p>
            <p>Jiang Zhi-gang, the head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), also said that food safety is always based on scientific analysis and checking risks. He added that people's health is the most important thing. All policy decisions will be based on scientific information. He explained that according to international rules, the talks are still private. The FDA, as a lower-level agency, will help the government with important national issues and talks.</p>

            <h1>US Fires Typhon Missile in Australia for the First Time Outside of America During Military Exercise</h1>
            <p>Canberra, July 17 (CNA) - In Australia, a large military exercise called "Talisman Sabre" is happening with other countries. During this exercise, the US Army fired a Typhon missile system for the first time outside of the US. This is also the second time this system has been used in the Indo-Pacific area, after being used in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>The EurAsian Times reported that the biggest Australian exercise, "Exercise Talisman Sabre 2025," has started recently. More than 35,000 military personnel from 19 countries are taking part.</p>
            <p>The report said that countries like the US, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga, and the UK are all involved in this exercise.</p>
            <p>The US Army and the Australian Army worked together to fire a live "Typhon" missile system in the Northern Territory. This system is a ground-based missile launcher that can hit targets at medium distances. This firing is a big event because it's the first time this missile system, which can also attack ships, has been fired outside of the US.</p>
            <p>The US Army announced that the firing was successful. They also said that the Typhon missile system belongs to the US military's 3rd Multi-Domain Task Force (MDTF). This test showed that the system works well in a real situation and helps the US and Australian armies work better together.</p>
            <p>It is important to remember that the Chinese People's Liberation Army did live-fire exercises near Australia and New Zealand a few months ago without giving enough warning. This caused tension in the Indo-Pacific area.</p>
            <p>Experts at that time said that China's exercises were a very clear show of its military power. They also showed that Beijing wants and is able to extend its power beyond its usual naval areas. Both Australia and New Zealand have said they are worried about China's quick growth in power in the Pacific.</p>
            <p>Because of this, firing the Typhon missile sends a message that the US and Australia are showing their military strength in the Indo-Pacific region. This action also matches the US goal of increasing its military presence in the Indo-Pacific to balance China's influence.</p>
