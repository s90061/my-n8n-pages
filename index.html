The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently announced that artificial intelligence (AI) could affect nearly 40% of all jobs worldwide. This new technology could change the job market in many countries. The IMFâ€™s head, Kristalina Georgieva, explained that while AI could boost productivity and economic growth, it also brings risks.

One major concern is that AI might worsen the gap between rich and poor. Many advanced economies, where AI is more developed, could see a higher percentage of jobs affected. For example, about 60% of jobs in these countries might be impacted. Some jobs could disappear, while others might change significantly.

In contrast, developing countries might experience less immediate impact from AI. This is because fewer jobs there are directly exposed to the technologyâ€™s changes. To manage these changes, the IMF suggests that governments should create policies. These policies should help people learn new skills and provide financial support for those who lose their jobs. The goal is to make sure AI benefits everyone and doesn't leave people behind.

**"Loud Thriving": A New Trend in the Workplace**

After trends like "quiet quitting" and "quiet firing," a new idea called "loud thriving" is gaining popularity in workplaces. "Quiet quitting" meant doing only the minimum required work, while "quiet firing" was when employers made conditions difficult for employees to encourage them to leave. Now, "loud thriving" is about employees openly showing their successes and actively working to improve their careers.

This trend involves workers talking more about their achievements, skills, and future goals with their managers and colleagues. Instead of quietly working in the background, people are making their efforts and ambitions visible. They are seeking out new projects, asking for promotions, and discussing their career paths more directly.

Experts say this shift is a response to how the job market has changed. With more remote work, it can be harder for employees to be noticed. "Loud thriving" helps individuals stay visible and ensures their hard work is recognized. It encourages people to take control of their careers and actively shape their professional future.

**Airlines Face Challenges Adopting Greener Fuels**

The airline industry is trying hard to reduce its carbon footprint by using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is made from sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, or even household trash, rather than fossil fuels. It can significantly cut down harmful emissions from flights. However, airlines face major difficulties in making this switch.

One main problem is the cost. SAF is currently much more expensive than traditional jet fuel, sometimes three to five times more. This makes it difficult for airlines to use it widely without increasing ticket prices significantly. Another issue is the limited supply. Not enough SAF is produced globally to meet the demand of the entire aviation industry. Factories need to be built, and supply chains developed, which takes time and investment.

Despite these challenges, governments and environmental groups are pushing for more SAF use. Many countries are setting goals for airlines to use a certain percentage of SAF in their fuel mix over the next few years. While it's a promising solution for cleaner air travel, the industry needs more innovation, investment, and government support to make SAF widely available and affordable.`;
