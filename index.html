            <h1>High Temperature Warnings for Taipei, New Taipei, and 5 Other Cities. Expert Says Hot Weather Until Mid-Autumn Festival.</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's weather agency has put out high temperature warnings for 7 cities and counties today. Weather expert Wu Derong said that it will be sunny and hot everywhere from today until the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 6th). He also said that a tropical storm might pass through the Philippines this week. Then, another tropical storm might form east of Taiwan, and we need to watch it closely.</p>
            <p>Today, the Central Weather Agency gave high temperature information. It will be hot everywhere. New Taipei City, Taichung City, and Tainan City have an "orange" warning. This means temperatures might reach 36 degrees Celsius for many days. Taipei City, Changhua County, Yunlin County, and Pingtung County have a "yellow" warning. This means temperatures might go above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, a professor from National Central University, wrote in his weather column today. He said that the latest weather models show that from today until October 6th (Mid-Autumn Festival), a high-pressure system from the Pacific will bring sunny and very hot weather. Temperatures in northern Taiwan will often reach 37 or 38 degrees Celsius. The sun's UV rays will be very strong around noon. People should protect themselves from the sun and heat stroke. There might be some short rain showers in mountain areas in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong also said that on October 4th and 5th, there will be more moisture from the south. This might bring some local rain to Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong pointed out that the latest weather maps from the US and Europe show a new tropical storm forming east of the Philippines later this week. Its path seems to be towards the northwest, passing through the Philippines and into the South China Sea. By the evening of the Mid-Autumn Festival (October 6th, 8 PM), it will have passed the north side of Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula. Another tropical storm will develop east of Taiwan, but its path is very unclear, so we need to keep watching.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that the latest forecast from the weather agency shows that Typhoon Bualoi is still affecting northern Vietnam today. It will become a tropical low-pressure system tomorrow. Middle Typhoon Kujira is very far from Taiwan and will change into a temperate cyclone.</p>

            <h1>UK Government May Make It Harder for Immigrants to Get Permanent Residency</h1>
            <p>Shabana Mahmood, the UK Home Secretary, said in a speech that the government plans to make it stricter for immigrants to apply for permanent residency. She said that applicants might need to show how they help British society as one of the new rules.</p>
            <p>This plan is the newest immigration rule from the Labour government. It is happening because a political party called "Reform UK" is becoming more popular. Reform UK has been talking a lot about immigration. This has made the Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, take a stronger stand on immigration.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that right now, most immigrants can apply for "indefinite leave to remain" after living in the UK for 5 years. If they get it, they can live in the UK forever.</p>
            <p>Today, Mahmood will attend the Labour Party conference for the first time as Home Secretary. According to parts of her speech released early by the Labour Party, the government is thinking about changing the rules. To get permanent residency, applicants would need to have paid social insurance, have no criminal record, and not be receiving money from welfare.</p>
            <p>Mahmood said they are thinking about only allowing people who speak English well and who have volunteered in their community.</p>
            <p>She announced that these ideas will be open for public discussion later this year.</p>
            <p>The Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, does not like immigration. They have been doing well in opinion polls. Last week, they said they might suggest getting rid of the "indefinite leave to remain" policy. Instead, they would use work visas that last for 5 years and can be renewed.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Keir Starmer said that the Reform UK party wants to remove many immigrants based on race. He said this would "break the country apart."</p>
            <p>Immigration has been one of the biggest concerns for British voters for a long time. Controlling the number of immigrants was a key reason why people voted for Brexit in 2016. However, after the UK officially left the European Union, the number of people coming into the country reached a new high.</p>

            <h1>Trump Orders Troops to Portland; Oregon State Sues to Stop It</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, US President Trump ordered American military troops to go to Portland, Oregon. Today, the authorities in Oregon filed a lawsuit to try and stop this.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that this is another similar action by the Republican president. Before this, he also sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington D.C., even though the local leaders (who are Democrats) did not want them there.</p>
            <p>Trump said that sending these troops is necessary to stop crime. He also said it is to stop protests against his plan to remove many immigrants, which many people disagree with.</p>
            <p>Today, Oregon and Portland authorities filed a lawsuit. They said that Trump is using too much power. They believe he is trying to make it normal for the military to do regular police work inside the country, especially in areas where his political opponents are in charge.</p>
            <p>Since Trump became president again in January, he has been strictly dealing with immigrants who do not have legal papers. But lawyers and groups that help people say this has caused many human rights problems.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Trump also promised to fight violent actions by what he calls a network of "domestic terrorists" from the left. However, people who criticize him believe these actions are meant to stop people from speaking against him.</p>
            <p>Oregon authorities said in their lawsuit that there is no need to send the National Guard to Portland. They said that, unlike what Trump claims, the protests against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) are small and peaceful.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit states that these protests usually have fewer than 30 people. Also, no arrests have been needed since the middle of June.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit also says that Trump's very strong military presence could make things worse and cause new problems.</p>
