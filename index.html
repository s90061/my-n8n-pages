            <h1>Magong has two safety issues overnight; police send quick response unit</h1>
            <p>Penghu County, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Magong had two public safety incidents one after another last night. First, it seemed like people were arguing with knives in front of Xiwei Great Temple. Then, late at night, gunshots were heard in front of a temple in Anshan. The police sent quick response teams and handled both unexpected problems successfully.</p>
            <p>Around 9:30 PM last night, the Magong Police Station received a report. It said that some people were fighting in front of Xiwei Great Temple, and someone was possibly shouting with a knife. The police quickly sent a quick response team. The head of the police station, Lu Wen-ting, also came to the scene. Seven police cars and almost 20 police officers who were working in the city also went to the scene at the same time. Luckily, the police quickly stepped in and calmed the situation. The incident ended well.</p>
            <p>Less than two hours later, around 11:20 PM, the police received another report. It said that gunshots were possibly heard in the square of a temple in the Anshan community. The Magong Police quick response team and officers from the Wen'ao Police Station quickly went to the scene to handle it.</p>
            <p>The police said that they did not find anyone involved in the incident at the scene, and no bullet casings were found. In the early morning, they went back to the place where it happened to search thoroughly, but they still did not find any evidence.

            <h1>Tseng Yu-chien plays Brahms' Violin Concerto again, compares it to running a marathon</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Violinist Tseng Yu-chien will play Brahms' "Violin Concerto" with conductor Jaap van Zweden and the Evergreen Symphony Orchestra. It has been six years since he last played this piece. Tseng Yu-chien said, "This piece is like a marathon for a violinist's body and will."</p>
            <p>Tseng Yu-chien, who won a silver prize at the International Tchaikovsky Violin Competition, told CNA that Brahms' "Violin Concerto" is a challenging and very lively classical piece. He said that this piece is more than 40 minutes long and gives no time to rest. "I must be fully focused and show deep feelings from the very first note until the end without relaxing," he said.</p>
            <p>To build up his strength for playing, Tseng Yu-chien practices the violin, swims in his community building, and exercises. People living there have even recognized him.</p>
            <p>Tseng Yu-chien said that playing Brahms' "Violin Concerto" again after several years helps him understand the music in new ways. He said this concerto is special because it is not just a piece of music, but a conversation. "This is not a piece where the violin plays alone. Both the orchestra and the violin are important, working together to move the music forward. It needs perfect teamwork," he said.</p>
            <p>Tseng Yu-chien pointed out that Brahms' violin concerto has a strong musical structure and deep feelings. It needs very good control of pitch, rhythm, and sound. "Not one note is extra," he said. "Because of this, every note must be perfect. Any small mistake will seem bigger. This is both a pressure and something to enjoy."</p>
            <p>Tseng Yu-chien said, "I like the pure and controlled feeling in Brahms' music. His romantic style is not grand; it is gentle and warm."</p>
            <p>Looking back, Tseng Yu-chien has played many of Brahms' sonatas and chamber music pieces over the past few years. He thinks these experiences have brought him closer to the composer's spirit. Tseng Yu-chien said that each performance is like getting to know Brahms again. "I used to think his music was very quiet and distant, but the more I play it, the more I feel that he was actually a very emotional person, but he expressed himself in a very deep and internal way."</p>
            <p>Tseng Yu-chien will play with Jaap van Zweden for the first time. He said that when he studied in New York, he often listened to the New York Philharmonic. "When I was at the Curtis Institute of Music, Jaap van Zweden was the music director. I was very impressed by how sensitive he was to small details, how well he understood the whole structure, and the energy he brought to rehearsals," Tseng Yu-chien said. He is very excited to work with the Evergreen Symphony Orchestra led by Jaap van Zweden.</p>
            <p>The concert "Conductor Jaap van Zweden, Tseng Yu-chien and ESO" will be on September 18 and 21 at the National Concert Hall in Taipei. Besides Brahms' Violin Concerto in D major, the program also includes Beethoven's "Egmont" Overture and Brahms' "Symphony No. 1" in the second half. (Editor: Kuan Chung-wei) 1140725</p>

            <h1>36 parks in Chiayi City will be cleared by the end of July to create a strong city</h1>
            <p>Chiayi City, July 25 (CNA) â€“ Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Chiayi City. Now, all parks except Chiayi Park and Metropolitan Forest Park, which are 36 parks in total, are expected to be cleared by the end of July. The city government is also planning to replant trees, take care of plants, and set up a system to warn about risks. This will make the city more able to recover from difficulties.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi City Government released a press statement today. After Typhoon Danas, roads in Chiayi City were blocked, streetlights were out, signs fell down, and even house roofs were blown away. The city looked very damaged. Because the city has many green areas, many trees planted along roads and in parks fell badly due to the strong winds during the typhoon.</p>
            <p>The city government stated that different parts of the city government worked quickly to check the damage and help. To deal with the huge task of clearing roads, the city government asked for help from outside. With help from the central government and other cities and counties, Chiayi City was able to fix traffic lights on main roads and important crossings within 5 days after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Min-hui said that Typhoon Danas greatly damaged the city. It also reminded them that a city's progress needs more than just buildings; it also needs to be strong. While working hard to fix the damage, the city government also talked deeply about plans to rebuild green spaces and plants. They made concrete plans for choosing trees, growing them, and later improving and caring for planting areas.</p>
            <p>Huang Min-hui said that they hope to make Chiayi City's parks and street tree systems stronger and last longer through a planned recovery. This way, the warning from this typhoon can help the city become more sustainable and strong in the future. </p>
            <p>The city government said that all walking paths in 38 parks in the city have now been cleared. Chiayi Park and Metropolitan Forest Park still need more time to be cleared because they are very large and have many trees. The other 36 parks are expected to be cleared by the end of July.
