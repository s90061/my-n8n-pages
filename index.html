            <h1>German Olympic Gold Medalist Dies in Pakistan Mountain Accident</h1>
            <p>A German Winter Olympic gold medalist, Laura Dahlmeier, has died. She was hit by a falling rock on a mountain in Pakistan. This was confirmed today by foreign news agencies in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Dahlmeier's management team, for the 31-year-old, confirmed her death in a statement released today. Her team said that rescue efforts were "completely impossible" because the area was too dangerous.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "The rescue operation for her failed, and this operation has stopped."</p>
            <p>The International Biathlon Union (IBU) said in a statement: "Laura's energy and her passion for life touched many people around the world."</p>
            <p>"Her important legacy in biathlon and outside of it will always be remembered. It will continue to inspire many athletes and adventurers in the future."</p>
            <p>Laura's friend and competitor, Czech athlete Gabriela Soukalova, wrote on social media: "This is very sad news. Laura will always be in my heart."</p>
            <p>Dahlmeier's team said on their official social media page that the accident happened around noon on July 28. It took place on Laila Peak, which is 5,700 meters high, in the Karakoram mountain range.</p>
            <p>Dahlmeier's climbing partner raised the alarm after reaching a safe area.</p>
            <p>Areeb Ahmed Mukhtar, a senior local official, told AFP: "We confirmed that a helicopter rescue was not possible."</p>
            <p>Dahlmeier's team said yesterday that "she was hit by a falling rock." Because there was a risk of more falling rocks and the area was "remote," no one could reach her location.</p>

            <h1>Private School Part-Time Teacher Pay Must Be Equal to Public Schools from August 1</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 31 (CNA) The Ministry of Education recently changed the "Regulations for Appointing Part-Time Teachers in Colleges and Universities." These new rules state that private schools must pay part-time teachers at least as much as public schools do. This rule will start on August 1st. The Ministry of Education will also give money to schools to help them pay the new higher rates.</p>
            <p>Because fewer children are being born, many private schools do not have enough money. They have not changed the hourly pay for part-time teachers. After many requests from education groups, the Ministry of Education changed the law. It now says that "the hourly pay for part-time teachers in private colleges and universities must not be lower than the amount paid in public colleges and universities." This will start on August 1st this year.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced today in a press release that to help private schools with money problems, they will increase the amount of money they give to schools for the pay difference. From August this year, for three years (until July 2028), the payment will increase from 50% or 70% to 90%.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that after the three-year support period, they will check the situation again. They will look at how private colleges are doing, their money, the quality of teaching, the number of full-time and part-time teachers, and government money. Then, they will decide what further help to give.</p>
