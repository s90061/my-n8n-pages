            <h1>Regulating Substances Similar to Etomidate: Opponents Say There is No Scientific Proof of Addiction</h1>
            <p>A new drug called etomidate e-cigarettes, also known as "zombie vape," is being used too much. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finished asking for opinions on adding three substances similar to etomidate to the controlled list. People who disagree say there is no scientific proof that these substances are addictive. They also say that these substances are not controlled by international rules, so Taiwan is making too many laws.</p>
            <p>In Taiwan, etomidate was first seen only as a controlled medicine. In November of last year, it became a Class 2 illegal drug. On July 4 this year, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Food and Drug Administration announced changes to the "Controlled Drug Classification and Items" list. They added three new substances similar to etomidate, like Butomidate. These are Dingtomidate, Trifluoroetomidate, and Fluoroetomidate. All of them are now listed as Class 2 controlled medicines.</p>
            <p>The new law was announced for 14 days, ending on July 18. People against it said there is no scientific proof of addiction, which goes against legal rules. To be listed as a controlled substance, it must be addictive and commonly misused. However, no studies on animals or humans currently show that these substances are addictive. The authorities only guessed their effects based on their "similar structure." This goes against fair rules and the rule that a crime must be clearly defined by law.</p>
            <p>Those who disagree also said that these substances are not controlled by the three main UN agreements on drugs. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) only found these substances in samples from East Asia. They did not say there was a risk of global misuse. If Taiwan is the first to add these as serious illegal drugs, it will not follow international rules. This could affect how different countries help each other with crime and how much people trust the legal system.</p>
            <p>The people against the law suggested that Dingtomidate, Trifluoroetomidate, and Fluoroetomidate should be put on a watch list for now. They believe there should be more studies on their effects and a check of their risks. They should be watched, not controlled immediately. Zhang Zhixu, who is a deputy leader in the FDA's controlled drugs section, told CNA reporters today that they only received this one opinion during the announcement period. He said that all opinions will be answered on the public policy online platform when the changes are officially announced.</p>
            <p>Regarding when the new rules will start, Zhang Zhixu said that all collected opinions will be sent to the Executive Yuan for approval and announcement. The official start date will be as announced by the Executive Yuan.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhixu pointed out that if someone brings in, sends out, makes, sells, or buys controlled medicines without a special license, they are breaking the rules for managing controlled medicines. They can be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000. If someone has a license but does not keep clear records of daily income, spending, destroying, losing, and keeping controlled medicines at their work place, they will also be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000.</p>
            <p>As for those with a controlled medicine license who do not report regularly, Zhang Zhixu said this also breaks the rules for managing controlled medicines. They can be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000. If someone uses controlled medicines for medical education research or tests without the Ministry of Health and Welfare's approval, they could be fined between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000.</p>

            <h1>Korean Father, 60s, Makes Gun and Shoots Son; Explosives Found at Home</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Liao Yu-yang, Seoul, July 21) A 63-year-old man in South Korea, Mr. A, is thought to have shot his son with a homemade gun at his own birthday party on the evening of July 20. He ran away but was caught by the police later. During the investigation, police found several homemade explosives hidden in his home. These explosives were set to blow up at noon today.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported that Mr. A is suspected of killing his 30-year-old son, Mr. B, with a homemade gun at his home on the 33rd floor of an apartment building in Incheon at around 9:31 PM on July 20. At that time, he was at a birthday party his son held for him. His daughter-in-law, two grandchildren, and friends were also there.</p>
            <p>After Mr. A committed the crime, the other people there hid in a room and called the police. Because they were not sure if Mr. A was still in the house, the police did not go in right away to avoid more injuries. After confirming that Mr. A had run away, they entered and sent Mr. B to the hospital. At that time, his heart had already stopped, and he later died.</p>
            <p>The police arrested Mr. A in Seoul at 12:20 AM today. During questioning, he said that the reason for the crime was problems in his family. He learned how to make the gun from YouTube. The bullets were hunting bullets he bought about 20 years ago and kept in a storage room. Investigations show that Mr. A used 3 bullets that day: one hit a room door, and two hit his son's chest. He still had 86 bullets left.</p>
            <p>Based on his confession, the police found 15 explosives made from plastic bottles, milk cartons, and other materials in Mr. A's home in Dobong-gu, Seoul. These explosives had ignition devices attached and were set to explode at 12 PM today. In his car, they found 2 homemade guns and 9 gun barrels. In his house, they also found 5 to 6 metal tubes that could be used to make guns.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Female Teachers Ask People to Return Home and Vote to Recall; Blue Camp Criticizes Using Teachers as Tools</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Lu Tai-cheng, Hualien County, July 21) Today, a group of female teachers, both retired and current, in Hualien asked people from Hualien living outside to come back home and vote to recall someone. They said, "Fu Kun-chi was chosen by Hualien people, so Hualien people have a duty to recall him." The KMT group in the Hualien County Council criticized this, saying it was "using children as hostages and making teachers into political tools."</p>
            <p>Yang Hua-mei, an independent Hualien County councilor, and Dr. Chen Yung-hsing, a former legislator, were with nine retired and current teachers at a press conference today. These teachers believe that education is not only about teaching facts, but more importantly, about building principles of honesty and following laws. As teachers, they should speak out and ask Hualien people living outsideâ€”whether students or workersâ€”to come home and vote. They should use their votes to keep their belief in honesty and lawfulness, so Hualien people can get back their respect and honor.</p>
            <p>A retired female elementary school teacher, Ms. Dai, said that Hualien has become less bright over the past 23 years. However, the fancy house of KMT legislator Fu Kun-chi is very grand, making it truly "poor Hualien, rich Fu Kun-chi." Fu Kun-chi was chosen by the people of Hualien, so Hualien people have a duty to recall him. History will record that "brave Hualien people ended the Fu family's rule in 2025."</p>
            <p>A retired female teacher, Ms. Hong, said that she never talked about politics in class. But changes over the past year have made her decide to speak up. She is asking Hualien people living outside to vote bravely, "to restart Hualien, protect Taiwan, and let children grow up safely in a land of freedom and justice."</p>
            <p>A current teacher who wished to remain unnamed said this is not a fight between political parties. Instead, it is a choice between caring for Hualien and giving up on Hualien. She asked Hualien people living outside to return home to vote on the 26th.</p>
            <p>The KMT group in the Hualien County Council responded with a press release. They said that education should not be used as a tool for fighting. Using children as hostages and making teachers into political tools is "the deepest betrayal of Hualien."</p>
            <p>The KMT group stated that at this important time, when Taiwanese society faces extreme political actions and a breakdown of values, they saw a heartbreaking press conference. Yang Hua-mei and Chen Yung-hsing pushed teachers to the front of a political storm. They made a recall campaign seem like it was about "mother's love" and "educational conscience," but it really became a political show to control people's minds.</p>
            <p>The KMT group said, "This kind of press conference is not about making democracy better; it is about politics getting worse." Education should give children the power to think for themselves, not plant seeds of hate and conflict.</p>
