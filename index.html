Former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol was openly questioned by a special team today. They are investigating if he was involved in rebellion. Mr. Yoon had asked to enter secretly, but he came through the main door. The investigation will check if he told his guards to stop an arrest or if he asked if they could use guns during a second arrest attempt. They will also look into whether he ordered the deletion of secret phone calls about martial law and if he discussed martial law with former government leaders.

**Many Emergency Room Doctors Are Leaving, Most Are 30-39 Years Old and Go to Clinics**

Many emergency room (ER) doctors in Taiwan are leaving their jobs. The Emergency Medicine Association said that over 100 ER doctors might leave this year. Almost half of them (over 40%) are moving to clinics, not hospitals. Most of these doctors are between 30 and 39 years old. The head of the association, Hsu Chien-ching, said that ER care is changing with new methods like online doctor visits and AI. He noted that the past year was hard for ER staff because hospitals were too full and many people left their jobs. The association will try to get more money for ER and critical care. From January to May, 61 doctors left, and 45 more plan to leave later this year. The number of ER doctors working in hospitals is going down, meaning more are choosing to work in other places like clinics.

**Trump to Announce Tariff Rates to Countries; South Korea Hopes for Extension**

Former US President Donald Trump said on June 27th that in about a week and a half, he will send letters to countries. These letters will tell them how much tax (tariffs) they need to pay to do business in the US. He added that the time countries have without paying these taxes could become longer or shorter. A South Korean official said it's not clear if South Korea's tax break, which ends on July 8th, will continue. This is even though South Korea has shown it is serious about trade talks with the US. Trump said he would rather make the tax-free period shorter and just tell everyone to "pay 25%." The South Korean official thinks that countries showing they are serious about trade talks might get more time. But countries that are not serious might have to pay higher taxes. The official also said that talks between South Korea and the US have been slow because of South Korea's own politics, but there is still time for Trump to decide.
