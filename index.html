            <h1>Coach Hong Thought It Was Fake News and Asked the Company to Help Steven Moya</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 19 (Central News Agency) â€“ The Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) All-Star Game started today. But Steven Moya, a foreign player for the TSG Hawks, had to leave the game. His wife felt very sick on the plane coming to Taiwan and died after landing. The Hawks' head coach, Hong Yi-Chung, was sad and said that when he first saw the news online, he thought it was fake. He will ask the company to give full help.</p>
            <p>Steven Moya was supposed to be the starting third batter and designated hitter for Team STAR in the first All-Star game. But before the game, the Hawks team announced that Moya's wife had a very serious health problem on the plane to Taiwan. After the plane landed, she was taken to the hospital but died. Because of this sudden event, Moya had to leave the All-Star game.</p>
            <p>Before the game, Hawks coach Hong Yi-Chung said that this news was very sudden and sad. He was checking his phone before the game and saw the news on social media. At first, he thought it was fake. Before he finished reading, he got a call from the team's assistant general manager who explained what happened. The team will help as much as they can.</p>
            <p>Hong Yi-Chung said he met Moya's wife and children at last year's All-Star Game. He added that outsiders cannot understand such deep sadness. He wants Moya to take care of things first, and then they can see about other matters later. (Editor: Lung Po-An) 1140719</p>

            <h1>China Held a Meeting for Private Business People, Hopes for Shared Ideas and Actions</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 19 (Central News Agency) â€“ China's government held a meeting about the current situation and policies for private business people from July 17 to 18. Li Ganjie, a member of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau and head of the United Front Work Department, spoke at the meeting. He said they hope to guide private business people to agree with the CPC Central Committee's plans for situations at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>On July 15, China's National Bureau of Statistics shared economic information for the second quarter. The economy grew by 5.2% in the second quarter, which is a bit slower than the 5.4% in the first quarter of this year. For the first half of this year, China's economy grew by 5.3%. But many people expect the economy to slow down in the second half of the year because of weak local demand and trade conflicts.</p>
            <p>According to the People's Daily newspaper, China's government held this meeting for private business people at this time. About 80 private business people joined the meeting. Leaders from China's National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce gave special reports. Officials from other related government departments also attended.</p>
            <p>Li Ganjie stated that teaching private business people about current situations and policies, and listening to their ideas, is an important way to follow what CPC General Secretary Xi Jinping said at the meeting for private companies. This helps private business people to have the same thoughts and actions as the CPC Central Committee regarding its smart decisions about national and international situations.</p>
            <p>He said that based on the steady and good growth of the national economy in the first half of the year, they should be confident and work hard. Private businesses should make new efforts to help the economy grow in the second half of the year.</p>
            <p>The report said that Li Ganjie hopes private business people will deeply follow Xi Jinping's advice: "Have a strong desire to serve the country, focus on development, follow laws, manage businesses well, and help others become rich after becoming rich themselves." They should "think together, stand together, and work together" with the CPC Central Committee. They should also encourage new ideas and lead in developing new types of production based on local conditions. (Editor: Chen Kai-Yu) 1140719</p>

            <h1>Lin Chih-Sheng Set Records at All-Star Game: "Thanks to My Hard Work to Be Seen"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 19 (Central News Agency) â€“ Wei Chuan Dragons veteran player Lin Chih-Sheng is playing in his last All-Star Game. Today, he started as the cleanup hitter (4th batter) and will set two new records. He joked that he hasn't played in a defensive position for a long time, so he felt a little tired after practicing. He said his first time playing at the Taipei Dome was for the All-Star Game. He added, "I thank myself for working very hard so that people can see me."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng, the 43-year-old veteran from the Dragons, was chosen for TEAM TAIWAN in this All-Star Game, which means he is passing on his experience. Today, he started the first game as the cleanup hitter and played first base. After practice, Lin Chih-Sheng smiled and said, "Today I'm the starting 4th batter and first baseman. Chen Chiang-Ho made me work hard just now, and I'm a bit out of breath."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng has not played a regular season game at the Taipei Dome yet. He said he really enjoys playing there. Today it was raining outside, and if there was no dome, the game would probably be delayed. He said, "My first time playing at the Taipei Dome is for the All-Star Game."</p>
            <p>The Dragons will hold Lin Chih-Sheng's retirement games from September 5 to 7 at the Taipei Dome. When asked if this was a practice for those games, he smiled and said time passes quickly, and it feels like it's still March. He has been getting ready all along.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Lin Chih-Sheng had played in 20 CPBL All-Star games, the same number as retired player Peng Cheng-Min. Today, as soon as he played, he broke the record, becoming the player with the most All-Star game appearances ever. He will also be the oldest All-Star cleanup hitter in history, at 43 years and 199 days old.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng said he learned about many records from news reports. He feels very honored to break records. He has been chosen or recommended for the All-Star Game almost every year. He thanked the coaches and fans for voting. He also said, "I thank myself, because I really worked hard to have the chance for everyone to see me."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng joked that he was surprised to see he would start as the 4th batter. He also knows this team is preparing for next year's World Baseball Classic. He said, "I can't play for too long, I am just part-time." He hopes to have many good memories from this year's All-Star Game. (Editor: Lung Po-An) 1140719</p>
