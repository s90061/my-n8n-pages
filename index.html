            <h1>After the "726 Recall" Ends, Taiwanese Groups Abroad Ask for Unity to Face Big Challenges</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 29 (CNA) â€“ After the "726 recall election" finished, five groups of Taiwanese people living in the US and Europe asked everyone to unite again. They said that Taiwan is talking with the United States about things like tariffs. If there is political trouble inside Taiwan, it will make Taiwan's position weaker. Also, if the opposition parties use their money to cause problems in the parliament, it will not help people's lives and might make the United States support Taiwan less.</p>
            <p>On July 26, people voted on whether to remove 24 KMT lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an from their positions. All these attempts to remove them failed. In the afternoon, five groups â€“ the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, the Federation of Taiwanese Associations in Europe, North American Taiwanese Women's Association, Manchester Taiwanese Association in the UK, and Vancouver Taiwanese Association â€“ released a statement. They shared their thoughts on the results.</p>
            <p>The statement said that people in Taiwan showed what they wanted through a democratic vote. Taiwan's situation in the world is difficult. They hope that after the vote, everyone can be united and work together to protect democracy.</p>
            <p>"Please respect the results of democracy and value what the voters have given us," the five groups said. They explained that the recall actions showed the anger of citizen groups. These groups were disappointed and did not trust the opposition lawmakers' work. These feelings should be heard and thought about.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te and his government team are working according to the country's laws. They should be respected and given space to continue making changes inside the country and working with other countries. They are taking on risks and pressure for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The groups also said that the real threat to Taiwan's democracy comes from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is trying to control and sneak into Taiwan. "From abroad, we can strongly feel that the CCP is using many ways to threaten democratic countries," they added.</p>
            <p>The statement said that the CCP is still getting involved in Taiwan's issues. They are using methods like influencing public opinion, spreading false information, and training people to work for them in politics. Their goal is to divide society, cause chaos in politics, and finally take over Taiwan and destroy its democracy.</p>
            <p>The statement also pointed out that Taiwan is having difficult talks with the United States about many things, like tariffs, trade, supply chains, and safety. Any political instability inside Taiwan will make Taiwan weaker in these international talks and make it less trusted.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that if opposition parties spend all their political resources fighting the government and causing chaos in the parliament, it will not help people's lives. It could also make the United States and other democratic countries trust and support Taiwan less.</p>
            <p>The Formosan Association for Public Affairs and other groups asked that the Legislative Yuan and all political parties stop useless political actions. They should focus on public policies and people's lives. The government team should stay on a steady path, keep working for national development, and connect with other countries. They should not let problems change their beliefs.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the public should be aware of "cognitive warfare" and how it tries to influence minds. People should keep their ability to understand media well so they are not fooled by political talk and false information. Taiwanese people both inside and outside Taiwan should support each other, talk calmly, and face outside threats and challenges together.</p>

            <h1>Good Morning World: Strong Southwest Winds Bring Heavy Rain to Southern Taiwan Today, Some Areas in Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Chiayi Stop Work and School</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been heavy rains in the mountains of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. Because of this, five areas in Kaohsiung, such as Liugui District, eight areas in Pingtung, such as Wutai Township, and five areas in Chiayi County, such as Alishan Township, will have no work or school on July 30. The weather office said that the southwest air current will be strongest on July 30. The rain will spread to areas south of Miaoli. Southern Taiwan should prepare for very heavy rain. Tainan has had floods after recent rains. Premier Cho Jung-tai visited the flooded areas on July 29. He said that the Executive Yuan will set up a special center in Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan to manage the floods. This center will help central and local governments work together to solve the problems.</p>
            <p>Recently, cities in northern China have had very heavy and unusual rain. By midnight on July 28, 30 people had died in Beijing because of the disaster. In Luanping County, Hebei Province, a landslide caused 8 deaths and 4 people are still missing. On July 28, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, gave instructions about the floods in northern China. He said that the heavy rain caused "serious deaths and injuries" in places like Beijing. China's Premier Li Qiang also said that the floods in Miyun, Beijing, caused "serious deaths and injuries." The Beijing government announced that 30 people died in the floods only after Xi and Li talked about the serious deaths and injuries.</p>
            <p>This year, Taiwan is becoming a "super-aged society," meaning one out of every five people is over 65 years old. This affects the job market first. Young people prefer to be online celebrities or delivery drivers, so industries cannot find enough new workers. They are starting to look for older workers. A senior manager at a job agency said clearly that society, including customers, might not be ready for this. A store manager once said that their store hired many older workers who were kind and helpful. But customers complained that they were too slow and wanted younger workers. Experts suggest teaching people about "aging society" from a young age. This way, everyone will understand that a "super-aged society is not just someone else's problem, but everyone's problem."</p>
            <p>Many batches of "Fu Yuan Chunky Peanut Butter" from Hsinchu have been found to have too much aflatoxin. The Hsinchu City Health Bureau said they have told the company to take all bad products off the shelves and stop making them. They also asked the company to provide a way for customers to return or exchange the products. The company will be fined between 60,000 and 200 million New Taiwan Dollars for breaking food safety laws. The Health Bureau pointed out that aflatoxin is a dangerous substance that can cause cancer. It is often found in peanuts and nuts. So, it must be strictly controlled by law.</p>
            <p>A new rule will start on August 1: people over 80 years old can hire foreign home caregivers without needing a health assessment from a hospital. However, some people are choosing to hire caregivers for less serious cases, leaving those with serious illnesses without help. To fix this, the Ministry of Labor announced six new plans to make sure people with serious and less serious illnesses are handled separately. If someone provides proof of a "serious illness," their application will be looked at first. Families with a seriously ill person can finish hiring a local caregiver in one day. The Ministry of Health and Welfare said that during the time when people are waiting for a foreign caregiver, they can use various long-term care services, but they must meet the requirements for long-term care.</p>
            <p>A man named Hu was upset that a woman, who used to be an expert witness for the National Communications Commission in the CTi News license renewal case, reported him for threatening her. Since November last year, Hu had been watching, following, and threatening the woman for over six months. The woman reported him to the police, and the police gave Hu a written warning. But Hu did not stop his actions. The woman then asked the court for a protection order, and she got it. However, Hu appeared at the woman's workplace many times, which broke the protection order. So, the woman filed a complaint. The Shilin District Prosecutors Office finished its investigation and charged Hu with stalking and harassment on July 29.</p>
            <p>A new law to control smoking has been in effect for over two years. Now, some heated tobacco products have been approved with certain conditions. This means 14 items from two companies can be sold legally in Taiwan in the future. However, these companies will need some time to prepare after getting approval before they can sell the products. For personal use, if people buy heated tobacco from other countries, and how taxes on tobacco will work, still needs to be decided. The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance said that companies can import these products, but for now, travelers still cannot bring heated tobacco into Taiwan.</p>
            <p>On July 28, a terrible shooting happened in Manhattan, New York. A man, who may have had mental health problems, went into an office building with a gun. He shot and killed four people, including a police officer and a security guard, and then killed himself. The shooting happened in a fancy office building on Park Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets in Manhattan. Important companies like Blackstone, KPMG US, and the NFL headquarters are in that building. The shooter is believed to be a 27-year-old man born in Hawaii and living in Las Vegas. The reason for the shooting is still being investigated.</p>
            <p>Yang Yuan-ming, the former head of the Central Police University, will retire on July 16. The National Police Agency announced that Huang Ming-chao, the deputy director of the National Security Bureau, will take his place. Liao Hsun-cheng and Li Wen-chang, the police chiefs of New Taipei City and Taichung City, will become deputy directors of the National Police Agency. All of them will start their new jobs on August 1. Huang Ming-chao is 62 years old. He graduated from the 51st class of the Central Police University and has a master's degree in crime prevention. He has held important positions before, such as director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, commissioner of the National Police Agency, and deputy director of the National Security Bureau.</p>
            <p>On July 29, the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association announced that Mark Liu, the former chairman of TSMC, and C.C. Wei, the current chairman and CEO of TSMC, will both receive the 2025 Robert N. Noyce Award. They are expected to attend a dinner on November 20 to accept the award. The SIA said that Mark Liu and C.C. Wei are very important people in the semiconductor industry. Together, they have more than 80 years of experience and knowledge in this field. They have changed the modern semiconductor industry both inside and outside the United States and have completely changed how computer chips are made.</p>
            <p>Hu Te-fu is from the Puyuma and Paiwan indigenous groups. In 1984, there was a coal mine explosion in Taipei County (now New Taipei City). Hu Te-fu found that many of the people who died were Amis miners. He wrote a song to speak out about the sad lives of indigenous people. After that, he helped start the "Taiwan Aborigines' Rights Promotion Association." This group worked to change the name for indigenous people and to give them back their land. They also led the first large protest for indigenous people after martial law ended in Taiwan. Over 2,000 indigenous people marched and shouted, "We want our land, and we want our names!" On August 1, 1994, the term "mountain compatriots," which was an insulting name, was removed from the Constitution. It was changed to "indigenous people." Three years later, it was changed again to "indigenous peoples."</p>

            <h1>Old Photos Unboxed: Hu Te-fu and the Movement to Rename Indigenous Peoples</h1>
            <p>(CNA website) On August 1, 1994, the word "mountain compatriots," which was a disrespectful term, was finally removed from the Constitution. It was changed to "indigenous people." Three years later, it was changed again to "indigenous peoples."</p>
            <p>This was a movement that lasted for 10 years. On this journey, the name Hu Te-fu (Kimbo) cannot be forgotten.</p>
            <p>He is a descendant of the Puyuma and Paiwan tribes. In 1962, Hu Te-fu moved from Taitung to Taipei to study at Tamkang Middle School. He was also the first person from his hometown to get into the Foreign Languages Department at National Taiwan University.</p>
            <p>He had to stop studying in his third year of university because of a brain injury that caused seizures. Later, to help his family with money, he started singing in cafes. While singing at a coffee center linked to the Colombian Embassy, he met good friends like Li Shuang-tze, Yang Hsien, and Wu Chu-chu.</p>
            <p>In 1974, Hu Te-fu held a concert called "Beautiful Rice Grains," thanks to Li Shuang-tze's strong support. This concert started the folk song movement in Taiwan and was also a major turning point in Hu Te-fu's life.</p>
            <p>"Sing your own songs, speak your own words." These words from Li Shuang-tze deeply influenced Hu Te-fu. He started to find his people's traditional songs again and also wrote his own music.</p>
            <p>In 1984, there was a coal mine explosion in Taipei County (now New Taipei City) at the Haisan coal mine. Hu Te-fu helped with the rescue work and found that most of the people who died were Amis miners. After he went home, he wrote a song called "Why?" He also held a concert in New Park to speak out and support the indigenous people who suffered in the disaster.</p>
            <p>At the end of the same year, even though many police tried to stop them, he and Icyang Parod and others started the "Taiwan Aborigines' Rights Promotion Association" in the auditorium of Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei. Hu Te-fu became the first president. They worked for the "Rectification of Name" and "Give Us Back Our Land" movements.</p>
            <p>On August 25, 1988, the first big social movement for indigenous people happened after martial law ended in Taiwan. More than 2,000 indigenous people marched on the streets and shouted: "We want our land, and we want our names!"</p>
            <p>In 1994, the President at that time, Lee Teng-hui, used the term "indigenous people" in public for the first time in Pingtung. In July of the same year, thanks to the efforts of National Assembly member Kao Cheng-chih, a change to the Constitution was passed by just one vote. It was officially announced on August 1. This day also became "Indigenous Peoples' Day."</p>
            <p>If you want to see more photos of Hu Te-fu, go to the CNA photo collection now.</p>
