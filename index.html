            <h1>Super Typhoon Hagupit Approaches Luzon Island; Philippines Suspends Work and Classes</h1>
            <p>Super Typhoon Hagupit is bringing strong winds and heavy rain. The Philippines is directly affected. Manila and many provinces have announced that work and school will be stopped. The typhoon is slowly moving northwest. It will eventually reach southern China. Hong Kong authorities are thinking about closing the airport temporarily.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Reuters says that the Philippine weather agency announced that Hagupit is moving northwest and getting stronger. It is expected to land as early as this afternoon on Batanes or Babuyan Islands, which do not have many people. Its path will go through the Luzon Strait.</p>
            <p>The Philippine weather agency stated that as of 11 PM yesterday, Hagupit's strongest continuous winds were 205 kilometers per hour. Gusts reached 250 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The Philippine government closed offices and schools in Manila and 29 provinces today. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said that local officials must move people from dangerous areas right away.</p>
            <p>Weather forecasters warned that there will be widespread power outages in the Philippines as the typhoon affects northern Luzon. There will also be landslides and dangerous sea conditions. More than 10 domestic flights in the Philippines have been canceled, mostly flights to Luzon. Port ferry services have also stopped.</p>
            <p>The Hong Kong Observatory said yesterday that Hong Kong's weather will "get worse slowly" starting tomorrow. The strong winds and big waves will be similar to those caused by Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018.</p>
            <p>Hagupit continues to move towards the southern coast of China. It is expected to hit Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has asked people to get ready. They are also thinking about closing the airport for 36 hours. This is expected to be one of the strongest typhoons to hit Hong Kong in many years.</p>

            <h1>Residential Electricity Prices Will Increase; Lu Shiow-yen Says It Should Be Carefully Considered</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that raising household electricity prices should be done carefully. She said that prices for goods are already high, and businesses are also having big problems. She is worried that raising electricity prices will make things even harder for people.</p>
            <p>On September 19, the Ministry of Economic Affairs held its second meeting about electricity prices for 2025. After looking at factors like how tariffs affect prices, what people can afford, and making electricity prices fair, the average electricity price will change by 0.71%. It will go from 3.7556 NT dollars per kilowatt-hour to 3.7823 NT dollars per kilowatt-hour.</p>
            <p>For businesses, the electricity price will not change. It will stay at 4.27 NT dollars per kilowatt-hour. The government will continue to help businesses that are struggling by lowering prices or keeping them the same. For household electricity, the price for each level of use will be slightly adjusted, with an average increase of 3.12%.</p>
            <p>After an event this morning, Lu Shiow-yen talked to the media about the increase in household electricity prices. She said that electricity prices have increased many times in the last 2 or 3 years. Even though each increase is small, when you add them all up, the total increase is quite large.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen stated that currently, prices for goods in Taiwan are high, and global trade is also changing. She worries that raising prices now will make things even worse for people. In this situation, the government should think about how to help all businesses and people get through this difficult time.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen believes that when prices are high and businesses are facing big difficulties, public companies should be careful when raising their fees. If prices were adjusted during normal times, it would be fine. But when the economy is difficult and prices are already going up, adjusting prices now will make people feel that things are much harder. During this time, both households and businesses are working very hard.</p>
