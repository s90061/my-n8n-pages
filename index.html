<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290123.aspx">News Link</a>

The Ukrainian military said today that an F-16 pilot died and his plane was lost. This happened during a big Russian attack with missiles and drones at night.

Reuters reported that this is the third F-16 jet Ukraine has lost since the war started in February 2022.

The Ukrainian Air Force wrote on Telegram that the pilot used all his plane's weapons. He shot down seven targets in the air. When he shot down the last one, his plane was damaged and started to fall.

The Air Force also said the pilot did his best to fly the plane away from a town. But he could not jump out in time.

The Ukrainian military said that Russia sent 477 drones and 60 missiles towards Ukraine overnight. Ukraine's forces destroyed 211 drones and 38 missiles. Six places were hit by Russian air attacks.

**China's "Ice City" Harbin Sees High Heat, Students Sleep Outside**

<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/acn/202506290122.aspx">News Link</a>

Harbin, a city in northeast China known as the "Ice City," has recently had very hot weather, over 30 degrees Celsius. Some universities there do not have air conditioning. Because it was so hot, students slept in the hallways of their dorms and in tents outside the dorm buildings at night. This has gotten a lot of attention.

Chinese news reported that a video online showed male students at Heilongjiang Oriental College in Harbin sleeping in dorm hallways and on the ground outside their building last Wednesday. The video showed many male students in short sleeves and shorts sitting in the hallway to cool down. Many male students were also lying on mats outside the dorm and on the roof, wearing only shorts.

Some students said the weather has been very hot, feeling like 37-38 degrees Celsius. Their dorms have no air conditioning or fans. They said they sweat even when they don't move and cannot sleep at night. Some female students said they had to put their hands and feet in water to cool down at night.

Some students who could not stand the heat went to hotels near the school. One student said, "The dorm next to us is empty because everyone moved to a hotel. A hotel 4 kilometers away is very expensive, costing about 300 Chinese Yuan (about 1200 New Taiwan Dollars)." Students also said they told the dorm manager, who told them to use ice to cool down.

School staff said that this year is the hottest in recent years. Harbin rarely sees such hot weather.

**China's Huge Investment Creates "Ghost City" in Malaysia, Dream of Future City Fails**

<a href="https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202506290120.aspx">News Link</a>

For 12 years, China has promoted its "Belt and Road" plan. One important project in Southeast Asia was Malaysia's Forest City, built by a big Chinese property company, Country Garden. They spent 100 billion US dollars on it. But now, this new city, very close to Singapore, is called a "ghost city." This is because China limited money leaving the country and it's hard to get to the city.

The Forest City is in Johor, Malaysia, right across from Singapore's Tuas area, only about 2 kilometers away.

When a reporter visited Forest City, the buildings were new and the area was green, but it was mostly empty. The sales office had very few people, and there seemed to be more salespeople than residents or visitors. The sound of birds was louder than human voices, showing how empty this "future city" is.

Outside the large central square, there were many modern apartment and office buildings, but almost no people.

A local taxi driver told the reporter that this was the only time in weeks he had a ride to Forest City. He said, "Almost no one comes here now." He added that few people actually live there, so taking a taxi there is not really worth it.

A salesperson speaking good Chinese quickly gave a brochure to anyone who came into the sales office. She talked about different types of homes, special offers, and good policies from the Malaysian government. But she seemed sad about the lack of people.

Mr. Chow Chia-ching, who runs a Malaysian property company, said that at first, the homes were mostly sold to Chinese buyers. About 10 years ago, China's economy was good, and many tourist buses came, and people signed up to buy homes.

But then, the Chinese government worried that too much money was going overseas. So, they put limits on money leaving China. After that, sales for Forest City fell very quickly. Mr. Chow said the buildings were finished, but "no one lives there."

Forest City was first aimed at Chinese investors, especially those with average or high income. They liked the idea of investing their money and having a "second home" there. It was also seen as the "closest overseas property to Singapore."

However, changes in government rules, the COVID-19 pandemic, and problems with the project made Chinese buyers lose interest. Many people who bought homes are now waiting to see what happens or are trying to sell them.

Even though Forest City is only 2 kilometers from Singapore, traveling between them is not easy. Going from Forest City to Singapore means crossing two border checkpoints. During busy times, it can take 2 hours or more to go one way, so traveling to work and back can take 4 or 5 hours. This long travel time is a big problem for people who cross the border every day.

A Malaysian investor who works in Singapore looked at Forest City a few years ago but decided not to buy there. He said, "It looked grand, but there was no life there at all. Also, travel was difficult, and there were very few shops or services. It just felt like an empty city." He later bought an apartment closer to Johor Bahru city center because it had people, a supermarket, and bus service.

Dr. Muhammad Najib Razali, a professor at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia who knows about property and economics, said that people calling Forest City a "ghost town" in the news and on social media has hurt trust and how people see the market. Once it gets that name, it's hard to get rid of it.

Country Garden, one of China's biggest property companies, has financial problems. Dr. Razali said that when the main company has problems in its home country, it affects projects overseas and how much money they have. If these projects don't make good profits, it also hurts the main company. This is like a chain reaction.

Dr. Razali believes that big building projects should think about city planning, especially transport, from the start. Getting from Forest City to Johor Bahru city center is not easy, and most people need private transport. During busy times, there can be traffic jams. For people who travel to work or school in the city, this makes the area less attractive as a place to live.

Dr. Razali said that even though some properties in Forest City have been sold, no one actually lives in them. Because international media call it a "modern ghost city," this negative image makes investors wait and worry about the future, slowing down new investments.

The Malaysian government is now trying hard to save the project. They are creating the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ) and the Forest City Financial Zone (SFZ).

Dr. Razali said that the Malaysian government is trying to save this project so it doesn't become too bad to fix. But they can't just change the names, like adding "financial zone." To attract foreign investors, they need to make it easier for them to do business, without too many difficult rules. They need to show investors that they can save money.

Will Forest City still struggle to be rented or sold in the future? Dr. Razali thinks the "ghost city" image is hurting new investments. The brand needs to be rebuilt through international marketing. But he said this will need a long-term plan and continued effort to work.`;
