A new artificial intelligence (AI) tool, called AlphaFold 3, has been created by Google DeepMind. This tool can predict the shapes of all of life's molecules, including proteins and DNA. This is a very important step forward, especially for discovering new medicines and for basic research in biology.

AlphaFold 3 can accurately show how different molecules connect and work together. This is key to understanding illnesses and creating new drugs. Using this AI tool makes the process much quicker and more exact than older ways of doing research. This could help scientists make big discoveries much faster, possibly saving years of work. The tool is available for researchers to use for non-profit purposes, which means scientists around the world can use it to help their work.

**Hybrid Work Continues to Change How We Work**

The discussion about working from home versus in the office is still ongoing, but many companies are now using a mix of both, known as hybrid work. A new study shows that even though some large companies are asking employees to come to the office more often, many workers around the world still want and expect flexible work options.

This change is affecting more than just how much work gets done. It also impacts how cities are planned, how people travel to work, and if city centers become lively again. Employees like having a better balance between work and life, and they appreciate less time spent commuting. However, employers often want teams to work together in person to build stronger bonds and create new ideas. The main challenge is to find a good balance that makes both employees and employers happy, using new technology for remote work while also keeping a strong company culture.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day Visitors**

Venice has started a new rule, asking day visitors to pay a fee to enter the city. This is a first-of-its-kind effort to manage the very large number of tourists it receives. Starting from April 25th, people visiting Venice for just one day will need to pay â‚¬5 during busy times to enter the old part of the city.

This new plan aims to reduce too much tourism, especially during peak season. It also helps protect the city's old buildings and unique culture from the problems caused by too many visitors. People who live in Venice, those staying overnight in hotels, and daily commuters do not have to pay this fee. The money collected will be used to help maintain public services and keep Venice's environment safe. Other popular cities that also have many tourists are watching this new system closely.`;
