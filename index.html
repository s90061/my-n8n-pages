            <h1>Shanghai-Taiwan Agricultural Seminar: Chairman Xiao Hanjun of National Farmers' Association Hopes for More Exchanges</h1>
            <p>To help Taiwan and Shanghai exchange ideas about farming, the Shanghai-Taiwan Youth Agricultural Exchange and Cooperation Seminar was held today in Chongming Island, Shanghai. Xiao Hanjun, the chairman of the National Farmers' Association, attended the event. He said that both sides have strengths that help each other in agriculture. He hopes that experts and new ideas can be shared more in the future.</p>
            <p>The "Working Together in New Agriculture Fields, Growing Youth Dreams" 2025 Shanghai-Taiwan Youth Agricultural Exchange event was organized by the Sustainable Agriculture Committee of the Shanghai Association of Taiwan Compatriots Investment. It took place today in Chongming, Shanghai. About 150 agriculture experts and business people from both sides came to the event.</p>
            <p>During the event, people from Taiwan visited places like Chongming Gengwang Orchid Base, the Agricultural Science and Innovation Center, Taihe Good Season Rural Complex, and Liuliujiu Eco-Park. This helped them understand how agriculture is growing in Chongming.</p>
            <p>At this event, three agreements for strategic cooperation (letters of intent for investment) were signed for agricultural and rural areas between Shanghai and Taiwan. Also, a ceremony was held to open the agricultural branch of the Shanghai-Taiwan Innovation Center.</p>
            <p>Xiao Hanjun spoke at the event. He said he hopes both sides can have more good exchanges in farming. He was surprised that a big city area like Shanghai still has agriculture. He praised Chongming Island for its good environment and its ability to grow well, calling it like Shanghai's back garden. He said it can attract people to enjoy farm life on holidays.</p>
            <p>After the event, Xiao Hanjun said in an interview that mainland China is an important place for Taiwan's agricultural exports. The amount of farm products sold to China and the United States is about the same. However, this time the United States put a 20% tax on Taiwan's products. In contrast, most of Taiwan's farm products sold to mainland China have zero tariffs under the ECFA agreement, which is better for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said that mainland China and Taiwan's agriculture help each other. People and farming technology should be shared more. He will continue to support these exchanges.</p>
            <p>Many Taiwanese farm businesses also came to look at the Chinese market. Zhang Yuyong from the Wencheng Orchid Production and Marketing Class Butterfly Orchid Division in Dalin Township, Chiayi, said they plan to invest in overseas locations. The exact place is still being decided. They had looked at Vietnam before and are also thinking of China. Right now, they believe China has good advantages for sales and production costs.</p>
            <p>Huang Shihong, the head of Dongshan Township Farmers' Association in Yilan, said he mainly wanted to visit Chongming Island to learn and see how things are done in different environments and ecosystems. He explained, "Because they can grow many varieties and ecosystems here that we cannot," so Taiwan might be able to learn from them.</p>

            <h1>Village Tour's Final Stop in Matsu: Diabolo Theatre Attracts 1500 People</h1>
            <p>The last show of the Ministry of Culture's "Cultural Equality Tour - Village Theater One-Day Event" was held tonight in Lienchiang County. The Diabolo Theatre, which represented Taiwan at the Osaka Expo, performed and drew over 1500 people. They enjoyed a creative show that combined diabolo (Chinese yo-yo) with modern technology.</p>
            <p>The "Village Theater" set up a very large stage in Baima Wang Park in Shanlong, Nangan Township. Even during rehearsals, local people gathered to watch and talk about it. To see the show, people came from all the islands in the county. Some even traveled from Dongyin Township, which is called the "Northern Border of the Nation" and is a two-hour boat ride away. To help people watch the show, the Lienchiang County government also added extra boat services between Nangan and Beigan tonight.</p>
            <p>Before the show started, Li Jinghui, the Political Deputy Minister of Culture, and Wang Zhongming, the Magistrate of Lienchiang County, held an opening ceremony. They both held glowing balls, which symbolized the start of the theater performance.</p>
            <p>During the Diabolo Theatre's show, people watched the amazing performances on stage with great focus. They often clapped and cheered for the performers. When the actors went down to interact with the audience, many people shouted "Pick me, pick me!" The atmosphere was lively.</p>
            <p>According to news from the Ministry of Culture, the Diabolo Theatre uses the traditional diabolo skill and mixes it with dance, music, new circus acts, and modern technology. They performed a touching show called "Light of Life." The stage had beautiful, bright illusions. The diabolos flew between the stage and the audience, creating paths like beautiful shooting stars. This made the people watching feel like they were entering a world of light with the actors.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Culture said that this year, they continued the idea of cultural equality. From July to September, they held three performances on three outlying islands. The first show was by the Tang Mei-yun Taiwanese Opera Company, which started with a lively and magical musical. They presented the "Starlight Edition of Meng Po Inn: Century Wedding" to Penghu. After that, the Ming Hwa Yuan Arts and Culture Group returned to Kinmen for an outdoor performance after ten years. They brought their stunning and exciting famous mystery play, "The Cat God."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture stressed that the "Cultural Equality Tour - Village Theater One-Day Event" aims to help the performing arts industry and make culture available to everyone. Since 2023, it has worked with local governments and performing groups. They have held 23 tour performances across Taiwan and its outlying islands. More than 350,000 people have attended. They hope that everyone who watched a show in their village had a wonderful and memorable time.</p>
