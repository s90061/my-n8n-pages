            <h1>Hualien Liwu River Barrier Lake Red Alert: Xiulin Township Two Villages and Four Neighborhoods Suspend Work and School on October 18</h1>
            <p>Because of a red warning for a barrier lake in Liwu River at Swallows' Grotto in Hualien, the Xiulin Township Office announced tonight that work and school will stop tomorrow, October 18. This affects the Datianshang area (Guanyuan, Luoshao, Xibao, Tianxiang), Minle Community, Neighbor 9 in Fushi Village, and Minyou Community, Neighbors 1 to 3 in Xiulin Village.</p>
            <p>The Hualien branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency said that the barrier lake in Liwu River is about 50 meters high. It is 260 meters from the Central Cross-Island Highway (Taiwan Route 8). Experts from Yang Ming Chiao Tung University calculated that the lake can hold about 2.7 million tons of water. Its surface area is about 10 hectares, and it stretches about 1700 meters. There is a risk that the lake could overflow and break at any time. Because of this, authorities have asked people living downstream and visitors in Taroko National Park to leave. The highway bureau has closed the road between Tianxiang and Taroko.</p>
            <p>Taroko National Park also announced tonight that due to the red warning for the Liwu River barrier lake from the Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, and road closures, people are not allowed into the park. People in the mountain areas should leave quickly.</p>

            <h1>Lin Yu-chang Starts Industrial Learning Trip, First Stop Dallas to Focus on High-Tech Industry</h1>
            <p>Lin Yu-chang, the former Secretary-General of the Democratic Progressive Party, who many see as a strong candidate for Taipei Mayor, left for the United States tonight. He is starting a trip to learn about different industries. He said that after the Cold War ended in 1989 and the world became more connected economically, we are now facing another big change in 30 years. This change is important for Taiwan's ability to compete and survive. He believes it is both a challenge and a great chance for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-chang posted on Facebook tonight that he has flown to the U.S. with EVA Air. But this time, he is not going to Washington D.C., which is the usual political center, and he is not going as a visiting scholar. Instead, he is visiting industries in Dallas, Austin in Texas, and Phoenix in Arizona.</p>
            <p>He said he is going to these places to see and understand how the semiconductor, AI, and high-tech industries in Taiwan and the U.S. are changing. He wants to see what is happening firsthand, talk to workers and managers, and learn from Taiwanese businesspeople and managers in the U.S. He wants to get direct information, find out what problems exist or might come up, and then think about what to do in the future.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-chang said that the world is now facing a big change, like the one after the Cold War ended in 1989 and global trade grew. This new change, happening after another 30 years, affects Taiwan's ability to compete and survive as a country. He sees it as a difficult time, but also a very good chance.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-chang took an EVA Air flight that just started direct service to Dallas in early October. He said that in the past, when Taiwanese people thought of Texas, they might have thought of steaks, oil fields, rockets, and space shuttles. But now, Texas is one of the top places for Taiwanese high-tech companies to go in the U.S. Dallas, Houston, and Austin have become a new important area for high-tech industries in America.</p>
            <p>He also said that it is getting easier to travel between Taiwan and Texas. He believes that trade and business between the two sides will become even stronger in the future. He made a plan to meet people in Dallas.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says 100% Tariffs on China Are Not Sustainable in the Long Run</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump said that his idea to put a 100% tax (tariff) on goods from China "cannot continue for a long time." However, he also blamed China for the recent problems in trade talks. He stressed that China's tighter control over rare earth exports caused these problems.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump was asked in an interview on Fox Business Network today if such high tariffs could last and what they might do to the economy. He replied, "It's not sustainable, but that's how the numbers are... they made me do it."</p>
            <p>One week ago, Trump announced that starting November 1, he would add a 100% tariff on goods coming from China to the U.S. He also said there would be controls on exporting "all important software."</p>
            <p>In the same interview, Trump confirmed that he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea in two weeks. He also spoke positively about the Chinese leader.</p>
            <p>Trump stated in the "Mornings with Maria" show, which was recorded yesterday, "I think we will be fine with China, but we must reach a fair agreement; it has to be fair."</p>
