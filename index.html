            <h1>UN: Mail to the US Drops by 81% After Duty Exemption for Small Parcels Ends</h1>
            <p>The United Nations' postal group, Universal Postal Union (UPU), announced today that the amount of mail sent to the United States has dropped by 80%. This happened after the US stopped allowing small parcels to be sent without paying customs duties at the end of August. Also, 88 postal companies around the world have stopped or partly stopped sending mail to the US.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the Trump government said in late July that from August 29, small parcels sent to the US would no longer be free of duties. After this, postal services in many countries, like Australia, the UK, France, Germany, India, Italy, and Japan, said they would stop accepting most parcels for the US.</p>
            <p>The Universal Postal Union reported that data from its electronic network shows that on August 29, the amount of mail sent to the US was 81% less than a week before.</p>
            <p>Moreover, 88 postal companies have told the Universal Postal Union that they have stopped some or all of their mail services to the US until a solution is found. This includes Deutsche Post from Germany, Royal Mail from the UK, and two postal services from Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
            <p>Masahiko Metoki, the Director-General of the Universal Postal Union, said in a statement that they are working hard to create a technical solution quickly. This solution will help parcels be sent to the US again.</p>

            <h1>Kuo Yi-hsuan Wins 3-0 Against Hungarian Boxer and Reaches Top 16 at WB Boxing World Championships</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese athlete Kuo Yi-hsuan won her women's 51kg fight 3-0 against Hungarian boxer Kata Pap today. This happened in the Round of 32 at the WB Boxing World Championships in Liverpool, UK. Her coach, Ke Wen-ming, said he is happy to see his student getting better.</p>
            <p>The World Boxing (WB) organization is now approved by the International Olympic Committee. This week, they are holding their first World Boxing Championships in the UK. Today, Taiwanese boxer Kuo Yi-hsuan started her journey in the women's 51kg category in the Round of 32. She competed against Hungarian boxer Kata Pap to try and move forward.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first round, Kuo Yi-hsuan was behind. Only two judges voted for her, making the score 2-3 against her. But in the second and third rounds, she changed her pace. She had also learned that Pap was an attacking boxer. So, Kuo Yi-hsuan decided not to fight her opponent head-on. This plan helped her get more votes from the judges and turn the fight around. She won 3-0 and successfully moved into the Round of 16.</p>
            <p>After the fight, Coach Ke Wen-ming told CNA that since Kuo Yi-hsuan joined the national team, her skills have improved a lot. Her footwork and fight plans are much better. As a coach, he feels very pleased. He said, "She fought very well this time. I think getting to the Round of 16 is very encouraging."</p>
            <p>Kuo Yi-hsuan will next fight German boxer Maxi Klotzer to try and reach the quarterfinals. They fought before in last year's Olympic qualification match, but Kuo Yi-hsuan lost in the second round because the referee stopped the fight (RSC). Now, as they meet again, Coach Ke hopes his student will show a different style. He said, "Back then, she was less experienced. This time, let's see if she can show something different."</p>

            <h1>Hengchun Pole-Climbing Contest: 17 Teams Compete, Shixin Life Ceremony Team Wins the "Smooth Wind Flag"</h1>
            <p>The Hengchun pole-climbing event in Pingtung County happened tonight at Dongmen Square. 17 teams worked together, stacking on top of each other in a lively competition with lots of cheers. The Shixin Life Ceremony team was the first to reach the top and win the "Smooth Wind Flag."</p>
            <p>The exciting pole-climbing competition started at 8:50 PM with firecrackers. Thousands of people came to watch. The crowd cheered loudly, and horns blew nonstop. The competition had two parts. In the first part, all 17 teams had to grab a red ribbon to move to the next stage.</p>
            <p>When the second part started, team members had to work together. It was also a big test of their strength and speed. They stacked on top of each other to push one person, the flag-grabber, to the top of the pole. As they climbed, they used cloths to wipe off the butter on the pole. Team members used their teammates' shoulders to climb up and grab the "Smooth Wind Flag." The team that climbed fastest to the top and hit the gong was the winner.</p>
            <p>During the race, some teams slipped because of the butter. In the end, the Shixin Life Ceremony team was the first to reach the top, hit the gong, and win the "Smooth Wind Flag."</p>
            <p>Besides the pole-climbing competition, the Hengchun Township Office, which organized the event, also set up a stage. Singers Hsu Fu-kai and Su You-rong performed live, making the event very lively.</p>
