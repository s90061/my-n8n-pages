<br>
The Ministry of Education in Taiwan has updated its list of recognized universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. For the first time in ten years, Guangzhou Jinan University has been removed from this list. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges.
<br>
The Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, stated earlier this year that schools run by China's United Front Work Department are not truly academic institutions and should not be recognized. Therefore, the Ministry of Education will no longer accept degrees from these schools. Guangzhou Jinan University was removed because it has been managed by the United Front Work Department since 2019. The Ministry wants to make sure Taiwanese students study in a normal academic environment, free from political goals.
<br>
The Ministry also said that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, fair, and respectful. Schools that arrange student trips to China should follow Taiwan's rules. They should be careful about invitations from China, checking the purpose of activities, organizers, plans, and materials. They should avoid activities with political goals or content, and not accept one-sided favors or help with China's political messages.
<br>
The Ministry added that if schools are unsure about an event's organizers or plans, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for help. Taiwan still hopes to help young students from both sides learn together and understand each other better. However, during these exchanges, students should be aware of possible risks and check the background of event organizers to see if there are any political goals.

**Video: First Car Fire on Kinmen Bridge - Surveillance Shows It "Instantly Became a Fireball"**
<br>
Today at 2:16 PM, the first car fire happened on Kinmen Bridge. A small car crashed and caught fire. It seems a tire burst, causing the car to slide and hit the barrier. The driver, Mr. Lin, and one passenger got out safely and were not hurt. Firefighters arrived quickly, closed the bridge to traffic, and put out the fire. The car was completely destroyed. Police and firefighters are still investigating what caused the accident.
<br>
The Kinmen County Fire Department got the call at 2:10 PM about a car on fire near the Huhu end of Kinmen Bridge. A small car was stuck on the barrier and burning. The fire department sent 4 fire trucks and 12 firefighters. The first team leader, Dong Bi-wen, was in charge.
<br>
When the rescue team arrived, they saw the car on fire, but the driver and passenger were already out. Firefighters used two water hoses and quickly put out the fire, cooling down the car to stop it from re-igniting. The car was completely burned, but thankfully, no one was hurt.
<br>
Police found that Mr. Lin was driving towards Lieyu on Kinmen Bridge. About 1 kilometer into the trip, he heard a tire burst. The car then slid, hit the barrier, and caught fire for an unknown reason. Police tested Mr. Lin for alcohol, and he was clean. The exact cause of the accident is still being checked.
<br>
After the accident, police and firefighters first allowed one lane of traffic in both directions. Then, the car was moved, and environmental workers cleaned up oil and debris. Once the road was clean, traffic returned to normal in both directions.
<br>
The fire department reminds drivers to always check their car and keep a safe distance from other cars. If there's a car accident or fire, call 119 right away. Tell them exactly what happened and if anyone is hurt, so they can help quickly.
<br>
The Jincheng Police Station advises that if a tire bursts while driving, do not suddenly brake. Instead, take your foot off the gas, slow down, and hold the steering wheel steady. Turn on your hazard lights and try to move the car to the side of the road. If you can't control the car, you can rub against the guardrail to slow down and avoid flipping. If your car stops on the side of the road after an accident, follow the "open, put, leave, call, take, move, wait" seven steps to keep people and the car safe. Especially at night or when it's hard to see, place your warning signs further away to warn other drivers.

**"Scared to Tears" - Chinese Spouse Xiao Wei Returns to Guizhou and Says She's Afraid, Reveals Late-Night Threatening Phone Call**
<br>
Xiao Wei, a Chinese spouse, had her residency permit canceled because she was believed to be supporting unification with China on TikTok. In April, she was sent back to Guizhou, China. After returning, Xiao Wei started sharing videos about rural life, but she still speaks her mind. She posted a video saying that the secretary of Xinchang Village in Guanzhou Town was not doing his job. She complained that she hadn't received compensation money for land flooded by a reservoir. However, today she shared that she got a threatening phone call from the Chinese police late at night. She said sadly, "I'm so scared, I can't even cry."
<br>
Today, Xiao Wei posted a video on TikTok saying she is very scared. She said she is a farmer, a common person, and a good citizen who hasn't broken any laws. She only asked the village committee why she hadn't received her compensation money. But on June 28th, after midnight, she received a threatening call from the Guanzhou police station.
<br>
In the video, Xiao Wei stated that she is a good farmer and cannot handle being scared. She questioned why the police station would call and threaten her. "I'm shaking while filming this video. Is there still justice? Is there still fairness?" she angrily asked the Chinese police, "Is it wrong for me to defend my rights legally? How do you people work and enforce laws at the police station? Is this how you treat farmers? You call to show off your power."
<br>
Xiao Wei said she is really scared, so scared that she can't even cry. At the end of the video, she strongly asked, "Please, relevant departments, protect us farmers. The more I think about it, the more scared I get. We farmers don't have powerful connections, so we can only use the internet to ask for help. Please pay attention to my situation."
