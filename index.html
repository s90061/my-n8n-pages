<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility and provocation, after a speech in which he said the island is "of course" a country and there is historical evidence and legal proof to back this up.

Beijing says democratically governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had intentionally distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions," it said in a statement.

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

Responding, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Lai was simply stating historical facts and Beijing's belief the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that, as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Taiwan has over the past five years faced stepped-up military and political pressure from China, including war games.

**Taiwan's China Airlines postpones retirement of older planes due to Boeing 787 delays**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) -Taiwan's China Airlines is postponing the retirement of some of its older aircraft due to delays in getting Boeing 787-9 jets that may result in compensation payments from the planemaker, the carrier's newly appointed chairman said.

Taiwan's oldest airline, established in 1959, is in the midst of a fleet renewal, last year splitting an order for new long-haul aircraft worth almost $12 billion at list prices between Boeing and European rival Airbus.

China Airlines has also ordered 24 Boeing 787s for regional and some longer-distance routes, including 18 787-9s and six of the stretched 787-10 variant.

But Chairman George Kao said China Airlines' fleet renewal plan to replace ageing Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos was being hit by delays in getting new aircraft delivered, especially the 787-9s.

"We are at present being greatly impacted. Some aircraft that were scheduled to be phased out, or handed back at the end of their lease, as some are leased, will remain and have their leases extended," he told Reuters in an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, home to Taiwan's main international airport.

Boeing has not given China Airlines an exact timeframe for the 787-9 delays, though it has said deliveries will "basically" start from the end of 2025, added Kao, a pilot by training who started out as a flight attendant and became chairman in March.

"This is written into the contract," he said, when asked whether China Airlines would seek compensation.

"For example, if it's in the supply chain, the responsibility is Boeing's, and Boeing has to provide some compensation. But if it's not, then there is no compensation. It's all recorded in the contract."

Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.

Other airlines are facing similar issues.

International Air Transport Association (IATA) Director General Willie Walsh, whose group represents airlines globally, this month called predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade "off-the-chart unacceptable".

Still, Kao was upbeat about expansion plans, pointing to the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year that will enable more capacity to be added to routes like New York and London, and a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport, the first section of which is expected to open later this year.

He signalled further aircraft additions ahead for subsidiary Mandarin Airlines, which flies almost exclusively domestic routes with ATR-72 turboprops and is getting a revamp to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan with new jet aircraft.

"I can talk about this with aircraft lessors," he said, without disclosing the jet models it could add. "We have this plan, to let Mandarin Airlines grow up."

China Airlines faces competition at home not only from long-established rival EVA Air but also rapidly growing Starlux Airlines, which last week placed an order for 10 more A350s.

Kao said while the Taiwan market itself was small, transit traffic, which all three airlines are focusing on, meant supporting three full-service airlines was not an issue.

Seoul's Incheon airport is too big, meaning passengers can get lost, Tokyo's landing fees are too expensive and Hong Kong has "political issues", whereas Taoyuan airport's new terminal will greatly improve the travel experience, he said.

"Our passengers are not all Taiwanese; many are transit. Because Taiwan's location, connecting the Pacific to all of Asia, is really very convenient."

**Nvidia Secures Entire Wistron Plant Through 2026 to Build AI Servers**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) reportedly locked in all production capacity at Wistron's newly launched Taiwan server facility through 2026 to meet surging AI server demand, according to a report by Economic Daily.

Nvidia reportedly booked all server manufacturing capacity at Wistron's recently launched facility in Zhubei, Taiwan, to produce its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. The orders, which extend through 2026, reflect Nvidia's aggressive push to secure critical AI infrastructure capacity as demand continues to outstrip supply.

The plant began operating this quarter and was officially inaugurated on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production already extend at least a year, while Economic Daily and Commercial Times reported that Nvidia has effectively locked in all future output.

Wistron's collective operations produce an estimated 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter, and the company has warned that its capacity may not be able to meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has secured an adjacent buildingset to become a second AI server site next yearto double its Taiwan-based output.

AI server shipments have become a primary growth engine not only for Wistron but also for Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is simultaneously expanding its U.S. presence with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By reserving full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is ensuring that its cloud and system partners receive AI servers in required quantities while competitors face tighter supply constraints. Nvidia's control of the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity signals its strategic intent to dominate the AI hardware ecosystem.
