A city councilor in Hsinchu criticized that some areas, like Gaocui Road and Baoshan Road, have dirty gutters and parks. These places are full of weeds, dead leaves, and rubbish. This causes a lot of insects, which bothers local residents.

The councilor visited the areas with residents and saw that some gutters were completely covered with dry wood and leaves. There were also tall weeds next to the roads. The councilor asked the city government to clean these areas quickly if they are public land.

The Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Bureau said they will check the places. If the dirty areas are public roads (4 meters wide or more), they will send staff to clean them. If the land is private, the owners will need to clean it themselves, following the law about waste.

**Taipei Main Station Mall Up for Bidding, Uni-President Express Shows Interest**

The company that manages Breeze Taipei Main Station will finish its contract next July. Taiwan Railways will then open a new bidding process for the mall's management. It is said that over 10 companies want to take over, and Uni-President Express is one of them. Uni-President has already contacted other brands they work with, showing they are very keen to win. They hope to get the contract because of their strong ability to attract businesses and their experience in managing malls.

Taipei Main Station is a very important transport hub in Taipei, with nearly 600,000 people passing through every day. It connects four different train and metro lines. Because "more people mean more money," many retail companies see Breeze Taipei Main Station as a great business location. Breeze Department Store has managed this mall for almost 20 years.

Many big companies are expected to bid, including Breeze Group again, Uni-President Superstore, and others like Goldsun Group and Eslite. Uni-President said they always look for suitable places to grow their business. They manage 61 malls in different places, like transport stations and tourist areas. In the last three years, their income from transport-related malls has grown by over 60%. An expert mentioned that before Breeze, Taipei Main Station was not very good for food. Breeze made it much better with modern designs and good food and shops, turning it into a place for transport, shopping, and eating.
