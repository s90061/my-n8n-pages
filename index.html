**Eating two bowls of dark green vegetables daily can lower children's risk of short-sightedness by 30%.**

More and more school children are becoming short-sighted in Taiwan, with over 40% now having the condition. A survey by the Cancer Care Foundation looked at the eating habits and health of elementary school students. It found a link between diet and short-sightedness. Children who eat two bowls of dark green vegetables every day have a 30% lower chance of becoming short-sighted than those who do not eat them.

The Cancer Care Foundation held a press conference today to share the results of their survey on elementary school children's eating and health habits. This study lasted one year and included over 25,000 valid surveys from 10 counties in Taiwan. It showed that eating two bowls of dark green vegetables, like spinach and kale, daily is a key factor in protecting children's eyesight.

Nutritionist Hsu Pei-yu said that dark green vegetables have important nutrients like lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, and Vitamin C. These act like a "natural shield" for the eyes. She suggested eating vegetables like kale, spinach, and rapeseeds. She also recommended eating orange and yellow vegetables such as carrots and bell peppers. Hsu Pei-yu also shared a cooking tip: to help your body take in more of these eye-protecting nutrients, it's good to cook them with a healthy oil. For example, you can stir-fry kale or spinach with oil, or boil them and add olive oil.

The survey also showed that children who spend time outdoors have a 10% to 20% lower risk of short-sightedness. It is suggested that children get 120 minutes of outdoor light every day. Areas with more green spaces, like Hualien and Taitung, have lower rates of short-sightedness (25.8% and 14.9% respectively). This is likely because the green areas help eyes focus on faraway things. The survey studied students from grades 3 to 6. Results showed that older students had a higher risk of short-sightedness. Girls had a 1.1 times higher risk than boys. Hsu Pei-yu explained that girls often reach puberty 1 to 2 years earlier than boys. During growth, the eyeball also grows quickly. If children have bad eye habits, the eyeball can grow too fast, leading to more short-sightedness.

**Taiwan's cruise market is a leader in Asia, with over 900 routes and double the bookings.**

Many people enjoy cruise travel, and Taiwan is a top country in the Asian cruise market. Travel companies have found that the most popular cruises leave from Keelung Port. The favorite places to visit are Japan and South Korea. There are now over 900 cruise routes available, and bookings have doubled.

AsiaYo, a travel company, announced today that big cruise lines plan to offer more international routes. Taiwan is very important in the Asian market. This year, there are more than 900 cruise options, and they expect bookings to double by the end of the year.

AsiaYo said that most people still prefer cruise trips starting from Keelung Port. The most popular places for travelers are still in Japan and South Korea, with Okinawa, Ishigaki Island, and Jeju Island being the top three. For "Fly Cruise" trips (where you fly to start your cruise), Southeast Asia, Europe, and the USA are the most popular places to begin. Regarding who is taking cruises, AsiaYo noted that the average age of travelers is getting younger. Before, most cruise passengers were older people. Now, the average age is between 30 and 49 years old. This is because online booking makes it easier for couples, friends, and families to choose cruises as a new travel option.

Yu Chi-yuan, AsiaYo's Chief Marketing Officer, said that Taiwan's cruise industry is entering a new period with many chances for growth. Changes in port building, adding more routes, improving service, and changing how the market is seen, all show that Taiwan is ready for a great time in cruise tourism. Yu Chi-yuan also mentioned that Taiwan's cruise market is changing. More people are booking trips online, and younger people are taking cruises. Taiwan's cruise market will continue to be a bright spot in travel, aiming for double the online bookings in 2025.

Besides the growth in cruises, another travel company, Tour World, said that new national holidays in the second half of the year will allow more flexible and frequent travel plans. Also, the strong New Taiwan Dollar and global issues making oil prices higher and flight costs increase, have made many travelers plan their trips for the end of this year and next year early. Overall bookings are up by over 20% compared to the same time last year, with bookings reaching as far as March next year. Popular trips include autumn leaf viewing and skiing in Japan and Korea, and longer trips to Europe.
