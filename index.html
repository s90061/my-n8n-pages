            <h1>US Government Shutdown Risk: White House Asks Agencies to Plan Big Layoffs</h1>
            <p>The White House Budget Office has told all federal agencies to get ready for a possible government shutdown. They need to prepare plans for a lot of layoffs, especially for workers whose jobs are not legally needed to keep important programs running.</p>
            <p>A memo from the White House Budget Office (OMB) was shared with Politico before it was sent to agencies tonight. It says that if the government shuts down, the number of government workers will be permanently reduced. This makes it much more likely that the government might shut down next week.</p>
            <p>In the memo, the OMB asked agencies to list all their programs, projects, and activities that will lose funding after October 1st and have no other money. For these areas, the OMB told agencies to start writing layoff plans. These plans will not just be for temporary unpaid leave. If the government shuts down, jobs for projects that are not important to President Trump's goals will be permanently cut.</p>
            <p>This is very different from how government shutdowns have been handled in the last few decades. In the past, unpaid leave was usually just for a short time. Employees could come back to work once Congress voted to get the government working again and gave it money. But this time, Russ Vought, the director of the OMB, is using the threat of permanent layoffs. This adds more pressure in the argument with Democratic lawmakers about government spending.</p>
            <p>The OMB wrote in the memo: "Programs that do not get forced funding will be affected first during a government shutdown." Agencies are told to send their layoff plans to the OMB. They also need to tell their employees, even those who might not be affected or would be on unpaid leave during a shutdown.</p>
            <p>An official from the OMB, who did not want to be named because the information is not yet public, said that some programs will continue to work even if the government shuts down. These include Social Security, health care (Medicare), benefits for veterans, military operations, law enforcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and air traffic control.</p>
            <p>This instruction comes at a time when Republican and Democratic lawmakers are disagreeing about money. There are only a few days left before the financial year ends on September 30th. The House of Representatives has passed a temporary spending bill to keep the federal government open until November 21st. But Democratic senators are refusing to support it. They want Republicans to talk and agree on a plan together. This plan might include keeping the "Affordable Care Act" subsidies, which are ending soon.</p>
            <p>The OMB said in its letter that if Congress successfully passes a temporary spending bill before September 30th, without any extra conditions, then these extra steps mentioned in the email will not be needed.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Helps Raise Awareness for Undocumented Migrant Children</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's top badminton player, Chou Tien-chen, is currently playing in Korea. He always cares about helping others. He has partnered with "Grace Home" to start a special exhibition. It is called "Give the 'Different' Children the Same Love" and will last for four days, starting today. Chou hopes that people will pay attention to the issue of "undocumented babies" who are children of migrant workers.</p>
            <p>The Immigration Agency's data from March 2025 shows that there are about 92,000 migrant workers in Taiwan who have gone missing. Yang Chieh-yu, who started "Grace Home" and has cared for the rights of migrant children in Taiwan for a long time, explained that some migrant mothers who become pregnant while working in Taiwan might be scared of being sent back to their home country. Because of this fear, they might choose to leave their jobs. If they do this, they become "missing" migrant workers.</p>
            <p>Yang Chieh-yu also said that "undocumented babies" are often born to migrant worker parents who have gone missing. These babies do not have legal papers, so the government cannot keep track of them. Without a nationality and health insurance, it is hard for them to get things like daily care and schooling. They also face big problems when they need medical help.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen has a strong connection with Indonesia because of his badminton career, and he has decided to get involved in this issue. He is the only Taiwanese badminton player ever to win the men's singles title at the Super 1000 Indonesia Open. His respected coach, Cheng Yung-cheng, is also from Indonesia.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen spoke to the media and said that Indonesian badminton fans are very excited about matches. This made a big impression on him about the atmosphere there. He said, "Besides playing on the court, I also pay attention to social problems in Indonesia. I have made a strong emotional connection with the people there."</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen mentioned that he was very moved to see that Grace Home continues to help these children. They provide medical care, help with daily life, and support for education. He hopes that everyone in society will help these children with their actions and care. He wants every life to be able to grow up safely and healthily.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen emphasized that sports and helping people should not have limits based on country. No matter where a child is born, they should have the right to go to school and have basic support for living. He hopes to use his influence to share care and encourage action, and to make more people aware of the issue of "undocumented babies."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Pauses Chip Export Rules for South Africa After Talks with Foreign Ministry</h1>
            <p>South Africa's foreign ministry changed the status and names of two Taiwan offices in an official government announcement. Taiwan is still thinking about how to respond. On September 23rd, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs announced that 47 types of goods, like chips, sent to South Africa would need special approval first. Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said this plan was not put on the Executive Yuan Gazette website, so it was not officially announced. It was only on the Ministry of Economic Affairs' website. After talking with and getting confirmation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they decided to stop this announcement for now.</p>
            <p>On July 21st, South Africa's foreign ministry suddenly said it would rename and lower the status of Taiwan's two offices. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently talked with other government departments about ways to react. These ideas included putting limits on sending chips to South Africa. Taiwan also asked South Africa to talk with them quickly.</p>
            <p>On September 23rd, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced plans to change some rules. These rules were about "Goods That Need Approval for Export from Free Trade Zone Companies" and "Stopping or Limiting Exports or Imports for Certain Countries, Regions, or Goods, or Taking Other Needed Actions." This meant that 47 types of goods, such as "diode chips and wafers, but not photodiodes or light-emitting diodes" (CCC8541.10.10.00-6) sent to South Africa, would first need approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. These new rules were expected to start in late November. Today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said it has stopped this announcement.</p>
