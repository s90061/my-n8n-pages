On June 30th, Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz won a difficult match against Italian player Fabio Fognini. Alcaraz played five sets and won, as he hopes to win the Wimbledon men's singles title for the third time in a row.

Alcaraz, who is ranked second in the world, played for over four hours in hot weather at Wimbledon's Centre Court. He won against 38-year-old Fognini with scores of 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1. This win allows him to move to the next round.

This is the first time since 2010 that a defending champion at Wimbledon has needed five sets to win their first match. In 2010, Roger Federer also had a tough five-set win in his first match. Alcaraz, also known as "The Young Bull," played inconsistently and made 62 unforced errors. However, he did not show any signs of being tired. In the deciding fifth set, Alcaraz broke Fognini's serve at an important moment. After saving two break points in the next game, he shouted "Come on!" to himself. Fognini, ranked 138th in the world, gave Alcaraz a harder match than expected. But in the end, Fognini became very tired, and Alcaraz showed his excellent skills in the final set. Alcaraz has never lost in the first round of any Grand Slam tournament. In the last two Wimbledon men's singles finals, he beat Serbian star Novak Djokovic. Alcaraz will play against British player Oliver Tarvet in the second round of this Wimbledon tournament. He said this will be another difficult challenge.

**Wall Street Journal: Trump Government Says Harvard Violated Students' Civil Rights**

The Wall Street Journal reported today that the US government, under President Donald Trump, told Harvard University that an investigation found Harvard broke federal civil rights laws in how it treated Jewish and Israeli students.

The Wall Street Journal looked at a letter sent today to Harvard's President, Alan Garber. The letter said that if Harvard does not make changes right away, it could lose money from the government and affect its relationship with the government.

The Associated Press reported that the Trump government's investigation found that Harvard did not protect Jewish students from being bothered or harassed. A special group from the US government sent a letter to Harvard today. They said Harvard broke civil rights laws that tell universities to protect students from unfair treatment based on their race or where they come from. Reuters could not immediately confirm the information in the report. Trump has said he is trying to make Harvard and other top universities in the US change. He believes these universities are controlled by "woke" ideas from the left and have become places that support anti-Semitism.

**Canada Drops Digital Tax, US to Restart Trade Talks**

On June 30th, Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, said that the US will immediately start trade talks with Canada again. This comes after Canada decided not to put a digital tax on American technology companies.

When Fox News Channel asked Hassett if the US and Canada would restart talks, he replied, "Of course." Hassett explained that US President Donald Trump had asked Canada to cancel the digital tax at the G7 meeting in Canada. He added, "They looked into it, and now they have agreed, so we can restart the talks."

Reuters reported that Canada had planned to put a new digital tax on US technology companies. But just hours before it was supposed to start today, Canada stopped the plan. This was done to help the stalled trade talks between the US and Canada move forward. Canada's finance department said last night that Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump will restart trade talks to reach an agreement by July 21. US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick responded on social media platform X, saying, "Thank you, Canada, for canceling the digital services tax. This tax would stop US innovation and harm any trade agreement with the US."
