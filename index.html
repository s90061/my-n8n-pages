The leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, Eric Chu, said that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has "double standards" when it comes to giving money to the public. Chu pointed out that in the past, the DPP would give money to people when the government collected too much tax. However, now that the parliament has approved giving NT$10,000 to each person, the DPP says it will "leave debt for future generations" and questions why people who don't pay taxes should get money. Chu called this a "bully mindset" and asked people to stand up against it.

The DPP's branch in Taoyuan said that how to use extra tax money can be discussed. However, they are disappointed that the KMT and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) are using their power in parliament for "bad political actions." They believe the public will vote on July 26 to remove lawmakers who are not doing a good job. Chu also supported KMT lawmakers Niu Hsu-ting and Lu Yu-ling, asking voters to say "no" to their recall from office.

**Ukraine's President Zelenskyy Plans New Prime Minister and Government Changes**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced his choice for the new Prime Minister: Yuliia Svyrydenko. She is currently the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy. Svyrydenko will take over from Denys Shmyhal, who has been Prime Minister since 2020. This change is part of a plan by President Zelenskyy to make the government work better.

Zelenskyy said that these changes are to make the country's economy stronger, help people more, and make more weapons in Ukraine. Svyrydenko, who is 39, has a master's degree in risk management and has worked in government since 2015. Many people think this decision is about managing money and resources better, especially during the war with Russia.

For Svyrydenko to become Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister, Shmyhal, must resign, and then the parliament needs to vote and approve the new choice. It is expected that Svyrydenko's nomination will be approved because the President's party has most of the seats in parliament.

**Small Plane Crashes at London Airport, At Least 4 Dead; Investigation Begins**

A small plane crashed at London Southend Airport yesterday, and at least four people have died, according to British news agency PA Media. The airport is currently closed, and officials have started an investigation into the accident.

The plane, a Beechcraft B200, which is about 12 meters long, crashed and caught fire shortly after taking off from London Southend Airport around 4 PM local time. Thick black smoke could be seen from the crash site. The airport, located about 56 kilometers east of London, will stay closed until further notice.

Many flights have been cancelled or changed because of the crash. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is now looking into what caused the accident. An AAIB spokesperson said that a team of experts arrived at the site yesterday and are continuing their investigation today.

While the exact number of deaths and people on the plane has not been officially confirmed, witnesses said the plane looked like a "fireball" when it crashed. A Dutch aviation company, Zeusch Aviation, confirmed that their plane, flight SUZ1, was involved in the accident. Their website suggests this type of plane might be used for medical transport, like moving patients or organs.
