            <h1>STARLUX Airlines and Alaska Airlines Add 12 New US Flight Spots</h1>
            <p>STARLUX Airlines said today that it is working more with Alaska Airlines. They are adding 12 new places to fly to inside the United States. This means they now share flights to 20 cities.</p>
            <p>STARLUX Airlines and Alaska Airlines began working together late last year. They shared 8 flight destinations. These were Salt Lake City, San Diego, Phoenix, Portland, Las Vegas, Dallas, Denver, and Austin.</p>
            <p>STARLUX Airlines announced today that they are adding 12 new places to fly to in the US. These flights will go from Seattle to Minneapolis, Atlanta, Tampa, Anchorage, Raleigh-Durham, Orlando, Washington Dulles, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Spokane, and Boise. Also, a new flight will go from San Francisco to Newark. This makes their flight network in North America much bigger.</p>
            <p>Glenn Chai, the head of STARLUX Airlines, said this new plan makes their flights in North America better. It also makes it easier to change flights and plan trips. He also said that people who have STARLUX Airlines and Alaska Airlines membership points can use them for Alaska Airlines flights. This gives them more choices for their travel.</p>
            <p>Alex Judson, the person in charge of Partnerships & International for Alaska Airlines, said that this new plan helps them keep their promise. They want to give more choices and good service to people flying across the Pacific Ocean. This is easy with transfers in Seattle and San Francisco.</p>
            <p>STARLUX Airlines now flies to 29 places and has 33 routes. They have many flights in Asia. They also fly to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Ontario in California, which is in North America. They keep working closely with Alaska Airlines. They also work with American Airlines. Next year, on January 15, they will start flying to Phoenix. From Phoenix, travelers can use American Airlines' many flights to get to more cities in America.</p>

            <h1>New York Times: Trump Government and Tehran Agree to Send Iranians Back</h1>
            <p>The New York Times reported today that the Trump government is sending about 100 Iranians from the US back to Iran. This news comes from two senior Iranian officers who were part of the talks. Also, one US officer who knew about the plan shared this information.</p>
            <p>The two Iranian officers told The New York Times that a special American plane left Louisiana last night. It is planned to arrive in Iran today, stopping in Qatar first. A US officer said that the flight plan was almost finished. The New York Times did not say the names of these officers because they were not allowed to speak publicly about the details.</p>
            <p>The report says this action clearly shows what the Trump government wants to do. They will send immigrants away, even if these people might face problems with their human rights. Earlier this year, the US sent some Iranians to Costa Rica and Panama. Many of these people had become Christians and might be in danger in Iran. This increase in sending people away has led to lawsuits and complaints from groups that help immigrants.</p>
            <p>For many decades, the US has offered a safe place to people who ran away from Iran. Iran has a long history of not respecting human rights. It has stopped women's rights helpers, people who disagree with the government, journalists, lawyers, small religious groups, and people from the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
            <p>It is not clear why these Iranians were being sent back or why they tried to move to the US. Recently, more Iranians have come to the border between the US and Mexico and entered the US without permission. Many of them say they were in danger in their country because of their political or religious beliefs.</p>
            <p>The US has often found it hard to send immigrants from certain countries back. This is because the US and those countries do not have normal friendly relations. Also, it takes a long time to get travel papers from the country they are going back to. So, the US sometimes had to keep them in jail for a long time or let them live in the US. In 2024, the US sent back more than 24 Iranians using regular flights. This was the highest number in many years.</p>
            <p>The two Iranian officers said that the people being sent back include men and women, and some are married couples. Some chose to leave after staying in detention centers for many months. Others did not want to leave. They said that in almost all cases, their requests to stay in the US were refused, or they had not yet gone to court to ask for asylum.</p>
            <p>These two Iranian officers said that this sending back of people is one of the rare times the US and Iranian governments have worked together. It happened after many months of talks between the two countries. One officer said that Iran's foreign ministry is helping these people return home. They were told they would be safe and would not have problems. But, he added, many people are still sad and even scared.</p>
