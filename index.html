Hong Kong universities, supported by the government, are actively trying to get international students from Harvard University to transfer. This comes after the U.S. government took action against Harvard. So far, Hong Kong universities have received about 300 transfer applications from students in the U.S. They have already accepted 36 students.

The Secretary for Education, Choi Yuk-lin, said that by June 26th, eight local universities supported by the government had received 850 questions and about 300 applications from students who wanted to transfer. From these, 36 acceptance letters were sent out.

For example, the University of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology each accepted 16 and 15 students, respectively. Chinese University of Hong Kong and Lingnan University accepted 3 and 2 students. These accepted students are not only from Harvard but also from other schools in the U.S. Ms. Choi mentioned that Hong Kong universities are always ready to attract talented people when opportunities arise.

**Two Killer Whales Seen Off Hualien Coast, Whale Watching Boat Watches from a Distance for 30 Minutes**

Recently, many whales have been seen near Hualien. Yesterday, a whale watching company saw two killer whales. They watched them for 30 minutes, staying far away and moving slowly. This is the first time killer whales have been seen in Hualien waters in three years.

The Dolo Man Whale Watching boat left Hualien Port at 4 PM yesterday. At the start of the trip, they saw a group of tropical spotted dolphins. Later, the crew saw killer whale fins far away, about 5 to 6 miles east of the Hualien Lighthouse. They believe it was a male and a female whale because of their different fin shapes.

The whale watching company said today that the killer whales swam in one direction at a steady speed, without stopping or changing course. The whale watching boat kept its distance and moved slowly alongside them, making sure not to disturb the whales' natural actions.

Mr. Lu Shih-ming, from the whale watching company, said that killer whales are not often seen in eastern Taiwan waters. The last time was three years ago. Everyone on the boat was very excited to see them this time.
