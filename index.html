These higher prices are making travel less accessible for many people, leading to a slowdown in tourism in some regions. Travel agencies and airlines are adapting by offering alternative travel options and promoting destinations that are more affordable. Experts suggest that the industry will need to find innovative solutions to manage costs and maintain competitive pricing to ensure long-term sustainability.

Restaurants and catering companies are showing increasing interest in this eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic utensils.
