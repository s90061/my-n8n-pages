            <h1>Trump: If Putin Does Not Agree to End Ukraine War, There Will Be Serious Consequences</h1>
            <p>A very important meeting between the leaders of the US and Russia is planned for August 15th in Alaska, USA. US President Trump said today that if Russian President Putin does not agree to end the war in Ukraine, Russia will face "very serious consequences." But Trump did not explain what these consequences would be.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump spoke to the media at an event today. He said that if Putin does not agree to end the war in Ukraine during their meeting, Russia will face "very serious consequences."</p>
            <p>However, when asked if this meant new punishments or taxes, Trump did not answer directly.</p>
            <p>Trump had previously said he might punish countries that buy Russian energy. He also already put higher taxes on India. He added that he might punish other countries in the future, possibly including China.</p>
            <p>Trump is expected to meet Putin face-to-face in Anchorage, the biggest city in Alaska, on August 15th. News reports say this will be the first time a US president and a Russian leader have a meeting like this since 2021.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said today that after his meeting with Putin, he plans to have another meeting soon with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Recently, Russia has attacked Ukraine more. Also, Zelenskyy was not asked to come to the US-Russia meeting on August 15th. This makes people more worried that Trump and Putin might make a deal that forces Ukraine to give up things.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Trump said that both Kyiv and Moscow need to give up some land to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting between Trump and Putin this week will immediately show if Putin is willing to make a deal. Zelenskyy has said he will not give up any land that has been taken by force.</p>
            <p>The war in Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. Since Trump came back to the White House, he has tried to get a permanent stop to the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. But so far, he has not gotten any big agreements from Russia.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: NBA Trail Blazers Find Buyer, Will Stay in Portland for NT$120 Billion</h1>
            <p>Sources told ESPN that Tom Dundon, who owns the NHL Carolina Hurricanes ice hockey team, has agreed to buy the NBA Portland Trail Blazers. This team belonged to Paul Allen, one of the people who started Microsoft. The price is a little more than 4 billion US dollars, which is about 120 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, a financial news company in the US, the Trail Blazers were one of the least valuable NBA teams this year, worth 3.65 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>ESPN, an American sports news company, also reported that Tom Dundon wants the team to stay in Portland.</p>
            <p>Paul Allen, who started Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought the Portland Trail Blazers in 1988 for 70 million US dollars (about 2.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars). He passed away from cancer in 2018. In his will, he said that the team should be sold "at some point."</p>
            <p>After Allen passed away, his sister, Jody, owned the Portland Trail Blazers as the person in charge of the Paul Allen Trust.</p>
