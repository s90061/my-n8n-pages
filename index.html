New York State Assembly member Zohran Mamdani has won the Democratic primary for New York City mayor. After three rounds of counting votes, he received more than 50% of the votes. If other political groups cannot agree on one candidate, Mamdani might become the first Muslim mayor of New York City in November.

Mamdani, who is 33 years old, is from an Indian-Ugandan family. He started in politics six years ago as a state assembly member. He calls himself a democratic socialist. His campaign focused on the high cost of living in New York City. He promised to freeze rents, build affordable housing, and make public transport and education free for young children.

Mamdani's win has caught the attention of both major US political parties. Former President Donald Trump called him a communist and said he would use federal money to punish New York if the new mayor didn't follow his rules. Older Democratic leaders are also worried about New York City's politics moving too far to the left.

**US Senate Passes "Big and Beautiful Bill"; Trump Says It Will Bring "Explosive Economic Growth"**

After many days of talks, the US Senate has passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" that President Donald Trump strongly supports. Trump said this bill will give American people tax cuts, secure borders, and a stronger military. He believes it will lead to huge economic growth in the US and wants to sign it into law before July 4.

The Senate had a very long voting process with 45 votes on different changes to the bill. In the end, the vote was 50 for and 50 against. Republican Vice President JD Vance cast the deciding vote, making the final result 51 to 50 in favor of the bill.

The bill will now go to the House of Representatives. The House passed its own version of the bill in May. The House must now accept the big changes made by the Senate, which might be difficult because some Republican members are worried about how much the bill will add to the country's debt.
