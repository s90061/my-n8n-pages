            <h1>Hualien Disaster Area: "Shovel Superheroes" from Ukraine and Japan Join Rescue Efforts</h1>
            <p>The Guangfu disaster area in Hualien needs to recover quickly. Recently, many "Shovel Superheroes" have come to help clean up the mud. There are also foreign people helping. Two women from Ukraine changed their plans to go to Hualien to help with the disaster. One Japanese man also wrote on Facebook with excitement, "Guangfu, wait for me!"</p>
            <p>Earlier, the Guangfu Township in Hualien was badly hit by floods. This happened because the Mata'an River dam lake overflowed, making the streets full of mud. Not only volunteers from all over Taiwan helped, but also international volunteers were seen. This showed true care and support across borders, which was touching.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government said that among the foreign volunteers were two young Ukrainian women. They said they have lived in Taiwan for 9 years and usually live in Taoyuan. A month ago, they planned to travel to Hualien. But when they saw the disaster, they felt very sad and decided to change their plans to help.</p>
            <p>They said that from Hualien train station, they saw many people carrying tools and wearing rain boots, hurrying to the disaster area. Taiwan Railways also added more trains to help move rescue workers, which was very touching. They said, "Many people from all over Taiwan came here from far away. It's a big deal. Yesterday, you couldn't even buy rain boots in Hualien because so many people wanted to help."</p>
            <p>And a Japanese man living in Taiwan, Saito Tadataka, wrote on Facebook today that he struggled for three days. Hualien gave him many friends and experiences this year. He thought about what he could do now, but he was also worried that going to Hualien at this time might cause problems. He didn't realize that he should act directly until he saw many "Shovel Superheroes" arriving in Guangfu online. He also decided to become a Shovel Superhero and shouted, "Guangfu, wait for me!"</p>
            <p>The Facebook page "Migration Lab" also posted today, saying that at this moment, sitting on a full train, they were "truly, truly, very, very touched." The train conductor bowed to everyone in each carriage. Some things don't even need words. The post also said, "Instead of talking more, put on your rain boots. Thank you to those who care for Hualien," and "The whole train of Shovel Superheroes is super cool."</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government thanked all groups for helping Guangfu Township. They reminded people that County Road 193 (from Jianyin Bridge to Guangfu Township) was originally narrow. Many large construction machines and rescue vehicles using it at the same time made it hard for cars to pass and caused serious traffic jams. Now, only southbound vehicles can use the road. Northbound vehicles must use Provincial Highway 11. Please follow the traffic directions and let rescue workers use the road first. We apologize for any trouble this causes.</p>

            <h1>Male Body Found Downstream of Mata'an River Identified as "Xiao Yi's" Great Uncle</h1>
            <p>It was the fifth day of the Mata'an River overflow disaster in Hualien. Today, people reported finding a male body about 30 kilometers from Guangfu area, under the Mizhan Bridge. Police and prosecutors used fingerprints to confirm the body was the great uncle of "Xiao Yi," a 6-year-old girl saved earlier on Fozu Street.</p>
            <p>Around 9 AM today, people reported finding a male body on the riverbed under Mizhan Bridge. At first, it was thought to be a worker named Cai from a farm downstream. The family also went to Ruishui Life Park to identify the body.</p>
            <p>After police and prosecutors used fingerprints, it was confirmed in the evening that the body was Mr. Wang, a 72-year-old man who lived on Fozu Street. On the day of the event, Mr. Wang, his wife, and 6-year-old girl "Xiao Yi" were all stuck in the mud. Mr. Wang and his wife worked together to lift "Xiao Yi" onto a roof beam. Because of this, "Xiao Yi" was lucky to be saved, but Mr. Wang and his wife sadly died.</p>
