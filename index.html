            <h1>Ichiro Suzuki Enters Hall of Fame, Gives English Speech, Jokes About Being a Rookie for the Third Time</h1>
            <p>Thousands of fans came to Cooperstown, New York, a famous place for baseball, today. They came to welcome five great players, including Ichiro Suzuki, into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In his speech, Ichiro Suzuki joked that he was a new player for the third time.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ichiro Suzuki, CC Sabathia from the New York Yankees, and Billy Wagner, a relief pitcher, joined the American Baseball Hall of Fame this year. Two other players, Dick Allen and Dave Parker, who have passed away, were also added. All these players have inspiring stories about baseball.</p>
            <p>Many famous players joined the Hall of Fame this year. But the most important person that day was Ichiro Suzuki, who is 51 years old. He also joined the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in January this year. He is the first baseball player to be in both Hall of Fames.</p>
            <p>As a new member of the American Baseball Hall of Fame, Ichiro Suzuki said, "This is my third time being a new player." In America, he usually spoke through a person who translated for him. But this time, he spoke in English.</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki talked about how he became a new player three times. He said, "In 1992, I was chosen after I finished high school in Japan. In 2001, I was 27 years old, and I became a new player again. The Seattle Mariners team signed me."</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki played in the Japanese baseball league for nine years. After the season in 2000, he wanted to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in America. He signed a contract with the Seattle Mariners. This started the successful second part of his career.</p>
            <p>He made a joke and said, "I know I am a new player again. I am 51 years old, so please do not be too strict with a new player like me."</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki spoke in a way that was both funny and serious. He talked about how he got into the Hall of Fame. He said it was because of being well prepared, taking care of the game, and always trying his best for the fans.</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki said that he started thinking about playing baseball in America only after he watched Hideo Nomo play for the Los Angeles Dodgers on TV in Japan.</p>
            <p>He spoke to many fans, including some from Japan. He said, "Suddenly, I saw clearly. I wanted to test myself in a place I had never thought of. I am very thankful to the Seattle Mariners for believing that I could be the first player from Japan to play a position other than pitcher."</p>
            <p>In his first year of being able to join, Ichiro Suzuki received 99.7% of the votes. He became the first Asian baseball star to enter the Hall of Fame. He is also the second player in history, after Derek Jeter, the captain of the Yankees, to get almost all votes, missing only one.</p>
            <p>Sabathia's speech was like a love letter to all the women in his life, including his grandmother.</p>
            <p>Sabathia made his Hall of Fame story even better in New York. He won more games than any other pitcher in Major League Baseball in 2009 and 2010. He said that signing with the Yankees team was "the best choice we ever made."</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki and Sabathia, who is 45 years old, were chosen for the Hall of Fame in their first year of being able to be chosen. Wagner received this honor in his tenth and last chance to be voted in. He played for the Houston Astros in 1999 and was named the best relief pitcher of the year.</p>
            <p>Parker and Allen were both chosen for the All-Star game seven times. They also won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. They were chosen for the Hall of Fame by the Classic Era Committee. Parker passed away on June 28, at 74 years old. This was six months after he learned he would be joining the Hall of Fame.</p>

            <h1>Continuous Heavy Rain Causes Landslide on Green Island's Round-the-Island Road, Traffic Stopped</h1>
            <p>Because of many days of rain, the soil became soft. This caused a landslide on the road around Green Island, near the Asahi Hot Spring in Taitung County. Traffic cannot pass in both directions. The Green Island local government has sent big machines to clear the road.</p>
            <p>This morning, people living on Green Island told the news that heavy rain for many days made the soil soft. It also rained last night. So, this morning, a part of the mountain fell onto the road. This happened on the round-the-island road near Asahi Hot Spring. Now, cars and people cannot use the road in both directions.</p>
            <p>People living there said that police officers from Green Island came to the road. They closed it to keep people and cars safe. The Green Island local government said they will quickly send big machines to clean the road.</p>

            <h1>Endangered Olive Ridley Sea Turtle Trapped in Net, Penghu Coast Guard Hears and Rescues in Time</h1>
            <p>In Penghu County, an Olive Ridley sea turtle, which is a protected animal, got stuck in an old fishing net. The Qitou Inspection Station of the Coast Guard was checking the harbor and coast. They heard the turtle crying. They saved it and sent it to the Sea Turtle Rescue Center at the Penghu Fisheries Research Institute to be cared for.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard said that on July 25, at 9:35 PM, the Qitou Inspection Station was checking the harbor and coast. They heard a living sea turtle crying about 10 meters from the shore. They went to look and saw it was stuck in an old, broken fishing net. It could not get out and had clear injuries on its body. They quickly told the Penghu County Agriculture and Fisheries Bureau and the Ocean Conservation Administration to help save it.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard said that the saved sea turtle is an Olive Ridley sea turtle, which is a protected kind. The turtle's shell is about 46 centimeters long and 50 centimeters wide. The Coast Guard and the Agriculture and Fisheries Bureau worked together. They first put the turtle safely at the Qitou Inspection Station. On July 26, staff from the Ocean Conservation Station took the turtle. They then sent it to the Sea Turtle Rescue Center in Penghu for more care.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard said that their officers usually patrol the sea, keep people safe, save lives, and help people. They also said that they must protect the animals and plants in the ocean. They ask everyone to help keep our ocean's valuable resources safe. Please do not throw away fishing nets or other trash into the sea. This will stop harm to sea animals. If you see anything wrong or need help from the Coast Guard, please call "118" right away. Let's all work together for the ocean.</p>
