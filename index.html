            <h1>Anthropic Stops Chinese Companies and Groups from Using Its AI</h1>
            <p>The American technology company Anthropic said it will stop Chinese companies and groups from using its artificial intelligence services. It will also put stronger rules on areas where governments have a lot of power.</p>
            <p>This new company is known for its Claude chatbot and AI models. It is worth about 183 billion US dollars and gets a lot of help from Amazon. Anthropic says it focuses on making AI safe and using it responsibly.</p>
            <p>Companies in countries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran could not use Anthropic's business services before. This was because of rules and safety concerns.</p>
            <p>Today, Anthropic said in a statement that even with these rules, some groups still found ways to use their services. For example, they used smaller companies registered in other countries.</p>
            <p>The statement said: "This new rule will stop companies or groups controlled by China and other forbidden areas from using our products. This is true no matter where they actually work."</p>
            <p>"Companies controlled by China and other such areas might have to share data or work with spy agencies because of their laws. This could cause national security risks."</p>
            <p>Anthropic also said that this update to its service rules will affect companies that are directly or indirectly owned more than 50% by companies in areas that are not supported.</p>
            <p>The statement said: "To develop AI safely, everyone must work together to stop bad use by powerful groups that are against us."</p>

            <h1>Students from "Study Abroad Program" Go to Cambodia to Help People</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education held a meeting today to share stories from the "Study Abroad Program." Yu Song-ai, a social work student from Shih Chien University, went to Cambodia. She interned at the Youth Empowerment Center (ACE) and helped a humanitarian group in poor areas. She learned how to work and talk with an international team.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education held this meeting for students who got awards from the "Study Abroad Program." 26 students received honors. Yu Song-ai shared her experiences for the "New Southbound Study Abroad Dream" program. She spoke to students who want to study or intern overseas later.</p>
            <p>Yu Song-ai, who studies social work, had served in Myanmar for a short time before. This made her want to learn more about different cultures and see how people really live. This time, through the "Study Abroad Program," she went to Cambodia for an internship at ACE. Every day was a new challenge, from learning the language and trying new food, to getting used to the weather and talking with local children.</p>
            <p>In the "Hope Porridge Project," Yu Song-ai worked with partners from Singapore to plan events. They held charity activities and helped children in poor areas with their homework. Because the team members came from different cultures, they sometimes had different ideas and small problems. This helped her understand how to find the good points in different team members and keep the team working well, even with limited resources.</p>
            <p>Being alone in a foreign country, Yu Song-ai sometimes felt lonely. The work was also difficult. She often doubted herself, but she also saw her weaknesses and blind spots. She realized that honest communication is the only way to truly work together in a multicultural place. This experience made her even more sure that she wants to be a social worker in the future.</p>
            <p>Li Zhi-ying, a student from Southern Taiwan University of Science and Technology, shared her story for the "Study Abroad for Disadvantaged Students" program. She went to Kurume University in Fukuoka, Japan, for a one-year exchange study.</p>
            <p>Li Zhi-ying thanked the program for giving students from families with less money a chance to study abroad. She also talked about a class where she had to write and present a paper in Japanese. She chose the mascot of Kurume City as her topic. She even went to the city office to talk to staff. She not only learned about how the city advertises itself, but her Japanese language skills also got much better. Her paper won the "Best Award" for the semester.</p>

            <h1>Innolux's CarUX Shows New Augmented Reality Display at Munich Car Show</h1>
            <p>Innolux Display Corp. announced today that its company CarUX will be at the IAA Mobility car show in Munich, Germany. They will show a new display system that goes from one side of the car to the other. It will also have an augmented reality head-up display that uses tiny LED lights (Micro LED). This technology will mix information with the driver's view in a natural way.</p>
            <p>The IAA Mobility international car show in Munich, Germany, will happen from September 8th to 12th. CarUX will show a new car cabin design that uses many new technologies.</p>
            <p>CarUX said that the Micro LED technology they are showing will be very important for car displays in the future. They are focusing on three main uses. First, a bright display that projects clear information onto the clear part of the front windshield. Second, a way to connect screens without borders. This Micro LED technology can create large and flexible display screens.</p>
            <p>Also, clear display technology makes augmented reality features look more natural in the car.</p>
            <p>Besides new display technology, CarUX also pointed out that they have smart new uses for car systems. This includes "Vital Sign Sensing" technology. This technology can put sensors exactly where the passenger sits. These sensors can check the driver's and passengers' body conditions in real time. This will make driving safer for everyone.</p>
