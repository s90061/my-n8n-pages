            <h1>China: Vice Premier He Lifeng to Go to Sweden for Economic and Trade Talks with the US from July 27 to 30</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced this afternoon that, after talks between China and the United States, China's Vice Premier He Lifeng will go to Sweden from July 27 to 30. He will hold economic and trade talks with the US side to continue discussing "economic and trade issues that both sides care about."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce also stated that both China and the US will follow the important agreement made during the phone call between their leaders (Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump) on June 5. They will use the China-US economic and trade discussion system well, based on the ideas of mutual respect, peaceful living together, and working together for everyone's benefit. They will continue to discuss "economic and trade issues that both sides care about."</p>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business News on July 22, US Eastern time, that he will hold the third round of high-level talks with Chinese officials in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, from July 28 to 29. The goal is to reach an agreement that might delay a deadline and to talk about making trade between the two countries more balanced.</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China made an agreement during talks in Geneva. Both sides agreed to greatly lower high taxes on goods for 90 days. The break in the US-China trade dispute will end on August 12.</p>

            <h1>Responding to Concerns: China Says Yarlung Tsangpo River Project is "Within Its Own Rights"</h1>
            <p>China is building a hydropower project on the lower parts of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. This has caused worries and criticism from India and Bangladesh, which are further downstream. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, stated today that this project is "within China's own country rights." He also said it will not negatively affect countries downstream. China has talked with the downstream countries and has started working together on water data and flood control.</p>
            <p>China's Foreign Ministry held its regular press conference this afternoon. CCTV News reported that Guo Jiakun said the above when answering questions from foreign media.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun claimed that building the hydropower project on the lower Yarlung Tsangpo River is "something China can do within its own borders." The goal is to quickly develop clean energy, greatly improve people's lives in the area, and actively respond to climate change. He said that China always acts very responsibly when developing rivers that cross borders. It also has a lot of experience in building hydropower projects.</p>
            <p>He claimed that the project's planning, design, and building "strictly follow China's highest industry standards." They are doing everything to build the project while protecting the environment, avoiding many important sensitive natural areas, and keeping the original natural system as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun said that the hydropower project on the lower Yarlung Tsangpo River will help the entire river area with disaster prevention and reduction. He added that it will not cause any bad effects for areas downstream. China has worked with the downstream countries on things like sharing water flow information and reducing flood damage. They have also had necessary talks about this project. He said they will continue to work more closely with downstream countries "to benefit the people in the river basin."</p>
            <p>BBC and other news groups reported that India and Bangladesh, which are downstream from the Yarlung Tsangpo River, have both shown concern and worry about China building a hydropower project there. They are worried that both the variety of life and people's ways of making a living will be harmed. Experts and Indian officials have warned that the dam from this project will give China the power to control or change the Yarlung Tsangpo River's path.</p>

            <h1>2026 Kinmen Marathon Route Changed to Be Flatter for Better Times</h1>
            <p>The 2026 Kinmen Marathon will take place next year on January 24 and 25. This time, the race path has been made flatter, which will help runners achieve better times. Runners from Kinmen can sign up starting now. All other runners can sign up starting on the 28th.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen County Government held a press conference this afternoon to explain details about this race. Kinmen County Deputy Magistrate Li Wen-liang, Education Department Director Sun Li-chi, and others were there.</p>
            <p>Li Wen-liang told reporters that the race path still has a military feel. It now also includes the Bo Yu Road, which many runners missed. He also said that the Kinmen Marathon welcomes runners who have joined in previous years. For first-time marathon runners, there will be "first-marathon race bibs" and special commemorative wine. He sincerely invited runners who have not yet participated in the Kinmen Marathon to join.</p>
            <p>Regarding the problem of hard-to-get plane tickets, Li Wen-liang said that if runners sign up for the Kinmen Marathon but cannot book their plane tickets right away, they can register for a waiting list. This shows the need for flights, and the county government will talk with airlines about using bigger planes and adding more flights. He said, "If you can't book at first, please don't worry."</p>
            <p>Media asked if mainland Chinese runners would participate. Li Wen-liang said that mainland Chinese runners are welcome, and the county government also plans to invite runners and running clubs from Fujian. He mentioned that last year, about 1,000 mainland Chinese runners participated, and they hope to attract even more runners based on that.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen County Government's Education Department said in a press release that this time, the full marathon route has been slightly changed. It will start from the square in front of the Kinmen-Matsu Joint Service Center. First, runners will go southwest in Kinmen, then run counter-clockwise around the island. They will pass through Qionglin Village, Cihu Lake, along Bo Yu Road, the section with military tunnels on Huan Dao South Road, and natural areas around Shuangli Lake and Cihu Lake, then return to the start and finish point.</p>
            <p>The Education Department noted that the new sections of the route are flatter, which will help runners achieve better times. The cut-off time for the full marathon has been changed from 7 hours to 6.5 hours this year. While still being friendly for first-time marathon runners, it also encourages athletes to try for their personal best (PB).</p>
            <p>For the 2026 Kinmen Marathon, registration opened at 6 PM today for runners from Kinmen. Registration for all other runners will open on the 28th, with competitive groups starting at 3 PM and recreational groups at 6 PM. On January 24, 2026, the Kinmen Marathon will have a health and leisure group race, starting at Jincheng Athletic Field. The competitive group will start on January 25 at the square in front of the Kinmen-Matsu Joint Service Center.</p>
