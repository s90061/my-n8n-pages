Taiwan and the UK have signed an agreement after almost two years of talks. This agreement, called ETP, covers three areas: digital trade, energy and reducing carbon, and investments. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is happy about this new step in trade relations between Taiwan and the UK. They will work with other government parts to make more trade partnerships based on shared values.

Today, the UK representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, and Taiwan's representative in the UK, Yao Chin-xiang, signed the ETP agreements. This happened with Douglas Alexander, a UK trade official, watching. The three areas of the agreement are digital trade, energy and net-zero emissions, and investment. MOFA said in a press release tonight that they welcome this news. They are glad to see a new important step in trade cooperation between Taiwan and the UK.

MOFA explained that the ETP agreement was first signed in November 2023. It was the first official trade plan between Taiwan and a European country, which was very important. Today, Taiwan and the UK signed more specific agreements on important topics they both care about. This will make their trade relationship even stronger. MOFA also said that Taiwan and UK relations have grown a lot recently. In June, the British Royal Navy ship 'HMS Spey' sailed through the Taiwan Strait. The UK also released plans about defense and national security, showing they care about peace in the Taiwan Strait. On June 26, after leaving the EU, the UK released its first 'Trade Strategy.' It said the UK will keep improving its trade with Taiwan under the ETP plan. MOFA stressed that Taiwan will keep working on its diplomacy. They will use the good relationship with the UK to start new trade cooperation based on shared values, working with all government departments.

Today, the Tucheng Hospital in New Taipei City had a ceremony for its new and old directors. The new director is Lai Chi-chun, who used to be the director of Keelung Chang Gung Hospital. New Taipei City Vice Mayor Chu Ti-chih attended and hoped that Lai Chi-chun would lead the hospital to become a top example in smart healthcare and long-term growth.

Under the supervision of Cheng Wen-chun, the head of the Chang Gung Medical Foundation, the former director of Tucheng Hospital, Huang Ching-lung, handed over his job to the new director, Lai Chi-chun. Vice Mayor Chu Ti-chih was there to see it. Chang Gung Hospital also made Huang Ching-lung an honorary director.

Vice Mayor Chu Ti-chih said that during his time, Huang Ching-lung helped the hospital get approvals as a serious emergency hospital and a teaching hospital. He also built a smart healthcare system. During the pandemic, he helped a lot with disease prevention and kept people healthy. The Vice Mayor said that the city government has high hopes for Lai Chi-chun as the new director. They hope he will use his medical skills and management experience to bring new ideas to healthcare in New Taipei. Lai Chi-chun said that taking this job is not just an honor, but also a promise to "protect citizens' health and lead healthcare innovation." He plans to bring in more resources from Chang Gung, make the hospital bigger, improve the system for sending patients to other doctors, and work with local doctors' groups and clinics. This will create a good local healthcare system, allowing citizens to get high-level care like at a big medical center, but at the cost of a local hospital.

US stock markets like Wall Street reached new high points, which made most Asian stock markets go up today. At the same time, investors are closely watching how different countries try to make trade agreements with the US. This is happening before July 9, when the US plans to start new tariffs (taxes on imported goods).

People in the market now think the US will lower interest rates more, which makes the US dollar weaker. Investors are also paying attention to US President Trump's tax cut plan, which will be voted on in the Senate. Some experts warn that this plan could add trillions of dollars to the US national debt. On June 27, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes in the US hit record highs. The market is hopeful that governments can avoid Trump's tariffs, which were supposed to start in April but were delayed to July 9 for talks.

Officials from Japan and India have stayed longer in Washington to keep talking. This gives more hope that these two big economies will reach an agreement. On June 27, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business Network that "some countries have offered us very good deals, but they might not all be finalized by next week." This statement made people more hopeful that the tariff deadline might be moved back. He also said: "We have 18 important trade partners... If we can sign agreements with 10 or 12 of them, and we also have 20 other important partnerships, I think we can finish the trade agreements before Labor Day on September 1." However, last weekend, Trump said he does not think he will extend the deadline. He told Maria Bartiromo on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures": "I don't think I need to do that." After US stocks reached new highs on June 27, most Asian stocks also went up today. Stock markets in Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Wellington, and Bangkok all closed higher. However, stock markets in Hong Kong and Taipei closed lower.
