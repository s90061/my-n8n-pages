New reports show that artificial intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on jobs around the world. For some workers, AI is making their jobs easier and more efficient. For example, AI can help with tasks like writing emails, analyzing large amounts of data, or even helping doctors diagnose illnesses more quickly. This means people can focus on more creative or complex parts of their work.

However, the picture is not the same for everyone. Jobs that involve simple, repeated tasks are more likely to be changed or even replaced by AI. This could include some roles in customer service or data entry. Experts say that if people don't learn new skills, they might find it harder to find work in the future.

Governments and businesses are discussing how to prepare people for these changes. Training programs are becoming more important to help workers adapt to a new job market where AI plays a bigger role. The goal is to make sure that the benefits of AI are shared widely and that fewer people are left behind as technology advances.

**The Four-Day Work Week: A Growing Trend**

Many companies across the globe are trying out a new way of working: a four-day work week, but with the same pay. Recent trials, especially in countries like the UK, Ireland, and Australia, have shown positive results for both employees and businesses.

Workers involved in these trials reported feeling less stressed and healthier, with more time for their families and hobbies. This led to a better balance between their work and personal lives. For companies, the change often meant that employees were more focused and productive during their four working days. Businesses also saw fewer people leaving their jobs and found it easier to attract new talent.

While not every company finds it easy to switch, especially those that need to be open five or seven days a week, the idea is becoming more popular. It shows that traditional work patterns are changing, and many businesses are looking for new ways to keep their employees happy and efficient.

**Venice Introduces Fee to Manage Tourism**

The famous Italian city of Venice has started charging visitors a small fee to enter, especially those who come just for the day. This new rule began in April and aims to help the city manage the large number of tourists it receives, particularly during its busiest times.

The fee is currently a trial for 29 specific peak days throughout the year. City officials hope it will encourage people to visit at less crowded times or to stay longer. Venice has struggled for years with "overtourism," where the sheer volume of visitors puts a strain on the city's infrastructure and the daily lives of its residents.

While some locals support the fee as a necessary step to protect their unique city, others worry it might change the city's welcoming atmosphere or not be enough to solve the problem. Venice is one of many popular destinations worldwide trying to find a balance between welcoming visitors and protecting its historical and cultural identity.`;
