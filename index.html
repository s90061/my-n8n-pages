            <h1>Damaged Solar Panels in Yizhu Are Being Removed Slowly; The Government Will Help Companies Clean Them Up Faster</h1>
            <p>In Yizhu Township, Chiayi County, the solar panels at Xinzhuang Detention Pond were badly damaged by Typhoon Danas. But the company removing them is working slowly. Premier Cho Jung-tai visited today and was not happy. He told the company to speak up if they have problems, and the government will help.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai went to Xinzhuang Detention Pond in Yizhu and Xinwen in Budai, Chiayi County. He was with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Guo Zhi-hui, the Minister of Environment, Peng Chi-ming, and legislator Tsai Yi-yu from the Democratic Progressive Party. They checked how the damaged solar panels from Typhoon Danas were being removed.</p>
            <p>In Xinwen, the work to remove damaged solar panels is almost finished, which is what the government expected. But in Yizhu, most of the broken solar panels are still stuck in the pond. This made Premier Cho Jung-tai very unhappy. He told the Thai company in charge of the solar farm to clean them up quickly. He said they should tell the government about any problems, and the government will help. He added that the government will not just ask when the work will be done.</p>
            <p>Minister Guo Zhi-hui also told the Thai company that the land around Xinzhuang Detention Pond belongs to Taiwan Sugar Corporation. The broken solar panels can be stored there for a short time. If the company needs machines or workers to clean up, the Ministry of Economic Affairs can help. He urged them not to delay any longer.</p>
            <p>Legislator Tsai Yi-yu spoke to the Central News Agency. He said that the solar panel company in Yizhu is from Thailand. They might not know how to handle disaster relief in Taiwan, which is why there are delays. The Thai company said they also want to clean up quickly, but they cannot find a company to help them remove the panels.</p>
            <p>After looking at the solar panel cleanup, Premier Cho Jung-tai and Minister Guo Zhi-hui went to the memorial hall for Li Yuan-han, a 36-year-old employee of Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) who died while working. They gave their condolences to his family and offered money to help them. Taipower Chairman Zeng Wen-sheng, Chiayi County Deputy Magistrate Liu Pei-tung, and Democratic Progressive Party legislators Chen Guan-ting, Tsai Yi-yu, and Wang Mei-hui also visited the memorial hall today to show their respect.</p>

            <h1>Philippines' Top Court Says Vice President Sara Duterte's Impeachment Process Is Against the Law</h1>
            <p>The Philippines' Supreme Court announced today that the process to remove Vice President Sara Duterte from office is not allowed by their country's law. This is because it broke a rule about impeaching the same official more than once in a year. Sara Duterte was facing impeachment by the Congress for claims like corruption and threatening to kill the president.</p>
            <p>Camille Ting, a spokesperson for the Philippine Supreme Court, announced today in a press conference that the House of Representatives' impeachment process against Sara Duterte should be stopped. This is based on the "one-year rule" in their constitution.</p>
            <p>The "one-year rule" means that people or groups cannot start more than one impeachment case against the same high-ranking official within one year.</p>
            <p>Sara Duterte said today that she was happy about the Supreme Court's decision. The Senate, which is supposed to handle impeachment cases, also said they must respect the Supreme Court's decision.</p>
            <p>Several groups in the Philippines accused Sara Duterte last December. They said she broke the constitution, was corrupt, did not act honestly for the public, and threatened the president's life. They sent three requests for impeachment to the House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>In February of this year, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Sara Duterte. They combined the accusations into a fourth request and sent it to the Senate. In the Philippines' system, the House of Representatives starts the impeachment, and the Senate holds the trial.</p>
            <p>In May of this year, the Philippines had midterm elections. All more than 300 seats in the House of Representatives were re-elected, and 12 out of 24 seats in the Senate were also re-elected. This meant the impeachment process continued from one session of Congress to the next.</p>
            <p>Sara Duterte's lawyers asked the Supreme Court in February if the fourth impeachment request was legal. They said that the first three requests had already been voted on by committees in the House of Representatives, which means the impeachment process had already begun.</p>
            <p>In June, her lawyers again argued that the impeachment process should not continue across different sessions of Congress. They asked the Supreme Court to stop the impeachment process for a while and to say that the impeachment requests were not valid.</p>
            <p>Camille Ting explained today at the press conference that the House of Representatives did not act on the first three impeachment requests. So, when the last session ended, those requests were considered rejected. The fourth impeachment request was like trying to impeach her again. Because the House of Representatives filed these three requests on February 5 of this year, no one can ask to impeach Sara Duterte again until February 6 of next year.</p>
            <p>Sara Duterte is a popular person who might run for president in the Philippines in 2028. If the impeachment case had passed in the Senate, she would lose her job as Vice President and would not be allowed to hold public office again for the rest of her life.</p>
            <p>According to a survey released by the Philippine polling group "Social Weather Stations" (SWS) on July 15 this month, 61% of people "trust Sara Duterte quite a lot."</p>
