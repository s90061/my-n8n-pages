https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp0d473l78yo

Good news for people in the UK: the speed at which prices are increasing has slowed down a lot. In April, the inflation rate fell to 2.3%. This is the lowest it has been in almost three years. This means that while prices are still going up, they are not rising as quickly as before.

A big reason for this change is that gas and electricity bills have become cheaper. Also, the cost of food is not going up as fast as it used to. This is helpful for families and individuals because their money can now buy a little more than it could when prices were rising very quickly. This slower rise in prices might also lead to the Bank of England thinking about making it cheaper to borrow money in the future.

**US Job Market is Cooling Down, But Still Strong**

The number of jobs available in the United States reached its lowest point in three years this June. There were about 8.73 million job openings, which is fewer than before. This suggests that the job market, which has been very busy, is now calming down a bit.

However, it's not all bad news. More people were hired in June, showing that companies are still taking on new employees. Also, fewer people decided to leave their jobs, which might mean they are feeling less sure about finding new work quickly. Experts say that even though there are fewer job openings, the job market is still quite healthy. It just means it's not as busy as it was during the peak hiring period.

**Europe Tries to Solve "Overtourism" Problem**

https://edition.cnn.com/travel/europe-overtourism-solution-greece-santorini-travel/index.html

Many popular places in Europe, like the beautiful island of Santorini in Greece, are facing a challenge called "overtourism." This means that too many tourists are visiting at the same time, which can cause problems for local people and the environment. When too many people visit, it can damage old buildings, create a lot of rubbish, and make daily life difficult for those who live there.

To fix this, European cities and countries are trying different ideas. Some places are now limiting how many visitors can come each day. Others are making it more expensive for tourists, for example, by increasing taxes or charging fees to enter popular areas. There are also efforts to send tourists to less famous but equally interesting places. The main goal is to protect these wonderful destinations so that both visitors and local residents can enjoy them in the future.`;
