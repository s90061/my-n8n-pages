            <h1>Coast Guard Stops Illegal Entry Before Nuclear Referendum</h1>
            <p>Tomorrow is the day for the Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 referendum. The Coast Guard Administration's Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch said that to make sure the referendum goes smoothly, the coast guard in these three island areas started a "joint land and sea sweep" today. This is to stop people from other countries from entering illegally. They want to prevent these people from causing problems and affecting the election, which could make society unstable.</p>
            <p>In a press release, the Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch of the Coast Guard said that this sweep focuses on ports, coastal areas, empty houses, windbreak forests, and places where Chinese boats often cross the border. They are also checking ships more carefully. The goal is to find unusual signs early and deal with them quickly.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch added that on the day of the referendum, they will continue to watch the sea in their areas closely. They will do more patrols on land and sea and stay in their positions. They will try their best to stop illegal activities from outside the country and inside the country. This will keep the country safe and society stable.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard asks people to call the "118" Coast Guard hotline right away if they see anything suspicious in the sea or on the coast. The Coast Guard will act quickly.</p>

            <h1>Ministry Helps Companies Make Generic Drugs Faster to Win Global Market</h1>
            <p>Generic drugs are a big reason for growth in the world's drug making industry. To get more business, Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial Development Agency (IDA) is running a program called "High-Value Drug Development and New Process Technology Expansion Plan." This plan helps companies develop and sell drugs faster. It also makes Taiwan's drug industry more valuable and helps it compete better globally.</p>
            <p>Last year, the global generic drug market was worth about 456.1 billion US dollars. It is expected to grow to 666.5 billion US dollars by 2029, with an average yearly growth of 7.9%.</p>
            <p>Today, the IDA announced in a press release that this plan focuses on making better new drugs (called 505(b)(2) products) and using new ways to make them. This helps companies create unique and difficult-to-make drugs more quickly. It also helps them get these drugs to the market and enter it faster. At the same time, the plan supports changes to the National Health Insurance drug payment rules. The first two generic drugs approved will get special prices. This helps companies get the first drug license and get ahead in the market.</p>
            <p>The IDA pointed out that since 2023, 11 drug companies have joined the plan. These include well-known Taiwanese companies like Yung Shin, Yulin, Standard, Synmosa, and Amend. They are developing many types of drugs, such as treatments for cancer, mental health drugs, and hormone and metabolism drugs. One drug has already received a license, and five are waiting for approval. This shows that some valuable drugs are successfully being developed in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>For example, Yulin Bio-Tech got help from the plan. It sped up the time from clinical trials to getting approval. Yulin successfully made an immune-regulating extended-release tablet, which makes it easier for patients to take their medicine. Amend Bio-Medical, a company that used to sell medical devices and is now making drugs, received its first license for Sugammadex (a drug to reverse muscle relaxants) in Taiwan this year. It did this by working with research groups and getting help with resources. This makes Amend a good example of how Taiwan can make its own drugs.</p>
            <p>The IDA said that in the future, through this "High-Value Drug Development and New Process Technology Expansion Plan" and other programs like the "Industrial Innovation Platform," they will keep helping companies do more research. They will also help them use the power of research groups and resources from different areas. This will make the drug supply chain stronger and better able to react to problems. They will also help Taiwan move from just making generic drugs to selling its own drug brands. This will help the industry improve and connect with the world.</p>

            <h1>Trump Government Loses Case, Florida Immigration Center in Everglades Ordered to Close</h1>
            <p>A US federal judge today stopped the Trump government and Florida state government from sending immigrants to an immigration center. This center was called "Alligator Alcatraz." The judge also ordered most of the equipment to be taken down, which means the center is basically closing.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Federal District Court Judge Kathleen Williams made this decision because environmental groups, "Friends of the Everglades" and "Center for Biological Diversity," sued the Donald Trump government.</p>
            <p>The Florida state government quickly announced that they would appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>The detention center is in the Everglades wetlands in Florida, where many alligators live. The center was built in an old airport in only 8 days in June. It was made quickly with large white tents, bunk beds, and caged areas.</p>
            <p>Kristi Noem, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, once said that the center was planned to hold 3,000 people.</p>
            <p>US President Trump, who promised to send millions of immigrants home, visited the center in July. He praised the tough conditions there and even joked that alligators could act as guards.</p>
            <p>The White House also gave it the name "Alligator Alcatraz." This name reminded people that Trump once said he wanted to reopen Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, California.</p>
            <p>Environmental groups and people who criticize Trump's actions against immigrants did not like this detention center in Florida. These critics thought the center was not kind to people.</p>
            <p>The environmental groups said that the center was a danger to the delicate natural environment of the Everglades. They also said it was built too quickly without checking its effect on the environment, which might be against the law.</p>
