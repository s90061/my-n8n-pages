            <h1>After 20 Months, Prince Harry and King Charles III Have Tea Together</h1>
            <p>Today, Prince Harry of the UK had afternoon tea with his father, King Charles III. This was the first time they had seen each other in 20 months. It might be the first step to fix their relationship.</p>
            <p>Harry last saw his father in February 2024. At that time, King Charles III had just said he had cancer and started treatment.</p>
            <p>Buckingham Palace said that King Charles, who is 76 years old, had tea with his son today at Clarence House in London.</p>
            <p>Harry, who is 40 years old, arrived in the UK on the 8th of this month. He plans to go to several events.</p>
            <p>Harry and his American wife, Meghan, moved to California in the US in 2020. After that, Harry often spoke negatively about the British Royal Family and its rules in interviews, documentaries, and his book. He made many strong comments about his father Charles and his brother William, who will become king. Because of this, his relationship with his family completely broke.</p>
