        const text = `**AI Will Change Many Jobs, Says New Report**

A recent report by the World Economic Forum suggests that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will significantly change over half of all jobs globally. This means that about 56% of jobs could be affected by this new technology in some way. The report explains that AI won't just replace people; often, it will "augment" jobs. This means AI tools will help people do their work more efficiently and better, making them more productive.

While some jobs may disappear, many new ones will also be created, especially roles related to AI development and management. For example, there will be a higher demand for data analysts and AI specialists. However, certain roles, like those in administration or clerical work, might see fewer job openings as AI takes over routine tasks. To prepare for these changes, workers will need to learn new skills or improve their existing ones. This "reskilling" and "upskilling" will be very important for people to stay relevant in the changing job market. Businesses also need to adapt and invest in training their employees for the future.

**Four-Day Work Week Becoming More Common**

The idea of working just four days a week is gaining popularity around the world, as more companies and countries experiment with this new model. This trend suggests a change in how we think about daily life and work. Companies that have tried it often report positive results. Employees typically enjoy a better work-life balance, meaning they have more time for family, hobbies, and personal well-being. This can lead to reduced stress and greater job satisfaction.

Interestingly, studies and pilot programs in various countries, such as the UK and Iceland, have shown that productivity can remain the same or even increase, even with fewer working hours. This is because employees are often more focused and motivated when they know they have a longer weekend. There can also be environmental benefits, as fewer commutes might lead to less pollution. However, the four-day week isn't suitable for all industries, like healthcare or retail, where constant service is needed. Implementing it successfully requires careful planning and commitment from both employers and employees to ensure work gets done efficiently. Despite challenges, many believe this flexible work arrangement could become a common practice in the future.

**Cities Getting Hotter Faster, Study Shows**

New research highlights a growing problem: cities around the world are experiencing hotter temperatures more quickly than rural areas. This phenomenon is often called the "urban heat island effect." It happens because city environments, with their many buildings, roads, and concrete surfaces, absorb and trap more heat from the sun compared to natural landscapes like parks or forests. This trapped heat can make daily life in cities much more uncomfortable and even dangerous during heatwaves.

The rising heat has several negative impacts. It can lead to serious health problems, such as heatstroke, especially for older people or those with existing health conditions. It also increases the demand for air conditioning, leading to higher energy use and costs. Additionally, extreme heat can damage city infrastructure, like buckling roads or railways. To combat this, cities are looking for innovative solutions. These include planting more trees and creating green spaces, using lighter-colored materials for roofs and roads that reflect sunlight, and setting up public cooling centers where people can escape the heat. Addressing this issue is vital for the well-being of billions of people living in urban areas worldwide.`;
