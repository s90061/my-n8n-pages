            <h1>Markets Hope for Longer US-China Trade Truce, Wall Street Stocks Mostly Up</h1>
            <p>New York, July 28 (CNA) â€“ Most major stock indexes on Wall Street went up today. This happened because US President Trump and the EU reached an agreement on tariffs. This made the market hope that the United States and China would continue their trade truce.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down a little by 64.36 points, or 0.14%, closing at 44837.56 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up slightly by 1.13 points, or 0.02%, closing at 6389.77 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index went up by 70.27 points, or 0.33%, closing at 21178.59 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 91.24 points, or 1.62%, closing at 5737.1 points. (Translator: Chen Yen-chun / Editor: Lu Ying-tzu) 1140729</p>

            <h1>EU Commissioner: US and EU to Form Metal Alliance Against China's Overproduction</h1>
            <p>Brussels, July 28 (CNA) â€“ Maros Sefcovic, the European Union (EU) Commissioner for Trade, said today that the EU and the United States will create a "Metal Alliance." This alliance will be based on a trade agreement. Its goal is to lessen the impact of China's subsidized production on global markets.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Sefcovic said US officials understood that steel companies in the US and EU face similar problems. This was after hours of talks to reach an agreement. Because of this, steel and aluminum makers in the EU will get a special system. This system would replace President Trump's 50% import tax with a very low or no tax. But this system is not yet final.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic said at a press conference: "This agreement clearly shows that we plan to work together on steel, aluminum, copper, and related products. I call this the Metal Alliance. It will effectively build a shared protection around our economies by using special tax amounts and good treatment for trade, which are at historic levels."</p>
            <p>This idea for an alliance and a special tax system shows that Europe and America are increasingly trying to stop China's overproduction.</p>
            <p>Sefcovic also said: "It is clear that the problem is overproduction. We believe this problem is connected to illegal subsidies." (Translator: Lu Ying-tzu / Editor: Chen Yen-chun) 1140729</p>
