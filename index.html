            <h1>Russia Uses Old Meeting Example, Says Talks with Ukraine Are Hard, Leaders' Meeting Not Ready</h1>
            <p>(Kyiv, July 24, Central News Agency) The third round of talks between Russia and Ukraine happened yesterday in Istanbul, Turkey. Mr. Vladimir Medinsky, who leads the Russian team and used to be Russia's Culture Minister, said that both sides have big differences about stopping the fighting. He said that leaders are not ready to meet yet. He used an old meeting from China's civil war, between Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek, to explain that without clear agreements, a meeting of leaders will not really help.</p>
            <p>Mr. Medinsky was Russia's Culture Minister from 2012 to 2020. He also helped write a history book in 2023 called "Russian History, 1945 to the 21st Century." This was the first Russian history book to talk about the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
            <p>After the talks, Mr. Medinsky told reporters that Russia and Ukraine still disagree on the small details of stopping the fighting. He said that before a meeting of leaders can happen, both sides should first agree on the main points. If not, the meeting would just be a show.</p>
            <p>He used the meeting between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong during China's civil war as an example. He said that a meeting of leaders without good preparation does not work. He explained, "Chiang Kai-shek wanted to meet in person to decide the details. They did meet and took a photo, but this did not end the civil war. Their main problems were not solved, so the war continued."</p>
            <p>Mr. Medinsky added that even though the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) had strong help from the West at that time, they still lost the war to the Communist Party. He said, "A meeting of leaders is only good if it is well-prepared. This is what we told Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Mr. Medinsky was talking about the "Chongqing Talks" in history. In 1945, Chiang Kai-shek asked Mao Zedong to meet three times. Then, on August 29, the two parties started talks in Chongqing. They talked for 43 days about a plan for peace. On October 10, they signed an agreement, but it was not followed, and the civil war started again.</p>
            <p>In these recent talks, Russia and Ukraine discussed notes they had shared before. But Russia said that Ukraine's army must leave four regions completely: Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Russia said this is needed to stop the fighting. Ukraine, however, said that Russia's army must leave all Ukrainian land. Their ideas are very different, so there was little progress in the talks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rustem Umerov, who leads the Ukrainian team and is the head of the National Security and Defense Council, suggested that leaders from Ukraine, Russia, the US, and Turkey meet before the end of August to find a solution.</p>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine had two earlier talks on May 16 and June 2. They did not agree on stopping the fighting, but they said they would keep working together on problems like exchanging prisoners and bodies, and returning children.</p>
            <p>Recently, US President Donald Trump asked Russia to agree to stop fighting with Ukraine within 50 days. He said if there is no progress, the US will put more punishments on Russia's trade partners. The deadline for this is August 31.</p>

            <h1>US Finance Minister Has New Trip, Meeting with South Korea on July 25 Postponed</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, July 24, Central News Agency) South Korea's Ministry of Economy and Finance told the media this morning that a meeting planned with the United States for July 25 will be held later. This is because the US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, has an urgent new trip. Both sides will talk again to plan the meeting as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Mr. Goo Yoon-chul, the new Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance for South Korea, and Mr. Yeo Han-koo, the head of trade talks, were going to meet with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington D.C. on July 25. This meeting was called a "2+2 talk." They planned to discuss taxes that the US puts on South Korea.</p>
            <p>Mr. Goo Yoon-chul was supposed to fly to the US today. It is said that he learned about the meeting being postponed when he was at the airport, ready to get on the plane.</p>

            <h1>Fewer Cars Sold, Tesla's Profit Falls by 16% in Second Quarter</h1>
            <p>(New York, July 23, Central News Agency) Today, the big electric car company Tesla said that its profit went down again this past quarter. This happened because there is more competition in the electric car market. Also, fewer cars were sold because of ongoing disagreements caused by CEO Elon Musk's involvement in US politics.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Reuters shows that Tesla's profit for the second quarter (April to June) was $1.2 billion. This is 16% less than the same time last year. In its press release, Tesla said it is still working hard to be a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.</p>
            <p>Tesla's sales for the second quarter went down to $22.5 billion. Last year, at the same time, sales were $25.5 billion. Experts expected sales to be around $22.74 billion, according to information from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG).</p>
            <p>After adjusting for certain things, Tesla's profit per share in the second quarter was 40 cents. This was lower than the 43 cents that experts expected.</p>
            <p>Tesla had already announced that fewer cars were delivered earlier this month, so the fall in profit was expected. Also, the average price of cars went down. And money spent on AI and other research projects went up. These things also affected the company's results.</p>
            <p>Tesla did not say how many cars it expects to make for the whole year. This is because world trade and money rules are always changing.</p>
            <p>Tesla said, "We are carefully investing money to help our car and energy businesses grow. But how well we do will depend on many things. These include the general economy, how fast self-driving technology improves, and how much our factories can produce."</p>
            <p>Tesla reported its biggest drop in sales for a quarter in over 10 years. Its profit was also less than what Wall Street expected. However, the profit from making cars was better than people had worried about before. After the market closed, Tesla's stock price went down by 2.6%.</p>
            <p>Tesla said that it plans to start making its promised cheaper cars in the second half of this year. This news gives hope to the market. People hope it will help increase demand again. This is needed because of strong competition from cheaper electric cars, especially in places like China. It also aims to deal with the problems caused by Elon Musk's strong right-wing political views.</p>
