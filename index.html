            <h1>Taiwan's Yu Opera Troupe: Hsieh Wen-chi to write with both hands in "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall"</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Yu Opera Troupe will perform two plays at the end of the year: "Please Lie to Me" and "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall." Lin Wen-wei and Hsieh Wen-chi, who are third-generation actors in the troupe, will star in these plays. Hsieh Wen-chi will even try to write "plum blossom seal script" with both hands at the same time during the show, as the story requires.</p>
            <p>Wang Hai-ling, the artistic director of the Taiwan Yu Opera Troupe, said today at a press conference that the two plays are very different. "Please Lie to Me" is a funny comedy, and "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall" is about a smart woman arguing in court. She said these two plays show the many different styles of the Taiwan Yu Opera Troupe.</p>
            <p>Wang Hai-ling also said that Lin Wen-wei and Hsieh Wen-chi usually play smaller roles. But this time, they will be the main actors. Older actors from the troupe will also join them on stage. This shows how the troupe passes on its traditions and also tries new things.</p>
            <p>Wang Hai-ling explained that "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall" is a very strange and sad story. In the play, an older sister helps her family because they are poor. She is sold to a bad place so her younger brother can study. Many years later, her brother goes to the capital for an exam and becomes an official. By a strange turn of events, he becomes the judge for his own sister's case. Wang Hai-ling said that this play focuses a lot on singing and speaking. It also uses the beautiful singing styles of Henan opera.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Wen-chi will play the role of "Chen Sanliang." In the play, she needs to write with both hands at the same time to show Chen Sanliang's talent. She said she needs to practice a lot for this. This will be a big highlight of the show.</p>
            <p>Lin Wen-wei said that he plays "Jin Deng-ke" in "Please Lie to Me." His character starts poor. But with his wife's clever plan, he becomes a famous "fortune teller." Later, he is even asked to work in the palace to find a national treasure. He tells the emperor the truth, but the emperor does not believe him. This makes the story both funny and ironic.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Yu Opera Troupe's end-of-year performances, "Please Lie to Me" and "Chen Sanliang Climbs the Hall," will be on November 29th and 30th, 2025. They will be held at the Main Performance Hall of the Taiwan Traditional Theatre Center.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Design Expo in Tianwei: "Greenhouse Castle" shows native plants</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Taiwan Design Expo in Changhua will feature a special area called "Tianwei Journey." The main part of this area is called "Greenhouse Castle." It is made of four greenhouses that look like a forest puzzle. Inside, you can see different types of native plants from Taiwan. These include warm evergreen forests, fern forests, high mountain pine trees, and plants from coastal areas.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Taiwan Design Expo will take place in Changhua County from October 10th to October 26th. It will have three main areas: Changhua, Lugang, and Changnan. Tianwei is located in the Changnan area.</p>
            <p>Some news earlier said that the main exhibition area in Changnan was not yet ready. However, the Changhua County Government explained today that they worked with the Tianwei Township Office. The old buildings at the "Greenhouse Castle" site were removed by September 11th. There was a short delay because the ground needed to be made flat and there was a typhoon. But the building team started working hard on September 24th, and the exhibition organizers know everything is on schedule.</p>
            <p>The Changhua County Government said that the "Greenhouse Castle" in Tianwei is made of four connected greenhouses. They form a "forest puzzle." It will show different forest environments like warm evergreen forests, fern forests, high mountain pine trees, and coastal forests. This means visitors can experience a rich forest ecosystem in a small space, like a model. It lets visitors go on a "green trip across oceans" in Tianwei.</p>
            <p>The county government also stated that the main idea for the 2025 Taiwan Design Expo is "Changhua Journey." It compares Changhua to a big company that has been around for 100 years. This company has 15 different offices, like the Changhua Main Office, the Champion Office, and the Dream-Making Office. This shows how industries in Changhua have grown, how design is used in many different areas, and how shopping streets are being improved.</p>
