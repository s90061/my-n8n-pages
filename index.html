            <h1>Madagascar's President Says He Was Almost Killed, Is Now in a Safe Place</h1>
            <p>The president of Madagascar, Rajoelina, who is facing difficulties, said today that he is hiding in a "safe place" after someone tried to kill him. People are putting more pressure on him to leave his job. He asked everyone to follow the country's rules.</p>
            <p>News agency AFP reported that this speech was delayed two times. It was the first time he spoke publicly since a rebel group supported protests against the government. There were also rumors that he had run away from Madagascar.</p>
            <p>Rajoelina, who is 51 years old, said in a live speech: "Since September 25, there have been many tries to kill me and even to start a coup (when the military takes control of the government). A group of military people and politicians planned to kill me."</p>
            <p>He said: "I had to find a safe place to protect my life." But he did not say where he was hiding.</p>
            <p>Young people mostly started these protests. At first, they were about the poor country's long-term problems with electricity and water. Later, they became a bigger movement against the government, asking Rajoelina to step down.</p>
            <p>Rajoelina used to be the mayor of the capital city, Antananarivo. He became president after a coup. Today, he asked everyone to respect the constitution (the country's main law) to solve the growing political problem. He said: "There is only one way to solve these problems, and that is to follow the constitution that we have now."</p>
