            <h1>Taiwanese Groups in Eastern US Parade in Manhattan for UN Membership, Asking Taiwan to Contribute</h1>
            <p>On September 13, Taiwanese groups, students, and lawmakers from the eastern United States took part in a parade in New York. This parade was to show support for Taiwan joining the United Nations. Officials from countries friendly to Taiwan also came to an event in front of the UN headquarters. They explained why Taiwan should be a part of the United Nations.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly started on September 9 at the UN headquarters. Taiwanese groups from New York, Philadelphia, and Washington D.C. joined the parade in downtown Manhattan. Many Taiwanese people came with their families.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers Wang Cheng-Hsu, Mai Yu-Jen, and Lai Hui-Yuan led the parade. They walked through busy 42nd Street and Bryant Park, and then arrived at the square in front of the New York Public Library.</p>
            <p>People in the parade shouted slogans like "UN for Taiwan" and "Keep Taiwan Free." Many tourists and New York citizens along the way clapped and cheered.</p>
            <p>Lee Chih-Chiang, who is the head of the Taiwan office in New York, spoke to the people at the library square. He said that Taiwan has not been part of the United Nations since 1971. He explained that they were there today to tell everyone in the world that the UN has not been fair to Taiwan. He believes Taiwan should be a member of the United Nations and take part in its work.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers came to New York for the parade. They also met with members of the U.S. Congress and representatives from friendly countries at the UN. Before the parade, these lawmakers joined officials from Tuvalu and Belize at the UN square. They started a promotional event to show Taiwan's image.</p>
            <p>This year's main message is "Chip in with Taiwan Better Together." This message shows Taiwan's strong technology in computer chips. Besides ads on special vehicles and taxi screens, Taiwanese business groups also paid for a large ad in Times Square.</p>
            <p>Wang Cheng-Hsu, a lawmaker from the DPP party, said that the pandemic caused big problems for the world four years ago. Taiwan is in the "first island chain," close to China. This area is where new diseases can easily appear. Taiwan is on the front line of this chain. If Taiwan can find out more about new viruses and diseases, it will help the whole world a lot.</p>
            <p>He added that Taiwan has shown it can help prevent diseases. Taiwan can also provide medical supplies. Taiwan has a good healthcare system. By sharing its good ways of working, Taiwan can help the world know how to reduce the effects of new diseases on people.</p>
            <p>Mai Yu-Jen, a lawmaker from the TPP party, said that in the parliament, they work for the good of the country and its people. Different ideas and thoughts can always be discussed, even if the ways of talking are different. Coming to New York is also about talking, sharing ideas, and what is needed. This way, everyone can agree. Taiwanese people in New York are asking the United Nations to listen to Taiwan's voice and work together with the world.</p>
            <p>While in New York, Wang Cheng-Hsu and Mai Yu-Jen visited Nicole Malliotakis, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. Malliotakis wrote on Facebook that the relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan is strong. She supports Taiwan's right to take part in the UN General Assembly.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Hostages Not Returning, Families Blame Netanyahu</h1>
            <p>On September 13, a group called "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" in Israel said that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the biggest problem in getting the hostages back. This happened soon after Netanyahu said that Hamas leaders were slowing down the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that the "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" said in a statement that Israel's recent attack on Doha, the capital of Qatar, clearly showed something. They said the only thing stopping the hostages from coming home and the war from ending is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
            <p>The statement also said, "Every time there is a chance for an agreement, Netanyahu always creates problems."</p>
            <p>On September 9, Israel launched an air attack on Qatar. This was the first time such an event happened in Qatar. Israeli warplanes attacked a building in Doha. Their goal was to kill Hamas members who were part of the talks for a ceasefire in Gaza. In the end, five Hamas members and one Qatari police officer died in the attack.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Netanyahu said that if the Hamas leaders hiding in Qatar could be removed, the war might end. He also said that Hamas has stopped previous efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement.</p>
            <p>He wrote on social media platform X, "The Hamas terrorist leaders living in Qatar do not care about the people of Gaza. They stop all efforts for a ceasefire. They want to make this war last forever."</p>
            <p>He added, "Getting rid of them is the biggest obstacle to releasing all hostages and ending the war."</p>
            <p>However, the "Hostages and Missing Families Forum" said that what Netanyahu said was just another "excuse" for not bringing the hostages home.</p>
            <p>The forum stressed, "It's time to stop delaying things just to keep power."</p>
            <p>They added, "These delaying actions threaten the lives of the hostages. They have been held for almost two years and are at their limit. It also makes it seem like we will never get back the bodies of those who died."</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked southern Israel and took 251 people. Now, 47 people are still held by Hamas in Gaza. This includes 25 people who the Israeli army has said are dead.</p>
            <p>AFP reporters said that tonight, thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv. They asked the government to end the war and quickly make an agreement to exchange hostages.</p>

            <h1>Washington Post: Trump Plans to Send 1,000 National Guard Soldiers to Keep Peace in Louisiana Cities</h1>
            <p>On September 13, The Washington Post reported on some documents they received from the Pentagon. These documents show that the U.S. President Trump's government has made a plan. They want to send 1,000 National Guard soldiers from Louisiana to help keep peace in the state's cities.</p>
            <p>Most cities in the U.S. have seen less violent crime. But ever since Trump became president, fighting crime has been a main goal for his government. Trump has focused on stopping crime in cities led by Democrats. This has caused legal arguments and protests, including thousands of people demonstrating in Washington D.C. last weekend.</p>
            <p>Leaders from the Democratic Party said that sending so many soldiers seems more like Trump showing his power. They believe it is not a real way to stop crime.</p>
            <p>More than a dozen people from Shreveport, Louisiana, told Reuters that they think these actions are more like a political show. They do not believe it will truly solve crime problems.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Pentagon did not say much about these documents.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that the planning documents say this plan will let the military help with law enforcement in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge.</p>
            <p>The Pentagon's plan to send soldiers will last until September 30, 2026. However, the documents do not clearly state when it will begin. The report says that the documents highlight the "special advantages" the Department of Defense has for its law enforcement plan in Louisiana.</p>
            <p>The report also mentions that this plan needs to be requested by Jeff Landry, the Governor of Louisiana, who is from the same Republican party as Trump. But it is not yet confirmed that federal or state government officials have approved it.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense's plan for Louisiana shows they are thinking about a big operation. The National Guard would help make law enforcement stronger in areas with a lot of crime. The Washington Post also reported that the National Guard might help stop drug crimes. They could also give support with supplies and communication to local authorities.</p>
