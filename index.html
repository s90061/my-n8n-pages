            <h1>Employee Collapses and Dies During Inspection; Taiwan Railway Sets Up Care Team for Family</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, an employee at the Taiwan Railway Administration (TRA) Jioucyutang Power Office suddenly fainted and died while checking a railway line. Today, the TRA Company announced that its General Manager, Mr. Feng Hu-sheng, has asked Mr. Zheng Guo-xi, the head of the Electrical Engineering Department, to visit the family and offer comfort. The Tainan Power Section has also created a special team to help the family with necessary arrangements.</p>
            <p>The TRA explained through a message that around 1 PM yesterday, the Jioucyutang Power Office received a report from Xishi Station. The report said a balloon was stuck on an electric wire holder at 30K+100 on the Pingtung Line. A team of three from the power office drove to the area between Linluo Station around 2:15 PM. After that, they walked along the railway line to inspect it.</p>
            <p>The TRA stated that around 2:30 PM yesterday, about 300 meters south of Linluo Station, an employee named Chen suddenly fainted. This was not due to an electric shock. His colleagues quickly called 119 for help and started CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). When the 119 emergency workers arrived, they took him to the hospital immediately. However, he did not survive.</p>
            <p>The TRA said that General Manager Feng Hu-sheng has asked Mr. Zheng Guo-xi, the director of the Electrical Engineering Department, to visit and support the family.

            <h1>Taichung Man Holds Temple Worker Hostage with Knife; Police Stop Him</h1>
            <p>A 40-year-old man named Wu recently entered Baoyun Temple in Taichung with a knife. He held a female employee hostage. It is believed he was angry about a past disagreement. He asked for legal officials to come to the temple. Police were called and arrived at the scene. During the event, Detective Team Leader Tu Chih-hung found a chance to grab the knife. Police then moved in to control Mr. Wu and sent him to the prosecutor's office. After questioning, the prosecutor approved his temporary arrest.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Department said today that police received a report around 7 PM on July 31st. Someone with a knife had gone into Fagu Mountain Baoyun Temple on Shizheng Road in Xitun District and was holding an employee hostage. Many police officers were immediately sent to handle the situation.</p>
            <p>When police arrived, they saw the 40-year-old Mr. Wu inside the temple office. He was very upset, holding a female employee with a fruit knife, and moving the knife as if he would attack. Police quickly closed all ways in and out and moved people away from the area. They surrounded Mr. Wu using police guns, batons, and pepper spray.</p>
            <p>Police found that Mr. Wu might have held a long-standing anger against the temple because of an old problem that was not fixed. He used this chance to enter and harm someone. He demanded that "legal officials come to the scene to hear my full story." As police talked to him, he became very emotional and held the knife tightly. The person he was holding was very scared and could not move at all.</p>
            <p>The officers saw that the situation was not moving forward. They pretended to agree to what Mr. Wu wanted. Mr. Tu Chih-hung helped to call the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office and asked a prosecutor to speak to Mr. Wu through a video call. During the conversation, Mr. Tu Chih-hung calmly moved closer. Then, he quickly took the knife away and held Mr. Wu tightly. Other officers saw this and helped to control Mr. Wu, rescuing the hostage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu was taken to the police station for investigation. After police questioning, the whole case was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office. He was charged with stopping someone's freedom and making threats. After more questioning, the prosecutor asked to keep him held, and this was approved.</p>
