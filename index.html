            <h1>Strong Earthquake Hits Venezuela, No Damage Reported Yet</h1>
            <p>A strong earthquake with a 6.2 magnitude hit western and northern Venezuela today. The US Geological Survey said that there are no reports of people being hurt or buildings being damaged yet.</p>
            <p>The earthquake's center was about 24 kilometers (15 miles) from Mene Grande. This is a town in Zulia state where not many people live, and it produces oil. The earthquake happened 7.8 kilometers (4.8 miles) below the ground.</p>

            <h1>Experts Say China Wants Changes in Trade Talks with the US, Including on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Experts say that China has three main goals in its trade talks with the United States. These two countries are the two biggest economies in the world. China wants the US to lower taxes on goods, make export rules less strict, and clearly say it "opposes" Taiwan's independence. This is different from just "not supporting" Taiwan's independence, and this difference in words is important to some people.</p>
            <p>A group in Washington called the Hudson Institute held a meeting today. They talked about how to keep supply chains safe during the competition between the US and China. Experts at the meeting included Gerard DiPippo from the RAND Corporation, Nadia Schadlow, a former US security advisor, and Rush Doshi, a former White House official.</p>
            <p>Mr. DiPippo said that China has three main goals. First, they want lower taxes on goods (tariffs). Second, they want fewer rules on exports. For example, China wants fewer limits on sending special computer chips to them.</p>
            <p>He also said that the third goal is not mainly about money. It is about Taiwan. China wants the US and President Donald Trump to say they "oppose" Taiwan being independent. This is a stronger statement than just saying they "do not support" Taiwan's independence.</p>
            <p>When asked about the order of these goals, Mr. DiPippo thought that tariffs are the most urgent. China wants the US to remove these taxes quickly. If the taxes are removed much later, it will not help as much because businesses will have already changed how they work.</p>
            <p>Next are the export rules. China needs more computer power for its plans, especially for artificial intelligence. They believe that even if their technology is not the best, it is good if it is fast and widely used. So, export rules are important for China in the middle term.</p>
            <p>He also said that China sees Taiwan as a very important issue for a long time. If needed, they can wait. But clearly, in the long run, Taiwan is the most important of the three goals.</p>
            <p>Recently, the US and China had their fourth round of trade talks in Spain. Last week, President Trump also talked with Chinese President Xi Jinping for almost two hours. They discussed topics like the video app TikTok and trade. This was the second time Trump spoke with Xi since he became president again and put high taxes on Chinese goods.</p>
            <p>After their call, neither the US nor China said anything about Taiwan in their official statements. This made people wonder. Ryan Fedasiuk, a former US State Department advisor on China, said it would be unusual if China did not mention Taiwan in a call with the US President.</p>
            <p>However, he also thought that Taiwan was probably not the most important topic in this call. This is because there are many other urgent disagreements between the US and China right now.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Feels Sad After Typhoon Kagasa Hits Eastern Taiwan Hard</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Kagasa, the 18th typhoon this year, caused big problems in eastern Taiwan. Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, wrote on the social media site X that he felt very sad. He wished that the people in Taiwan could get back to their normal lives soon.</p>
            <p>On X, Prime Minister Ishiba wrote in both Japanese and Chinese to his friends in Taiwan. He said, "To my friends in Taiwan, I am very sad to hear about the big damage caused by Typhoon Kagasa in eastern Taiwan. I send my deepest sadness to those who died and my true sympathy to their families. I also send my heartfelt care and sympathy to everyone who was affected."</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba also said, "I am very upset that Taiwan has had many bad typhoons and heavy rains. I truly hope that the people of Taiwan can return to their normal lives soon."</p>
            <p>Taiwan's representative in Japan, Lee Yi-yang, also used X to thank Prime Minister Ishiba. He said, "This time, when Typhoon Kagasa caused damage in Hualien, we received kind words of comfort from Prime Minister Ishiba, and we are very thankful."</p>
            <p>Lee Yi-yang added, "As the saying goes, 'A friend in need is a friend indeed.' Whenever Taiwan and Japan have a disaster, they always help each other. I believe the strong connection (kizuna, or bond of hearts) between Taiwan and Japan will continue and never change."</p>
            <p>Typhoon Kagasa hit Hualien very hard. Data from the Fire Department shows that by the evening of September 24th, 17 people had died, 17 people were missing, and 32 people were hurt. All the deaths and missing people were in Hualien County.</p>
