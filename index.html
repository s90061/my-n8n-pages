            <h1>President Lai visits Banqiao Shenqiu Fude Temple, details youth policies</h1>
            <p>President Lai visited Shenqiu Fude Temple in Banqiao, New Taipei City, this afternoon. He thanked the local gods, Tu Di Gong and Tu Di Po, for helping him and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim win the election with many votes. When he arrived, people welcomed him warmly and shouted, "Hello, President!"</p>
            <p>President Lai then went into the temple with Su Chiao-hui, the head of the DPP in New Taipei City, and DPP lawmaker Chang Hung-lu, along with several city council members. He also met with neighborhood leaders in the basement. During his speech, he said that the gods looked happier than last time he visited. He prayed for peace and good weather for the country, and wished everyone good fortune.</p>
            <p>President Lai talked about the government's plans to help young people. He said that education is very important for the country. Now, the government pays for high school and vocational school fees. It also helps pay for private university tuition for students, and gives more help to students from poor families. There is also help for dorms and renting homes, and a special monthly ticket called TPASS for commuting. These plans make sure that money problems do not stop young people from getting an education.</p>
            <p>The President explained that the government is actively using money for education, helping with rent, and creating policies for young people. For example, they have a new loan program called "New Youth Safe Loan" to help young people buy a home. They are also continuing former President Tsai Ing-wen's plan to build more public housing, giving more choices for places to live.</p>
            <p>President Lai also mentioned a special fund called the "Youth Billion Dream Fund for Overseas." This fund helps young people aged 15 to 30 go abroad to follow their dreams. He gave examples like learning street dance in New York, makeup in Japan, or cooking in Thailand. He hopes this will help young people see more of the world and chase their dreams without worries. He believes that helping young people grow will make the country better.</p>
            <p>President Lai shared that a friend from elementary school had to work in a factory after graduating because his family was poor. Now, Taiwan's economy is growing, and the government collects more taxes. So, it should help people who have less money and make sure that children do not lose the chance to get an education because of their family's financial situation.</p>

            <h1>Tseng Chun-hsin wins first home Davis Cup match, helps Taiwan tie Norway on first day</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's team played against Norway on the first day of the Davis Cup tennis event in Taipei. The score was 1-1. Tseng Chun-hsin, who is Taiwan's top singles player, won his first home Davis Cup match. He said he felt very excited.</p>
            <p>The Davis Cup World Group I uses a "best of five" format. The team that wins three matches wins the event. Taiwan is playing at home in the Taipei Tennis Center against Norway, a strong team. The winner will get to play in the 2026 World Group Finals. Today, the first two singles matches were played.</p>
            <p>In the first match, Taiwan's Wu Tung-lin played against Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, a 19-year-old new player from Norway. Wu Tung-lin won the first set 6-4. But then he lost the next two sets 3-6 and 4-6. So, Taiwan did not get the first point. Luckily, in the second singles match, Tseng Chun-hsin played very well. He beat Viktor Durasovic easily with two sets of 6-1. This helped Taiwan tie the score.</p>
            <p>Last year, Tseng Chun-hsin lost two singles matches against Bosnia and Herzegovina. So, winning his first home Davis Cup match now made him very happy. After the match, he told reporters he was very excited. He said that even though the score looked very different, it was a test for his preparation and mindset. He had always wanted to win at home, and that feeling stayed with him. He said, "At first, I was a bit stiff and couldn't play freely. But then, I started playing better and better."</p>
            <p>Tseng Chun-hsin thanked everyone on his team. He trained with head coach Lu Yen-hsun and other players for two weeks before the match. He slowly learned how to use his strengths and played his best. He said, "I played well in all areas. But there's still another match tomorrow, so we can't be careless."</p>
            <p>Wu Tung-lin said he felt he played well overall and showed his own style. He also said that the many fans cheering gave him a lot of energy. However, he had some stomach problems a few days ago, which made him feel tired sooner. He said he would rest well and get ready for tomorrow's match. "No matter who the opponent is, I will try my best for every point," he said.</p>
            <p>Coach Lu Yen-hsun said that the winner will be decided on the second day of the event. This means both teams still have a chance. He will help the players get ready tonight. He praised Wu Tung-lin and Tseng Chun-hsin for their performance. He said, "We hope to keep the victory in Taiwan."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese brands participate in International Rice Festival in Northern Italy for the first time</h1>
            <p>The city of Vercelli in Northern Italy is holding an "International Rice Festival." This year, for the first time, several rice companies from Taiwan are joining the festival as a group. Their theme is "Making Friends with Rice, Tasting Taiwan." They want to show how varied Taiwan's rice industry is and how creative Taiwanese food is.</p>
            <p>The yearly International Rice Festival, also called RisÃ², started on September 12th and will last for three days. Many important Italian politicians came to the opening ceremony. These included Italy's Minister of Agriculture, Francesco Lollobrigida, and the head of the Piedmont region, Alberto Cirio.</p>
            <p>Lin Tsan-nan, the head of Taiwan's office in Milan, was invited to the event. He was with Emanuele Pozzolo, an Italian member of parliament.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's office in Milan sent out a press release. It said that Vercelli is one of the biggest rice-growing areas in Europe. The International Rice Festival's main goal is to promote rice and food culture. It includes selling farm products, cooking shows, market events, cultural talks, and special areas for different countries. Every year, tens of thousands of people visit, and hundreds of brands join. These include farmers, food importers, food experts, and regular shoppers.</p>
            <p>This year, with help from Taiwan's office in Milan, the Italian-Taiwanese Business Association (ACTI) formed a group to join the festival for the first time as Taiwan. They are working with an Italian rice brand called Cascina Bellaria. Their theme is "Fa l'amicizia con riso â€“ Making Friends with Rice, Tasting Taiwan." They invited several Taiwanese brands and new companies to take part. This shows the many different parts of Taiwan's agriculture and food industry, and its new food ideas.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan area at the festival has many different things. It includes information about Taiwanese rice types and their quality. There are also special products made from rice, like rice desserts and ready-to-eat meal kits. They are also showing new technology and science related to rice. For example, health products made from fermented rice and ways to reuse rice husks. Taiwan hopes to find new business chances and partners around the world through this.</p>
            <p>Chang Ling-yin, the head of the Italian-Taiwanese Business Association, said that Taiwan is always proud of its diverse food culture. Rice is a very important part of this. She hopes that by joining this festival, the hard work that goes into Taiwanese rice will shine on the world stage. This will also help more people around the world know about Taiwan.</p>
