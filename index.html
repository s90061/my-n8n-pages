            <h1>New Taipei Tracking Management Platform Controls the Flow of Incineration Recycled Granules</h1>
            <p>Today, the New Taipei City Environmental Protection Department announced that it has created a "Tracking Management Platform for Recycled Materials from Incineration." This platform uses digital management and maps to fully check where the recycled materials from three incinerators go. It also encourages public construction projects to use these recycled materials instead of sand and gravel.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department told CNA reporters today that as landfills become full, all cities and counties face a common challenge: how to turn the ash from incinerators into useful resources. New Taipei City has three incinerators in Xindian, Shulin, and Bali. The ash from these incinerators needs to go through a process of breaking, sorting, and magnetic separation. This removes unwanted parts from the ash. The remaining good material is called "incineration recycled granules."</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that the "Tracking Management Platform for Incineration Recycled Granules" digitally controls the ash and granules from the three incinerators. It records and tracks each batch from when it is made, transported, processed, reused, until its final disposal. This platform helps lower costs for administration and staff. It also creates a good system for warnings and management, allowing them to fully control where the recycled materials go.</p>
            <p>Because construction companies, supervision teams, and government departments can quickly get the latest information, each batch of recycled materials has an "ID card." This makes sure that the materials are used correctly in public construction projects. It also prevents them from going into sensitive areas, which could cause pollution worries.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department stated that in the past two years, New Taipei City produced about 110,000 tons of recycled incineration materials each year. On average, about 148,000 tons were used each year. This means more was used than produced. All of it was used in public construction projects. Most of it was used for filling pipe trenches that do not need strong support. A small part was used for the base layers of roads and for high-pressure concrete bricks. If there are any extra recycled materials in the future, they will ask to use them to create new land at Taipei Port.</p>
            <p>Before using the recycled incineration materials, it is important to check if their use and location follow the rules set by the Ministry of Environment. The Environmental Protection Department said that New Taipei's recycled materials have not gone into sensitive environmental areas. This not only makes the circular economy work better but also helps the city move towards "net-zero carbon emissions by 2050."</p>

            <h1>iTunes Out of Control in the Brain: Musical Explores Modern People's Difficulties</h1>
            <p>The National Theatre Company is putting on a musical called "iTunes Out of Control in the Brain." It will start during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. Talented musician Lin Yi-hsin and "Strongest Imitator King" Lin Jun-yi are working together again. They will look at the difficulties people face in modern times.</p>
            <p>At the dress rehearsal press conference, Lin Jun-yi showed his amazing ability as an "Imitator King." In just three minutes, he quickly changed between four famous characters and changed his clothes fast. Everyone watching was very surprised.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from the National Theatre Company, "iTunes Out of Control in the Brain" has been very popular since it first opened. For this new run of shows, the original cast is returning. Also, the versatile actress Xiao Xun (Huang Jing-yi) and sweet singer Angie are joining. Their additions will bring new energy to the stage.</p>
            <p>Director Hsieh Nien-tzu said, "Xiao Xun plays a woman's feelings of love and attachment, which is very touching. Angie's lively and clever character is very charming. The addition of these new friends makes the show richer and more complex."</p>
            <p>When talking about her first time performing in the musical, Xiao Xun laughed and said that before the first show in Hsinchu, even after a lot of practice, she was so nervous that she kept repeating her lines, dance steps, and songs. Angie shared, "My lips were shaking right before I went on stage. Luckily, my teammates were very strong, which made me feel much better." Both of them hope to be less nervous this time in Taipei and enjoy their time on stage.</p>
            <p>The story of "iTunes Out of Control in the Brain" is about an unlucky girl who is struck by lightning. After that, music and sounds play non-stop in her head. She meets an idol singer who has lost his ability to create music. With help from a psychiatrist, they both find their music and direction in life again from their confused thoughts. Director Hsieh Nien-tzu said that even though the show seems light and funny, it deeply looks at people's mental health and the stress they face today.</p>
            <p>"iTunes Out of Control in the Brain" will be performed from the 3rd to the 5th at the Taipei City Stage.</p>

            <h1>World's Richest Man Elon Musk's Net Worth Exceeds US$500 Billion, First Person in History</h1>
            <p>Today, Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, saw his personal wealth go above 500 billion US dollars. He is the first rich person to reach this amount. Musk's wealth grew a lot mainly because Tesla's stock price went up. Also, his other new companies became much more valuable this year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that, according to the Forbes Billionaires Index, at 4:15 PM Eastern Time, Elon Musk's net worth reached 500.1 billion US dollars (about 15.211 trillion New Taiwan Dollars). This made him the first billionaire to pass the 500 billion US dollar mark.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk's wealth is very closely linked to Tesla. As of September 15th, Musk owned more than 12.4% of Tesla's shares. Since the beginning of the year, Tesla's stock price has risen more than 14%. Today, it closed with a strong increase of 3.3%. This added over 6 billion US dollars to Musk's wealth in just one day.</p>
            <p>At the start of this year, Tesla's stock price was unstable for a while. But after Musk focused on his business again, investors felt more confident, and the stock price started to go up. Robyn Denholm, the chairperson of Tesla, said last month that Musk had returned to the "core" of the company after working at the White House for several months.</p>
            <p>A few days later, Musk also announced that he bought about 1 billion US dollars worth of Tesla shares. This showed that he believed in the company's future. Tesla is now working hard to change. It is moving from being just a car maker to becoming a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.</p>
            <p>This year, Tesla has not done as well as the "Magnificent Seven" tech companies in the US stock market. Last month, the company's board suggested a huge pay plan worth 1 trillion US dollars. This plan set very high financial and operational goals. It also met Musk's request to own more of the company.</p>
            <p>Also, the value of Musk's AI startup company, xAI, and his space company, SpaceX, has also increased a lot this year.</p>
            <p>According to Pitchbook, a company that studies financial data, xAI's latest value in July this year was 75 billion US dollars. Last month, the US financial news channel CNBC reported that xAI's value could go up to 200 billion US dollars after raising money. However, Musk said that the company has not raised any money.</p>
            <p>In July, Bloomberg News reported that SpaceX was talking about raising money and plans for people inside the company to sell their shares. It is thought that the company's total value could be about 400 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>As of today, Larry Ellison, who started Oracle, has a personal wealth of 350.7 billion US dollars. He is second only to Musk on the Forbes Billionaires list.</p>
