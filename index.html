        <h2>Wu Sze-yao: China Will Increase Efforts to Affect Taiwan's Politics</h2>
        <p>Wu Sze-yao, a leader from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said that China will try harder to influence Taiwan's politics. She explained that China, which has tried to affect elections before, will now focus on stopping people from removing politicians from office. This includes using misleading information and even violence.</p>
        <p>Wu Sze-yao also warned that people should watch out for Chinese money going to the Kuomintang (KMT) party to help them, and if Taiwanese business people are forced to come back to Taiwan to vote for the KMT.</p>
        <p>She also talked about a recent event where a political commentator and someone trying to remove a KMT politician were threatened by a gang. Wu Sze-yao believes China might be behind this, trying to cause problems in Taiwan. She also said that some public figures who recently visited China are now spreading ideas from China and should not be taken seriously.</p>

        <h2>Animal Groups Ask to Stop Cruel Live Pig Auctions in Taiwan</h2>
        <p>Several groups that care about animals protested at Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture. They said that the way pigs are sold in live auctions is cruel. They explained that before pigs are killed for meat, they are often treated badly, such as being hit with electric shocks or whipped.</p>
        <p>These groups showed videos of these cruel actions from many pig markets across Taiwan. They believe this old way of selling pigs hurts the animals and also makes it harder to stop diseases. They want Taiwan to use a new system called "carcass grading," which is used in many other countries like in Europe, America, and Japan.</p>
        <p>In the "carcass grading" system, pigs are taken straight to the slaughterhouse. After they are killed, their meat is checked for quality, like how much fat and lean meat there is. This way, the price is fair, and farmers who raise good quality pigs get better rewards. The animal groups hope the government will make this change to improve animal welfare and the quality of Taiwan's pork.</p>

        <h2>Adding Pingpu Indigenous Legislators: Government Says It's Not Possible Now</h2>
        <p>A new bill about recognizing Pingpu Indigenous peoples in Taiwan was discussed in the parliament. Some lawmakers asked if this would mean adding more special seats in the parliament for Pingpu representatives. However, the head of the Council of Indigenous Peoples, Icyang Parod, said that this is decided by the country's main law, the constitution. To add more seats, the constitution would need to be changed, which is very difficult and not likely to happen soon.</p>
        <p>Icyang Parod explained that Pingpu groups are indeed Indigenous peoples of Taiwan because they have their own languages, customs, and long history. The new bill aims to officially recognize them and protect their languages, cultures, and traditions. It also plans to ensure their rights in areas like political involvement, healthcare, money matters, and social support within the next three years.</p>
        <p>He added that while they want to give Pingpu people the respect and rights they deserve, changing the number of legislative seats is a big step that requires changing the highest law of the country, which is not easy to do at this moment.</p>
