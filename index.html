            <h1>Trump Speaks at UN, Criticizes Allies for Recognizing Palestine and Buying Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>On September 23, in New York, former US President Donald Trump spoke at the United Nations General Assembly. He said that Washington's friends who recognize Palestine are "rewarding" Hamas, a Palestinian armed group. Trump also asked European countries that are allies to stop buying oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>The main discussions at the UN General Assembly started today. About 150 country leaders are expected to speak this week. When Trump started his speech, he joked that he was happy to speak without a teleprompter because it was broken.</p>
            <p>He then talked about familiar ideas. He said America was very bad under former President Joe Biden. But he claimed things got better quickly since he became president in January this year. Trump said, "Under my leadership, energy, gas, food prices, and house loan rates went down. We also won against rising prices. The only thing that went up was the stock market, which just reached its highest point ever."</p>
            <p>Trump said he ended 7 wars, from the conflict between Pakistan and India to the 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He then stated, "It's a shame I had to do these things, instead of the UN doing them."</p>
            <p>Trump questioned why the UN exists. He said the UN has huge potential but does not use it well. He added, "Most of the time, at least now, they only seem to write strong letters and then never do more. These are just words, and words don't stop wars."</p>
            <p>In his speech, Trump also talked about the war between Israel and Hamas, and the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump said that when US allies recognize Palestine, while Hamas refuses to let Israeli hostages go or agree to a ceasefire, it is "rewarding" Hamas for its "terrible actions." This includes Hamas's unexpected attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>
            <p>Trump also told European allies to stop buying Russian oil right away. He said that China and India are helping Russia pay for its war in Ukraine by buying oil. He stated, "They must stop buying all energy from Russia at once. Otherwise, we are all wasting a lot of time."</p>
            <p>Regarding immigration, Trump criticized the UN for giving money to help immigrants. He said the UN "funds attacks against Western countries and their borders" and "supports those who come into the US illegally."</p>
            <p>Trump was proud of his strict immigration rules. He also said that European allies are going to "hell" because of immigration. He said, "It's time to end the failed idea of open borders."</p>
            <p>Recently, the US military destroyed at least 3 Venezuelan boats that were smuggling drugs. More than ten people died. In his UN speech, Trump promised to completely stop drug smugglers. He said, "To every terrorist who brings drugs into the US, be careful, we will completely stop you."</p>
            <p>Trump also spoke against green energy. He called it too expensive and a "joke." He also said, "For me, climate change is the biggest trick in the world ever... The idea of a carbon footprint is a trick made up by bad people. They are going towards complete destruction."</p>
            <p>Trump spoke after Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva today. Even though Trump strongly criticized Lula for charging former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro with planning a coup, Trump still said he would meet Lula next week.</p>
            <p>Even though Trump strongly criticized the energy and immigration rules of UN member countries, and the UN itself, he ended his hour-long speech in a friendly way.</p>
            <p>He said, "Let's work together to build a bright and beautiful planet. A planet we share, a peaceful planet that is richer, better, and more beautiful than ever before. This can happen, and it will happen."</p>

            <h1>Russia Says It Has Taken a Big Part of Kupyansk in Kharkiv Region</h1>
            <p>On September 23, Russia announced that it had taken a large part of Kupyansk. Kupyansk is a city in the Kharkiv region, which is in northeast Ukraine. Russia is trying to go even further into this region.</p>
            <p>The Russian army said that if they control Kupyansk, they can move deeper into the Kharkiv region. This includes moving towards Izium and Chuhuiv. The Kharkiv region is not one of the five regions in Ukraine that Russia says it has taken. In 2022, Ukrainian soldiers pushed most of the Russian forces out of Kharkiv. Russia's new statement seems to show that they still want to take this region.</p>
            <p>Russia said today that more than 65% of the buildings in Kupyansk are now under its control. The news agency AFP could not check if this information is correct.</p>
            <p>Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters that Ukrainian soldiers are still fighting to keep control of Kupyansk. He said that "strong fighting is happening there, and soldiers are ready." Kupyansk is a key place for transport. Russia says that taking this city will help them move forward in the Donetsk region, which is next to Kharkiv.</p>
