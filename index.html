            <h1>NBA Clippers Accused of Paying Kawhi Leonard $28 Million for Fake Job to Avoid Salary Cap</h1>
            <p>A sports reporter and podcast host named Pablo Torre has said that the NBA team Los Angeles Clippers and their owner, Steve Ballmer, are accused of paying star player Kawhi Leonard 28 million US dollars (about 860 million New Taiwan dollars). This money was supposedly for a "fake job" to avoid the NBA's rules about how much money teams can pay their players. This rule is called the salary cap.</p>
            <p>Yahoo Sports reported that Pablo Torre shared this story, which he called a scandal, on his podcast "Pablo Torre Finds Out." He used direct quotes from many legal papers in his show.</p>
            <p>The report says that Steve Ballmer, the owner of the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, paid Kawhi Leonard 28 million US dollars through one of his companies. Leonard supposedly did almost no work for this money. Ballmer is accused of using this agreement to pay Leonard more than his NBA contract allowed. If this is true, it would be against the league's rules.</p>
            <p>The whole situation involves a company called Aspiration. This company was funded by Ballmer and is now out of business. Aspiration had a legal agreement with Leonard's company, KL2 Aspire, LLC, for 28 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Torre tried to find out if Leonard had advertised or promoted this company, but he found no evidence of it.</p>
            <p>It is said that a rule in the contract between Aspiration and KL2 Aspire, LLC, allowed Leonard to "refuse to do any actions the company asked for." This basically meant he got paid for nothing. Another rule said he had to remain a Clippers player to receive the money.</p>
            <p>Leonard used to play for the San Antonio Spurs and the Toronto Raptors. He led the Raptors to win a championship in 2019. After that, he joined the Clippers. As a free agent at that time, he accepted less money than the Raptors offered. He did this to play with another star player, Paul George, and to go back to his hometown, Los Angeles.</p>
            <p>In January 2024, Leonard signed a new contract with the Clippers. Reports say this contract is for three years and is worth 153 million US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says US Helped China Get Freedom; Xi Jinping Should Mention It in His War Speech</h1>
            <p>On September 3, Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a speech about the war. He also went to a military parade with leaders from Russia and North Korea. Former US President Donald Trump said today that the US helped China become free in the past. He thinks Xi Jinping should have talked about this in his speech about the war. When asked about China, Russia, and North Korea working together against the US, Trump did not give clear details.</p>
            <p>On September 3 (Taipei time), China held a military parade in Beijing. This event was to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in the "Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." Xi Jinping was there with Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Xi Jinping gave a speech. He said that the Chinese people won their first complete victory against foreign invaders in modern times. He stressed that this happened because of the Anti-Japanese National United Front, which the Chinese Communist Party started.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," on the evening of September 2 (US Eastern time). He said that China, Russia, and North Korea were "working together against the United States."</p>
            <p>Today, when he met with Polish President Karol Nawrocki at the White House, reporters asked him about this. He did not give clear details about why he said China, Russia, and North Korea were working against the US.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I understand why they are doing that. They want me to watch, and I am watching." He also said that he has good relationships with all of them. He added, "We will see how good this relationship is in the next week or two."</p>
            <p>Trump also said that the US helped China a lot in the past. But he thinks the US is not given enough credit for helping China gain freedom. Even though Trump called Xi Jinping his friend, he was surprised. He said he watched Xi Jinping's speech and thought the US should have been mentioned because "we helped China very, very much."</p>
            <p>Also, Trump stated he had no message for Putin. He said Putin knows what he thinks about the issues between Russia and Ukraine. He added that no matter what Putin decides, "if we are not happy, we will see some things happen."</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for more than three and a half years. Since Trump returned to the White House, he has been trying to help find a peace plan. He also hopes the leaders of Russia and Ukraine can meet for talks.</p>
            <p>Foreign news reported that Putin said today he is ready to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy if Zelenskyy comes to Moscow. But Putin also said it is still unclear if such a meeting would be useful.</p>

            <h1>Putin: I See a Light at the End of the Tunnel for Ending the Russia-Ukraine War</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told Ukraine today that if they can "stay smart," there is a chance to end the war in Ukraine through talks. But he also said he is ready to use force to end the war if that is the only way.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that after his visit to China, Putin said he sees "a small light at the end of the tunnel." He believes the United States, under President Trump, is truly working to end this war, which is the biggest land war in Europe since World War II.</p>
            <p>Putin told reporters, "I think that if people can stay smart, it is possible to find a good solution to end this fight. This is what I guess."</p>
            <p>He said, "Especially when we look at the attitude of the US government led by President Trump, we see more than just their statements. We see their honest desire to find a solution... I think a small light has appeared at the end of the tunnel. Let's wait and see what happens."</p>
            <p>"Otherwise, we will have to use force to solve all the difficult problems we face."</p>
            <p>However, Putin did not show any signs of changing his long-held demands. These demands include that Kyiv (Ukraine's capital) must give up its plans to join NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).</p>
            <p>Putin said he is ready to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy if Zelenskyy visits Moscow. But he added that any such meeting must be well-prepared beforehand and lead to real results.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's foreign minister replied that the idea of meeting in Moscow "is not acceptable."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy has been actively trying to meet with Putin to discuss possible peace terms, even though both sides have very different ideas. Zelenskyy has asked Washington to put more punishments (sanctions) on Russia if Putin does not agree to a compromise.</p>
            <p>Trump has also been working to find peace solutions. He has said he hopes the two leaders can meet for talks. He has also threatened to put more sanctions on Russia, but he has not done so yet.</p>
            <p>Putin said that if possible, he prefers to end the war peacefully, through talking and diplomacy. This is because Russia's economy is under a lot of pressure from many sanctions from Western countries.</p>
