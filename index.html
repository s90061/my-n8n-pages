            <h1>Trump to Meet Netanyahu, Hopes for Gaza Peace Plan</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump told Reuters today that he hopes to finish a proposal for a Gaza peace plan tomorrow. He will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. Meanwhile, Israeli tanks are still going into Gaza City. Hamas, a Palestinian group, said they lost contact with two people they were holding.</p>
            <p>News reports say that people in Israel are very worried about these two people. This concern might make the meeting between Netanyahu and Trump difficult tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Today, the Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed part of Hamas, asked Israel to take its soldiers out of Gaza City. They also asked Israel to stop air attacks on Gaza City for 24 hours. This would let their fighters find the people they are holding.</p>
            <p>Trump told Reuters in a phone call that his peace plan for Gaza got a "very good" reaction from Israeli and Arab leaders. He said, "Everyone wants to make a deal." However, Hamas said they have not yet received any real plan from Trump or anyone helping to solve the problem.</p>
            <p>Recently, the Israeli army started a big attack on Gaza City. They destroyed many areas and told hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move to tent camps. Netanyahu said this was to completely get rid of Hamas.</p>
            <p>Even though the fighting continues, talks to solve the nearly two-year war in Gaza through diplomacy have been increasing recently.</p>
            <p>Trump has a 21-point peace plan for the Middle East. It asks for all Israeli people held captive to be released, whether they are alive or not. It also asks Israel to stop attacking Qatar. And it wants Israel and Palestine to start talking again so they can "live together in peace."</p>

            <h1>Spain's Valencia Issues Red Alert for Heavy Rain, Fears More Floods</h1>
            <p>Spain's weather agency today issued a red alert for very heavy rain in the Valencia area in the east. They are worried that a bad flood, like the one that killed 235 people last October, could happen again.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that the Spanish national weather agency (Aemet) warned that Tarragona, Castellon, and Valencia will have "extremely dangerous" weather today in the afternoon and evening, and also tomorrow. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also gave the same warning.</p>
            <p>Local officials in Valencia announced that all schools and universities in Valencia city will be closed tomorrow. All public places like libraries, parks, gardens, markets, and cemeteries will also be closed for a short time.</p>
            <p>People in Valencia also got a red alert message on their phones this afternoon. It told them to be careful because of the very bad weather.</p>
            <p>Climate change makes the effects of heavy rain worse. In October last year, there was a very serious flood in the Valencia area. After that, local people protested many times. They said that the government did not handle the crisis well. They also said that even though the weather agency gave a warning, officials did not tell people in time.</p>

            <h1>US Military Generals from Around the World to Gather; Trump to Speak</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced today that he plans to speak to military generals at a meeting on September 30th. The meeting will be in Quantico, Virginia. He will greet them and give them an encouraging talk.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has asked all U.S. military generals from around the world to meet in one place. This is a rare event.</p>
            <p>Trump told Reuters, "I want to tell these generals that we love them. They are respected leaders. They need to be strong, tough, smart, and excited... This is all about teamwork. It's time someone did this."</p>
            <p>Trump's presence at the meeting might make people pay less attention to Hegseth. U.S. officials told Reuters that Hegseth is expected to talk about the need for the entire military to keep its "warrior spirit." He might also talk about other topics.</p>
            <p>Hegseth often talks about "warrior spirit" and how the U.S. military needs a "warrior mindset" in almost all his public speeches.</p>
            <p>The U.S. military is present all over the world, including in South Korea, Japan, and the Middle East. Generals or admirals with two, three, or four stars lead these forces.</p>
            <p>More than one official told Reuters that the meeting is expected to happen at the Marine Corps University in Quantico.</p>
            <p>Some high-ranking officials will fly on military planes to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.</p>
            <p>It is not clear why this meeting cannot be held online. Also, the costs for travel and security might be at least several million U.S. dollars.</p>
