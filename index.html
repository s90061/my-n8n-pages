            <h1>Zheng Li-wen campaigns for KMT Chairman election; Wang Jin-pyng writes 3 hopes</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) will elect a new chairman on October 18. Candidate Zheng Li-wen visited former Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng yesterday. She said today that Wang Jin-pyng was very careful and kind. He gave her many good ideas and cared about her election. He wrote down three points of advice and hopes for her. He believes her ability to speak and fight are what the KMT needs most right now.</p>
            <p>This morning, Zheng Li-wen wrote on Facebook that she had met Wang Jin-pyng twice to ask for advice before she decided to run for party chairman. Yesterday, she visited Wang Jin-pyng again especially for the party chairman election. As always, Wang Jin-pyng was very careful and kind. He cared about her election and gave her many good ideas. She learned a lot from him.</p>
            <p>Zheng Li-wen said that Wang Jin-pyng always thinks about peace between Taiwan and China, the country's development, and social harmony. So, he has strong hopes for the KMT's future and the chairman's duties. Because of this, Wang Jin-pyng seriously wrote down three points of advice and hopes beforehand and gave them to her himself.</p>
            <p>Zheng Li-wen said Wang Jin-pyng's three hopes include: "First, the people should be in charge. Those in power should not decide for the people, unlike now when everyone decides for the people. The people decide, and we work." "Second, the KMT has been losing support for many years. We need to check if the KMT's own culture has problems, making people not accept it. So, the new KMT chairman must change the internal culture to create a new feeling that people will like."</p>
            <p>Zheng Li-wen said: "Third, he values her ability to speak and fight, but reminded her not to forget that after becoming chairman, she must serve all people and unite everyone in society. So, she needs to be gentle and bring good luck." Wang Jin-pyng strongly believes her speaking and fighting skills are what the KMT needs most now. He also reminded her to "be gentle and bring good luck." In the future, after becoming chairman, she must not only unite the whole party but also think about uniting all of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Zheng Li-wen said that Wang Jin-pyng kept saying that there should not be more division and conflict within Taiwan. The KMT must unite Taiwan to successfully achieve peace between Taiwan and China. Both within Taiwan and across the Taiwan Strait, everyone should "be gentle and bring good luck." This is good for the people.</p>
            <p>Zheng Li-wen said that Wang Jin-pyng's effort and vision deeply touched her. She felt a very big responsibility on her shoulders. She sincerely thanked Wang Jin-pyng for helping and supporting her always. She will remember Wang Jin-pyng's hopes deeply in her heart and will not let him down. In the future, she will work hard day and night, do her best, and give her all for the party and the people.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Flood Causes Damage; CPC Says Guangfu Gas Station is Open Again</h1>
            <p>A flood in Hualien was caused by a natural dam in the Mata'an River overflowing. CPC Corporation, Taiwan, continued to send workers and machines to quickly clean up and fix two of its gas stations in Guangfu Township. The Mata'an station started working again on the afternoon of September 27. Today morning, the Guangfu station, which is in the town center, also started working again. This means they can provide fuel for rescue equipment and for local people.</p>
            <p>CPC said in a press release that the Guangfu station helped the army clean nearby small roads. On September 29, the station finished cleaning its area and checking its equipment. In the evening, they took samples of the fuel. On September 30, at 9 AM, they got the test results. The results showed that all the fuel the station sells (92 unleaded gasoline, 95 unleaded gasoline, and premium diesel) was good.</p>
            <p>CPC stated that after many careful steps and tests, the Guangfu station opened again at 8 AM today. Both of CPC Taiwan's gas stations in Guangfu Township are now fully supplying fuel. This helps with rescue efforts and meets the local people's need for fuel.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Poland's CoD Sign Agreement; Lin Chia-lung: "Democratic Flame Will Shine Globally"</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Community of Democracies (CoD), an international organization in Warsaw, Poland. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung, who was there, said that democracy and freedom are very important to Taiwan. Taiwan will continue to work with countries that share similar ideas to make the democratic flame shine brightly everywhere in the world.</p>
            <p>This morning, MOFA released a press statement. It said that Lin Chia-lung led a group to Poland. On September 30, they went to the permanent office of the Community of Democracies (CoD). They met with Secretary-General Mantas Adomenas. They also saw MOFA and CoD sign the MOU. This MOU creates a partnership. Both sides promise to work together on things like making democracy stronger, fighting against "foreign information manipulation" (FIMI), promoting human rights, and encouraging people to join in society. This will create a system for working together and show friendship and unity among democratic countries.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said in his speech that democracy and freedom are "Taiwan's DNA." This MOU shows that both sides have the same values. It also shows that protecting democracy is a strong base for keeping peace and success in the world. Adomenas said that signing the MOU is a new step in their cooperation. He stressed that Taiwan and Central Europe are both on the front lines of protecting democracy. He praised Taiwan as a great example of democracy in the 21st century.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that Lin Chia-lung's trip showed that Taiwan and Europe are not only partners in democracy but also strong partners in economics and technology. Taiwan is a trustworthy democratic partner and a key player in the global supply chain. Based on "value diplomacy," Taiwan will work with Europe to create value and promote "value-added diplomacy" to build a future with democracy and success.</p>
            <p>This morning, Lin Chia-lung posted on Facebook that he had met Adomenas last year during a visit to Poland. He was very happy to meet his old friend from Taiwan, who used to be the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs for Lithuania.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung remembered that Adomenas received the "Friendship Diplomacy Medal" when he visited Taiwan in 2024. This was to thank him for helping Lithuania donate over 250,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan during the pandemic. It also recognized his help in setting up an office in Lithuania using the name "Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung used his own experience of joining the "Wild Lily Student Movement" in university as an example. He said that democracy is not just an idea. It is something people get every day through courage and sacrifice. Now, authoritarian powers like China and Russia are helping each other. They are sharing their ways of ruling without freedom around the world. In the war between Russia and Ukraine, China seemed "fake neutral but truly pro-Russia." Because of this, Taiwan and CoD working together to support democracy is very important.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung emphasized that Taiwan will continue to walk side-by-side with countries that think similarly. They will make the flame of democracy shine everywhere in the world. They will also unite to work for freedom and global success.</p>
