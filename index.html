Apple recently announced "Apple Intelligence," its new system for artificial intelligence (AI) designed to make iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers smarter and easier to use. This new technology aims to personalize user experience and ensure privacy. It will help users with everyday tasks like writing emails, summarizing documents, and creating images from text descriptions. For example, it can rephrase text, check grammar, or prioritize notifications.

A key feature of Apple Intelligence is its deep integration with various apps like Mail, Pages, and Notes, making it a seamless part of the user's daily digital life. Apple emphasized that these AI features will process most information on the device itself, protecting user privacy.

In a significant move, Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT. This means users will be able to access ChatGPT directly through Apple's voice assistant, Siri, when a more complex or general knowledge request is needed. Users will always be asked for permission before any information is sent to ChatGPT, ensuring control over their data. This integration will be free for Apple users and is expected to be available this autumn.

**The Rise of 'Quiet Vacationing' Among Workers**

A new trend called "quiet vacationing" is becoming popular, especially among remote workers. This refers to the practice of taking time off from work, but secretly, without informing employers or colleagues. Instead, individuals might work from a holiday destination, or simply pretend to be online and available while actually resting or enjoying personal time.

There are several reasons why employees might choose this approach. Many feel pressured to always be available and fear falling behind if they take a proper break. High workloads and a sense of guilt about taking time off also contribute to this behaviour. Some workers believe it is easier to just 'disappear' for a bit rather than formally request and justify time off.

However, experts warn that "quiet vacationing" can lead to more stress and burnout rather than providing real rest. Employees are not truly disconnecting, which means they don't get the benefits of a genuine holiday. This trend also highlights a broader issue: companies might not be encouraging a healthy work-life balance. To address this, it is important for employees to communicate openly with their managers about their need for breaks. Companies, in turn, should promote a culture where taking proper time off is not only accepted but encouraged for employee well-being.

**European Tourism Adapts to Extreme Heat**

Europe is experiencing increasingly hot summers, and this change is significantly affecting the continent's tourism industry. Traditional summer holidays in popular southern European destinations like Spain, Greece, and Italy are becoming very challenging due to rising temperatures, which often reach extreme levels. This means tourists are starting to change their travel plans.

Many travellers are now choosing to visit Europe during cooler months, such as spring or autumn, to avoid the intense heat. There is also a growing interest in northern European countries or regions with milder climates, like the Alps or coastal areas further north. This shift in preferences is pushing southern European nations to adapt their tourism strategies.

Local businesses and governments are looking for ways to stay attractive. They are promoting activities that are suitable for hotter weather, such as evening tours, water sports, or visits to indoor attractions. Some places are also considering extending opening hours later into the evening when temperatures drop. The challenge is to balance economic needs with environmental concerns, ensuring tourism remains sustainable while adapting to the realities of a warming planet. This adaptation is crucial for the future of Europe's valuable tourism sector.`;
