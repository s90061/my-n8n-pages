            <h1>Trump Announces Meeting with Putin in Alaska on August 15th; Ukraine Deal to Include Land Exchange</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced today that he and Russian President Putin will meet on August 15th in Alaska, USA. More details will be shared later. People are watching to see if this meeting can bring important steps towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump has been unhappy that the war between Russia and Ukraine has lasted so long. He told Putin that Russia must reach a peace agreement with Ukraine by August 8th, or it will face stronger punishments.</p>
            <p>But today, Trump seemed more positive about a peace deal. This afternoon at the White House, he told reporters, "European leaders want peace. I believe President Putin wants peace too, and President Zelenskyy (of Ukraine) also wants it."</p>
            <p>"My feeling tells me that we have a chance to make peace."</p>
            <p>Trump later posted on his social media, "Truth Social," that his important meeting with Putin will happen on August 15th in Alaska. More details will come later.</p>
            <p>On August 6th, Trump said that his special helper, Steve Witkoff, had a good meeting with Putin earlier that day about stopping the Russia-Ukraine war. He also said he might meet Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy soon to talk about the issues between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that officials from Europe and Ukraine said Putin offered a big ceasefire plan this week. He asked Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to give up a lot of land and for other countries to agree to Russia's demands, in exchange for stopping the fighting.</p>
            <p>European officials have strong worries about Putin's offer. This is because it would make Ukraine give up the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine, and Russia would promise very little besides stopping the fighting.</p>
            <p>The Russia-Ukraine war has been going on for over 3 years. Since Trump came back to the White House, he has tried to make Russia and Ukraine stop fighting permanently. But he has not been able to get any big agreements from Russia so far.</p>
            <p><h2>Trump: Russia-Ukraine Agreement Will Involve Land Exchange</h2></p>
            <p>US President Trump said today that any agreement to end the fighting between Russia and Ukraine will include exchanging some land. But he did not share more details.</p>
            <p>He spoke at the White House during a peace meeting with leaders from Armenia and Azerbaijan. He told reporters that the agreement for peace between Russia and Ukraine is "almost ready."</p>
            <p>He said this possible agreement will involve "some land exchange, which will help both countries." He also said he is working hard to make Russia return some of the land it took during the war to Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Azerbaijan and Armenia Make Peace, Agree to Nominate Trump for Nobel Peace Prize</h1>
            <p>Azerbaijan's President, Ilham Aliyev, said today that after signing an agreement with Armenia to end a conflict that lasted for decades, he suggested that both countries nominate US President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
            <p>Aliyev and Armenia's Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, came together at the White House today for what Trump called a "historic peace meeting."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "Armenia and Azerbaijan have promised to stop all fighting forever, to open trade, tourism, and diplomatic relations, and to respect each other's right to be independent and their borders."</p>
            <p>At the White House event, Aliyev said, "Perhaps we can agree with Prime Minister Pashinyan (of Armenia) to jointly send a nomination to the Nobel Committee, suggesting that President Trump be given the Peace Prize."</p>
            <p>Pashinyan also said, "I think President Trump deserves to get the Nobel Prize, and we will support and help this happen."</p>
