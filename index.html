            <h1>China's Representative in Europe: Cooperation Between China and Europe Can Benefit Both Sides</h1>
            <p>A representative from China in Europe, Cai Run, said that working together between China and Europe will help both sides. He said this before the leaders of the European Union visit China.</p>
            <p>The President of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will visit China on July 24. They will meet with China's President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang.</p>
            <p>The newspaper "The Paper" released Cai Run's interview on July 22, just before the leaders' visit. He was interviewed in Brussels in late June. This interview was for the 50th year of China and Europe having official relations.</p>
            <p>Cai Run stated that China and Europe are different in many ways, like their social systems, beliefs, history, culture, and how much they have developed. He said these differences are real. But he also said that these differences should help them talk and work together, not cause problems. He believes that countries can be partners even if they are not exactly alike.</p>
            <p>He added that China and Europe have learned a lot in 50 years. He said it is important for them to respect each other's choices for their societies and their ways of growing. They must also respect what is most important to each other. He thinks that both sides benefiting is the biggest reason for China and Europe to work together. He said that when China and Europe work together, it helps both of them.</p>
            <p>Cai Run also said that China and Europe both agree on several important things. They both support the United Nations as the main international organization. They also support global trade rules from the World Trade Organization (WTO), a world with many strong countries, and a global economy. They also agree to work together on climate change. He said that because they both support these things, their relationship is very important for the world.</p>
            <p>About issues like Chinese electric cars being sold in Europe, Cai Run repeated that trade is a big part of the relationship between China and Europe. He said that because there is so much trade, it is normal to have some disagreements. He emphasized that it is important to solve these problems by talking and discussing, as their leaders have agreed.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Cai Run stressed that he hopes Europe will see China's growth in a fair and sensible way. He pointed out that China and Europe are on different sides of the world. They do not have arguments about land or big problems with what each country wants. He believes that they cooperate much more than they compete, and they agree on many more things than they disagree on. He said they are partners, not enemies.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen Prison Starts Farming and Electrician Classes; Justice Minister Says It's a New Start for Life</h1>
            <p>The Fujian Halfway House Association, Kinmen Prison, and Kinmen Agriculture and Industry School have started new training classes. These classes will teach prisoners how to grow crops in special netting houses and how to do indoor electrical wiring. The Minister of Justice, Cheng Ming-chien, was at the opening ceremony today. He said these classes are "a starting point for changing lives."</p>
            <p>Last year, the Fujian Halfway House Association worked with Kinmen Prison and the National Kinmen Agricultural and Industrial Vocational Senior High School to offer the first indoor wiring class. Today, they started the second indoor wiring class. At the same time, a new farming class in netting houses also began. Many important people were there, including Minister Cheng Ming-chien, Mao You-tseng (the head of the Fujian Halfway House Association), and Lin Hsien-ming (the head of the Agency of Corrections).</p>
            <p>Minister Cheng Ming-chien spoke at the event. He said that all five students from the first electrician class passed their exams and got their licenses. For the second class, 17 prisoners signed up. This shows that the first class was very popular. He added that with the new farming class, these are "a starting point for changing lives." He also said that teachers from Kinmen High School and different police departments will work together to help the students.</p>
            <p>Lin Hsien-ming said that prisons have two main goals: making sure things are fair and helping prisoners return to society. He explained that after people break the law and go to prison, the hope is that they can help their families and society later. He hopes the students "can calm down, change, and then go back to society" during their time in prison. He shared a success story: one student from last year's indoor wiring class went back to Taipei and found a job through the Taipei Halfway House Association. He hopes these training classes continue to be successful.</p>
            <p>During the ceremony, Minister Cheng Ming-chien gave certificates to students who passed the national skill test for indoor wiring in 2024. He also visited the farming training area. He planted a lemon tree there, which means hope and new beginnings. He and other guests also planted peanuts and picked and tasted corn and okra as part of the farming activities.</p>
            <p>The Fujian Halfway House Association said in a press release that the farm with netting houses is now using green fertilizer to make the soil better. In the future, this farm will grow valuable, natural vegetables. It will be a special training place where students can work with nature.</p>
            <p>The Fujian Halfway House Association explained that both the electrician class and the farming class help prisoners learn good work habits and have healthy minds and bodies. These classes also teach them useful job skills. This gives them a strong base for life after they leave prison. The Fujian Halfway House Association believes in the idea of "giving a man a fish helps him for a day; teaching him to fish helps him for a lifetime." They will keep offering job training. This will help prisoners improve their skills, feel more confident, and find stable jobs. It will help them start a new and better part of their lives.</p>

            <h1>South Korea and U.S. to Talk on July 25 to Discuss Tariffs</h1>
            <p>New taxes on goods from the United States will begin on August 1. South Korea's new Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance, Koo Yun-cheol, announced today that he will have important talks on July 25. He will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington D.C. He will be joined by South Korea's Minister for Trade, Yeo Han-koo. These talks are called "2+2 talks" because two officials from each country attend.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News reported that Koo Yun-cheol said this after an urgent meeting about foreign economic matters today. He said, "There is not much time left until August 1." The urgent meeting was held to plan how they will talk to the U.S. and what their goals will be.</p>
            <p>This will be the first "2+2 talks" between South Korea and the U.S. in three months. South Korea had suggested a "July plan" in April. This time, the Minister of Industry, Trade and Energy will not be there. Instead, the Minister for Trade and the Finance Minister will attend together. This means the discussions will likely be more about practical details.</p>
            <p>South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Minister of Industry, Trade and Energy Lee Chang-yang are also expected to visit the U.S. this week. They will meet with different U.S. officials.</p>
            <p>Koo Yun-cheol said that the South Korean government will bring together all the necessary government departments. They will make a careful plan that focuses on what is best for South Korea and what is practical. They will work hard on these talks about tariffs. Regarding whether the new tariffs might start later, Koo Yun-cheol said they will try their best to talk and find a solution.</p>
