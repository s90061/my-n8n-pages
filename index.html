            <h1>News of Nobel Peace Prize Winner Possibly Leaked, Association Fears Spy Action</h1>
            <p>Today, the Norwegian Nobel Institute told Norwegian media that it is "very likely" that news about the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, was leaked early. The institute thinks it could be a spy operation.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that on a betting website called Polymarket, the chances of Machado winning the Peace Prize suddenly went up. Between the evening of the 9th and early morning of the 10th, her chances jumped from 3.75% to almost 73%. The winner was officially announced just a few hours later.</p>
            <p>However, no experts or news organizations had named Machado as a likely winner at that time.</p>
            <p>Kristian Berg Harpviken, who leads the Norwegian Nobel Institute and is the secretary of the Nobel Committee, told Norway's TV2 channel, "It is very likely a spy operation."</p>
            <p>But the day before, Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told the Norwegian News Agency (NTB) that he did not think Machado's name had been leaked. He said, "I do not think there has ever been a leak in the history of the Peace Prize, and I find it hard to imagine that this would happen."</p>
            <p>Even so, Harpviken said the institute will investigate this carefully. They will "strengthen security measures further if needed."</p>
            <p>Harpviken said that a spy operation "would make people think there was an intentional leak from inside, but that is actually unlikely." He added, "We cannot be 100% sure yet, but it's not a secret that the Nobel Institute is a target for spies."</p>
            <p>"It is clear that this institute has always been interesting to certain people who want to get information. These people could be countries or other groups. Their reasons could be political or financial."</p>
            <p>He said, "This kind of activity has been happening for many decades."</p>
            <p>Harpviken did not answer AFP's request for comments.</p>
            <p>Only a very small number of people know the name of the winner chosen by the five members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee before it is announced.</p>
            <p>In the past, Norwegian media sometimes reported surprising winners early, which made people wonder if there were leaks. But this has not happened in recent years.</p>
            <p>Machado is a leader of the opposition in Venezuela. The government did not allow her to run in the 2024 election. When she won this Peace Prize, the committee praised her for "working hard to promote democratic rights in Venezuela and trying to change the country peacefully from a dictatorship to a democracy."</p>
