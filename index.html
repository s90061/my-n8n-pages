            <h1>Travel Agencies Offer 90-Day Advance Booking for Easy Japan Scenic Train Trips</h1>
            <p>Many travelers to Japan like to ride special scenic trains. Travel agencies have seen this good business chance. They now let travelers book these trains up to 90 days in advance. This includes popular trains like the Yufuin no Mori, which are often hard to get tickets for. Now you don't have to worry about not getting a ticket.</p>
            <p>According to numbers from the Ministry of Transportation and Communications Tourism Bureau, more than 2.68 million Taiwanese travelers have visited Japan by May this year. As independent travel to Japan stays popular, the demand for Japan's scenic train trips is also going up.</p>
            <p>Travel agency KKday announced in a press release that until the end of August, you can book Kyushu scenic trains, Kyushu Crossing, Narita Express, and specific JR Shinkansen routes without a booking fee. Also, choosing your favorite seat on scenic trains won't cost extra. You can book these trips up to 90 days before you travel.</p>
            <p>KKday said that travelers can book popular scenic train seats for trains like the Yufuin no Mori, Aso Boy, and Futatsuboshi 4047 ahead of time.</p>
            <p>Klook also recently added 18 Japanese scenic trains for booking, including popular ones like Yufuin no Mori, Super Hakuto, and Futatsuboshi 4047.</p>

            <h1>School Bullying Is Common; Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao Calls for Strict Punishment and Review of Rules</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been many reports of bullying and gender equality issues at several universities, including National Taiwan Normal University. Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao said today that there will be strict punishment, and the rules and ways of dealing with these situations will be looked at and improved.</p>
            <p>The case of blood tests for the National Taiwan Normal University women's football team has gotten a lot of attention. Changhua Normal University's Counseling and Guidance Department has had many reports of sexual harassment and assault. Taipei University of Marine Technology also had a teacher accused of bullying special education students. Cheng Ying-yao went to the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee today to answer questions. Before the meeting, he spoke to the media about the recent school bullying and gender equality issues.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao repeated that there will be "strict punishment." The Ministry of Education will also review the rules for universities, colleges, and schools of all levels to see how they can be made better.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao also said that victims of these events, whether they have graduated or not, should get help from the education system and social support systems for their mental health. The Ministry of Education cares about students' right to education and will make sure it is protected. Schools will need to set up ways for students to report problems, and these will be checked carefully as special cases.</p>
            <p>For the National Taiwan Normal University case, the Ministry of Education and the National Science and Technology Council are currently checking 97 projects in sports science from 2022 to 2025 that involve blood samples. They will check them more closely later. Cheng Ying-yao said they will look at how the schools' IRB (Institutional Review Board, which checks human research ethics) handles things and the possible harm to students.</p>
            <p>The media also asked about rumors of a cabinet change. Cheng Ying-yao said, "This is a hypothetical question, so it's not easy to answer." But he then said that for a government official, "leaving gracefully" has always been his goal, and he will keep this attitude in how he acts.</p>

            <h1>US-India Relations Are Tense; Modi Will Visit China After 7 Years</h1>
            <p>Sources in the Indian government said today that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit China for the first time in seven years. This shows that diplomatic relations between India and China are getting better, especially as tensions between India and the United States are increasing.</p>
            <p>Government sources told Reuters that Modi will go to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, which starts on August 31. The Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately answer questions about this.</p>
            <p>Modi plans to visit China at a time when the relationship between India and the United States is facing its worst crisis in many years. US President Trump has put the highest import taxes on India among Asian countries. He has also threatened to punish India further in ways he has not yet explained, if India continues to buy oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Modi will go to Tianjin for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. This will be his first visit to China since June 2018. The relationship between India and China got much worse in 2020 because of military fights at their disputed border in the Himalayas.</p>
            <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization started in 2001. It is a group for political, economic, and security cooperation across Europe and Asia. Its members include Russia, China, and countries in Central Asia. Later, India, Pakistan, Iran, and Belarus joined.</p>
            <p>Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met last October during the BRICS summit in Russia. Since then, the two countries have been slowly solving the problems that have hurt their business and tourism connections.</p>
            <p>Trump has threatened to add an extra 10% tax on goods from BRICS member countries, including India, saying these countries "support anti-American policies."</p>
            <p>Trump's main representative, Steve Witkoff, is currently in Moscow. There are only two days left until the deadline Trump set for Russia to make a peace agreement in Ukraine, or Russia will face new punishments.</p>
            <p>According to government sources who did not want to be named, India's National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, is also visiting Russia. This visit comes after Trump pressured India to stop buying crude oil from Russia. Doval is expected to talk about buying oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Doval will probably also discuss defense cooperation between India and Russia. This includes making the delivery of Russia's S400 air defense system to India faster and the possibility of Russian President Vladimir Putin visiting India.</p>
            <p>India's Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, will also visit Russia in a few weeks.</p>
