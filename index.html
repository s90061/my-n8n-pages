            <h1>Diplomacy Stops, Zelenskyy Asks for Talks with Putin</h1>
            <p>(Kyiv, August 24, CNA foreign news) Today is Ukraine's Independence Day. President Zelenskyy said that trying to end the war with talks is not working. He believes that meeting with Russian President Putin is "the best way to move the peace process forward."</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Ukraine used drones today. This caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Russia.</p>
            <p>US President Trump has tried to arrange a meeting between Ukraine and Russia. But on August 22, Russia said that Putin and Zelenskyy would not meet right away. After this, the hope for peace became small.</p>
            <p>But today, Zelenskyy said again that "a meeting between leaders is the best way to move the peace process forward." He asked for a meeting with Putin once more.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Western countries were trying to "find excuses to stop the talks." He also criticized Zelenskyy for "wanting to meet right away, no matter what."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy made a promise at an event. US special envoy Keith Kellogg and other Western officials were there. Zelenskyy promised to "make Russia choose peace."</p>

            <h1>Song Hsin-hao is MVP of Asian University Basketball League; Coach Chen Zi-wei is Happy They Played Their Own Way</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 24, CNA reporter Chen Rong-chen) The National Chengchi University (NCCU) Griffins, champions of the UBA college basketball league, won the Asian University Basketball League (AUBL) today. Song Hsin-hao, a main player, was chosen for the best five players and also won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Coach Chen Zi-wei was happy that his players showed their own style.</p>
            <p>The NCCU Griffins played for Taiwan in the AUBL in Hangzhou, China. In today's final game, they played against Tsinghua University from Beijing. Song Hsin-hao, a key player, scored the most points with 29. He also had 12 rebounds and 6 assists. Another guard, Hsu Te-chi, added 20 points. They won the game 82 to 79 and took home the championship trophy.</p>
            <p>Coach Chen Zi-wei from NCCU, who had lost his voice from cheering, told CNA that he thanked team leader Chiang Feng-nien for finding a professional team to help. He also thanked the coaches for their hard work. He said he always wanted UBA to be known internationally and get recognition. "We did it this time. Now UBA is getting better. Many schools care more about basketball and work hard for it."</p>
            <p>In this year's AUBL, NCCU guard Song Hsin-hao played very well. He averaged 21.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game. His all-around performance was key to the team winning. Song Hsin-hao was not only in the best five players but also got the MVP award.</p>
            <p>Chen Zi-wei said that this new group of Griffins, led by Song Hsin-hao and team captain Hsu Te-chi, found their own style after Yu Ai-che left. They did not live in the shadow of older players, which made him very happy. Both Song Hsin-hao and Hsu Te-chi are strong and not afraid of challenges. Together, they helped the Griffins become stronger than before.</p>
            <p>"After the game, I also told them to create their own story, not just follow Yu Ai-che's time. This makes me feel proud as a coach," Chen Zi-wei said. He hopes to keep UBA strong in the future. This will help train new basketball players for Taiwan and even help them learn how to play with foreign players earlier.</p>
