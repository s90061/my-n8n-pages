            <h1>Tariffs and Exchange Rates Affect Semiconductor Companies; Q3 Not as Good as Expected</h1>
            <p>It is usually a busy time for the semiconductor industry. However, many semiconductor companies are not very positive about their business in the third quarter. This is because of changes in tariffs and exchange rates. They think that their sales might not be as high as usual, and could even be lower than in the second quarter.</p>
            <p>Semiconductor companies are holding meetings to talk about their business. A main topic for them is how tariffs and exchange rates affect their work. For tariffs, companies do not sell directly to the U.S. very much, so tariffs do not affect them a lot. But to prepare for tariff changes, customers bought products earlier in the first half of the year. This changed the usual business cycle, making the slow and busy times less clear.</p>
            <p>Because customers bought products early, most companies did well in the first half of the year, even during slow business times. Now, the U.S. has started new tariffs. Also, customers already have enough products. So, companies will buy fewer products in the second half of the year. This means that the third quarter might not be as busy as it usually is for these companies.</p>
            <p>MediaTek, a company that makes phone chips, said that some demand moved to the first half of the year. This means the third quarter's business will be different from other years. PixArt, a company that makes sensor chips, said that customers who buy mouse chips bought a lot in past quarters. So, in the third quarter, these customers might buy less. However, PixArt sees that customers are placing more small orders. They can see orders for about two to three months from now.</p>
            <p>Novatek, a company that makes display driver chips, said that the effects of China's subsidies and early buying because of U.S. tariffs are slowing down. The market is now waiting to see what happens. Customers are being careful with their orders in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>The New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger in the second quarter. Most semiconductor companies sell their products in U.S. dollars. So, their income was affected. They also lost money from currency exchange outside their main business. Some companies even lost money overall because of these exchange losses.</p>
            <p>GUC, a company that makes special chips, made 35 million New Taiwan Dollars from its main business in the second quarter. But it lost 33 million New Taiwan Dollars from currency exchange. With other small losses, the company lost 2.31 million New Taiwan Dollars after tax. This means it lost 0.06 New Taiwan Dollars for each share.</p>
            <p>Since the start of the third quarter, the New Taiwan Dollar has not gotten stronger. It has become weaker, nearly reaching 30 New Taiwan Dollars to one U.S. dollar. Still, most companies think that the average exchange rate for the New Taiwan Dollar will be stronger in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. This will be one reason for their business performance in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>PixArt expects its income in U.S. dollars for the third quarter to be about the same as or slightly more than the second quarter. However, their income in New Taiwan Dollars might go down compared to the second quarter. MediaTek expects its income for the third quarter to be between 4.49 billion and 4.83 billion U.S. dollars. This is a 1% to 8% drop from the previous quarter. In New Taiwan Dollars, their income will be about 130.1 billion to 140 billion, a 7% to 13% drop. The decrease might get bigger.</p>
            <p>Changes in tariffs and exchange rates are affecting most semiconductor companies. But the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is still very strong. TSMC, which makes almost all AI chips, is still doing well. They expect their income in U.S. dollars to grow by 8% in the third quarter. For the whole year, their U.S. dollar income should grow by about 30%. This growth is much higher than the 15.4% growth expected for the entire global semiconductor industry.</p>

            <h1>Trump: If Courts Say Tariffs Are Illegal, U.S. Might Face Another Great Depression</h1>
            <p>New York, August 8th (CNA) â€“ Former U.S. President Donald Trump warned today that if courts decide his broad tariffs are illegal and he took too much power, the U.S. economy might face problems like the Great Depression of 1929 again.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, that if a "radical left court" rules that his tariff actions are against the law, then "such a large amount of money and honor might never be fixed or paid back."</p>
            <p>He said, "The Great Depression that happened in 1929 will happen again!"</p>
            <p>Trump made these strong statements while the U.S. federal appeals court is looking at whether his use of the "Emergency Economic Powers Act" to put general tariffs on U.S. trade partners is legal.</p>
            <p>In late May, the U.S. Court of International Trade decided that Trump's tariffs were beyond his power and invalid. Trump's government quickly appealed this decision. In June, while the U.S. federal appeals court heard the case, it ruled that the tariffs would stay in effect for now.</p>
            <p>Trump said today that billions of dollars from tariffs are "flowing into" the Treasury Department. Also, the U.S. stock market has recently reached new high levels. He claimed this shows his tariffs have brought "the largest amount of money, wealth creation, and influence in U.S. history."</p>
            <p>However, many economic experts are worried that the tariffs are causing prices to go up (inflation). They also think that not knowing what will happen with trade policy is making investment slower.</p>
            <p>This case might finally go to the Supreme Court, where most judges are conservative (6 to 3). But experts believe that the final decision is still not clear.</p>

            <h1>570,000 People Applied for Property Change Alerts; Some Frauds Stopped</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 9th (CNA) â€“ The Ministry of Interior started a service called "Property Change Instant Notification" to stop fraud groups. These groups often trick people into using their property as collateral for loans, pretending to offer "fake investments." By the end of June, 570,000 people across Taiwan had signed up for this service. There is a record of it stopping fraud in Tainan.</p>
            <p>With the Ministry of Interior's "Property Change Instant Notification" service, when people sign up, they will get a text message or email right away if someone tries to buy, sell, or put a mortgage on their property. The message also goes to one contact person they choose. This helps people know immediately if there are changes to their property and keeps their property safer.</p>
            <p>Interior Minister Liu Shih-fang said in a press release today that older people living alone or who are not good with technology can easily become targets for fraud. The instant notification service can also tell their children or trusted friends at the same time. People should use this service well. More care means more safety for older people's property.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said that by the end of June, 570,000 people across the country had signed up for the instant notification service, and it has already stopped some frauds. Recently, the Guiren Land Administration Office in Tainan received an application from a 77-year-old person to put a mortgage on their property. This person had signed up for the instant notification service and put their child's phone number as the second contact. So, when the child got the text message from the land office, they realized their father might be a victim of investment fraud. After talking, they immediately asked to stop the mortgage application.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said that if people want to sign up for the Property Change Instant Notification service, they can go to any land administration office in person. They can also apply online through the Department of Land Administration's "Digital Counter" website using a natural person certificate or business certificate. People can also apply for the service when they buy new property, at the same time they register the purchase.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior reminds people that when they sign up for the instant notification service, besides themselves, they can also add a trusted friend or family member as a contact. If there are 12 types of changes to their property in the future, such as buying, selling, auctioning, setting up a mortgage, or getting a new property title, the land administration office will send a text message or email right away to inform them.</p>
