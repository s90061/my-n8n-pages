Taiwan's League of Legends team, CFO, was eliminated early from the Mid-Season Invitational today. However, their performance was praised by their opponent, AL. CFO's top player, Driver, also believes that the difference between regions is getting smaller, and he said, "We will become stronger."

In the 2025 League of Legends Mid-Season Invitational in Canada, CFO, representing the Pacific LCP region, played against China's top team, Anyone's Legend (AL), for a spot in the semifinals. Unfortunately, they lost 1-3 and were eliminated because they could not keep their lead.

After the game, CFO's top player, Driver (Shen Zong-hua), told reporters that their performance in the Mid-Season Invitational was just okay. He felt they could have played better in many games, and he personally could have helped the team more to change the game. He added, "We didn't take advantage of times we should have won, and our decisions at the end of games still need to improve."

CFO was very close to the Mid-Season Invitational semifinals, and they surprised many people again. They showed they could compete with teams from South Korea's LCK region and China's LPL region. After the game, their opponent, AL, even said, "They are a very strong team." CFO's support player, Kaiwing (Ling Qi-rong), was happy to get praise from the LPL's top team. He said, "It means we can compete with them."

Driver also mentioned that the difference between regions is getting smaller. He feels it's not easy to see who has the advantage anymore, and any team can win. He plans to try different heroes before the next competition because he felt that opponents targeted his hero choices, which was difficult.

Driver told CNA that teams from the LCK and LPL regions are better at team fights and strategy. Compared to CFO, they have more ways to play. He said, "We rely more on our players' individual skills and quick decisions. But if we can improve those small things, we will become stronger."

Next, CFO will travel to Saudi Arabia to get ready for the Esports World Cup. Kaiwing said that the teams in that event will be similar to those in the Mid-Season Invitational. He hopes to get "revenge" on the teams they lost to. He also thanked fans for staying up late or waking up early to watch CFO's games and promised, "We will try to do better at the Esports World Cup."

**Clashes in Kenya Protests: At Least 10 Dead, Hundreds Arrested**

In Nairobi, Kenya, police and protesters clashed today in the city's outskirts. Human rights groups and police say that at least 10 people died and hundreds were arrested during anti-government protests.

According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights also said that the police worked with criminal groups. Before the annual "Saba Saba Day" march, many security forces were put in place, making most of Nairobi's city center empty.

"Saba Saba Day" means "Seven Seven." It is a day to remember July 7, 1990, when Kenyans protested against many years of strong rule by President Daniel Arap Moi. They wanted to bring back a system with many political parties.

The Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights said in a statement that they recorded "10 deaths and 29 injuries" in 17 counties, but they did not give more details.

The Kenyan National Police Service said in a statement tonight that 11 people died, and 52 police officers and 11 civilians were hurt.

From around noon, AFP reporters saw crowds fighting with riot police. The police fired tear gas at small groups, and some people threw stones and stole things.

Young people in Kenya are protesting again because they are unhappy with the slow economy, corruption, and police violence. Last month, protests turned into stealing and violence, which led to many deaths and thousands of businesses being destroyed.
