Taipei's Ganghu area held its first "Ganghu Cup 3X3 Basketball Game" opening event today. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an spoke at the event. He said that 3X3 basketball is very popular. He believes that letting children play can help them become excellent players from a young age. He also promised to hold the event again next year and bring his eldest son to play.

Mayor Chiang shared that his eldest son is in junior high school, about to go to ninth grade, and is already 181 centimeters tall. He plays on the school team. Chiang said that when he played basketball with his son during Chinese New Year, he found it hard to win against him because his son has long arms and legs. His son even blocked his shot for the first time and joked, "Dad, I was playing in slippers!" He added that he wished his son could have come today and promised to bring him next year if the event is held again.

**Woman Reports Investment Scam, Taichung Police Catch 65-year-old Female Scammer**

A woman in Taichung, Ms. Chen, lost money in a fake investment scam. The scammers told her she made a bad investment and needed to pay more money. Ms. Chen realized something was wrong and reported it to the police. Working with the police, they caught a 65-year-old woman, Ms. Lin, who was collecting the money. Police found fake receipts and other evidence. Ms. Lin was sent to court for fraud and money laundering crimes.

The Taichung City Police Department said today that Ms. Chen had lost NT$860,000 since March to a fake investment group. The group pretended to be "expert investment advisors." They told her they had secret information that would help her earn money in the stock market without risk. They asked her to join a fake investment website and pay money by bank transfer and in person. Recently, the scammers asked Ms. Chen to pay another NT$800,000 in person. They lied, saying she had caused "losses to the company" by "bad investment actions" and needed to pay NT$2 million. They even said they had already paid NT$330,000 for her and demanded she pay them back. Ms. Chen then realized it was a scam and called the police. Police worked with Ms. Chen to set up a meeting with the scammer. When Ms. Lin came to collect the money on the morning of the 17th, police arrested her. Police found the phone she used for the scam and fake receipts. Ms. Lin was a member of the scam group, responsible for collecting money. The police are continuing to investigate to find others involved in the scam.

**Fire Department Asks Parents to Teach 5 Key Fire Safety Points for Summer Vacation**

As summer vacation starts, Taiwan's Fire Department today reminded everyone that fire prevention starts at home and through family education. They urged families to be careful about fire safety, whether children are home or on vacation. They asked parents to teach their children five important fire safety rules, including clearly telling them not to play with fire.

The Fire Department said in a press release today that children will spend more time at home during summer. So, parents should be very careful about fire safety at home or in hotels. Children might play with fire because they are curious. Parents should teach their children about fire safety and how to use fire and electricity safely. Here are 5 important points:

First, do not leave children alone at home, in the kitchen, or in a hotel. Teach them three main habits, including staying away from "hot things." Second, keep lighters and other tools that make fire in a safe place where children cannot reach them, or lock them away. Third, teach children the right things about fire safety. Help them understand how dangerous fire can be, and clearly tell them not to play with fire or copy actions that use fire. Fourth, spend more time with children to stop them from playing with fire because they are curious or bored. Fifth, if you see your child playing with fire, stop them right away and make sure it does not happen again.

If you plan to travel this summer, the Fire Department also reminds people to check five important things before leaving home:
1. Turn off gas stoves, gas tanks, or natural gas.
2. Unplug any electric devices that are not needed. This helps prevent short circuits or overheating.
3. Turn off the main power switch (if it does not stop necessary equipment from working). This saves power and lowers the risk of fire.
4. Make sure your home fire alarms are working correctly so they can warn you quickly if there is a fire.
5. Have a good relationship with your neighbors. If there is an emergency, you can help each other.

The Fire Department shared that from 2022 to 2024, there were 15,387 building fires in Taiwan. Out of these, 11,014 fires (about 71.6%) happened in homes. These home fires caused 360 deaths and 591 injuries. The top three causes of fires were electrical problems (40.1%), cooking (28.0%), and leaving burning things unattended (like cigarette butts or incense, 20.3%). This shows that managing electricity and cooking safely every day is still very important for preventing fires.

Also, the Fire Department noted that during the same time, 93 fires were caused by children playing with fire. These fires resulted in 9 deaths and 5 injuries. This shows that stopping children from playing with fire is a serious issue that should not be ignored.

The Fire Department said that fire prevention starts with daily habits and family education. It is important to teach children about safety and fire prevention from a young age. During summer vacation, it is even more important to be careful and prepared so you can have a fun and safe holiday.
