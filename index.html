Oil prices dropped a little today. This is because people are worried that new US taxes on goods might lower the need for energy.

Also, it is expected that a group called OPEC+ will produce more oil, which also makes prices go down.

Brent crude oil, a type of oil, went down by 0.45% to $68.80 per barrel. Another type, US West Texas Intermediate oil, fell by 0.67% to $67 per barrel. Trading was quiet because of the upcoming Independence Day holiday.

**Putin Talks to Trump About Ukraine, Says "Main Reasons" for War Must Be Solved**

US President Trump and Russian President Putin spoke on the phone today. Trump asked for the war in Ukraine to stop quickly. Putin's helper said that Putin repeated his idea that the "main reasons" for the war need to be fixed.

They talked for almost an hour. They did not discuss the US stopping some weapons for Ukraine. Ukraine's President Zelensky hopes to talk to Trump soon about this.

When Russia says "main reasons," they mean things like NATO growing bigger and Western countries helping Ukraine. This includes not wanting Ukraine to join NATO.

**US House of Representatives Approves Big New Bill, Sends It to Trump to Sign Before July 4th**

The US House of Representatives voted today to pass a large bill. This bill includes big tax cuts and spending plans from President Trump. The vote was 218 for and 214 against.

This means the bill will now go to President Trump. He wants to sign it into law before July 4th, which is a national holiday. The Senate had already passed this bill with a very close vote.

Trump believes this bill will help the US economy grow. However, government experts say the bill will add about $3.3 trillion to the country's debt and reduce health insurance for many people.
