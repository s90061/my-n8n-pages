            <h1>World Games: Sun Chia-hung is Taiwan's Flag Bearer, Excitedly Calls It "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 7th â€“ The opening ceremony for the 2025 Chengdu World Games happened today. Sun Chia-hung, a martial arts athlete, was the first martial arts player to carry the flag for the Taiwan team. He was very excited, saying this moment felt like something from a dream.</p>
            <p>At the last World Games in Birmingham, the Taiwan team won 1 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze medals. For this Chengdu World Games, Taiwan has sent 120 athletes. They will compete in 14 different sports. The women's tug-of-war team plans to try and win their sixth championship in a row in the 500 kg category. This would be a first.</p>
            <p>At today's opening ceremony for the Chengdu World Games, Sun Chia-hung and Huang Mei-chien were the flag bearers for Taiwan. They were the 104th team to enter, coming in between Syria and the Czech Republic. In total, 64 athletes from Taiwan took part in the event. They are in sports like canoe polo, korfball, orienteering, fin swimming, roller sports, waterskiing, martial arts, and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-hung won a gold medal in Tai Chi Quan and a silver medal in Tai Chi Sword at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now, he is back in Chengdu and is the first martial arts athlete to be a flag bearer. He told reporters he was very moved. He said this is a moment he has dreamed of since he was a child. He believes it is a result of hard work over time. He mentioned that many older athletes before him did very well, and together, they helped Taiwan's martial arts become well-known and respected in international competitions.</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-chien, who was a national swimmer for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has recently started focusing more on coaching. However, she still competes in fin swimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fin race at the World Fin Swimming Championships. Huang Mei-chien said she has been an athlete representative for oaths and a torch bearer before. But this is her first time being a flag bearer. She said she is "very excited and a little nervous" and hopes to do her job well.</p>

            <h1>Car Flooded? Financial Supervisory Commission: You Need Extra Insurance</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 7th â€“ Heavy rains from a recent weather system in the southwest have caused a lot of damage in central and southern Taiwan. Many cars have been flooded. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that current car insurance policies (Type A, B, and C for vehicle damage) do not cover damage from typhoons or floods. If people need this protection, they can add an "Additional Clause for Typhoons, Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Hail, Floods, or Water Accumulation Due to Rain" to their policy. This is the only way to be covered.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan, Deputy Director of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, spoke at a regular press conference today. He explained that insurance has two main parts: personal insurance and business insurance. The affected areas in central and southern Taiwan are large, and not just people and businesses, but also homes and cars, may have been damaged. For personal insurance, he said that residential fire insurance now includes "Residential Typhoon and Flood Disaster Compensation Insurance." This covers damage to homes from typhoons or floods. If a home is flooded by 50 centimeters or more, it provides basic coverage of NT$7,000 to NT$9,000 for three different areas.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen also said that if people think the basic coverage is not enough, they can ask their insurance company to add an "Excess Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause." This extra clause offers more compensation than the basic plan. It also provides NT$3,000 per day for temporary housing, for up to 60 days.</p>
            <p>Also, there have been many mudslide disasters recently. Mr. Chen explained that if a house is in a low-lying area or on a hillside, people can choose to add a "Ground Subsidence, Landslide, or Landslide Insurance Additional Clause." This protects against losses from ground movement or sinking, landslides, loose ground, and sand and soil loss (including mudslides) caused by typhoons or floods.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that many cars have also been damaged by floods. However, current car insurance policies (Type A, B, and C for vehicle damage) do not cover damage from typhoons and floods. If your home is in a low-lying area, and you are worried about your car getting damaged by a typhoon or flood, you can add the "Additional Clause for Typhoons, Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Hail, Floods, or Water Accumulation Due to Rain." This will protect your vehicle from damage caused by typhoons or floods.</p>
            <p>For business insurance, Mr. Chen stated that the most common type of fire insurance for businesses is comprehensive commercial fire insurance. This kind of insurance covers many things. It mainly covers buildings, machinery, and movable property. It protects against losses from sudden and unexpected accidents, so it includes damage from typhoons and floods.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Chen also said that commercial fire insurance policies list specific things they cover. Because of this, they do not cover damage to insured items caused by typhoons or floods unless specifically added. Businesses can buy an "Additional Clause for Typhoon and Flood Insurance" to protect themselves from natural disaster risks. He advises businesses to talk to their insurance company when buying a policy to make sure the coverage meets their needs.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Says Xidong Line Project Damaged Wires; New Taipei Metro Says They Will Investigate</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 7th â€“ Matsuyama Airport had a power outage tonight. Taipower said it happened because the New Taipei City Metro Department's Xidong Line project accidentally dug into a power transmission line. However, the New Taipei City Metro Department replied that they are not sure yet if their work caused the power outage. They will let Taipower come to the site to check tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Matsuyama Airport's power outage at night lasted only 3 to 4 seconds, according to the Civil Aeronautics Administration. No flights were affected. Also, other parts of the Songshan area also had power issues, for example, the escalators at Nanjing Fuxing MRT station stopped working.</p>
            <p>Taipower explained that they checked and found that the Xizhi-Donghu Line project by the New Taipei City Metro Department accidentally dug into a power line. This caused a short drop in voltage. Because of this, the power at Matsuyama Airport, the Taipei Metro, and Far EasTone Telecommunications main office flickered briefly. Now, Taipower's electricity supply is back to normal.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Government Department of Rapid Transit Systems explained in a message that the Xidong MRT Line project was drilling on Tongxing Road in Xizhi District. According to the high-voltage wire maps from Taipower, there were no 161KV high-voltage wires under the ground at that location. Also, the construction company dug down 2.5 meters and drilled 40 meters, but found no pipes or lines. So, they are not yet sure if it is connected to the power outage.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Metro Department said that because Taipower directly blamed the Xidong Line project, they will start traffic control tomorrow morning and let Taipower come to the site to check. This will help them find out the exact reason for the accident.</p>
