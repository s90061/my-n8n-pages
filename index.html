            <h1>Taiwan Nichia Promotes Dai Zhen-chia to Executive Director, He Becomes the Highest-Ranking Taiwanese Manager</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia announced today that Dai Zhen-chia, who was a managing director, has been promoted to executive director. This makes him the Taiwanese person with the highest position in the Nichia Group. Dai Zhen-chia is now the third most important person at Taiwan Nichia, after the president and vice president.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia explained in a press release that an executive director has a very important role in Japanese companies. This person is only below the president and vice president. They are in charge of running the main business and making important plans. They also play a key part in board meetings and regular meetings. This new appointment shows that Nichia greatly values Dai Zhen-chia's leadership and hard work over many years.</p>
            <p>Besides his role at Nichia, Dai Zhen-chia also works as the vice chairman for Nichia's child company, Taiwan Asia Semiconductor. This helps to connect their work more deeply in the semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>Lee Kuo-guang, the chairman of Taiwan Asia Semiconductor, said that it is very special for a Taiwanese senior manager to become an executive director in a Japanese company. This shows that Taiwanese skilled workers are very competitive in international companies. It also means that the economic ties and trust between Taiwan and Japan are getting stronger.</p>
            <p>An "executive director" is similar to an executive director in a Taiwanese company. In Japanese companies, this role often helps the president and manages all company matters.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Woman Beats Partner and Burns Her Face, Causing Death; She Had Also Hurt Her 4 Years Ago</h1>
            <p>In February of this year, a woman named Luo from New Taipei City used a billiard cue to hit her girlfriend's head and a lighter to burn her face. The girlfriend died because of this. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office recently charged Ms. Luo with causing death by injury. Ms. Luo admitted to all the charges in court. Further checks showed that Ms. Luo had hurt the victim, Ms. Qiu, four years ago, so this was not the first time.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo, who is 34 years old, and Ms. Qiu were partners. They lived together in a rented apartment in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City. Around 1 AM on February 4th this year, Ms. Luo first pushed Ms. Qiu with her hands, making her head hit the floor. After Ms. Qiu lost consciousness, Ms. Luo moved her to the bed and, during this, Ms. Qiu's head hit something again.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo also used a billiard cue to hit Ms. Qiu's head and body. Then, she used a lighter to light tissues and other things that burn easily. She used the fire to burn Ms. Qiu's face, head, and shoulders. This caused a lot of bleeding at the back of her head, a broken bone on the left side of her skull, and finally, brain damage that led to her death.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office recently charged Ms. Luo with causing death by injury. Yesterday, the New Taipei District Court held a first hearing, where Ms. Luo admitted to all the crimes mentioned above.</p>
            <p>Additionally, records show that Ms. Luo had hurt Ms. Qiu many years before. In February 2021, the two had an argument. Ms. Luo used a wine bottle and an ashtray to hit Ms. Qiu, and she also grabbed Ms. Qiu's head and hit it against a wall. This caused injuries to Ms. Qiu's head. At that time, the prosecutors charged Ms. Luo with assault. However, the two later agreed to settle, and the charges were dropped.</p>
