            <h1>Wu Der-rong: Hot Temperatures Everywhere, 50% Chance of Tropical System Becoming a Typhoon</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that it will still be hot everywhere today. Around noon, people should be careful because the UV index will be at a dangerous level. This week, there is a chance of a tropical weather system forming far east of Taiwan. It has about a 50% chance of becoming a typhoon. It is expected to move past the Ryukyu Islands towards Japan, but we still need to watch it closely.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, who is also an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column today for the Weather Application and Promotion Foundation. He said that the newest European weather models show a tropical system far east of Taiwan this week. It has about a 50% chance of becoming a typhoon. The average path from these models shows it moving north, passing near the Ryukyu Islands, then making a big turn to the northeast towards Japan. However, individual model paths are spread out, meaning there is still a lot of uncertainty. We should keep watching it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also said that the latest European models show sunny to partly cloudy skies everywhere today. It will be hot. Around noon, the UV index will be dangerous, so people should use sun protection and avoid heatstroke. In the afternoon, there might be some local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration today shared a high-temperature warning. The weather will be hot everywhere. Taipei City, New Taipei City, and Changhua County have an orange warning, meaning there is a chance of temperatures reaching 36 degrees Celsius for several days.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the latest European models show that from tomorrow until September 3rd, there will be a little more moisture from the south. It will be mostly sunny with some clouds everywhere, and northern Taiwan will still be quite hot. The eastern parts of Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula might have some short local rain showers. In the afternoon, there will be local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains, and sometimes they might spread to some flat areas. People should be careful about heavy local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu added that on September 4th and 5th, it will be clear and very hot everywhere. In northern Taiwan, temperatures could reach 38 degrees Celsius. Around noon, the UV index will be dangerous, so people should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. In the afternoon, there is a chance of local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains.</p>
            <p>Also, Wu Der-rong stated that on September 6th, there will be a little more moisture from the south. It will be mostly sunny with some clouds everywhere, and northern Taiwan will still be quite hot. The eastern parts of Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula might have some short local rain showers. In the afternoon, there will be local showers or thunderstorms in the mountains, and sometimes they might spread to some flat areas.</p>

            <h1>Nicaragua Opposition Members Die in Prison, Opposition Accuses Authorities of Suppression</h1>
            <p>Managua, August 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ According to news from Nicaragua and opposition parties today, a person who disagreed with the government died in prison two weeks after being arrested. Also, earlier this week, another person who had long been against the government also died while in custody.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that these deaths show that Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and his wife, Vice President Rosario Murillo, are still strongly stopping people who disagree with them. In recent years, they have arrested hundreds of opposition members. Since 2019, it is said that five people who opposed the government have died in prison.</p>
            <p>The opposition member who died today was lawyer Carlos Cardenas. He was arrested on August 15th during a police raid targeting people who were against the government. Cardenas was also put in prison in 2018 because of big public protests in Nicaragua. Reuters could not directly contact Cardenas's family.</p>
            <p>The Grand Coalition for Nicaragua (GCON), a large opposition group, posted on social media platform X today. They said, "This strict government has given another political prisoner's body back to their family."</p>
            <p>The government of Nicaragua did not immediately answer questions about this.</p>
            <p>On August 25th, several opposition leaders in Nicaragua also criticized the authorities. This was after political activist Mauricio Alonso died in prison in mid-July after being arrested.</p>

            <h1>Vilnius Electric Boats: Green Capital's Pride or Taxpayer's Burden?</h1>
            <p>In mid-July, Lithuania's first electric boat officially started running. This happened with Mayor Valdas Benkunskas watching. The boat travels on the Neris River, which goes through the city center. The city government said these boats are not just for regular transport. They are also an important symbol to encourage "river life." But as the electric boats began, people started cheering and asking questions almost at the same time.</p>
            <p>The city government plans to use a total of four electric boats this year. Each boat costs about 450,000 Euros (around 15.75 million New Taiwan Dollars). With building the docks and paying the staff, the first cost is estimated to be over 2 million Euros. A one-way trip on an electric boat takes about 30 to 50 minutes. Each boat only has 34 seats. On average, it is expected to carry 390 passengers each day. Also, the boats only run from May to October.</p>
            <p>These numbers immediately caused arguments. For those who support the boats, they show Vilnius's plan to be a green city. They make the city's river not just a pretty view but also a part of daily life. But for those who criticize the idea, the small number of passengers the boats can carry and the limited time of year they run make this big investment seem like an expensive show-off, especially when compared to buses or trams.</p>
            <p>In early August, a heavy rainstorm made the company operating the boats, JUDU, suddenly announce that they would stop running. The official reason was not just that the water level rose. It was also because the heavy rain washed many tree branches and logs into the river, making it unsafe. But this still led to public jokes. People asked: If a summer rainstorm can stop the boats, how can they talk about stable service?</p>
            <p>Soon after, another passenger complained. He was not allowed to get on the electric boat because it was full. He ended up walking to the next stop faster than the boat. This made the mayor's words about it being a "regular transport tool" seem untrue.</p>
            <p>Taking advantage of the clear weather at the end of summer, the reporter also rode this new transport, which was the most talked about this year. The boat was full of people trying it for the first time, curious about it. More often, it was young people and families taking pictures, not people going to work.</p>
            <p>A couple with bicycles told the reporter that the river path is curvy, and the boats come too far apart. Also, there are only five stops. Even during busy times, it is hard for the boats to replace buses. They think the electric boats are better for fun or for tourists, not as a useful way to travel every day.</p>
            <p>Another Lithuanian passenger complained because he almost could not get on the boat. He was waiting at a middle stop, but the boat already had 34 people, and no one got off. So, he was not allowed to get on. In the end, he had to ask the crew for a special favor to get on. In his opinion, the electric boats are not a helpful way for citizens to travel. Instead, they are a "useless investment" pushed by politicians to show off their achievements.</p>
            <p>Not only passengers criticized the boats. City council member Aleksandras Nemunaitis said clearly that because the electric boats can only be used in certain seasons and carry a limited number of people, they are "meant to lose money." He said he "would not be surprised at all" if they stop running in two years because of a change in political power.</p>
            <p>The city government, however, emphasized that this is an investment in a green future. The boat service not only offers transport but also helps people have a closer connection with the river. Go Vilnius, the official tourism group, even called the electric boats "both a symbol of moving towards a green city and a practical step."</p>
            <p>It is true that riding quietly on the Neris River in a boat without diesel fumes or a loud engine is a pleasant experience. Looking at the green views along both sides of the river, people can temporarily forget their daily worries. This is probably the most attractive thing about the electric boats.</p>
            <p>However, when the title of "Green Capital" is no longer new, will Vilnius still be able to convince its people that this investment is worthwhile? Will the electric boats become a symbol of the city's long-term growth, or just a short-lived political decoration? Only time can tell.</p>
