            <h1>Russia's Foreign Minister Says No Plans to Attack Europe, Warns of Strong Response if Attacked</h1>
            <p>The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, spoke at the United Nations today. He told world leaders that Russia does not want to attack Europe. But he also said that if anyone attacks Russia, Russia will respond very strongly.</p>
            <p>Lately, some planes that were not allowed have flown into the sky of NATO countries. Many people believe Russia is responsible for this, and it has made Europe very worried. This is especially true after NATO planes shot down a drone over Poland. Also, Estonia said a Russian warplane flew into its sky and stayed for 12 minutes. This has made the situation more difficult.</p>
            <p>Russia has said its planes did not go into Estonia. They also said that the drones were not aimed at Poland. Belarus, which is a friend of Russia, said that Ukraine's signal jamming caused the drones to go the wrong way. But European leaders believe these events were planned to test NATO and see how they would react.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Lavrov insisted that Russia is the country that is facing threats.</p>
            <p>He said, "Russia has never intended to attack Europe or NATO countries, and it does not intend to now. But if anyone attacks our country, we will respond strongly."</p>
            <p>This week, the President of the United States, Mr. Trump, said he thinks Ukraine can take back all the land that Russia has taken.</p>
            <p>This is a big change from what the US leader said before. He used to say that Ukraine might need to give up some land. He also said that Ukraine might never get back all the areas Russia has controlled since 2014 when Russia took Crimea, and since 2022 when Russia started a full war.</p>
            <p>Three weeks ago, Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, said that Russia and the US had a good understanding. He also said that Trump's government was "listening to us."</p>
            <p>President Trump shared his new idea after meeting with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the UN General Assembly on September 23rd.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Questions Drone Crossing Border, Hungary Replies with Sarcasm</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, recently said that a military report suggested a drone flew into Ukraine from Hungary. He thought the drone might have been trying to find out about Ukraine's factories in the western part of the country. Yesterday, Hungary responded to this with a joking and mocking comment.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy spoke about this early military report, but he did not say exactly when it happened. After he met with Ukraine's top military leaders, he wrote on Telegram. He said he had told them to check all the information they had and to report every event right away.</p>
            <p>Later, in his usual speech, Zelenskyy talked more about "very strange events" near the border with Hungary. He said he had ordered a "complete investigation." He also warned that if similar drones appeared again, Ukraine would "take suitable actions to protect our country."</p>
            <p>Hungary's Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, wrote on social media site X. He said that President Zelenskyy "has become crazy because he dislikes Hungary. Now he is seeing things that do not exist."</p>
            <p>The Ukrainian military also put photos online that seemed to show a drone entering their country. They said that Ukrainian drones were flying in that area to check it.</p>
            <p>Hungary is a member of the European Union and NATO. Both of these groups are helping Ukraine in its war against Russia. However, the relationship between Ukraine and Hungary has always been difficult. Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban, has often questioned if Western countries should send military help to Ukraine. He also keeps a friendly relationship with Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.</p>

            <h1>29 Dead, 50 Hurt in Crowd Crush at Indian Actor-Politician's Rally</h1>
            <p>Today, a newspaper called "The Hindu" reported that 29 people died and at least 50 people were hurt. This happened at a political gathering for an actor and politician named Vijay. Health officials shared this information.</p>
            <p>The Health Minister of Tamil Nadu state, Ma. Subramanian, said that at least 24 doctors from Tiruchirappalli and 20 doctors from Salem were sent to Karur county to help. This is where the event took place.</p>
            <p>The report said that a very large number of people came together for this gathering. It was part of Vijay's tour for his political party, "Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam."</p>
            <p>Vijay, who is known by only one name, is campaigning for the Tamil Nadu election that will happen early next year.</p>
            <p>The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, wrote on social media site X. He said he was "very sad" about the "bad event" in Karur, Tamil Nadu.</p>
            <p>Reporters from Reuters tried to call the health department of Tamil Nadu and the office of the state's leader, MK Stalin, but no one answered.</p>
            <p>Stalin wrote on X that the news from Karur was "worrying." He added that he told his ministers and other officials to quickly give medical help to the people who were hurt at the Karur event. He also asked for more help from the nearby city of Tiruchirappalli.</p>
