            <h1>Malaysian Man Arrested in Nantou for Scamming, Held in Custody</h1>
            <p>A 29-year-old Malaysian man joined a scam group online. He came to Taiwan on October 10th. He followed the scam group's orders to collect money in different places. An 81-year-old woman named Lin in Nantou gave him NT$1 million. The police caught the Malaysian man and another man, Hong, who was helping to collect the money. The prosecutor then asked to keep them in custody, and the request was approved.</p>
            <p>The Nantou County Police Department released news today. The Nantou Police Station received information that a scammer was going to meet a victim in Caotun Township on October 14th to collect money. Police chief Chen Chun-hong led his team to wait there. They saw a man collecting cash from an 81-year-old woman named Lin. The man then walked to a nearby parking lot and gave the money to another man. </p>
            <p>Mr. Chen's team immediately arrested the Malaysian man, who was the "money collector," and Mr. Hong, who was the "money handler." They seized NT$1,196,000 in cash, a work phone, and ATM cards. The 29-year-old Malaysian man admitted he found the scam job online. The scam group paid for his plane ticket to Taiwan on October 10th. He then followed their instructions to collect money. The 27-year-old Mr. Hong also admitted he was responsible for "handling the money." He collected the stolen money from the scammer and then sent it to a specific location as told by the group leader.</p>
            <p>The police said that Mrs. Lin was a victim of a fake police and prosecutor scam. The criminals pretended to be a prosecutor from the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office. They told Mrs. Lin she was involved in a criminal case and had to help with an investigation. They also told her to let them control her bank accounts and not to tell anyone. So, when the Nantou police officers showed up, Mrs. Lin thought they were "fake police" and did not believe she was being scammed. The police worked hard to convince her and took her to the police station. They even called the Kaohsiung District Prosecutor's Office to check if there was a prosecutor with that name. Only then did Mrs. Lin realize she had been scammed by fake police and prosecutors.</p>
            <p>The police found the NT$1 million that Mrs. Lin had given. They also found two unknown ATM cards and NT$196,000 in cash in Mr. Hong's car. The case has been sent to the Nantou District Prosecutor's Office. The Malaysian man and Mr. Hong are accused of fraud and breaking money laundering laws. Both have been held in custody. The police want to remind everyone that police and prosecutors will not handle cases over the phone. They will also never ask you to transfer money or give them cash.</p>

            <h1>Pingtung's Second Youth Advisory Committee Starts Its Work, Hopes to Show Young People's Energy</h1>
            <p>Today, the Pingtung County Government's second "Youth Advisory Committee" officially started. Pingtung County Governor Chou Chun-mi gave certificates to 19 committee members. She encouraged the young people to bravely share their ideas. Lin Liang-yin, a new committee member, said she hopes they can all show the different talents and energy of young people in Pingtung.</p>
            <p>The committee's start ceremony was held today at the Labor and Youth Development Department building. Governor Chou Chun-mi gave certificates to 19 members. These members include university students, young business owners, new social talents, and local youth groups. She encouraged them to continue the good work from the first committee. She asked them to bravely give advice and actively help with county government matters.</p>
            <p>Governor Chou said that young people are not only important for the country but also for every city's development. She started the first advisory committee in 2023 when she became governor. Thanks to the young representatives and many experts, she got many new ideas for managing the county. She hopes that with the new members, Pingtung will become even better.</p>
            <p>Lin Liang-yin, 26, is a youth advisory committee member who is still studying for her master's degree at National Taiwan University. She said that when she was studying, she thought leaving Pingtung to work in the north was the right choice. But Pingtung has a way of keeping people. Earlier this year, she came back to her hometown and started the "Good Pingtung Youth Association" to encourage more public discussions. She said that people from Pingtung want to go out and see the world, but it often takes more effort to come back. She hopes to work with her friends to show the different talents and energy of young people in Pingtung.</p>
            <p>According to the Labor and Youth Development Department, only 4 out of the 19 young committee members this year are women. Lin Liang-yin quickly pointed out that there are not many women on this committee. She said that even though fewer women applied, it shows that public participation, especially in more serious areas, is still mostly for men. This quietly shows that there is still inequality between genders. She believes that public life should not just be for people with certain qualities. More diverse voices, experiences, and ways of thinking should be seen. She also hopes that this year's committee will give advice not only on youth issues.</p>
            <p>Li Yu-chen, the Director of the Pingtung County Government Labor and Youth Development Department, said that this committee has 19 young members, 5 experts, and 5 government representatives. For the next two years, they will connect the county government and the public. Besides holding regular meetings, they will also hold youth talks, workshops, and idea competitions in different places. They will also work with youth centers, schools, and groups in the county. This will make sure that government decisions better meet the needs of young people.</p>
            <p>The Labor and Youth Development Department mentioned that since the first Youth Advisory Committee started, it has given many suggestions. These include combining resources for young business owners, improving career exploration, caring for the safety of deaf drivers, and having bilingual road signs. This year, they also started the "Pingtung Creative Idea" competition. This competition helps turn young people's solutions into real actions for different government departments. It has helped many county policies improve. In the future, they will continue to support youth policies and create a platform for young people in Pingtung to take part in public life.</p>

            <h1>Lee Sze-chuan Asks Shin Kong Life Again to Find a Third Party to Set a Fair Price for Ending Their Contract</h1>
            <p>Today, Taipei City Deputy Mayor Lee Sze-chuan spoke again to Shin Kong Life Insurance Co., Ltd. He asked them to work together to choose a third-party accountant, appraiser, or lawyers' association. This third party would decide a fair price and conditions for ending their contract by agreement. This would help the situation move forward.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA, a big tech company, had planned to build its Taiwan headquarters in the Beitou-Shilin Technology Park on plots T17 and T18. However, Shin Kong Life already has the rights to use this land. The Taipei City Government wants to end the contract by agreement. Then, they want to give the land use rights to NVIDIA through a special plan. On October 13th, the city government sent a letter to Shin Kong Life asking to end the contract by agreement.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Lin Wei-chun, the General Manager of Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding Co., Ltd., said that NVIDIA agreed to pay a fee to Shin Kong Life to transfer the land development rights. He also said that even though the agreement (MOU) ended in September, it would not be hard to talk about it again.</p>
            <p>Before attending a press conference for the "Neihu Science Park Commute Transformation Project," Lee Sze-chuan talked to the media. He said that since May, the Taipei City Government, Shin Kong Life, and NVIDIA have discussed many plans. They even talked about having all three parties sign a contract. But the biggest problem is that NVIDIA cannot pay two times for one piece of land.</p>
            <p>He explained that Shin Kong Life knows the real difficulties very well, and NVIDIA has also clearly stated its position. What NVIDIA can accept now is for Shin Kong Life to end its contract with the city government, dealing only with the city government, not with Shin Kong Life directly. But Shin Kong Life keeps insisting on its own plan. Mr. Lee said, "I don't know why it's like this."</p>
            <p>Lee Sze-chuan asked Shin Kong Life to suggest conditions and an amount for ending the contract by agreement. He suggested they work with the Taipei City Government to choose a third-party group, like an accountant association, an appraiser association, or a lawyers' association, to decide the fair price. He said this would be a good basis for discussions in both the Taipei City Council and Shin Kong Life's board meetings. It would also avoid problems like breach of trust and help the situation progress.</p>
            <p>The media asked if the Taipei City Government would give in if Shin Kong Life refused to end the contract by agreement. Lee Sze-chuan said that it is not about anyone giving in. Everyone hopes NVIDIA will set up its office in Taiwan. The people of Taipei especially want NVIDIA to come to Taipei. He said that the city government is currently working to find a plan that everyone can accept.</p>
            <p>Lee Sze-chuan said that NVIDIA has already sent letters to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taipei City Government to look for other possible locations. This means NVIDIA does not only want the T17 and T18 plots in the Beitou-Shilin Technology Park. If the city government does not hear back from Shin Kong Life by October 24th, the city government will offer other good alternative plans for NVIDIA to choose from.</p>
