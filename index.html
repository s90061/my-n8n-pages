            <h1>Woman's Unleashed Dog Causes Motorcycle Accident in Taoyuan</h1>
            <p>On October 11, the Guishan Police Station in Taoyuan City reported that a woman named Zhan was walking her dog late on October 9. Her dog was not on a leash. The dog suddenly ran onto the road, causing a motorcyclist named Liu to fall. Police and emergency services arrived to help. Mr. Liu had not been drinking alcohol and suffered many scratches on his body, but his life was not in danger. Both sides will talk about how to pay for the damages.</p>
            <p>The Guishan Police Station said that at 11:41 PM on October 9, 18-year-old Mr. Liu was riding his motorcycle straight on Guangrong Road in Guishan District. Suddenly, a dog ran across the road. Mr. Liu braked hard to avoid the dog, which made him and his motorcycle fall.</p>
            <p>Police officers arrived at the scene and quickly helped Mr. Liu with his injuries. They tested him for alcohol, and the result was zero. Medical staff saw that Mr. Liu had many scratches but was not in danger. Based on the first investigation, Ms. Zhan was walking her dog without a leash late at night, and the dog running around on the road caused the accident. The Guishan Police Station will handle the case according to the law.</p>
            <p>The Guishan Police Station also said that the motorcyclist has not yet filed a complaint about his injuries. Both parties are still discussing how to pay for the damages from the accident. The police want to remind everyone that when you walk your dog outside, you should always use a leash.

            <h1>Lukang Music Festival Draws Crowds, Changhua County Government Asks People to Use Shuttle Buses</h1>
            <p>On October 11, Changhua County government held a "Taiwan Design Exhibition." As part of this event, the "Trendy Lukang" Music Festival is happening today and tomorrow in Lukang Township. Many music fans are expected to come. The county government is asking people to use the shuttle buses often and has asked bus companies to add more buses so visitors do not have to wait a long time.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Design Exhibition" started yesterday and will continue until October 26. The Changhua County Government Transportation Department announced today that on the first day, including trial runs, the three main exhibition areas had more than 440,000 visitors. Many people said there were not enough shuttle buses. The county government quickly contacted the bus companies to fix this problem by adding more buses and improving their scheduling to avoid long waits for visitors.</p>
            <p>The County Government Transportation Department said that the best way to visit the Taiwan Design Exhibition is to download the "Changhua Travel APP." This app has full information about transportation and explains how to use special shuttle buses and public transport to get to each exhibition area, which helps reduce traffic in the city. For the "Changhua Exhibition Area," visitors can park at the Taihua shuttle station parking lot and then take a shuttle bus. For the "Changnan Exhibition Area," visitors can park at the Yixin Garden parking lot or the parking lot behind the exhibition center. From there, they can walk or take an exhibition area shuttle bus to easily reach the destination.</p>
            <p>The Transportation Department also said that the "Trendy Lukang" Music Festival is taking place today and tomorrow at the Lukang Sports Ground. Popular artists such as Crowd Lu, Nine One One, Meixiu Group, Mi-Sui-Sian, and TRASH are performing. Many music lovers are expected to come to Lukang. The government also asks people to use the shuttle services to avoid busy roads and enjoy the "Trendy Lukang" event and the exhibition halls.</p>

            <h1>Rakuten Monkeys Change Batting Order for CPBL Playoff Challenge, Sung Chia-hsiang and Pedro Fernandez Hope to Play Well Again</h1>
            <p>On October 11, the Rakuten Monkeys baseball team in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) had to win today's playoff challenge game. They changed their batting order. Head coach Koo Koji said, "This should be the best lineup we have right now." He also said that starting pitcher Pedro Fernandez and young catcher Sung Chia-hsiang will play together, hoping to do as well as they did in the regular season.</p>
            <p>Pedro Fernandez was the pitcher with the most wins and strikeouts in the CPBL this year. He is trying to help his team continue in the competition.</p>
            <p>Koo Koji said that he wants Sung Chia-hsiang to play with the same mindset as in the regular season and not try to do more than he can. Sung Chia-hsiang and Pedro Fernandez worked very well together in the second half of the season, and the coaching team saw many good things from them.</p>
            <p>The CPBL playoff challenge is a best-of-five series. The Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions, who won the first half of the season, already have one win. They won the first game yesterday, so they are close to winning the series. The second game tonight is back at the Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium, the Monkeys' home field. All 18,000 tickets were sold before the game, so the stadium will be full of fans.</p>
            <p>The Monkeys have no more chances to lose, so they changed their batting order. Chen Chen-Wei will be the leadoff hitter (left field). Cheng Chin, who played center field and batted ninth yesterday, will now bat second. The middle of the batting order will be Lin Li (right field), Lin Hung-Yu (designated hitter), and Liang Chia-Jung (third base). Lin Tzu-Wei will start at second base and bat sixth. Lin Cheng-Fei will be the shortstop and bat seventh. Sung Chia-hsiang will bat eighth, and Yu Te-Lung will play first base and bat ninth.</p>
            <p>Koo Koji said he has been thinking about the batting order since yesterday. He believes this starting lineup is the best the team has right now.</p>
