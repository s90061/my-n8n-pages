            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai Says New Budget Law Problem is in Legislature, Will Discuss Solutions with Local Governments on September 13</h1>
            <p>The new law about how money is shared between the central government and local governments is still causing problems. Premier Cho Jung-tai will invite local government officials on September 13 to talk about it. Today, Premier Cho said that local governments want to surround the central government and want them to "put down the knife." But, he believes everyone knows the new law has mistakes. He hopes local governments will be open to discussing with the central government to fix these mistakes.</p>
            <p>The argument about how much money the central government gives to local governments is not solved yet. Yesterday, leaders from cities and counties led by the KMT and TPP parties said they want to protect local funding. They want to make sure that shared tax money and general grants only increase, not decrease. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said they would "surround the central government." Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen asked the central government to "put down the knife." Before this, leaders from DPP-led cities and counties asked the central government to quickly change the law to fix its incorrect rules.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan has planned for Premier Cho to meet with local governments in two groups on September 13 to discuss the finance law. Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said today after a meeting that Premier Cho pointed out the new finance law has bad effects. It makes cities and countryside areas unbalanced. Also, the rules in the law have clear mistakes. Because there is not enough time, making the budget for next year is very hard.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that the Executive Yuan's document to ask for a review clearly explained the problems, with pictures to show them. If the Legislature had discussed the Executive Yuan's suggestions fully in February, this argument about money sharing would not be happening now. He said, "Sadly, in the Legislature, they only looked at the voting numbers." That is why making the budget is now difficult.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that yesterday, 15 city and county leaders held a press conference. But these leaders did not offer solutions. Instead, they said they would "surround the central government" and asked the central government to "put down the knife." However, the Executive Yuan's document for review had already pointed out where the problems were.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho stressed that society already agrees there are mistakes in this law change. The government does not want to blame anyone, but to fix the mistakes. This way, the law about how government money is shared can be discussed fairly in the future. He used a saying, "The one who tied the bell must untie it," meaning those who created the problem should fix it. He hopes everyone will discuss it with an open mind.</p>

            <h1>Rubio Talks with Wang Yi, Hopes for "Helpful" Talks Between US and China</h1>
            <p>Today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi. This happened while the US is putting pressure on China for buying oil from Russia. Rubio said he hopes for helpful talks with China.</p>
            <p>The US State Department said Rubio "stressed how important it is to keep talking openly and helpfully on many topics between the two countries." But they did not give more details. This information comes from Agence France-Presse.</p>
            <p>Rubio's call with Wang Yi happened a few days after China's President Xi Jinping led a big parade to remember the end of World War II. Leaders from many countries, including Russia's President Vladimir Putin and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, were there.</p>
            <p>US President Trump, however, said that these three leaders are secretly planning against the United States.</p>
            <p>According to Xinhua News Agency, Wang Yi said his call with Rubio was successful. But he also warned that "America's bad words and actions have hurt China's fair rights."</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also told the US to be careful with issues important to China, especially Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi said, "The US and China fought together in World War II against militarism and fascism. Now, in this new time, both sides should work together for world peace and wealth, deal with global problems, and act responsibly as big countries."</p>
            <p>When Rubio was a senator, he was known for his strong views against China. In a meeting to approve new officials, he even warned that a big global fight must happen to stop China from becoming the most powerful country, surpassing the US.</p>
            <p>However, when Rubio met Wang Yi in Malaysia in July this year, the mood was friendly. Trump has also often spoken highly of his relationship with President Xi Jinping and said he hopes to visit China this year.</p>
            <p>But recently, Trump has suggested he will raise taxes on goods from China. He did the same thing with India. The reason is that these countries continue to buy oil from Russia, even though Russia has not stopped fighting in Ukraine, which the US asked for.</p>

            <h1>China Eastern Airlines Starts New Route, Argentine Media Mistakenly Shows China Airlines Pictures</h1>
            <p>On September 10, an Argentine news channel named A24 reported that China Eastern Airlines will start a new flight route in December. This route will go from Shanghai, through Auckland, to Buenos Aires. It is called a "Southern Corridor" because it connects three continents. However, the news report mistakenly showed pictures of Taiwan's China Airlines, which made viewers confused.</p>
            <p>In the news report, there was one photo of China Eastern Airlines at the start. There was also a screenshot from a social media post by the Chinese Embassy in Argentina. But the explainer video, which was four and a half minutes long, mostly used a promotional video from China Airlines. This video was called "With You, Blooming in the Sky." In the video, China Airlines' clear plum blossom logo on the plane's tail could be seen easily. For people who don't know much about the two airlines, they might think the Taiwanese airline is a Chinese government-owned airline.</p>
            <p>Argentine media calls this route "the longest flight route in the world." The flight will take about 29 hours and cover a distance of 19,681 kilometers. Passengers will stop in Auckland, New Zealand, but will not get off the plane. This route is seen as a "Southern Corridor" that connects Asia, Oceania, and South America. There will be 4 flights each week. It is believed to be one way to increase business and cultural talks between China and Argentina.</p>
            <p>The start of this flight route is also closely connected to the policies of China, New Zealand, and Argentina. In May 2025, China held a "China-CELAC Forum" in Beijing. After this, China said that citizens from five Latin American countries, including Argentina, can visit for 30 days without a visa. In July of the same year, Argentina also said that Chinese travelers can enter with a US visa. These actions help to open the Southern Corridor flight route.</p>
            <p>Carrie Hurihanganui, the CEO of Auckland Airport, said that choosing Auckland as a stopover is also related to the New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) policy, which will start in November 2025. This policy lets Chinese citizens transfer flights without needing a traditional visa.</p>
            <p>Argentine media has analyzed that China Eastern Airlines' direct flight is now the only international air route between Asia and Argentina. This comes after Malaysia Airlines left the South American market 10 years ago. In the future, this route will mean travelers and cargo will not have to rely on stopping in Europe or North America. It will make travel time between East Asia and South America shorter. It also shows that China is continuing to increase its business influence and diplomatic plans in Latin America.</p>
