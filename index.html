            <h1>Tom Hanks' Award at West Point Canceled, Trump Calls it a Smart Choice</h1>
            <p>Washington (CNA) â€“ The West Point alumni group planned to give an award to actor Tom Hanks. But they suddenly canceled the award ceremony. This might be because of his political opinions. On this day, US President Trump said that West Point made a smart decision.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Military Academy at West Point announced in May that it would give the 2025 "Sylvanus Thayer Award" to Tom Hanks.</p>
            <p>Trump posted on his social media site, "Truth Social," on this day. He wrote, "Our great West Point (it is getting better and better!) smartly canceled the award ceremony for actor Tom Hanks."</p>
            <p>He also said, "This is an important step! We do not need people with bad, 'woke' ideas to get our valued American awards."</p>
            <p>Also, Trump wrote that he hopes the Oscar awards and other fake award ceremonies will look again at their rules and ways of doing things, for fairness and justice.</p>
            <p>In February of this year, Tom Hanks wore a "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) hat. He acted like a Trump supporter on the TV show "Saturday Night Live" on NBC. He made fun of racism.</p>
            <p>People who support Trump said Tom Hanks was "disgusting." They said he purposely made Trump supporters look bad.</p>

            <h1>About the New Financial Law: Pingtung has a 4.6 Billion Yuan Problem, Says Chou Chun-mi</h1>
            <p>Pingtung County (CNA reporter Li Hui-ting, Pingtung County, on the 8th) â€“ Pingtung County leader Chou Chun-mi posted on Facebook tonight about the new law for dividing money. She said she thought the shared tax money would increase. But she found out it was not true. After adding and taking away three big parts of government help, Pingtung is missing 4.6 billion yuan. She asked for the law to be changed again.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that the Parliament changed parts of the law for dividing money last year. She first thought Pingtung would get more shared tax money. But she said, "the details are tricky, it's really not like that." So, on this day, she went to visit the Executive Yuan again. She wanted to understand how the central government gives money. She also asked for the law to be changed a second time. This is to make sure every local government is treated fairly.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that usually, the central government gives money to local governments in three main ways each year. These are shared tax money, general help money, and special project money. The most important one is shared tax money. After the law change, Pingtung will get 26.4 billion New Taiwan dollars in 2026. This is an increase of 14.1 billion yuan. But if you look at how much it increased, 114%, Pingtung is the last one among the cities and counties that are not the 6 big cities, after islands are not counted.</p>
            <p>Also, the general help money for next year is set at 11.2 billion yuan. This is a decrease of 8 billion yuan. This is the biggest decrease for any city or county not in the 6 big cities. And the special project money is set at 0.6 billion yuan, a decrease of 10.7 billion yuan. This is the second biggest decrease for cities and counties not in the 6 big cities. After adding and taking away these three types of help money, there is a shortage of 4.6 billion yuan.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that after this law change, Taipei City's shared tax money went from 69.7 billion yuan to 114.9 billion yuan. Hsinchu County's money went from 6.8 billion yuan to 24.5 billion yuan. The money for Hualien and Taitung also increased by more than 200%. She asked, "Why is the rule for increasing money so different for each city and county? Will it always be this unfair in the future?"</p>
            <p>"Worry and trouble." Chou Chun-mi said she asked the Executive Yuan to think about how different each city and county's money situation is. She asked them to give more help to fix Pingtung County's money problem. This will let Pingtung County's work go well in 2026, make development fair in the north and south, and make sure Pingtung's building projects do not stop, and that the rights of its people are protected.</p>

            <h1>Keelung City Wants More Money for Keelung MRT; Government Says Money is Limited and Must Be Shared</h1>
            <p>Taipei (CNA reporter Lai Yu-ting, Taipei, on the 8th) â€“ The Keelung City Government said today that the central government's money for the Keelung MRT project is more than 1.1 billion New Taiwan dollars less than they asked for. They hope the central government will give the full amount. A person from the Executive Yuan said that because of the new law about dividing money, Keelung City will get more than 7 billion yuan in shared tax money next year. The money should change with responsibilities. Since the central government has much less money, they must give the limited money to other areas where the difference between cities and countryside has grown bigger.</p>
            <p>The Keelung City Government announced today that the Keelung MRT is a very important building project for Taipei, New Taipei, and Keelung. But the Executive Yuan only approved about 360 million yuan for Keelung City's public building projects next year. This is about 1.11 billion yuan less than the money they asked for. They hope the central government will quickly provide the rest.</p>
            <p>A person from the Executive Yuan said tonight that based on the new law about dividing money, local governments will get 416.5 billion yuan more in shared tax money next year. This is a 90% increase. Keelung City's shared money will increase by more than 7 billion yuan next year, a 120% increase. Taipei City's shared money will also increase by more than 44 billion yuan, a 63% increase. New Taipei City's shared money will increase by more than 40 billion yuan, a 74% increase.</p>
            <p>The person from the Executive Yuan said that money should follow responsibilities. Because the central government's own money has decreased a lot, they must give the limited money to other local governments where the gap between cities and the countryside has become larger. So, they will talk with different city and county governments soon about how to handle responsibilities.</p>
            <p>The central government gives money to local governments mainly in three ways: shared tax money, general help, and special project help. For the shared tax money, the Ministry of Finance recently calculated the amounts for each city and county based on the new law. They told each city and county how much shared tax money they will get next year. Next year, the central government will give 884.09 billion New Taiwan dollars in shared tax money to local governments. This is 416.51 billion yuan more than this year's 467.59 billion yuan, almost a 90% increase. This will be 31% of the central government's income.</p>
