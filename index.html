The increasing influence of artificial intelligence is expected to significantly boost the use of co-packaged optics, which will benefit many chip and component providers, including Broadcom and Nvidia, according to a note from J.P. Morgan to its clients.

Co-packaged optics (CPO) is a new technology that combines optical and electrical parts into one module, aiming to lower power use and costs for AI systems. J.P. Morgan predicts that the CPO market will grow from $10 million in 2023 to $5 billion by 2027.

A J.P. Morgan analyst, Harsh Kumar, noted that Nvidia's data center earnings are projected to rise sharply from $47 billion in 2024 to $160 billion by 2027, mainly due to AI. He also stated that this growth will be more limited by the availability of fast connections rather than the basic computing power.

This indicates that the CPO market will expand rapidly, with Nvidia and Broadcom being the main companies to benefit, as per J.P. Morgan. The bank also mentioned that optical connections will make up over 10% of data center material costs by 2027, up from less than 1% in 2023.

Kumar estimates that about 25% to 30% of Broadcom's networking semiconductor business, which is predicted to reach $20 billion by 2027, will come from CPO-related products, showing a major impact. He added that Broadcom's CPO earnings could reach $5 billion by 2027.

**US Gained Over 1,000 New Millionaires Daily Last Year, Says UBS Report**

According to a report released by UBS and EY on Tuesday, wealth in the United States grew notably fast last year, with over 379,000 people becoming new U.S. dollar millionaires, which averages more than 1,000 new millionaires each day.

The 2024 Global Wealth Report indicates that the total number of millionaires in the U.S. reached 13.2 million, marking a 7.2% increase from 2023.

Globally, the number of millionaires went up by 5.1%, reaching 60.1 million.

Worldwide, wealth per adult also saw a 2.6% increase, reaching $127,143.

North America experienced the most significant wealth growth, adding 1.2 million millionaires last year.

In contrast, Europe's wealth dropped by 1.6% due to high inflation, and its portion of global wealth decreased by over 2% to 26.6%.

In Asia, China's total wealth increased by 2.5% to $95.5 trillion, while India's wealth rose by 11.2% to $15.4 trillion.

Africa's wealth grew by 2.7% to $7.1 trillion, while Latin America's wealth saw a 1.3% decrease to $12.3 trillion.

UBS and EY anticipate that global wealth will grow by 4.2% in 2024, supported by a recovery in stock markets and decreasing interest rates.

**Oil Tankers Near Iran Seemingly in Rural Russia Due to Signal Jamming**

According to a Reuters analysis of shipping data, on Sunday, the Front Tyne oil tanker, while sailing through the Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates, appeared to be in rural Russia, near the city of Krasnodar, over 2,000 km (1,243 miles) away, just after 9:40 a.m.

This particular case is one of at least 50 oil tankers identified by Reuters that have seemingly appeared in Russian waters, mainly close to the southern port of Novorossiysk, even though they were actually in different locations such as the Red Sea, Black Sea, or the Mediterranean.

This event, known as "spoofing," involves sending out a fake location from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), a tool used to prevent ships from colliding at sea.

Lars Lange, the secretary general of BIMCO, the largest global shipping association, stated that "spoofing by commercial vessels is extremely rare and it suggests that whoever is behind these incidents has significant capabilities and is trying to avoid detection."

It is thought that these vessels might be trying to avoid Western sanctions placed on Russia's oil exports following its invasion of Ukraine.

A spokesperson from the U.S. State Department commented, "While we cannot comment on individual cases, we are aware of reports of GPS interference and spoofing and continue to monitor the situation."

The Russian defense ministry and the Kremlin did not immediately respond when asked for a comment.
