            <h1>Good Weather for Mid-Autumn Festival Moon Watching; Cooler Weather Expected in Taiwan in Mid-to-Late October</h1>
            <p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. The weather agency says there will be some rain in the afternoon in central and southern Taiwan. This rain will likely stop in the evening, so most places will have a good chance to see the moon. During the Double Tenth Day holiday, winds will change from northeast to east. This means some areas facing the wind might have short periods of rain. The weather agency also thinks it might get cooler in Taiwan around mid-to-late October, but they need to watch it more closely.</p>
            <p>A weather forecaster, Li Ming-hsiang, said that the rain this afternoon was mostly in the mountains of central Taiwan and in the south. He expects the rain to get lighter in the evening, and the clouds will go away. This will give people a good chance to see the moon everywhere.</p>
            <p>Li Ming-hsiang also said that starting tomorrow, the wind around Taiwan will change to mainly northeast. Areas like Keelung's north coast, Yilan, the mountains of greater Taipei, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have short, local showers. Hualien and Taitung will have a few short showers. Other areas will be mostly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, central and southern Taiwan will have local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>About temperatures, Li Ming-hsiang said the highest temperature today was 38 degrees Celsius in Sanxia District, New Taipei City. Other places like Baoshan Township in Hsinchu County had 36.9 degrees, and Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan were also close to 36 degrees. He predicts that tomorrow, eastern Taiwan will generally have high temperatures of about 31 to 32 degrees, and western Taiwan will be 33 to 35 degrees.</p>
            <p>Li Ming-hsiang pointed out that from October 8th to 10th, the northeast wind will affect the weather. Greater Taipei, Keelung's north coast, eastern Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have short, local showers. Other areas will be mostly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, central and southern Taiwan and other mountain areas will have local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Li Ming-hsiang also mentioned that from October 11th to 13th, the wind will change to east. There will be less moisture. Keelung's north coast, eastern Taiwan, the mountains of greater Taipei, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have a few short showers. Other areas will be mostly cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, central and southern Taiwan and all mountain areas will have local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Li Ming-hsiang said that the area from the South China Sea to the east of the Philippines still has a large low-pressure system. But in the next week, no strong tropical weather systems are expected to form. The Pacific high-pressure system has recently gotten a little weaker. Current information shows that a cold high-pressure system from the north might move south around mid-to-late October. This could make Taiwan cooler, but it's not certain yet, and they need to keep watching.</p>
            <p>Li Ming-hsiang warned that from tomorrow until October 10th, coastal areas from New Taipei to Taichung, as well as Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, will experience very high tides because of the annual king tide. People should be careful about seawater coming inland and local flooding. On October 10th and 11th, Keelung's north coast, eastern Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), the Hengchun Peninsula, and Matsu will have long waves.</p>

            <h1>France's New Government List Causes Anger; Prime Minister Lecornu Unexpectedly Quits</h1>
            <p>France's new Prime Minister, Sebastien Lecornu, resigned today. This happened just a few hours after he announced his new list of government ministers. Both friends and enemies in politics had said they would try to remove his government.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Lecornu's resignation was a surprise and had never happened before. It made France's political problems even worse. After the news came out, the French stock market and the Euro currency both fell sharply.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that around 8 AM Greenwich Mean Time, the CAC 40 index in Paris fell by more than 2%.</p>
            <p>Lecornu was a close friend of French President Emmanuel Macron. He had only started his job on September 9th. He was the seventh Prime Minister during Macron's time as president and the fifth in two years.</p>
            <p>After talking with different political parties for several weeks, Lecornu announced his new list of ministers yesterday. They were supposed to have their first meeting this afternoon.</p>
            <p>France was already in a very serious political crisis. The parliament was very divided, and no single party or group had most of the seats. Lecornu's list of ministers made both his political friends and enemies angry. Some thought the new government was too far to the right, while others said it was not right-wing enough. This made people wonder how long the new government could last.</p>
            <p>Lecornu gave his resignation to President Macron this morning. The Elysee Palace, which is the President's office, said: "Mr. Lecornu has given his resignation for the whole government to the President of the Republic, and the President has accepted it."</p>
            <p>Since Macron was re-elected in 2022, French politics has become more unstable. This is because no party or group has most of the seats in parliament. Last year, Macron decided to have early elections for parliament. But this only made the parliament more divided and made the crisis worse.</p>

            <h1>Rumor: "Manimal" Kenneth Faried Joins PLG Hawks; Team to Give Update on October 8th</h1>
            <p>Kenneth Faried, a former NBA basketball star known as "Manimal" for his amazing strength, is rumored to join the Tainan TSG Hawks in Taiwan's PLG basketball league. The team said that they will give the latest information about their new foreign player on October 8th.</p>
            <p>The P. LEAGUE+ in Taiwan is starting its sixth season. The 2025-2026 season will begin with its first game on October 26th. This season will still have four teams. Among them, Yankee Engineering, based in Hsinchu, is a new team that has joined the league.</p>
            <p>The PLG TSG Hawks team recently posted a picture of a player's outline on their official social media. At that time, fans recognized features like "braided hair" and "jersey number 35." Because of these clues, they guessed it was the former NBA star Kenneth Faried.</p>
            <p>Faried is now 35 years old and is 203 centimeters tall. He was chosen by the Denver Nuggets in the first round as the 22nd pick in 2011. He is a strong inside player who is not very tall. But because of his amazing energy, he still played well in the NBA.</p>
            <p>In the 2013-2014 NBA season, Faried scored an average of 13.7 points and got 8.6 rebounds per game. He also played for the USA team in the FIBA Basketball World Cup.</p>
            <p>Sadly, Faried never really developed a good outside shot. When the NBA started to focus more on three-point shots, he slowly lost his place. After playing 25 games for the Houston Rockets in the 2018-2019 season, he left the NBA. He then played in different leagues around the world to continue his basketball career.</p>
            <p>Today, the Hawks team simply said when asked by the Central News Agency, "We plan to release all new information about our new foreign player this Wednesday. We ask fans to keep supporting the Hawks."</p>
