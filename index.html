**Article 3: Italy Introduces New Visa for Digital Nomads**

Italy has announced a new visa specifically designed for digital nomads, making it easier for remote workers to live and work in the country. The visa, which will be valid for one year and renewable, is aimed at attracting skilled professionals who can contribute to the Italian economy while enjoying the countryâ€™s rich culture and lifestyle. Applicants will need to demonstrate a minimum annual income of â‚¬28,000 and possess health insurance.

It offers a unique opportunity to experience the Italian way of life while working remotely, and it is anticipated to have a positive impact on the country's tourism and economy. The application process is expected to be streamlined and user-friendly, making it accessible to a wide range of potential applicants.
