            <p>Bloomberg says that people who know about the situation shared some information. The European Union (EU) believes that US President Trump will announce official actions this week.

            <p>According to Bloomberg News, these sources also said that the US and EU will likely release a joint statement. This statement will explain the promises that Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made last month. The US will decide the legal details of these actions.</p>
            <p>Based on the agreement between the EU and the US, America will put a 15% tax on most goods coming from the EU. Officials from both sides have said this tax rate will also apply to cars. This new 15% tax will replace the current 25% tax. It will also apply to any future actions for products like medicines and computer chips.</p>

            <h1>Former Employee Detained After Group Trouble at Kaohsiung Hospital</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, there was a fight involving a group of people at Botian Hospital in Kaohsiung. The Kaohsiung police made a special team to investigate. So far, 31 people have come forward. A former employee, Mr. Chen, is believed to be the leader. After questioning, prosecutors asked the court to keep him in custody for crimes like using force. Six people who helped in the disturbance were released on bail, paying between 30,000 to 50,000 NT dollars. The rest were allowed to leave without bail.</p>
            <p>Officers from the Zuoying police station in Kaohsiung said the group fight happened around 3:40 AM yesterday. The police checked many security cameras to find out who was involved. They found Mr. Chen, the main suspect, and many others. The police will continue to look for other people who were involved.</p>
            <p>The Ciaotou District Prosecutors Office said tonight that prosecutor Li Kan-ying led the investigation. The Kaohsiung City Police Departmentâ€™s Criminal Investigation Team and the Zuoying police station are looking into the case. It involves disrupting order, taking away freedom, causing harm, and damaging property at Botian Hospital. They arrested the main leader and those who used force.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors explained that 31 people have been arrested or came in by themselves for this case. After questioning, prosecutors Li Kan-ying, Lin Shih-hsun, Shih Chia-hung, and Liang Yung-chun believe Mr. Chen was the leader. They think he might try to connect with other people involved or witnesses. So, they asked the Ciaotou District Court to keep him in custody without contact. This is for crimes like disturbing order, causing harm, using force, and damaging property. The six people who helped were told to pay bail of 30,000 to 50,000 NT dollars. The others were allowed to leave without bail.</p>
            <p>The head of the Kaohsiung City Police Departmentâ€™s Criminal Investigation Team, Yen Chih-hao, said that Mr. Chen was a former employee of Botian Hospital. The group of people pretended to be security guards. The police will use the evidence to find out the relationship between Mr. Chen and the other people who were there.</p>
            <p>It is understood that Mr. Chen supposedly paid people between 2,000 to 4,000 NT dollars to pretend to be security guards. These people then reportedly went into the hospital, damaged equipment and argued with the hospital's real security guards.</p>

            <h1>Foshan, China: Buy Fever and Joint Pain Medicine with Your ID to Track Chikungunya</h1>
            <p>The Chikungunya disease is spreading more in China. The number of confirmed cases is almost 7,000. To help the government find cases and stop the disease from spreading, officials in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, where the disease started, have made a new rule. From now on, all drugstores in the city must record your name if you buy any of the 47 types of medicine for Chikungunya symptoms, like fever, rash, or joint pain.</p>
            <p>The Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper reported that these 47 medicines include well-known ones in China, like Lianhua Qingwen Capsules and Banlangen. They also have versions for children.</p>
            <p>According to the report, today the Foshan City Market Supervision Administration shared a document on its WeChat official account. The document is called "Notice on Strengthening Registration Management for Key Controlled Medicines Sold by Retail Drugstores During the Epidemic (Chikungunya, called 'Jikongkenya fever' in China) Prevention and Control Period." It talks about the new rules and says they started on August 1st.</p>
            <p>This notice says that all drugstores in Foshan City must follow a strict "registration and reporting system for key controlled medicines" starting from August 1st. This is part of Foshan City's plan to control the disease. The 47 medicines that need ID registration are for treating symptoms of Chikungunya, such as fever, rash, and joint pain.</p>
            <p>The notice also says that when people buy these medicines at drugstores in Foshan City, they need to help the staff with "ID verification by scanning a code." They also need to fill in their personal information. If they have symptoms like fever, rash, or joint pain, or if they have been bitten by mosquitoes recently, they should tell the drugstore staff.</p>
            <p>The notice states that for older people or others who cannot use smartphones or register by themselves, family members should help. Or, drugstore staff should give the necessary help to complete the registration.</p>
            <p>The notice further mentions that all drugstores and related government departments will "strictly follow national laws on protecting personal information." They will keep the information collected from medicine buyers "strictly secret" and only use it "for epidemic prevention and control needs."</p>
            <p>After the Chikungunya disease continued to spread, reaching Macau and Hong Kong, the head of China's National Disease Control and Prevention Administration, Shen Hongbing, went to Foshan on August 2nd. He went to guide the efforts to control Chikungunya. He asked them to try to stop the disease as quickly as possible. This is to make sure people's health is safe and that "social order is stable."</p>
