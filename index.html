            <h1>Trump Warns Iran: New Attacks if Nuclear Work Restarts</h1>
            <p>On July 28, US President Donald Trump warned that if Iran tries to start its nuclear places again, he will order new attacks on them. These places were bombed by the US last month.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump gave this warning to Iran while talking with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Turnberry, Scotland.</p>
            <p>Iran says it will not stop enriching uranium, even though three of its nuclear places were bombed. Iran denies that it wants to make nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters that Iran has been sending "unpleasant signals." He said that any attempt to restart their nuclear program would be destroyed right away.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "We have already destroyed their ability to make nuclear things. They can try to restart, but if they do, we will quickly destroy it before anyone can react."</p>
            <p>Last month, the US launched air attacks on Iran's nuclear places. Washington said these places were part of Iran's plan to make nuclear weapons. Tehran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful uses.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Gaza People Are Very Hungry, Promises Help with Food Centers</h1>
            <p>On July 28, US President Donald Trump warned that people in the Gaza Strip are facing "real hunger." He said the United States and its partners will help set up food centers there.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that aid groups are trying to quickly bring food to Gaza. They are using a time when Israel has stopped its military actions for a short while.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke about the hunger in Gaza after meeting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland. His words were different from what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu had earlier said that worries about hunger in Gaza were just propaganda from the Palestinian group Hamas. Yesterday, he even said, "There is no hunger problem in Gaza."</p>
            <p>Trump said that the US and its partners will help create food centers to help the people of Gaza. UN aid groups have warned that more than 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are in danger of severe hunger and not getting enough food.</p>
            <p>At a press conference with Starmer, Trump told reporters, "We will get some good food there, and we can save many people. I mean, some children are truly hungry."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "Before we do anything else, we must give help because people need it. We must make sure children have food to eat."</p>
