            <h1>Vice President: Young People's Ideas Help Taiwan's Global Connections</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim went to an awards event for a student competition today. She said that a team from Yunlin University made special potato snacks. Guests from Idaho, USA, were very surprised by them. Also, some cloth made with plant dyes from Nuannuan Community in Keelung looked like expensive art to guests. But it was actually just a school project for university students in summer. She hopes that new ideas from Taiwan's farming areas can continue to be seen by the world.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao spoke at the "15th University Student Return to Rural Areas Competition" awards. She said that "returning" is not just coming back. It means bringing new knowledge, skills, and ideas from outside back to farming villages. This helps to bring new energy and creativity, and then people can start new things. So, "returning" is not an end, but a continuing process.</p>
            <p>The Vice President shared that she also went to this event last year. When she walked around the booths, she saw many creative works. She later used some of these as gifts for foreign guests as part of her diplomatic work.</p>
            <p>For example, students from Yunlin University used a 3D printer. They used potatoes to print very special designs. When the governor of Idaho, USA, visited Taiwan, she asked the students and teachers to use the 3D printer. They used both American and Taiwanese potatoes to print the names of Taiwan and Idaho. They made delicious potato snacks. She shared these with the guests and asked them to guess which potato was from Taiwan and which was from America.</p>
            <p>The Vice President also said that last year she saw plant-dyed cloth from the Nuannuan Community in Keelung. The colors were very calming. Later, she asked someone to find two pieces of the cloth. She framed them and hung them in her office. When foreign guests visited, they thought these were very expensive art pieces. But they were actually just summer projects by university students. This shows how appealing the quality was.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said she wants the world to continue seeing Taiwan and the new ideas from Taiwan's farming areas. Taiwan is often known globally for politics or high-tech industries. Many people do not know that the warmest parts of Taiwan are actually in the rural areas.</p>
            <p>She also said that the government wants Taiwan to develop in a balanced way. Besides the important high-tech industries, they hope that technology and artificial intelligence can be used in healthcare, services, finance, and farming. Not long ago, she visited a smart agriculture exhibition. She saw many young people bringing their professional skills from different fields to farming areas. This makes farmers' lives more secure and also increases the value of farming products.</p>
            <p>The Vice President stated that rural development also affects the country's food safety. Rural areas are not just familiar, warm places for older people. They are also places where young people can find hope and future opportunities. Different types of industries and different generations can all find chances in rural areas.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Vice President said that President Lai Ching-te cares a lot about young people. Last week, everyone saw the stock market reach a new high. Also, Taiwan's exports were higher than South Korea's, even though South Korea has twice as many people as Taiwan. This makes people feel that society is developing well. However, not everyone owns stocks, especially young people.</p>
            <p>She said that people might feel that the benefits of economic growth are not always shared equally. Because of this, the "Return to Rural Areas" plan is even more important to bring new ideas to farming areas. The government is also working to reduce the burden on young people. This includes policies like housing subsidies, special low-interest loans for young people, and childcare support. There are also tuition fee subsidies and a "Youth Billion Dream Plan."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Wins Third Place at U18 Baseball World Cup, Beats South Korea</h1>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup happens every two years. The top three teams from the Asian Youth Baseball Championship the year before can join the World Cup.

            <p>In the U18 Baseball World Cup third-place game, Taiwan played a tough game against South Korea. In the top of the fifth inning, Taiwan scored two runs. In the top of the seventh inning, when the score was tied, Chiang Ting-yi hit a good single. This put Taiwan ahead. There was a controversial call by the umpire, but it did not change the game much.

            <h1>U18 Third Place Game Incident: Tseng Sheng-en's Run to Home Plate Was First Out, Then Changed to a Score</h1>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup happens every two years. The top three teams from the Asian Youth Baseball Championship the year before can join the World Cup. Taiwan won the Asian Youth Championship last time, beating Japan. So, they got to play in the U18 World Cup again. In the last three World Cups, Taiwan played in the final game. This year, they hoped to do well again.</p>
            <p>In the U18 Baseball World Cup third-place game, Taiwan played South Korea. In the top of the fifth inning, the Taiwan team scored 2 runs and went ahead. In the bottom of the sixth inning, South Korea tied the score. In the top of the seventh inning, something unexpected happened. Tseng Sheng-en ran to home plate and was first called out. But after looking at the video replay, the umpire changed the call to "obstruction." This meant Tseng Sheng-en scored the run. Taiwan then led South Korea 3 to 2.</p>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup third-place game between Taiwan and South Korea was very close. After six innings, the score was tied 2-2. In the top of the seventh inning, Taiwan was attacking. Chiang Ting-yi hit a single. Tseng Sheng-en ran to home plate and hit the catcher. At first, the umpire said he was out and made a sign to remove Tseng Sheng-en from the game. But after using video replay, the umpire changed the decision. He called it "obstruction" by the catcher, and Tseng Sheng-en's run counted.</p>
