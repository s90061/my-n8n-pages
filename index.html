<p>Good news about trade talks between the US and China made the US stock market go up on June 27. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes reached new high points. Experts say that as the third quarter starts, people should watch how the New Taiwan Dollar getting stronger might affect local companies' money reports. Also, the 90-day break from equal tariffs from the US will end on July 9. How these tariffs are changed and what deals are made with different countries are important things to watch.</p>

<p>US President Trump said on June 29 that he will not extend the 90-day break for equal tariffs for most countries after July 9. He said that if countries haven't made a deal with the US, Washington will tell them that extra taxes will start. Experts pointed out that if these equal tariffs start again, it will cost Taiwanese companies more money. So, people need to pay close attention to what happens with international policies.</p>

<p>On June 27, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 432.43 points, or 1.00%, ending at 43819.27 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 32.05 points, or 0.52%, to 6173.07 points. The Nasdaq index, which has many technology companies, went up by 105.55 points, or 0.52%, to 20273.46 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 3.529 points, or 0.06%, to 5544.988 points.</p>

<p><b>China Uses AI to Boost Face Recognition, Helping Authoritarian Regimes Worldwide</b></p>

<p>A French newspaper, Le Monde, recently reported that more and more countries are using AI to improve face recognition technology. This technology is becoming a tool to watch and silence people who disagree with the government and minority groups. China is helping this by giving money and other benefits to easily share this technology and way of ruling with authoritarian governments all over the world.</p>

<p>Le Monde's in-depth report on June 28, written by three reporters, showed how China, Georgia, and Russia are using AI to make face recognition better. This helps them watch and control their people more closely. For example, in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, people protesting the government have been wearing masks since November 2024 to avoid being seen by new face-recognition cameras installed around the city.</p>

<p>Most of these cameras are near the Parliament building, where the protests happen. Georgia signed a special agreement with China in 2023, and these advanced face-recognition cameras were bought from a Chinese company called Dahua. This company was punished by the US in 2019 for its role in the oppression of the Uyghur people. Russia also uses a lot of this technology, with over a million cameras across the country, half of which are linked to face recognition systems.</p>

<p><b>Weather Expert Wu Der-rong: Today and Tomorrow May Be Hottest of the Year, Two Typhoons Possible This Week</b></p>

<p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that today and tomorrow, temperatures will be a bit higher and feel like a very hot summer. There is a chance that these days could be the hottest of the year. He also mentioned that weather models show tropical storms might form east of the Philippines this week. By the end of the week, two light typhoons could develop, but they are expected to move away to the northeast.</p>

<p>Taiwan's Central Weather Administration has issued a high-temperature warning. It will be very hot across Taiwan. Taipei and New Taipei City are under an orange alert today, meaning temperatures could reach 36 degrees Celsius for a long time. Tainan and Kaohsiung are under a yellow alert, warning of temperatures above 36 degrees. People should use sunscreen and drink plenty of water when outside.</p>

<p>Wu Der-rong, a part-time professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column that the latest European weather model shows tropical storms forming east of the Philippines. Around the end of the week, light typhoons could form north of Guam and south of Okinawa. However, these typhoons are expected to move northeast and away from Taiwan. He said that different weather models still show varied paths, so it's important to keep watching for updates.</p>
