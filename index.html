Delta Electronics, a big company, announced on July 1st that it bought a factory in Guanyin, Taoyuan, from Tayfeng Tire for NT$6.95 billion (about US$224 million). This factory, which includes land and buildings, will be used for new projects like hydrogen energy, energy storage, and data centers.

Delta has been working on hydrogen technology. In early 2024, they partnered with Ceres, a UK hydrogen company, to bring their technology to Taiwan. By the end of last year, Delta started building a special lab in Tainan to test hydrogen production and fuel cells. They hope to produce hydrogen parts and systems in Taiwan by the end of 2026.

Mr. Cheng Ping, the chairman of Delta Electronics, said that reducing carbon is important because of global warming. He believes hydrogen is a key part of the move to clean energy. Hydrogen can be used in many areas like transport, factories, and power grids, helping to lower carbon emissions.

**Taiwan Stock Market Still Moving Up and Down as Tariff Deadline Nears**

On July 1st, the main stock markets in the US had mixed results. An expert said that Taiwan's stock market might go up more because it hasn't risen as much as the US market. However, the market might be unstable because the US tariff grace period ends on July 9th. But experts think the tariffs won't affect the market too much unless they hurt the US economy badly.

In other news, Yageo, a big electronics company, is still trying to buy Shibaura Electronics in Japan. The time for this purchase has been extended to July 15th.

Also, new information shows that in June, the number of homes sold in Taiwan's six biggest cities was 18,095. This is 5.2% more than May, but 24% less than last year. The total sales for the first half of this year are the lowest in eight years.

**Ukraine Says Russia is Helping North Korea Make Drones, Making Korean Situation Worse**

On July 1st, Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, stated that Russia is giving North Korea technology and equipment to build drone factories. This could make the security situation on the Korean Peninsula more difficult. He explained that Russia is not just sending drones, but also the tools and knowledge to make them.

Budanov added that North Korea's military is getting stronger because of their direct cooperation with Russia and the experience gained from battles. He noted that North Korean soldiers are getting real combat experience, which affects the security of the Korean Peninsula. He also confirmed that Russia has sent its "Pantsir-S1" air defense systems to Pyongyang and is training North Korean soldiers to use them.

Furthermore, Budanov said that North Korea plans to send many workers to Russia. These workers will replace Central Asian workers and might even join the war in Ukraine as "volunteers." He also mentioned that some Chinese citizens are helping Russia in their war efforts to gain experience. Russia and North Korea have been increasing their military cooperation since 2024, trading weapons and people.
