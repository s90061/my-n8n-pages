<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia has reportedly secured all production capacity at Wistron's newly opened Taiwan server facility until 2026. This move is to meet the increasing demand for AI servers. According to reports from *Economic Daily*, Nvidia has effectively reserved all future output from this plant.

The facility in Zhubei, Taiwan, which started operations this quarter and was officially opened on June 19, will produce Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. Wistron's CEO confirmed that contracts for AI server production already extend at least a year.

Wistron's operations currently produce an estimated 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter. The company has acknowledged that its current capacity might not be enough to meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has obtained an adjacent building to become a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its output in Taiwan.

AI server shipments are a major growth driver for Wistron, as well as for companies like Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is also expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By booking the full production capacity at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia ensures that its cloud and system partners receive the necessary quantities of AI servers, while competitors face tighter supply. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity shows its strategic goal to dominate the AI hardware market.

**Taiwan is 'of course' a country, president says in rebuke to China**

<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te stated on Sunday that Taiwan is "of course" a country. He argued that China lacks both historical and legal evidence to support its claims of sovereignty over the island, strongly rejecting Beijing's increasing political and military pressure.

China views democratically-governed Taiwan as "sacred" Chinese territory, asserting it has belonged to China since ancient times and is merely one of its provinces, with no right to be called a state.

President Lai and his administration firmly reject this perspective and have repeatedly offered talks with China, which have been declined. China labels Lai a "separatist."

In the first of a series of ten speeches titled "uniting the country," Lai discussed Taiwan's history, including the ancient connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesian groups, such as native Hawaiians. He used this to illustrate what he believes is Taiwan's distinct development separate from China.

He added that the people of Taiwan have a history of resisting invasion, citing uprisings against Japan's colonial rule from 1895-1945. Furthermore, under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for a mere eight years.

"Of course, Taiwan is a country," Lai declared during a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, also highlighting its presidential elections. "But China insists that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of business hours. China maintains that the 1971 United Nations resolution, which removed Taipei's seat and gave it to Beijing, serves as one of the legal foundations for its claims.

Lai, who in March referred to China as a "hostile foreign force," asserted that Beijing's claim about the U.N. resolution being related to Taiwan's sovereignty was "totally wrong," as the resolution only addressed which government was represented at the organization.

Lai also emphasized that China's threat to Taiwan is real, pointing to Beijing's daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he asked, receiving applause.

The defeated Republic of China government retreated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war to Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

**US added over 1,000 new millionaires a day last year, UBS report says**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-added-over-1-000-090239309.html">News Link</a>

ZURICH (Reuters) - Wealth grew at an exceptionally fast rate last year in the United States, where more than 379,000 individuals became new U.S. dollar millionaires. This amounts to over a thousand new millionaires every day, according to a report released on Tuesday.

This increase accounts for 60% of the worldwide growth in millionaires, showing the significant impact of the U.S. market. The annual "Global Wealth Report" by UBS, in collaboration with Credit Suisse, also revealed a surprising rise in average global wealth per adult. It recovered to record levels after experiencing a decline the previous year due to inflation and rising interest rates.

Global wealth reached $629 trillion by the end of 2024, showing a 3% increase. Switzerland and the Netherlands also saw strong growth in wealth. However, outside the U.S., millionaires increased most rapidly in Switzerland, with 103,400 new ones, and in Japan, with 94,600 new millionaires.

The report also noted a significant increase in the number of individuals with "ultra-high net worth" (UHNW), defined as those with assets exceeding $50 million. The U.S. gained 28,300 new UHNW individuals, followed by China with 10,700 and Germany with 6,800.

The authors expect global wealth to continue to grow, predicting an 18% rise over the next five years to reach $806 trillion by 2029. This growth is expected to be driven by falling interest rates and the expansion of the artificial intelligence sector, particularly in developed countries.

However, the wealth gap remains a concern. The richest 1% of the world's population now controls 45.8% of all personal wealth, an increase from 44.5% in 2023.
