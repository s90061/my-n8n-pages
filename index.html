            <h1>Taiwan President's Transit: US State Department Reaffirms Position in Line with Practice</h1>
            <p>A recent report said that the United States might change its usual practice of letting Taiwan's president pass through the US. This was because a meeting between the US and China was being planned. Today, a spokesperson for the US State Department said again that Taiwan's president passing through the US follows the usual practice and a long-standing policy.</p>
            <p>Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the US State Department, answered questions from the media this afternoon. She said that when high-level officials from Taiwan, like the president, pass through the US, it is a usual practice. It also completely follows their consistent policy. These visits consider the visitor's safety, comfort, ease, and respect.</p>
            <p>United News Network recently quoted sources who said that President Lai plans to visit friendly countries in Central and South America in August. His trip will include stops in New York and Dallas, Texas, in the United States. The president will visit three countries that have diplomatic ties with Taiwan: Paraguay, Guatemala, and Belize.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's representative office in the US said that they do not have any information to share right now. If there are clear plans later, the Presidential Office will announce them when it is time.</p>

            <h1>US Policy Adjustment: Rubio Asks State Department to Stop Commenting on Other Countries' Elections</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported today that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has sent out new instructions. These instructions tell State Department staff to stop publicly commenting on other countries' elections. They can only comment if it clearly helps the United States' foreign policy. For many decades, US officials regularly commented on or congratulated other countries on their election results. This new memo will change the State Department's long-term way of doing things.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent a signed memo. It tells State Department staff to stop publicly talking about other countries' elections right away. They should only do this if there is a clear and strong reason that helps US foreign policy.</p>
            <p>For many decades, the US government often publicly looked at and criticized election processes and results in other countries. They did this to help countries have fair elections. Rubio's new instructions are very different from what the US has done in the past.</p>
            <p>The new instructions from Rubio highlight that "the US government cares about a country's right to govern itself." This clearly uses the idea from the Donald Trump government that "the US has wrongly interfered in other countries' affairs in recent decades."</p>
            <p>The instructions say that information given out about other countries' elections should focus on congratulating the winners. It should avoid giving opinions on whether the election process was fair, legal, or about other countries' democratic values.</p>
            <p>The State Department replied to the report. They said that the US will stick to its democratic values. When other countries choose the same path, the US will also celebrate those values. President Trump has clearly stated that the US will work with countries that help its national goals.</p>
            <p>In the past, the White House and the State Department regularly gave statements or comments about other countries' election results. This was to help countries have free and fair votes, make the world more democratic, and isolate countries with strict governments that controlled elections. However, the State Department sometimes avoided publicly criticizing allied countries for unfair elections.</p>
            <p>Current and former US diplomats said that the US way of looking at other countries' elections greatly affects smaller and developing countries. In these countries, opposition groups and human rights groups see US statements as a way to put pressure on their governments.</p>
            <p>The US State Department also checks if other countries have fair and free elections. This check affects plans for punishments against groups or forces that interfere with elections.</p>
            <p>Nicole Widdersheim, the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch's Washington office, criticized the new rules. She said that limiting US embassies and consulates from checking and finding facts will stop the US government from truly understanding the leaders of these countries.</p>
