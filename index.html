**US Congress Report Finds "Unforgivable" Failures by Secret Service in Trump Assassination Attempt**

A report from the US Congress released today criticized the Secret Service for "unforgivable" mistakes during an attempt to kill former President Donald Trump a year ago. The incident happened on July 13 last year in Pennsylvania. A gunman shot at Trump, and the bullet went past his ear. One person died and two were hurt. The gunman, Thomas Crooks, was killed by a government sniper.

The Senate Committee said that the punishments for these mistakes have not been strong enough. The report noted many "preventable errors" by the Secret Service that almost led to Trump's death. Senator Rand Paul pointed out that the Secret Service did not use important information and did not work well with local police. He also said that no one was fired because of these failures. He called it a problem with how the organization works, showing a lack of clear rules and not acting on threats.

**Trump to Make Big Statement on Russia; NATO Head to Visit Washington**

NATO announced that its Secretary General, Mark Rutte, will travel to Washington in the next two days. He plans to meet with US President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. NATO did not say why Rutte is visiting.

However, President Trump recently told NBC News that the United States is willing to send weapons to Ukraine through NATO. He also said that he will make a "major statement" about Russia tomorrow. So far, the weapons sent to Ukraine by the Trump government were approved by the previous Biden administration, which strongly supported Ukraine.
