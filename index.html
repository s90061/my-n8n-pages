            <h1>Taishan Asks Jiekou to Return 3.6 Billion Dollars; Second Trial for Case Starts Today, Continues on Sept 1</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 28 (CNA) - A new team leading the company Taishan wants nearly 3.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars back from Jiekou Fintech. Taishan won the first court case. Today, the second court case started. Jiekou said the first court's decision was wrong and should be canceled. The judge said there are many questions about whether Jiekou, which received the money, must give it back. The court will continue to hear the case on September 1.</p>
            <p>On May 5, 2023, the old team running Taishan company had a meeting. They decided to buy 40.39% of Jiekou Fintech, the company that owns Jiekou Electronic Payment, for 3.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The new team says that this decision by the old board was against the law and not valid. They also say that the agreement signed by the old representative, Zhan Jingchao, with Jiekou Fintech is not valid for Taishan.</p>
            <p>On August 30, 2023, Taishan sued Jiekou Fintech to get back around 3.5958 billion New Taiwan Dollars. In May this year, the Taipei District Court decided that Taishan was right. Jiekou Fintech must give back all the money plus 5% interest each year. If Taishan gives 1.1986 billion New Taiwan Dollars as a guarantee, they can start to get the money back early.</p>
            <p>After that, Taishan gave more than 1.1 billion New Taiwan Dollars to the Taipei District Court as a guarantee. They asked to take money from Jiekou Fintech's bank accounts. But they could not do that. So, they asked to take Jiekou Fintech's other properties instead. On the 10th, an officer from the Taipei District Court came to seal Jiekou Fintech's properties.</p>
            <p>Jiekou Fintech did not agree with the first court's decision, so they appealed. The Taiwan High Court is hearing the second case. Today was the first time they met in court.</p>
            <p>Jiekou Fintech's lawyer said that the first court's decision had big mistakes. They asked for the decision to be canceled and for a new trial. The lawyer also said that during the first trial, they tried to use a "set-off" defense, but the court did not clearly explain why they did not accept it. They hope the court can finish the case soon.</p>
            <p>Taishan's lawyer said that Jiekou received the money for Dorian company. If they could not finish the necessary steps with the Investment Commission after getting the money, they should give it back to Taishan. Since these steps were not finished, Jiekou has to give the money back. Jiekou was holding this money for both sides. Where the money goes depends on whether the Investment Commission's steps are completed. Even though Jiekou mentioned a "set-off" before, they have not used that defense for a year and a half.</p>
            <p>The judge said that this case is about how Taishan discussed and signed two agreements: a "share purchase agreement" and a "new share subscription agreement." The judge asked both sides to explain this in a table and include any proof.</p>
            <p>The judge also pointed out some important questions: how Taishan's board made decisions about the two agreements (including how the meetings were held and if the decisions were valid), if the old representative Zhan Jingchao had limits on his power, if Jiekou was an honest party in the deal, and what the legal situation is for Jiekou receiving the money and who should return it. The judge asked both sides to prepare their information. The trial will continue on September 1 at 4:00 PM. (Editor: Li Xizhang) July 28, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Many Villages in Yunlin County Flooded; Chiang Wan-an Calls to Show Concern and Offers Help</h1>
            <p>Yunlin County, July 28 (CNA) - Because of a low-pressure area and southwest winds, Yunlin County had over 300 millimeters of rain by 11 AM. The Beigang area is badly flooded, and many villages are under water. Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Li-shan visited the area today and said that Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an called to show his concern and said he is willing to help.</p>
            <p>The weather office sent out a heavy rain warning. Because of a low-pressure area and southwest winds, there will likely be strong, short rains. Today, Yunlin, Chiayi County, Chiayi City, and Tainan will have local heavy or very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Many villages in Shuilin Township are under water. Today, Chang Li-shan went to see the damage in Niaosong Village, Songbei Village, and Beichen Elementary School in Shuilin Township. She was with the acting head of Shuilin Township, Chang Tung-kai, and the director of the Water Resources Department, Hsu Hung-po. She told the related departments to fully help with draining the water and fixing things. Some homes were flooded. People living there lifted all their things inside their houses to lose less money.</p>
            <p>Chang Li-shan said that the Niaosong area in Shuilin Township had over 300 millimeters of rain from midnight until 11 AM. A lot of rain in a short time, plus the ground sinking over time, made the drainage system very full and caused serious flooding.</p>
            <p>Chang Li-shan asked the county government to use all its efforts to put many pumps in areas that often flood. They also quickly sent their own machines from within the county to help. Chang Li-shan also said that Chiang Wan-an called specially to show concern and said he would help if Yunlin County did not have enough equipment.</p>
            <p>Hsu Hung-po said that according to Chen Kuo-yuan, the head of Songbei Village, it started raining at 12 AM today. The heaviest rain was from 3 AM to 7 AM. In just that time, over 200 millimeters of rain fell. By 11 AM, the total was over 300 millimeters. This is a very strong rain level, much more than the flood protection rules. So, flooding was expected.</p>
            <p>Because of the very heavy rain, Yunlin County's disaster response center is now at level two. Related departments are closely watching the water levels and rain, and they are ready to act at any time. (Editor: Li Shuhua) July 28, 2025.</p>
