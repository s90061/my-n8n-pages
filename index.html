            <h1>Trump Says He Might Visit China Soon, Threatens High Taxes on Chinese Goods</h1>
            <p>Today, U.S. President Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House. Trump said he might visit China this year or soon after. He also threatened to put a 200% tax on Chinese goods if China does not give rare earth magnets to the United States.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump said, "I think I will go to South Korea soon for trade talks." He also said he would be happy to go to the APEC summit in South Korea. The APEC leaders' meeting is planned for October 31st in Gyeongju, South Korea.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that he might visit China this year or soon. He said, "We will have a good relationship with China." President Lee Jae-myung also said he wants to visit China with Trump.</p>
            <p>Trump also said that Chinese students will be allowed to come to the U.S. He stated, "We will get along well with China." In May, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the U.S. would strongly cancel visas for Chinese students and make the checking process stronger.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the U.S. and China had an agreement before to stop putting very high taxes on each other's goods. But Trump said today that if China does not keep its promises, the U.S. might raise taxes again.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump threatened to put a 200% tax on Chinese goods if China does not send more rare earth magnets to the U.S.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "They must give us magnets. If they do not give magnets, then we will have to put about a 200% tax on them."</p>
            <p>He also added, "But I think we will not have any problems."</p>
