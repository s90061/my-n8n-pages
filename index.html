            <h1>Former French President Sarkozy Sentenced to 5 Years, Reportedly to Begin Prison Term on Oct 21</h1>
            <p>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was sentenced last month to five years in prison. This was for a crime called criminal conspiracy. News sources told AFP today that Sarkozy will go to prison in Paris starting October 21.</p>
            <p>Sarkozy is 70 years old. He will be the first French leader to go to prison after World War II. He will also be the first former head of state in the European Union to serve time in prison. It is said that he will be in La Sante prison in Paris.</p>
            <p>Sarkozy was President of France from 2007 to 2012. He was found guilty at the end of September. This was because the late Libyan leader Moamer Kadhafi helped pay for Sarkozy's election campaign in 2007.</p>
            <p>To keep him safe in prison, officials plan to make security stronger. Sarkozy might be put in a cell for prisoners who need special protection, or he might be kept alone.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, he went to the financial prosecutor's office in Paris. He learned about the details of going to prison.</p>
            <p>An AFP reporter said he arrived in a car with tinted windows. He left after about 45 minutes and did not say anything. Later, an AFP photographer saw him go back to his home.</p>
            <p>Sarkozy has said he is innocent of the charges. He has appealed the court's decision.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Regional Leaders Sign Gaza Declaration, Calls it a Great Day for the Middle East</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today was "a great day for the Middle East." He signed a statement with leaders from many countries in the area. This statement helps make the ceasefire in Gaza stronger. This happened hours after Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas traded hostages and prisoners.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump made a quick visit to Israel. He spoke in their parliament and praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After that, he flew to Egypt for a meeting about Gaza. There, he signed the statement with leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. These countries will help make sure the Gaza agreement is kept.</p>
            <p>More than 20 world leaders met in Sharm el-Sheikh, a resort town. Trump said, "Today is a great day for the world, and an even greater day for the Middle East."</p>
            <p>Before signing the statement, Trump said, "This document will list rules, regulations, and many other things." He said two times that "this agreement will continue to be valid."</p>
            <p>Hamas released the last 20 hostages today. They had been held in Gaza for two years. This was part of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza. In return, the Israeli prison service said Israel released 1,968 prisoners. Most of these prisoners were Palestinians.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to members of the Israeli parliament. He said, "From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a country at war. It has carried a heavy burden that only a proud and strong people can carry." When he arrived at the Israeli parliament, the people there stood up and clapped for a long time.</p>
            <p>He also said, "For many families in this land, they have not had a truly peaceful day for many years. This long and painful nightmare is finally over, not only for Israelis but also for Palestinians and many others."</p>

            <h1>China Plays the Rare Earth Card Again; US Treasury Secretary Bessent Analyzes 3 Possible Reasons</h1>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that China has put new controls on rare earth exports. He thinks there are three possible reasons for this. First, China's economy is not doing well. Second, China may not like that the US is working for peace in the world. Third, it could be a plan before the leaders of both countries meet. Bessent believes this is a mistake, and both sides are still talking.</p>
            <p>On October 9, China announced stronger rules for rare earth materials. After this, US President Donald Trump wrote online that the US would add a 100% tax on goods from China and add other limits. The leaders of both countries might meet in Korea at the end of this month. This new trade issue between the US and China adds uncertainty to their meeting.</p>
            <p>Bessent spoke on Fox Business Network's morning news show. He said there are many reasons. The first is that China's economy is not strong, so they might be focusing on economic problems.</p>
            <p>The second reason is that China is against the US, which is working for peace around the world. China helps pay for wars, buys oil from Russia, and provides resources for war machines. The US has also asked China to stop buying oil from Iran. Maybe these things have had an effect.</p>
            <p>The third reason is that China might have made a bad decision before the two leaders meet in Korea at the end of October. Trying to play games before a formal meeting with Trump is a bad idea. On October 10, Trump changed the situation with a social media post, introducing new taxes and necessary bans on China.</p>
            <p>He also said, "This is a miscalculation. The US is still talking, and we are confident that we can move forward."</p>
            <p>The show's host, Maria Bartiromo, asked if Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping would still meet. She also asked if new taxes and other bans would start on November 1 after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Bessent replied that this was a message from Trump. Trump wrote on his social media that they could delay it. This gives both sides time to meet and talk. Trump and Xi have a good personal relationship. Bessent believes Trump thinks this decision might have come from lower-level officials in China.</p>
            <p>He also explained that there are different groups within the Chinese government. So, this decision might not have come from Xi Jinping himself. It could be from a group of hardliners. There are also hardline people in China who want to harm the relationship between the two countries.</p>
