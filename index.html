            <h1>A bite costs 180 million NT dollars. A banana art piece is eaten again.</h1>
            <p>A visitor bit a banana that was taped to a wall. This banana was an art piece and was worth about 180 million New Taiwan dollars. This happened last week at the Pompidou Centre-Metz in eastern France. This is not the first time this art piece has been eaten.</p>
            <p>This art piece is by an Italian artist named Maurizio Cattelan. It is called "Comedian." He taped a banana to a wall. Last year, it was sold in New York, USA, for 6.2 million US dollars, which is about 182 million New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Cattelan said he was sad that the visitor did not eat the banana peel and the tape too.</p>
            <p>The Pompidou Centre-Metz said that after the visitor ate the art piece on July 12, "security quickly and calmly stepped in." The art piece was "put back up in a few minutes."</p>
            <p>The museum added, "Because bananas spoil easily, we change them regularly as the artist told us to."</p>
            <p>Cattelan said the person who ate the banana "confused the fruit with the art piece." He said this because the person "only ate the banana itself, not the peel and the tape."</p>
            <p>"Comedian" has been eaten before. The first time it was shown was in 2019 at the Art Basel show in Miami Beach, USA. A performance artist named David Datuna ate it then. He said he was "hungry."</p>
            <p>Last year, Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency businessman from China, bought this art piece for 6.2 million US dollars. He also ate the banana in front of cameras.</p>
            <p>When Cattelan first showed this art piece, it caused many discussions. Cattelan said that "Comedian" is a comment on the art market. In the past, he said that the art market is too focused on making money quickly and does not help artists enough.</p>
            <p>The "New York Post" in the USA said that in 2019, "Comedian" cost 120,000 US dollars, which is about 3.53 million New Taiwan dollars. This showed that the art market was "crazy" (like the slang word "banana").</p>
            <p>Besides "Comedian," Cattelan is also known for another art piece called "America." This is a working toilet made of 18-karat gold. During Donald Trump's first time as US President, the museum that owns it offered to lend it to the White House.</p>

            <h1>Singapore names hacker group for cyberattacks. China says it is not involved.</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Home Affairs Minister, K. Shanmugam, said that cyberattacks have increased in recent years. One of the groups is a hacker group called UNC3886. He said Singapore will keep making its cyber defenses stronger. A cybersecurity company believes this group is linked to China. China has said it is not involved.</p>
            <p>News outlets like Lianhe Zaobao reported that Singapore's Cyber Security Agency celebrated its 10th anniversary. Minister Shanmugam, who is also the Minister for National Security Coordination, spoke at the dinner. He talked about the cybersecurity threats Singapore is facing now.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said that serious cyberattacks in Singapore increased more than four times from 2021 to 2024. The government found earlier that international hacker groups tried to get into some important basic systems. One group that did such attacks in the past was the hacker group called UNC3886. "The goals of this group are very clear. They target important places with high value, like important systems that provide necessary services," Shanmugam said. The Singapore government will continue to make its cyber defense stronger, focusing on stopping and preventing threats.</p>
            <p>Lianhe Zaobao said that Shanmugam talked to the media today after a community event. When asked about naming a specific hacker group, he said that the authorities decided it was necessary to let Singaporeans know about the cyber threats they are facing. "The number of incidents we tell people about is much less than the actual number of attacks. For reasons of national security or public interest, we do not share all incidents," he said.</p>
            <p>Mandiant, a cybersecurity company owned by Google, says UNC3886 is a spy group linked to China. This group has attacked defense, technology, and telecommunications organizations in the USA and Asia.</p>
            <p>According to Lianhe Zaobao, China's state media, CCTV.com, quoted a spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy in Singapore. The spokesperson said that Singaporean news reported Singapore was attacked by a hacker group, and a cybersecurity company from another country said that the UNC3886 group mentioned was linked to China. China "strongly opposes any false accusations against China."</p>

            <h1>Taipei City University and United Hospital explain they were not involved in the National Taiwan Normal University women's football blood test case.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 19 (CNA) - The coach of the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team, Chou Tai-ying, reportedly threatened players with lower grades if they did not agree to blood tests for a research study. One professor from Taipei City University and one doctor from Taipei City Hospital were also said to be involved. Taipei City University stated today that this is not true. Taipei City Hospital said the doctor did not actually take part in or carry out this research.</p>
            <p>The NTNU women's football blood test case has been a big topic in society for several days. Media reports said that besides coach Chou Tai-ying, who is now facing criticism, the research team also included a professor from University of Taipei and a doctor from Taipei City Hospital Renai Branch.</p>
            <p>Taipei City University said today that the media reports are not correct. The professor was not a co-leader of the research project and did not help carry it out.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Hospital Renai Branch explained that the doctor's name was listed as a co-leader because of their professional background, which could offer advice to the research team. However, their involvement was only to give professional advice related to their field. After looking into it, it was found that this doctor did not actually help design the research, collect information, or do the work. They also did not give any advice or further help.</p>
