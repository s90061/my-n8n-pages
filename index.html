            <h1>Brazil Faces High US Tariffs, Seeks New Export Opportunities with China</h1>
            <p>Because the United States is putting high taxes (tariffs) of up to 50% on some goods from Brazil, the Brazilian government and businesses are actively looking to China as a new market for their products. China is very willing to work more closely with Brazil, especially in areas like food, energy, and raw materials for industry.</p>
            <p>CNN Brazil News reported what Thomas Law, the head of the "Brazil-China Social and Cultural Research Center" (Ibrachina), said. He mentioned that China wants to build many different supply chains with countries that have stable and good diplomatic relations. This makes Brazil an important partner. China has already started buying products from Brazil that it used to buy from the US, which shows a change in trade focus.</p>
            <p>Brazil mostly sells farm products and raw materials to China, but it sells more advanced industrial goods to the US. Mr. Law believes that selling industrial goods to China will be difficult. However, there are more and more talks and meetings between the two countries, which shows possible chances for growth.</p>
            <p>Recently, China allowed 183 Brazilian companies to sell coffee to them. They also added more types of sesame and animal powders they would buy. These actions show that China is actively opening its market to Brazil and giving real chances to Brazilian exporters.</p>
            <p>Victor Queiroz, who manages the Asia-Pacific region for Brazil's Export and Investment Promotion Agency (ApexBrasil), said that China is interested in many areas, including computer chips, fruit juices, frozen foods, transportation, clean energy, sustainable airplane fuel, and medicine. His agency has made a map showing over 400 products that Brazil can sell to China.</p>
            <p>Fagner Santos, an analyst from the Brazilian consulting company JF Comex, stressed that the high tariffs from the US are not going away, and it is very risky to depend too much on the US market. He said now is the right time for small and medium-sized Brazilian businesses to take this chance. Companies should try hard to enter the Chinese market, visit China, meet people, and plan their business steps carefully.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu is Coming: Wu Derong Warns Eastern and Southern Taiwan to Prepare for Damaging Rain</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 12 (CNA) Typhoon Yangliu is getting closer to Taiwan. Weather expert Wu Derong said today that eastern and southern Taiwan should get ready for a lot of rain that could cause damage. He also warned that Hualien and Taitung should prepare for very strong winds.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, who is an assistant professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote in his "Classroom for Revealing Heavenly Secrets" column for the Meteorological Applications Promotion Foundation. He said that Yangliu will hit Taiwan tomorrow. Eastern and southern Taiwan need to be careful of heavy rain that can cause harm. Hualien and Taitung need to be very careful of "damaging" strong winds near the typhoon's center.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong said that the newest path map from the Central Weather Administration and the average path from the latest European weather models both show that Yangliu will land in Taitung tomorrow at noon. Then, it will land in Fujian, China, early on August 14. Before it lands, its strength is expected to stay as a medium typhoon. After it lands, the mountains will make it quickly lose strength.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong stated that areas near where the typhoon lands will definitely have very strong, damaging winds from the typhoon's center. Therefore, both Hualien and Taitung should be extra careful. The Weather Administration's "Quantitative Rainfall Forecast" shows that eastern and southern Taiwan should both be very careful of heavy rain that could cause damage.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration issued a sea warning for medium Typhoon Yangliu at 5:30 AM today. They told people living along the coast of Keelung's north coast, eastern Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula to be careful of large waves.</p>

            <p>He also said, "Injured workers have been taken to local hospitals for treatment. Search and rescue work is still happening at the factory."</p>
            <p>Allegheny County police posted on Facebook: "Officials can now confirm that one person has died because of this event."</p>
            <p>John Fetterman, a US Senator from Pennsylvania, also posted on X that "dozens" of people were hurt.</p>
            <p>Some US news reports said that there are still people stuck under the broken parts of the factory. U.S. Steel has not yet answered AFP's request for comments.</p>
