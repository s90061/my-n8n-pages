            <h1>Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba wants faster talks on trade taxes; US Finance Minister says a good deal will happen.</h1>
            <p>Scott Bessent, the US Finance Minister, is in Japan for the "US Day" event at the Osaka-Kansai Expo. Today, he met with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Regarding trade talks between Japan and the US about taxes on goods, Mr. Bessent said, "A good agreement will definitely be reached."</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent will go to the "US Day" event at the 2025 World Expo (Osaka-Kansai Expo) on July 19th.</p>
            <p>The Nikkei newspaper reported that Mr. Ishiba met with Mr. Bessent for more than 30 minutes at the Prime Minister's office today at 5:30 PM (4:30 PM Taiwan time). Japan's Minister for Economic Revitalization, Akazawa Ryosei, who handles tax talks with the US, was also there. Mr. Bessent is the US Finance Minister who handles tax talks with Japan.</p>
            <p>During their meeting, Mr. Ishiba and Mr. Bessent confirmed that Japan and the US will make their relationship stronger in areas like the economy and safety. Also, about the Japan-US tax talks, Mr. Ishiba hopes that Mr. Bessent and Mr. Akazawa will keep talking closely to reach an agreement that is good for both Japan and the US.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba also said that Japan will make its defense stronger by itself to keep peace and safety.</p>
            <p>In response to what Mr. Ishiba said, Mr. Bessent replied, "A good agreement will definitely be reached."</p>
            <p>On July 7th, US President Donald Trump announced that the US will start adding a 25% tax on goods imported from Japan from August 1st. The Japanese government hopes to talk with the US at different levels to find a solution.</p>
            <p>However, sources from the Japanese government said that Mr. Bessent's visit to Japan this time is as part of the US team for the Osaka Expo. He did not plan to have official talks with Japanese ministers.</p>
            <p>For the Japan-US tax talks, Japan's idea is to invest a lot in the US and buy more American goods. This would help to lower the US trade imbalance. The US government is still carefully looking at Japan's idea. The Japanese government is thinking about sending Mr. Akazawa to the US again soon, hoping to make progress in the tax talks.</p>
            <p>After his meeting with Mr. Bessent, Mr. Ishiba told the media, "During the meeting, I said that safety in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia are all connected. Japan and the US should work together more. In terms of economic safety, there are also many areas where Japan and the US should work together."</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba said, "In the meeting, I hoped that Mr. Bessent would continue to talk closely with Minister Akazawa to reach an agreement that is good for both Japan and the US. About a meeting with President Trump, the date is not decided yet. But it is important for our country's interests, so there will surely be a chance to talk directly with President Trump. We will decide based on how the talks go in the future."</p>
            <p>After the meeting between Mr. Ishiba and Mr. Bessent, Mr. Akazawa told the media, "The meeting was friendly. Japan and the US understood each other better, and we hope to have more talks. The meeting also included important political topics."</p>

            <h1>US official worries China will use AI for military, wants to stop Nvidia H20 chips from being sold to China.</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 18th â€“ The head of the US House of Representatives committee about competition with the Chinese Communist Party, John Moolenaar, wrote a letter today to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. He asked the government not to allow the sale of Nvidia H20 computer chips to China again.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Mr. Moolenaar wrote to Mr. Lutnick: "The Department of Commerce made the right choice before when it stopped the H20 chips from being sold to China."</p>
            <p>Mr. Moolenaar said, "We must not let the Chinese Communist Party use American chips to train AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems. These systems could make their military stronger, limit their people's freedom, and make American new ideas weaker."</p>
            <p>After this news was shared, Nvidia's stock price went down, according to Reuters. The US Department of Commerce and Nvidia did not immediately say anything about this.</p>

            <h1>EU approves new rules, lowers price cap on Russian oil exports.</h1>
            <p>Brussels, July 18th â€“ Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine has been going on for more than three years. Today, countries in the European Union (EU) agreed to their 18th set of financial punishments against Russia since the war started. They hope to put more pressure on the Kremlin by lowering the highest price allowed for Russian oil exports.</p>
            <p>Kaja Kallas, a high-level EU official for foreign affairs and safety, said: "The EU has just approved one of the toughest plans to punish Russia so far."</p>
            <p>This price limit was started by the Group of Seven (G7) big industrial countries. Its goal is to limit how much money Russia makes from selling oil to countries like China and India.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the G7 set the highest price for Russian oil exports at $60 per barrel. With the EU's new plan, the new highest price is lowered to $47.60 per barrel. This price can be changed later if oil prices change. The EU hopes that other G7 countries, like the UK and Canada, will join this new plan.</p>
            <p>EU officials also said that the EU has put over 100 oil tankers on a list of banned ships. These tankers belong to Russia's "shadow fleet" which Russia uses to get around the oil export limits.</p>
            <p>The EU will also take steps to stop the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea from being used again in the future.</p>
