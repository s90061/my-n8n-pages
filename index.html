A palliative care doctor in Germany, known as "Doctor Death," is on trial for allegedly killing 15 patients with lethal injections between September 2021 and July 2024. He is accused of giving patients a mix of anesthetics and muscle relaxants without their permission, causing them to stop breathing and die quickly. The victims were aged 25 to 94. In five cases, the doctor also allegedly set fire to the victims' homes to hide his crimes. Police started investigating last July after colleagues became suspicious when several of his patients died in fires. Prosecutors believe the 15 murders might be "just the tip of the iceberg," as 96 other cases, including the death of his mother-in-law, are still being investigated. Prosecutors say his only reason was to kill.

**Taiwan's Ministry of Environment Releases New Carbon Reporting Guidelines**

Taiwan's Ministry of Environment announced new guidelines today for counting greenhouse gas emissions for four types of businesses: services, transport, hospitals, and universities. These guidelines will help businesses that were recently added to the list of those required to report their carbon emissions. The ministry will hold meetings to explain the new rules and plans a trial period for reporting in September. These new rules apply to businesses that use a lot of electricity or fossil fuels and are expected to emit between 10,000 and 25,000 tons of greenhouse gases. The ministry has also created an easy-to-use tool to help businesses estimate their emissions and is working with Taipower to allow businesses to check their electricity use directly on the platform.

**Korean Medical Students to Return to Classes After 17-Month Boycott**

Thousands of medical students in South Korea will return to classes, ending a 17-month boycott. This decision helps to resolve part of a big disagreement that also included a strike by young doctors. The conflict started last year when then-President Yoon Suk-yeol tried to greatly increase the number of students accepted into medical schools to solve a shortage of doctors in an aging society. This led to protests, with resident doctors leaving their jobs and medical students boycotting classes, causing many surgeries to be cancelled and medical services to be disrupted nationwide. The number of new student places was later reduced, and after the president was impeached for a short period of martial law, the government froze new admissions in March 2025. About 8,300 students are expected to return, but the exact schedule is not yet known. However, around 12,000 resident doctors are still on strike and have not returned to work.
