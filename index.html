            <h1>Ministry of Health and Welfare: We will investigate if a medical organization is involved in the NTNU women's soccer team blood drawing case.</h1>
            <p>(Taipei News) The case of blood drawing from the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's soccer team continues to be discussed. Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai said that he has asked the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) and other groups to find out who is responsible for these actions. He also asked them to take good care of the students who were affected. Deputy Minister of Health and Welfare, Lin Ching-yi, said that if the investigation shows that a medical organization was involved, the MOHW will get involved if needed.</p>
            <p>Last November, Chen Pei-yu, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), made this issue public. Yesterday, she and other DPP legislators, along with some affected students, spoke out. They said that a teacher from the NTNU women's soccer team threatened students by making them draw blood to get course credits. This might be a crime called "coercion" under the criminal law. Also, the money given to students for being part of the study had to be paid back to the team's public fund. This might be a crime called "embezzlement." It also seems to go against rules for human trials.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai attended the Ministry of Labor's National Skills Competition. When reporters asked him about the NTNU women's soccer team blood drawing issue, Premier Cho said he was very angry. He stated, "I, like everyone in Taiwan, cannot accept such actions in a project that has been going on for many years."</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that they have made several decisions about this matter. First, they have asked the Ministry of Health and Welfare to find out who is legally responsible for the project leader's actions. If others were also involved in illegal or improper actions, they will also be judged. Second, they will make sure the affected students get good care and help for any physical or mental harm they have suffered.</p>
            <p>When asked about what will happen next, Deputy Minister Lin Ching-yi from the Ministry of Health and Welfare explained to reporters on the phone. According to the Human Research Act, the central government body that oversees the organization, school, company, or group doing the human research is responsible. This includes supervising, checking, managing, punishing, and protecting the rights of the people in the research.</p>
            <p>Because the Ministry of Education is the main government body for National Taiwan Normal University, Lin Ching-yi said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has already sent a letter. This letter asks the Ministry of Education to deal with the issue according to the law and their responsibilities.</p>
            <p>However, Lin Ching-yi pointed out that "we need to know where all these blood samples went." It is important to find out if the school handled the samples by itself or if it worked with a medical organization. Even though the Ministry of Education is investigating the school's research plan and its ethics committee (IRB), if they find out that a medical organization was involved, then the Ministry of Health and Welfare will be responsible. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has already asked its Medical Affairs Department to be ready to investigate if necessary.</p>
            <p>Lin Ching-yi also said that for student support, the school has ways to help current students. If graduates are no longer students and need help, the Ministry of Health and Welfare can contact relevant groups to start providing support.</p>

            <h1>Gongliao Junior High School Teacher Accused of Sexual Harassment; Education Department May Reopen Investigation</h1>
            <p>(New Taipei News) An acting teacher at Gongliao Junior High School in New Taipei City was involved in several school safety reports and also sexually harassed male students. The school and the Education Department did not handle these cases correctly according to the law. Because of this, the Control Yuan, a government body, officially told the school and the Education Department to fix their mistakes. The Education Department said they will ask the people involved again. If they agree to be investigated or if new evidence appears, the investigation will start again.</p>
            <p>Today, the Control Yuan announced in a press release that an acting teacher, referred to as "Teacher A," at New Taipei City Gongliao Experimental Junior High School, was involved in 11 school safety incidents from the 2012-2013 school year to the 2024-2025 school year. Among these, Teacher A was suspected of at least three cases of sexual harassment or molestation of male students between 2017 and 2022.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan's investigation found that the school and the former principal, Mr. Shi, did not handle the cases properly according to the law. They greatly ignored the rights of the students. Also, the New Taipei City Government did not supervise correctly. Therefore, the Control Yuan told Gongliao Junior High School and the New Taipei Education Department to correct their actions.</p>
            <p>The Education Department said they respect the Control Yuan's investigation. They also said they will not be soft on the acting teacher who is suspected of sexually harassing students and seriously breaking teacher ethics. They will look into it seriously. However, at the time of the investigation, the people involved in the cases were asked many times if they wanted to be interviewed. Both the people involved and their families clearly said many times that they did not want to cooperate. Because of this, the investigation stopped for a while.</p>
            <p>The Education Department said they will ask the people involved in these cases again. If they are willing to be investigated or if new evidence appears, the investigation will start again immediately. If any wrongdoing is found, the teacher will be punished strictly according to the law. The former principal was moved to an administrative job in 2022. Later, they will use the "Regulations for Investigating and Handling Facts of Incompetent Principals" to check again if the former principal broke any administrative rules or duties. If he is found to have failed in his duties, he will be dealt with according to the rules.</p>
            <p>The Education Department also reviewed and changed its rules completely because Teacher A, who taught for a long time, was often involved in problematic incidents. This acting teacher was fired this year because he was found guilty of improper disciplinary actions. He was also fined 60,000 New Taiwan Dollars by the Social Affairs Department.</p>
            <p>The Education Department stated again that they will not accept any actions that harm students' physical and mental safety. They have told all schools to check their hiring process for acting teachers very carefully. They must now check school safety and gender equality records from previous years. This is to make sure they do not hire teachers who might be risky. This will help ensure good teaching and student safety. At the same time, they will make campus efforts to prevent gender-based violence stronger. They will also improve positive discipline and teacher ethics education. This is to help every child grow up in a safe, healthy, and respectful environment.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Riverside Parks Add 5 New Tech Enforcement Spots, Active from August 10</h1>
            <p>(New Taipei News) To stop cars and motorcycles from entering riverside parks and making it unsafe for people, the New Taipei City High-Draining Area Project Management Office has already set up 17 technology enforcement spots. This year, they will add 5 more such spots. These new spots will start working on August 10. The goal is to stop vehicles that are not allowed from driving in the parks.</p>
            <p>Today, the High-Draining Area Project Management Office released a press statement. The director, Huang Yu-bin, said that New Taipei's riverside areas are important places for citizens to relax. Based on phone data, in 2024, about 53 million people visited the riverside areas. To make sure people are safe while relaxing, 17 technology enforcement spots have already been set up.</p>
            <p>Huang Yu-bin said that if a vehicle breaks the rules and is caught by the technology enforcement, the driver can be fined between 900 and 1,800 New Taiwan Dollars. This is according to the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act. Statistics show that from January to May this year, 1,462 fines were given out.</p>
            <p>The High-Draining Area Project Management Office stated that to provide safe places for people to relax, they are adding 5 new technology enforcement spots this year. These new spots are located at Rainbow Trail in Bali District, next to Qinqing Riverside Park and Dapeng No. 2 floodgate in Xindian District, and along the Caolan Stream and Dakeng Stream bike paths in Xizhi District. They are starting to announce this information now. These new spots will officially begin working on August 10. The office asks people not to drive cars or motorcycles into the parks illegally, so they don't get fined.</p>
