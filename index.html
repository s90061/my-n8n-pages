            <h1>US Secretary confirms talks with Intel about buying shares; says chip production cannot rely on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>After Nvidia and AMD agreed to give 15% of their profits from selling chips to China to the government, the U.S. Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, confirmed today that the U.S. is talking with Intel about buying 10% of its shares. He also said again what he often said before joining the government: that the U.S. should make its own chips. He stated, "We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lutnick told the U.S. financial news channel CNBC that the U.S. government might become Intel's biggest shareholder. However, it would not control how Intel is run. "This is not about control," he said. "We are just changing the money given by the Biden government into shares. Also, the U.S. government will not have voting rights."</p>
            <p>Lutnick again criticized the Chip Act, signed by former President Biden. He said the law gives money to companies that make semiconductors, but American taxpayers do not get anything in return.</p>
            <p>He asked, "Why should we give so much money to a company worth 100 billion U.S. dollars (about 3 trillion New Taiwan dollars)? How does this help American taxpayers? Trump's answer is that we should use this money to buy shares."</p>
            <p>Intel has indeed received the most benefits from the "Chips Act." It received 7.9 billion U.S. dollars for making commercial semiconductors. It also got 3 billion U.S. dollars for the Pentagon's "Secure Enclave" project. Additionally, Intel can ask for 11 billion U.S. dollars in loans.</p>
            <p>Lutnick said, imagine this: "The Biden government is actually giving money to Intel for free, and also giving money to TSMC for free. All these companies are getting money for nothing."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg previously reported, citing White House officials and others with knowledge, that the Trump government was talking about buying about 10% of Intel's shares. At the same time, Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. also said it would invest 2 billion U.S. dollars in Intel, becoming one of Intel's top ten shareholders.</p>
            <p>If the White House decides to buy shares, it will greatly help Intel's financial situation. Because Intel has been firing employees and cutting costs, these talks are getting a lot of attention in the market.</p>
            <p>Intel's stock price in New York went up by 11% today at one point. SoftBank's shares, traded in Tokyo, went down by 4% today when the market closed.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg said that the U.S. government talking about buying Intel shares shows a big change in U.S. policy on semiconductors. If this deal is finalized, it could set an example for Washington to make similar deals with other chip makers.</p>
            <p>Lutnick also said today that for national security reasons, the U.S. wants to move some chip making to the U.S. "We need to make our own chips. We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>At the same time, Lutnick did not say it was impossible for Nvidia to sell its new AI chip, which it is still developing, to China. Reuters reported that this AI chip will use the newest Blackwell technology and will be more powerful than the H20 chip currently allowed for export to China.</p>
            <p>Lutnick spoke about Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang. He said, "Of course, he wants to sell a new chip to China. I heard him talk to the President, and the President listens to these good technology companies. In the end, it is up to him to decide what to do."</p>

            <h1>Traders consider Russia-Ukraine ceasefire outlook; international oil prices fall</h1>
            <p>After many high-level talks, U.S. President Trump is now trying to arrange a meeting between Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelensky. Traders are thinking about the possibility of a ceasefire in Ukraine, which caused international oil prices to go down today.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery dropped by 1.7%, ending at 62.35 U.S. dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery went down by 1.2%, closing at 65.79 U.S. dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Cargo ship explosion closes Baltimore port channel; investigators find out why</h1>
            <p>Last night, a cargo ship full of coal exploded when it left the port of Baltimore, Maryland, to go to East Africa. Investigators are now trying to find out why it happened. The main shipping channel of Baltimore Port was closed this morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, officials said that no one was hurt in the explosion last night. The explosion sent out a distress signal. The ship was reportedly near where the Francis Scott Key Bridge fell down last year.</p>
            <p>Videos showed flames from the explosion shooting high into the sky. Then, a lot of thick smoke covered the Patapsco River.</p>
            <p>The main shipping channel for the Port of Baltimore was closed this morning.</p>
            <p>Port officials said in a press release: "The U.S. Coast Guard is in charge of this response. They will decide when the channel can safely open again and when ships can enter and leave the port."</p>
            <p>According to information from ship tracking websites, the W-Sapphire is a commercial ship that is 229 meters long. It was supposed to travel from Baltimore to East Africa and arrive at the Port of Mauritius in about one month. The ship was built in 2012 and currently uses the flag of Liberia. Officials said that the ship was carrying coal.</p>
            <p>According to the U.S. Coast Guard, there were 23 crew members and 2 pilots on the ship when the explosion happened.</p>
            <p>John Marsh, a spokesperson for the Baltimore Fire Department, said that his department went to deal with a fire below the ship's deck.</p>
            <p>The Maryland Department of Emergency Management reported that no other property was damaged, only the ship itself.</p>
