            <h1>Italy's King of Fashion Armani Dies, Dedicated to Love and Beauty Until the End of Life</h1>
            <p>Today, Giorgio Armani, who was known as Italy's "King of Fashion" and a famous clothes designer, passed away. He was 91 years old. He always looked for love and beauty, and this was important throughout his life. His company said that he kept working on his beloved fashion until he died. Also, he recently bought a bar where he met his partner, who passed away earlier. Many people see this as a perfect example of Italian romance.</p>
            <p>The Armani Group released a statement today to say they were sad about the death of their founder, Giorgio Armani. For two days this weekend, his memorial service in Milan will be open for family and friends to visit. His funeral will be private, as he wished.</p>
            <p>The statement also said that when Armani died, his family and his partner of nearly 20 years, Leo Dell'Orco, were with him. Mr. Dell'Orco is the head designer for Armani men's clothes. This year, Armani was not at Milan Fashion Week, which was unusual. Mr. Dell'Orco led the team instead. Because of this, many people think Mr. Dell'Orco will take over the Armani Group in the future.</p>
            <p>The news of Armani's sudden death surprised the fashion world in Italy. Armani had just turned 91 on July 11th this year. Even though he was old, he was still very active at work. A few days before he died, he announced he was buying a famous restaurant and bar in Italy. He did this to remember where he met his late partner and business friend, Sergio Galeotti, in the 1960s. Armani also personally looked at the designs for the 50th-anniversary collection shown at Fashion Week recently.</p>
            <p>The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported that Armani went to the hospital a few weeks before his birthday because of a lung infection. He later went home to rest. A few days ago, Armani had a bad stomach ache, but then he started eating normally again. He was still guiding his work over the phone. So, no one in the fashion world expected to hear the sad news today.</p>
            <p>Armani was born in Piacenza, a city in northern Italy. He first studied medicine at university, but he stopped when he had to do military service. After leaving the army, he worked at a famous Italian department store called Rinascente. In 1965, a well-known Italian designer, Nino Cerruti, recognized Armani's talent and gave him a series of clothes to design.</p>
            <p>After that, Armani became more and more famous in fashion. In 1975, he started the Armani company with his partner at the time, Sergio Galeotti. From then on, his business grew a lot and became well-known on international fashion shows. This made Armani famous as the "King of Fashion."</p>
            <p>Sadly, Sergio Galeotti died early, just a few years after they started the company. He did not get to see how big the Armani empire would become. Armani once said that when Galeotti passed away, he felt a part of himself was gone too. At the end of August this year, just before his own death, Armani announced he was buying La Capannina, the restaurant and bar where they first met, to remember him. This leaves a lasting memory of their special love story.</p>

            <h1>Cathay Life Partners with Criminal Investigation Bureau to Create a National Anti-Fraud Safety Net</h1>
            <p>Today in Taipei, Cathay Life Insurance announced that it is working with the National Police Agency's Criminal Investigation Bureau. They are starting an "anti-fraud safety net" project. This project has four main parts: a "knowledge network," a "technology network," a "joint prevention network," and a "care network." These parts will help teach people of all ages how to avoid fraud. In the last two years, they have stopped 176 fraud cases and protected people's money, saving about 192 million New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life Insurance released a press statement today to share the results of its work with the Criminal Investigation Bureau. In the past two years, they have successfully stopped 176 fraud cases and protected 192 million New Taiwan dollars of people's money. This amount of stopped fraud is 90% of all fraud stopped in the life insurance industry, making them number one in the insurance business.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life's own numbers show that fake investment scams are the most common type, making up 57% of cases. Fake dating scams come second at 23%, and fake police or prosecutor scams are 5%. This shows that fraud victims are not only children and older people, but people of all ages.</p>
            <p>Liu Shang-Chi, the General Manager of Cathay Life Insurance, said that Cathay Life and the Criminal Investigation Bureau have worked together for a long time. They have created ways to share information and work together online. They also go into communities and schools to teach people of all ages about fraud prevention. With the four networksâ€”knowledge, technology, joint prevention, and careâ€”they are building a "fraud safety net."</p>
            <p>First, the knowledge network helps staff learn more about preventing fraud. They do this by sharing real cases where fraud was stopped and by having regular online lessons. This helps all service staff stay updated with fraud prevention knowledge and information. Second, the care network works by visiting customers, talking to them at the counter, and holding events to teach about fraud. This helps customers understand more about fraud and lowers their risk of becoming victims.</p>
            <p>Third, the technology network uses data systems and AI to calculate how likely a customer is to be scammed. It has successfully found 80% of high-risk customers who were targeted by scams. Finally, the joint prevention network focuses on combining resources to keep customers' money safe. Inside the company, they use "Cathay Shield," which is a platform for group risk prevention, to check customer identities carefully. This makes risk monitoring more accurate. Outside the company, they work with the 165 anti-fraud hotline to create early warning systems for common high-risk scams.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life also supports government policy by offering a "designated contact person service" for insurance policies. This service helps customers name a family member as a contact when they buy insurance or change their policy. This way, a third person can quickly advise them and lower the risk of fraud.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Fubon Bank's Guo Bei-ting: Central Bank's Real Estate Loan Concentration Control is Tighter Than Banking Act</h1>
            <p>Today in Taipei, Guo Bei-ting, the General Manager of Taipei Fubon Bank, said that the Banking Act, specifically Article 72-2, sets a limit of 30%. Taipei Fubon Bank's own internal warning level is 28%, and they are still a bit away from that 28%. He also said that the Central Bank's rules for how much banks can lend for real estate are currently stricter than the Banking Act, and they use a different way to calculate it. Taipei Fubon Bank plans to lower its real estate loan concentration to 38% by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>To get better at fighting fraud, Fubon Life Insurance and Taipei Fubon Bank officially signed a document today with the Taichung Branch of the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office and the Taichung City Government. This document is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for anti-fraud cooperation. The main goal is to share information about stopping fraud and to teach people how to avoid it. Together, they will work on stopping fraud. Both Guo Bei-ting and Chen Shih-Yueh, the General Manager of Fubon Life, were at the signing ceremony.</p>
            <p>Article 72-2 of the Banking Act is often called the "golden rule" for bank real estate loans. It says that the total amount commercial banks lend for building homes and businesses cannot be more than 30% of all the money they have from deposits and selling financial bonds. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced a new rule. It says that loans for the "New Youth Housing Loan" program will not be counted in this 30% limit. However, private banks are not currently involved in this "New Youth Housing Loan" program.</p>
            <p>After the event, Guo Bei-ting said in an interview that the Banking Act has a top limit of 30%. Taipei Fubon Bank's own warning level inside the company is 28%, and they are currently still below that 28%. However, he noted that the Central Bank is now controlling real estate loans by banks more strictly.</p>
            <p>In the middle of August last year, the Central Bank used "moral persuasion." They asked banks to control the total amount of real estate loans they make for one year (from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year). This plan is currently in its second quarter and will continue until the fourth quarter of this year. After that, they will check the results.</p>
            <p>Guo Bei-ting pointed out that the Central Bank uses a different way to calculate things than the Banking Act. At the end of last year, Taipei Fubon Bank had a higher concentration of real estate loans. But it has gone down from 44% to 40% now. They are slowly improving it each quarter. According to their plan, they expect it to be 38% by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>He further explained how Taipei Fubon Bank manages this. The total amount of loans they give out naturally grows with their business. To control the amount, they only lend new money up to the amount that customers pay back each quarter. Currently, Taipei Fubon Bank's normal home loan interest rates are around 2.5% to 2.6%, and customers can still get these loans.</p>
            <p>Also, recently, there has been more competition in the market for participating insurance policies. Fubon Life Insurance re-entered this market in 2023. Chen Shih-Yueh said that participating insurance policies might become the main product in the market in the future. Currently, these policies make up more than 50% of Fubon Life's new insurance premium income. Their goal for this year is also between 50% and 60%.</p>
