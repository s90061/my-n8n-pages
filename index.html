A recent study shows that young people, known as Gen Z (those aged 18 to 26), are experiencing more stress and exhaustion than older generations. This group often feels overwhelmed by the pressures of modern life.

Experts say several factors contribute to this feeling of burnout. These include constantly being online and comparing themselves to others on social media. Financial worries, such as the cost of living and finding good jobs, also add to their stress. Many young people also find it hard to separate their work life from their personal life, especially with remote work becoming common.

To help Gen Z, there is a growing call for better support systems. Employers are encouraged to offer more flexible work options and mental health resources. Society also needs to understand and address the unique challenges this generation faces, creating a more supportive environment for them to thrive.

**AI Could Change Many Jobs, Says IMF**

A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warns that artificial intelligence (AI) is set to change a large number of jobs around the world. The report suggests that about 60% of jobs in richer countries could be affected by AI.

For some jobs, AI might take over certain tasks or even replace the entire role. However, for many other jobs, AI will likely work alongside people, helping them to be more productive. This means workers might need to learn new skills to use AI tools effectively.

The IMF also highlighted a concern about income inequality. If not managed well, AI could make some people much richer while leaving others behind, especially if they don't have the right skills. To prevent this, the report suggests governments should invest in education and training programs to help people adapt to the changing job market. They also recommend stronger social safety nets to support those who might lose their jobs due to AI.

**More Travelers Want Sustainable Trips**

A recent study shows that more and more people are interested in sustainable travel. This means choosing holidays that do less harm to the environment and support local communities. Travelers are becoming more aware of issues like overtourism and the climate crisis.

While many people say they want to travel sustainably, there's often a gap between their wishes and what they actually do. This can be because sustainable options might be more expensive or harder to find. However, the report also shows that a significant number of travelers are willing to pay extra for greener choices.

To meet this demand, travel companies and airlines are starting to offer more environmentally friendly options. This includes things like eco-friendly hotels, tours that benefit local people, and ways to reduce carbon emissions from flights. The goal is to make it easier for everyone to enjoy traveling while also protecting our planet for the future.
