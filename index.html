            <h1>Google Cloud COO: AI Will Reach Every Business and Every Corner</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 27th â€“ Francis deSouza, the Chief Operating Officer of Google Cloud, said today that in the past few years, companies moved their data and apps to the cloud. But now, a bigger trend is starting: using Artificial Intelligence (AI) for both everyday people and businesses. In the future, AI will be in every part of every company.</p>
            <p>DeSouza spoke at an online meeting with reporters. He said that usually, when new technology comes out, small, new digital companies use it first. Then, bigger companies start to use it later. But this time is different. Very large companies, even those in industries that were slow to use new technology before, are now actively using AI. This shows how much companies believe AI can help them make money.</p>
            <p>He mentioned a study by Google Cloud and other companies. This study found that if businesses choose the right situations and tools, they can get their money back from using Google Cloud AI in less than one year. Also, they can get more than 700% return on investment (ROI) within three years.</p>
            <p>As "Agentic AI" becomes popular, the use of AI will definitely grow a lot. DeSouza observed that if customers see strong returns on their money, they will want to spend. Customers believe they can get returns in two ways: first, by making their work more efficient, and second, by using AI and their data to start new businesses and find new ways to earn money.</p>
            <p>He also said that to meet customer needs, Google is building data centers around the world. This year, they plan to invest 75 billion US dollars (about 2.3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) to build this infrastructure. Google is working hard to get space, electricity, and computer chips. They are also making sure they have the right technology and skilled people, and they are making it easier to work with more customers.</p>
            <p>When asked why Google Cloud recently got Meta and OpenAI as big customers, deSouza said that Google Cloud's infrastructure is very strong and almost always works. He also said it is the only very large cloud service provider that has its own AI technology. He explained, "Customers are not just buying today's products; they also trust us to help them in the future."</p>

            <h1>Taipei City to Build Tamsui Riverbank; Mayor Chiang Wan-an: Enjoy World-Class River Views</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 27th â€“ Today, the Taipei City Hydraulic Engineering Office started the "Tamsui River Riverside Area Improvement Project" at Dadaocheng Wharf Plaza. They plan to finish the whole project by the end of 2028. Mayor Chiang Wan-an said that this will let citizens enjoy beautiful river views like those around the world, without leaving the city.</p>
            <p>The Hydraulic Engineering Office explained that the "Tamsui River Riverside Area Improvement Project" has been planned for a long time. Today, Mayor Chiang Wan-an led the opening ceremony. Lawmakers, local leaders, and citizens also came to see the start of this riverbank project. The construction will follow a plan of "build first, then remove; in stages." This will reduce problems for people's daily activities. The first two parts of the project are expected to be done by 2026, and the whole project by the end of 2028.</p>
            <p>The Hydraulic Engineering Office said the project has four main parts along the river. First is the "Western Riverside Time-Space Corridor." This will include a new pedestrian bridge connecting Yuquan Park and the riverbank. It will connect areas inside and outside the river levee, creating a green skywalk for relaxation.</p>
            <p>Second is the "Dadaocheng Fireworks Image Revitalization Area." This part will make the Dadaocheng Wharf area better and allow for more activities. The "Dadaocheng to Dunhuang Wharf Riverside Path" will make the walking path wider. This will give people a nice place to walk, see the river, and watch the sunset.</p>
            <p>The fourth part is the "Dunhuang Water Recreation Base." This will have a new yacht marina, steps for viewing, and a light food area. It will connect to the Beidatong Cultural Park, mixing history and culture with the riverside space.</p>
