On Sunday, an oil tanker called the Front Tyne was traveling through the Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. However, around 9:40 a.m., ship-tracking data strangely showed the large vessel located in Russia, specifically in agricultural areas known for growing barley and sugar beets. Later that day, by 4:15 p.m., the ship's inconsistent signals indicated it was near Bidkhun in southern Iran, before continuing to show it moving back and forth across the Gulf.
