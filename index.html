            <h1>Israel's Finance Minister: If Hamas Does Not Give Up, the Government Should Slowly Take Over Gaza</h1>
            <p>Israel's Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, said today that if the Palestinian group Hamas keeps its weapons, the Israeli government should start to slowly take over the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Smotrich, a far-right politician, had strongly disagreed with making a deal with Hamas to stop the war, which has been going on for almost two years. Today, in a press conference in Jerusalem, he shared his plan to "win in Gaza by the end of the year."</p>
            <p>His plan says that Hamas will get a final warning. They must give up, get rid of their weapons, and let go of all hostages taken during the attack on Israel in October 2023.</p>
            <p>If Hamas says no, Smotrich suggests that Israel should take over a part of Gaza each week for four weeks. This would give Israel full control over most of the Gaza Strip. According to Smotrich, Palestinian people would first be asked to move to the south of Gaza. Then, Israel would block the north and middle parts to remove any remaining Hamas fighters. Finally, the takeover would be complete.</p>
            <p>He said, "This can be done in three to four months."</p>
            <p>Right now, Israeli soldiers are strongly attacking Gaza City, the largest city in the Gaza Strip. They are trying to get control, and many people are worried about the Palestinian civilians there. During the war, most of the more than 2 million people in the Gaza Strip have had to leave their homes. Many of them have moved several times.</p>
            <p>Smotrich asked Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to "immediately accept this plan completely."</p>
            <p>Hamas said the plan was bad. They called it "open support for forcing our people to move and for ethnic cleansing."</p>
            <p>In 2005, Israel removed its army and settlers from the Gaza Strip. Smotrich is one of many far-right members in Israel's current government who have said they want to build settlements in Gaza again.</p>

            <p>Chou Tien-chen is currently ranked 6th in the world. He won a bronze medal at the World Championships in 2022. Even though he is 35 years old, he is still a strong player in world badminton. This season, he reached the semifinals twice in BWF Super 1000 events. He also got second place in the Indonesia Open.</p>
            <p>Chou came to France for the World Championships. He won two matches in a row to reach the top 16 in men's singles. He is Taiwan's only hope in the singles event.

            <h1>Ex-Chief of Freeway Bureau Gets 4 Years in Jail for Helping Contractor, Court Says</h1>
            <p>Lee Tai-ming, a former head of the Freeway Bureau, was accused of unfairly helping a construction company. This happened when they were building an extra interchange for the Wanli-Ruibin East-West Expressway. After a third re-trial, the High Court decided to give Lee Tai-ming 4 years in prison. The court also said that because the case has taken so many years, his sentence was made shorter under a special law for quick trials. He can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>The court document said that in 2008, Lee Tai-ming, who was then the Director of the Taiwan Area National Freeway Bureau, and Hung Ming-chien, who was the Director of the Bureau's Expansion Project Office, were working on the "Dahua System Interchange Project for the Wanli-Ruibin East-West Expressway."</p>
            <p>The court stated that Lee Tai-ming and Hung Ming-chien were accused of using fake complaints set up by two men, Mr. Chen and Mr. Su, who worked for the construction company. Without checking or studying the situation, they changed the way a retaining wall project was built. Instead of the original plan, they used a "static pile pressing method." They then gave a part of the work to the company with a special offer, which helped the company unfairly gain more than NT$3.29 million.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors charged them with profiting illegally under the Anti-Corruption Act. The first court, New Taipei District Court, said there wasn't enough proof and found Lee Tai-ming and others not guilty. But when the case went to a higher court, the Taiwan High Court changed the decision. They gave Lee Tai-ming 6 years in prison, Hung Ming-chien 5 years and 6 months, Mr. Chen 4 years, and Mr. Su 3 years. The Supreme Court then canceled the decision three times and sent the case back to the Taiwan High Court for another review.</p>
            <p>In the third re-trial, the High Court still found Lee Tai-ming and the others guilty of illegal profiting. The court looked at each person's actions. Mr. Chen and Mr. Su were not public officials, so their sentences could be lighter. The court also thought about how long the case has been going on and used the "Criminal Speedy Trial Act" to make the sentences shorter.</p>
            <p>The third re-trial sentenced Lee Tai-ming to 4 years in prison, Hung Ming-chien to 3 years and 6 months, Mr. Chen to 2 years and 6 months, and Mr. Su to 1 year and 6 months. Any money they illegally gained that has not been seized must be taken or returned. This decision can still be appealed.</p>
