            <h1>El Salvador Changes Constitution to Allow President to Serve Forever; Opposition Says Democracy is Dead</h1>
            <p>El Salvador's ruling party lawmakers voted today to change the constitution and election rules. This change makes it possible for President Bukele to be re-elected again and again. But lawmakers from the opposition said, "Democracy in El Salvador is dead."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that even though the constitution clearly says a president cannot serve again, Bukele won a second term last year. Most of the top judges in El Salvador are friends with Bukele. In 2021, the Supreme Court decided that running for re-election was a human right for Bukele.</p>
            <p>The new changes to the constitution passed easily because Bukele's New Ideas party has many seats in the parliament. These changes let the president serve an unlimited number of terms. They also make the presidential term longer, from 5 years to 6 years, and remove the need for a second round of voting if no one wins a clear majority in the first round.</p>
            <p>After he won re-election last year, Bukele told reporters that he "did not think constitutional changes were needed." But at that time, Bukele did not answer if he would try to become president for a third time.</p>
            <p>The new constitution changes passed with 57 votes for and 3 votes against, just as the Salvadoran parliament was about to finish its session.</p>
            <p>This change to the constitution also makes the current president's term shorter. This will allow presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, which are now held at different times, to happen at the same time in 2027. Holding these elections together will likely help the ruling party win everything.</p>
            <p>There are only a few lawmakers from other parties in the parliament. They are worried this will make one party too strong, so they did not support the changes to the constitution.</p>
            <p>Marcela Villatoro, a lawmaker from the Nationalist Republican Alliance party (ARENA), said, "Today, democracy in El Salvador is dead."</p>
            <p>Bukele is still one of the most popular leaders in Central America. This is because he has greatly reduced murders by fighting gangs very strongly. However, groups that protect human rights are very concerned that innocent people have also been affected. (Translated by He Hongru/Reviewed by Chen Yen-chun) August 1, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Pingtung Heavy Rain: 8 Townships Enter 5th Day of Suspended Work and School; 429 People Evacuated from Mountain Areas</h1>
            <p>In Pingtung, heavy rain has continued for many days. Many places in the mountain areas are at risk of landslides. Two bridges connecting Sanhdi-men Township are closed because the water level is too high. As of 6:30 PM today, 429 people have been moved out of the mountain areas. Eight indigenous townships will have no work or school for a fifth day tomorrow. The county government is telling people not to go into high-risk areas.</p>
            <p>Because of the strong southwest winds, Pingtung has had continuous heavy rain for many days. Many places in the mountain areas of the indigenous townships are at risk of landslides. Eight indigenous townships in the whole county will have no work or school for a fifth day tomorrow. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi went to inspect the mountain areas today. She told the indigenous townships to start moving people out as a safety measure right away. She also encouraged the workers who have been fixing roads for two weeks without stopping.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that it is still raining in the mountains, and the heavy rain might continue for several more days. She asks all local people to follow the government's orders to leave and not to enter any high-risk areas. The county government and the disaster response center are very alert and ready to help. If anything happens, they will "handle it immediately."</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that the Koushe Bridge and Fubon Bridge, which are important bridges connecting the Koushe tribe in Sanhdi-men and Gaoshu Township, are completely closed. This is because the water level has gone over the warning limit due to continuous rain. All other bridges in the county are also being watched closely. She told people not to risk crossing closed roads. The county government has also checked the medical supplies and other necessary things in villages that might become cut off. They have asked all indigenous township offices to report their needs right away, and the county government will help get supplies to make sure people have basic necessities during and after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Jiang Guo-feng, the director of Pingtung County Government's Water Resources Department, said that the Koushe Bridge on County Road 185 in the Sanhdi-men area has problems because its main structure is not tall enough, as seen by the high water levels from the recent rains. Chou Chun-mi and officials from the Seventh River Management Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Water Resources Agency inspected the site. She asked the Public Works Department to quickly propose a plan to rebuild the bridge and ask the Water Resources Agency for money to help.</p>
            <p>A press release from the Pingtung County Government's Information and International Affairs Department said that the county government has started a special contract for disaster relief. They have brought together repair teams to work day and night. The repair teams have been working for two weeks straight, starting as early as 6 AM and continuing until 8 PM. They are still working very hard to repair the roads and are always ready for any emergency.</p>
            <p>According to the Indigenous Peoples Department, as of 6:30 PM, 429 people have been moved out of Pingtung's indigenous townships. Taifu Township had the most with 183 people, and Chunrih Township was second with 133 people. (Edited by Fang Pei-ching) August 1, 2025.</p>
