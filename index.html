            <h1>Machine Association: Exchange Rate Affects Machine Tool Exports More Than Tariffs</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Machine Tool Industry Association said today that the exchange rate affects machine tool exports more than tariffs.</p>
            <p>The association announced that in September, the value of Taiwan's machinery exports was 2.647 billion US dollars. This is 9.4% more than the same month last year, showing growth for 8 months in a row. However, when measured in New Taiwan Dollars, the growth rate in September was only 3.9%. The association pointed out that the New Taiwan Dollar exchange rate has a bigger impact than US tariffs.</p>
            <p>The association explained that the New Taiwan Dollar has not become weaker as much as the Japanese Yen since 2021. This means that Taiwanese equipment used to be 20% to 30% cheaper than Japanese equipment, but this price difference has now disappeared. This has especially affected machine tool exports and caused a big drop in orders.</p>
            <p>In September, Taiwan's machinery exports were 2.647 billion US dollars. This is 9.4% more than September 2024, which was 2.42 billion US dollars. If calculated in New Taiwan Dollars, the amount was 80.464 billion, which is 3.9% more than last year.</p>
            <p>The association said that machinery exports continued to grow in September, for the eighth month in a row. However, the data shows that machine tool exports in September were only 170 million US dollars. Although this is 5% more than last year, it is because last year's numbers were very low. The current export amount is still lower than in the past. The machine tool industry is still affected by global uncertainty, and orders are low.</p>
            <p>Looking at machine tool exports to the US, the association said that they were affected by tariffs. At first, the US paused these tariffs for 90 days. Companies sent their goods earlier to deal with this. In May, Taiwan's machine tool exports to the US grew by 17.1%. In June, they grew by 57.4%. But in July, exports to the US fell by 26.4%. In August, they fell by 32.1%. In September, they fell by 19.9%.</p>
            <p>In the first nine months of this year, Taiwan's total machinery exports were 23.259 billion US dollars, which is 6.6% more than last year. In New Taiwan Dollars, this was about 725.07 billion, a 3.8% increase.</p>
            <p>For the main export markets in the first nine months of this year, the association noted that the top three countries for Taiwan's machinery exports were the United States (26.3%), China (22.8%), and Japan (7.6%).</p>
            <p>The association stated that the US and China are still the two biggest markets for Taiwan's machinery exports. In the first nine months of this year, Taiwan's machinery exports to China grew by a small 4.3%, and to the US by 13%.</p>
            <p>The association explained that from August 7, the US started to put tariffs on goods from all countries. For Taiwan, the temporary tariff rate is 20%. Compared to competing countries like Japan and South Korea, which have a 15% rate, the 20% tariff makes it harder for Taiwan's machinery products to be exported to the US.</p>
            <p>The association explained that at first, the US stopped the matching tariffs for 90 days. Companies sent out their goods early because of this. In May, machinery exports to the US increased by 19%. In June, they increased by 23.6%. In July, they increased by 14.8%. However, in August, when the matching tariffs started, the growth rate of exports clearly dropped to 7.6% yearly. In September, exports then decreased by 0.9%.</p>

            <h1>KMT Chairman Election Debate: Candidates Promise to Win Southern Taiwan in 2026</h1>
            <p>The Kuomintang (KMT) will elect its new chairman on October 18. Today, candidates held a meeting in Kaohsiung to share their ideas. Luo Chih-chiang and Hao Lung-pin said they would quit if they don't win one of the two main cities in southern Taiwan in the 2026 elections. Cheng Li-wen thinks Kaohsiung has a good chance to change. Tsai Chih-hung said he would quit if the number of county mayors decreases.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairman election will be held on October 18. Today, candidates held a meeting in Kaohsiung to share their plans. Six people joined: Hao Lung-pin, Chang Ya-chung, Luo Chih-chiang, Tsai Chih-hung, Cheng Li-wen, and Cho Po-yuan. They all spoke in order.</p>
            <p>Hao Lung-pin said that when new leaders take over, it should not mean one group of people replaces another. Instead, people of different ages should work together. He said it is the chairman's job to give young people chances to show their skills and make the KMT stronger. He also said that many fake accounts and false messages have attacked him, and he hopes people will support him and not believe the bad rumors.</p>
            <p>Talking about the 2026 elections, Hao Lung-pin said his plan is to "protect the north, make the middle stable, and win the south." He wants to win in the north and middle, and at least one of the two main cities in the south. He promised that if he becomes chairman and doesn't win one of the two southern cities, he will quit. He said that in the past, elections were often decided in central Taiwan, but for the 2028 election, he hopes they will be decided in southern Taiwan. He believes the KMT should work with the Taiwan People's Party, but it is more important for the KMT to be strong itself.</p>
            <p>Chang Ya-chung said that the KMT needs to find its spirit and values again when it is in power. If it doesn't have clear ideas and a soul, it cannot attract young people. He still believes that the current candidates do not have enough party spirit. He also said that if Hao Lung-pin wins, the party's structure will not change. He asked everyone to vote for someone who can help the KMT find its original ideas, like when former President Chiang Ching-kuo led the party.</p>
            <p>Luo Chih-chiang said that if he becomes chairman, he will make a strong rule that the KMT must win at least one of the two major southern cities in the 2026 elections, or he will quit as chairman. He also said this election is about two types of values. One idea is that the chairman should be calm, reliable, and very loyal. The other idea is that there should be new, younger leaders who are strong in fighting. He believes he fits both ideas.</p>
            <p>Luo Chih-chiang also said that there are many rumors recently about him supporting other candidates, but he supports himself. He hopes everyone will vote with confidence and not change their minds. He also said he is a strong fighter. He has been active in the Legislative Yuan and helped party members with their campaigns. He said if he becomes chairman, he can do even more to remove the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) from power and bring back the KMT.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chih-hung said that the situation between Taiwan and China is now very dangerous and could lead to war at any time. If there is a war in the Taiwan Strait, people will not be able to live and work peacefully. If he wins, he will work to arrange a meeting between the leaders of the KMT and China. He will also suggest ideas for "one China" and mutual understanding as a basis for talks. Also, if the number of KMT county mayors decreases in the 2026 elections, he will immediately quit.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen said she will not be a chairman who stays in an office in Taipei. She will be a chairman who connects with the people. Southern Taiwan has been led by the DPP for too long. The KMT needs to break the DPP's hold next year and change southern Taiwan. She also said that the KMT has many female county mayors, like Lu Hsiu-yen, and she hopes a woman can also become the party chairman.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen also said that the chance to win the Kaohsiung mayoral election next year is very good because the DPP is divided and fighting among themselves. So, the KMT needs to unite to defeat the proud and divided DPP. She said that since she announced her candidacy for chairman, everyone in Taiwan and the world is watching because the KMT is different now. It wants to stand up again and win the support of young people and undecided voters.</p>
            <p>Cho Po-yuan said that the KMT needs to become younger and train new people. He suggested that the two youngest candidates, Cheng Li-wen and Luo Chih-chiang, should run for president and vice president. The other three candidates could be top advisors to the KMT. This way, everyone can use their skills and help the party fight.</p>
            <p>Cho Po-yuan emphasized that there is a third way beyond unification with China or independence. This way is to move the United Nations to Taiwan. If he becomes party chairman, he will invite Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump to Taiwan to drink bubble tea. He will also work to make sure both the US and China agree to move the United Nations to Taiwan. He will also raise money so that party members do not have to pay membership fees, encouraging millions of members to return to the party.</p>

            <h1>Formosa Plastics Group Companies Earn NT$13 Billion in Q3, Turning Profit Except for One</h1>
            <p>The four main companies of Formosa Plastics Group announced their financial reports for the third quarter today. They made a combined profit of about NT$13.031 billion. This is a good change from the second quarter when they lost NT$25.07 billion. Three of the companies (Nanya Plastics, Formosa Chemicals & Fibre, and Formosa Petrochemical) made a profit, while only Formosa Plastics had a small loss.</p>
            <p>Nanya Plastics made a net profit of NT$3.26 billion in the third quarter. This is a big improvement from a loss of about NT$4.1 billion in the second quarter. It is also much more than the NT$65.76 million profit in the same period last year. The earnings per share for the quarter were NT$0.41.</p>
            <p>Nanya Plastics said that its profits grew in the third quarter because of higher profits from high-end electronic materials like IC substrates, and stable profits from plastic processing products. Also, its investment companies, Nanya Technology and Formosa Petrochemical, started making money again this quarter. The exchange rate also became stable, which greatly reduced losses from foreign currency exchanges. This led to the highest profit for Nanya Plastics in almost two years.</p>
            <p>Formosa Chemicals & Fibre made a net profit of NT$1.787 billion in the third quarter. This is a good change from a loss of about NT$6.8 billion in the second quarter and a loss of about NT$1.9 billion in the same period last year. The earnings per share for the quarter were NT$0.3.</p>
            <p>Formosa Chemicals & Fibre said that the company improved its main business losses in the third quarter by changing its production and sales plans, reducing inventory, and actively selling products to keep prices steady. Along with more investment income from companies like Formosa Petrochemical, a stable exchange rate, and other income like cash dividends, these factors helped the company make a profit in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>Formosa Petrochemical made a net profit of NT$8.584 billion in the third quarter. This was the highest profit among the four companies this quarter. It is a big improvement from a net loss of about NT$7.5 billion in the second quarter and a net loss of about NT$3 billion in the same period last year. The earnings per share for the quarter were NT$0.9.</p>
            <p>Formosa Petrochemical said that its operations turned profitable in the third quarter for several reasons. One reason is that its first heavy oil cracking unit (RCC#1) finished its regular check in the second quarter. So, in the third quarter, the refinery's capacity use increased by 12.4% to 90.3% compared to the second quarter. Also, conflicts around the world increased in the third quarter, and Western countries put more restrictions on Russia's oil exports. This kept crude oil prices high, and losses from buying materials and inventory decreased a lot.</p>
            <p>Formosa Plastics had a net loss of about NT$600 million in the third quarter. It was the only one of the four companies that lost money. However, this loss was much smaller than the loss of about NT$6.6 billion in the second quarter or the loss of about NT$3 billion in the same period last year. The net loss per share for the quarter was NT$0.09.</p>
            <p>Formosa Plastics explained that in the third quarter, the prices of its main products fell by 4% to 15% compared to the second quarter. This was because of tariffs from the US and more chemical products being made by competitors in China, which reduced demand. However, the company's total loss was smaller because it received more cash dividends and investment income.</p>
