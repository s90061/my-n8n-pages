Young people, known as Gen Z (born roughly between 1997 and 2012), are changing how we shop. A recent report shows their unique spending habits. They often use social media, like TikTok, to find new products and decide what to buy. They prefer to shop from brands that care about important issues, like the environment or social justice.

Unlike older generations, Gen Z doesn't just want to own things. They value experiences, like concerts or travel, more than physical goods. They also like to support smaller businesses and artists they discover online. Stores are now trying to create more exciting shopping experiences to attract these young customers, offering things like interactive displays or special events. This generation's choices are pushing companies to be more honest and to offer products that fit a modern, digital lifestyle.

**How AI Will Change Our Jobs, Not Replace Them**

Many people worry that artificial intelligence (AI) will take away jobs. However, a recent report from the World Economic Forum suggests a different future. Most workers believe AI will not replace them completely. Instead, they think it will change the way they work.

AI will make some tasks easier and faster, allowing people to focus on more creative or complex parts of their jobs. For example, AI can help with data analysis or writing basic reports. This means workers will need to learn new skills, especially in technology and problem-solving. Companies are encouraged to offer training programs to help employees adapt. The report says that in the future, humans and AI will work together, making workplaces more efficient and allowing people to do more interesting work.

**Dealing with Too Many Tourists in Popular Places**

Many popular travel destinations around the world are facing a problem called "overtourism." This means too many tourists visit at once, which can harm the environment, bother local people, and make the travel experience less enjoyable. Places like Venice in Italy or certain islands in Thailand are struggling with large crowds, litter, and damage to natural sites.

To solve this, some places are trying new rules. For example, they might limit the number of visitors per day, charge higher fees, or ban large cruise ships from their city centers. Local communities are also trying to encourage tourists to visit less famous areas or to travel during off-peak seasons. The goal is to find a balance, so tourism can continue to help local economies without destroying the beauty and peace of these special places for everyone.
