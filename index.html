The US military announced today that it will send 200 Marines to Florida. Their job will be to help the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with office work and other support tasks.

The Marines will only do non-law enforcement duties inside ICE buildings. They will focus on administrative and logistical tasks. They are not allowed to directly contact people held by ICE or be part of any evidence handling.

Last month, the US Department of Defense said it could use up to 700 staff members to help ICE in Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.

**Fan Page Owner Accused of Threatening Jinghua City Case Prosecutor; Detained**

Online, there were angry pictures and words targeting the prosecutors in the Jinghua City case. Police called a man named Dai, who is an engineer and runs the Facebook page "Memes of Taiwanese Democracy," for questioning. He was then sent to the Taipei Prosecutors Office. Early this morning, they asked the court to hold him and not allow him to see anyone.

Police also found that two other people, a man named Zhou and a woman named Lin, who are a couple in Taichung, edited and shared the original picture from Mr. Dai. Police went to Taichung last night and brought them back to Taipei for questioning. They are expected to be sent to the Taipei Prosecutors Office today.

Recently, some people posted the names and photos of 11 prosecutors involved in the Jinghua City case online. They even added fake blood to the pictures and used threatening words like "a life for a life" and "remember their names and faces." Similar angry posts with photos of judges were also shared.

The Taipei Prosecutors Office, Ministry of Justice, and other legal groups strongly condemned these threats. The "Memes of Taiwanese Democracy" Facebook page said that the owner, Mr. Dai, found and posted the photos himself and that it was not connected to other political groups.

Police found that Mr. Dai, a 39-year-old IT engineer from Xizhi District, New Taipei City, was the owner of the page. He told the police that he found and posted the photos of the prosecutors online but said he did not add the blood or threaten anyone.

After questioning Mr. Dai, the police searched his home with his permission. He was then taken for more questioning. Last night, he was sent to the Taipei Prosecutors Office for threatening safety and breaking personal data protection laws. After more questioning overnight, the prosecutor asked to hold him and not allow him to see anyone early this morning.

**Johnny Depp Case Called a Big Reality Show: Live Court Broadcasts Cause Debate in US**

Taiwan's parliament has passed a new law about live court broadcasts, and people are watching what will happen next. In the US, rules for live court broadcasts are different in various courts and states. Three years ago, the live broadcast of actor Johnny Depp's defamation case got millions of viewers and became very popular online. But there are different opinions about it.

In 2022, when Johnny Depp sued his ex-wife Amber Heard for defamation, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live. This made the civil case a global topic. Some media even called it a "court reality show" watched by millions.

During that time, the trial was streamed live on YouTube. Short videos of important parts were quickly made by internet users and shared widely on TikTok and Instagram. From the expressions of the people involved to witness answers, these clips were turned into internet memes with captions and music.

Whether US courts allow live broadcasts depends on the court level and the state. Federal courts have usually not allowed recording or broadcasting for a long time. State courts, however, can be more flexible, and judges can decide. The Johnny Depp case was heard in a Virginia court, which allowed the full live broadcast. This shows how live court broadcasts are handled differently in American legal practice.

In Johnny Depp's case, there were both good and bad opinions about live court broadcasts. Some experts and human rights groups are worried about live broadcasts in court. They think that in the age of social media, live court broadcasts might become a popularity contest, making the legal arguments less important. Also, too much public exposure could hurt the people involved again and affect the fairness of the trial.

Professor Michele Dauber from Stanford University Law School said that the trial became an "internet farce." She believes that in cases about violence in relationships or sexual violence, live court broadcasts make the people involved "judged twice, in court and online." She worries that a public judging atmosphere might make the weaker party choose to stay silent.

She criticized that live broadcasts change serious legal processes into a popularity contest and a dramatic show.

For example, Amber Heard was attacked on social media during the trial. Videos of her were edited and shared widely on TikTok and YouTube, leading to worries about "public opinion trials." Some comments suggested that public opinion was already decided before the jury made their decision, which could put pressure on the jury.

Supporters believe that live broadcasts make the justice system more open. They let the public see the entire trial directly, without relying on second-hand reports from the media. This helps people trust the fairness of the trial more.

Judge Penney Azcarate, who oversaw the case, said at the time, "I don't see any good reason not to make this trial public." She thought that live broadcasts could reduce misunderstandings compared to short media reports.

Some legal experts say that open access has educational value for law. Emily D. Baker, a legal influencer, streamed live on YouTube and explained the trial as it happened, attracting many viewers. She believes that "seeing how the court works in real life is more real than any textbook."

This is not the first time live court broadcasts have caused debate in the US. In 1995, the trial of football star O.J. Simpson, who was accused of killing his wife, was broadcast live. This became one of the most debated cases in US legal history.

In the O.J. Simpson case, the trial became too dramatic and was used as entertainment by the media. Even though the jury was kept isolated, the huge amount of media attention could still affect their decision. Also, the people involved and witnesses faced privacy and safety worries, and some witnesses chose not to speak.

The O.J. Simpson case made the US legal community think again. To balance public trials and fair trials, federal courts became more careful about live broadcasts afterward.
