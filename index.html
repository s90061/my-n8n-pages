            <h1>China Shares Records About Japanese Forces Forcing Workers 94 Years After September 18 Incident</h1>
            <p>Today is the 94th anniversary of the September 18 Incident in China. State media, CCTV, reported this morning that the Heilongjiang Provincial Archives shared 62 special documents for the first time. These documents are about Japanese forces making Chinese workers work during the invasion.</p>
            <p>According to CCTV news, these documents are from the time when Japan controlled the area. They show rules for using and controlling workers. They also show plans for taking workers and how this was done. The documents describe the very bad treatment of workers and their fights against it. They explain how, after the September 18 Incident, Japan forced people to work for 14 years in Northeast China.</p>
            <p>The report says that the forced laborers were treated very badly. Their living conditions were terrible. The documents show they did not have enough food. They also did not have warm clothes. They had to do very hard work. Many workers tried to escape because they could not stand it. The Japanese forces caught them, punished their families, and even killed them. They took away their freedom and basic human respect.</p>
            <p>Nie Boxin, who is in charge of sorting documents at the Heilongjiang Provincial Archives, said these documents are important for studying history. They also strongly show that Japanese groups who deny or make their past crimes seem better are wrong. These documents are shared to remember the sad history, keep justice, and tell everyone to value peace and stop war.</p>
            <p>This year is also 80 years since China won the Anti-Japanese War. Before September 18, the Japanese Embassy in China sent emails to Japanese people in China. It told them to "be careful of strong anti-Japanese feelings."</p>

            <h1>Shen Yu-lin Shares Family Jokes on TV Show, Says Daughter Has His Funny Side</h1>
            <p>The artist Shen Yu-lin recently shared that he has leukemia, a type of blood cancer. He is now actively fighting the disease and hopes to return to work soon. Before he got sick, he appeared on the TV show "Who's Coming to Dinner?" On the show, he visited the Po-hsien family, who are farmers in Yunlin. During the show, Shen Yu-lin told funny stories about his family. He said that his daughter has his sense of humor.</p>
            <p>Before his illness, Shen Yu-lin visited the Po-hsien family in Taisi Township, Yunlin County, for the show "Who's Coming to Dinner?" The family works on a farm with their father. The show's team said in a press release that Shen Yu-lin is not only funny on TV. As soon as he arrived, he made the whole family laugh. At the dinner table, Shen Yu-lin ate the homemade food and joked, "The best food is food that brings happiness."</p>
            <p>People talked about how a sense of humor develops. Shen Yu-lin laughed and said it must be something people are born with. He said his father was not a typical strict soldier. He said, "My father was not a traditional, serious dad. He did not make us stand straight at home. He was born with a sense of humor. So, I think it might be about DNA."</p>
            <p>Shen Yu-lin married his wife, Ya-ya, in 2010. They have one daughter. When asked how he manages his busy work and family life, Shen Yu-lin said he spends time with his daughter before she goes to school. He said, "For three years, I have made myself wake up early every day. This is to use the five minutes before my child gets on the school bus. That is our time to be together as father and daughter."</p>
            <p>Even though he has a close bond with his daughter, Shen Yu-lin also said that she treats him differently from her mother. For example, for Mother's Day, his daughter always works very hard to prepare something. But for Father's Day, his daughter says she must treat both parents the same. She wants to celebrate Father's Day by singing a song for him. However, when she starts to sing, it is "Only Mama Is Good in This World." This made Shen Yu-lin laugh and say, "My daughter really got my humor."</p>
