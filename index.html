            <h1>NASA's First Crewed Mission Around the Moon is Going Well, Planned for April 2026 Launch</h1>
            <p>NASA said today that the first mission with people, called "Artemis 2," is going well. It is part of the "Artemis program." The plan is to launch it in April 2026, and it might even launch earlier in February 2026.</p>
            <p>The "Artemis program" is NASA's main plan to go back to the Moon. This space exploration plan costs billions of dollars. It is competing with a similar Moon landing plan from China. China wants to send people to the Moon for the first time before 2030.</p>
            <p>Lakiesha Hawkins, a high-level official at NASA, said today at a meeting, "We truly plan to keep this promise." She added that if the rocket and spaceship are ready sooner, they might launch earlier. But the most important rule is always the safety of the mission.</p>
            <p>The "Artemis 2" mission will last for 10 days. Four astronauts will be on it: three from the United States and one from Canada. They will travel around the Moon in a spaceship and then come back to Earth.</p>
            <p>This mission will not land on the Moon. Landing on the Moon is the goal for "Artemis 3."</p>
            <p>During his second term as President, Donald Trump continued to ask NASA to make the space program faster.</p>
            <p>This Republican leader started the Artemis program in his first term. He wants NASA to go back to the Moon quickly and then go to Mars.</p>

            <h1>Li Chenggang Meets US Midwest Business Group, Focuses on US-China Trade</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce said on September 23 that Li Chenggang met with a group of business and government leaders from the US Midwest on September 22. Li Chenggang is China's international trade negotiator and a vice minister. They talked about trade between the US and China, and also about trade cooperation between US states and Chinese provinces.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce shared this news on its official website on September 23. However, they did not give many details.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that experts believe food exports from the US Midwest will be very important in any trade deal between the US and China.</p>
            <p>The report also said that China is the biggest buyer of soybeans in the world. But China has not yet bought any soybean shipments from the US fall harvest. Traders say that most of these soybeans come from the US Midwest.</p>
            <p>Trade experts expect that US President Donald Trump wants China to agree to buy more US farm products and things like Boeing planes. This would be part of a deal to stop the taxes on goods between the two biggest economies in the world.</p>

            <h1>Leaders from Countries Friendly with Taiwan Attend 'Taiwan Friendship Night' During UN General Assembly</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York held a "Taiwan Friendship Night" on the first day of the United Nations General Assembly. Many leaders from countries friendly with Taiwan and members of the UN General Assembly attended. Yu Da-tsui, Taiwan's representative to the US, said that Taiwan is like a light of democracy in the Indo-Pacific area. It is also in a very important place for international strategy. Taiwan will continue to make its friendships stronger with friendly countries and countries that share similar ideas.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Friendship Night" party happened in the main hall of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York. This was on the first day of the 80th United Nations General Assembly. More than one hundred people came. These included Yu Da-tsui (Taiwan's representative to the US), Li Chih-chiang (Director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York), Li Yu-chieh (Advisor to the National Security Council), Hilda Heine (President of the Marshall Islands), Ralph Gonsalves (Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines), and many foreign ministers from friendly countries, as well as officials from UN General Assembly groups and UN representative groups.</p>
            <p>Yu Da-tsui gave a speech and thanked friendly countries and countries with similar ideas. He thanked them for continuing to help Taiwan take part in the United Nations and its special groups, as well as other ways of working together internationally.</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan is an important example of democracy in the Indo-Pacific region. It is also a key location for international travel by sea and air. Taiwan will keep working to make its important friendships stronger with friendly countries and countries with similar ideas. They will work together to face future problems and create a good future with democracy, peace, and lasting wealth for everyone.</p>
            <p>President Hilda Heine of the Marshall Islands said again that her country's government and people are firmly committed to their friendship with Taiwan. She praised Taiwan for its important help with health care, climate change, and working faster to reach goals for lasting development. She said that letting Taiwan take part in a practical way helps to make the UN's ideas about human rights for all people real, and also its goal of "leaving no one behind."</p>
            <p>Other people also led groups to the event. These included Francis Fonseca (Foreign Minister of Belize), Pholile Shakantu (Foreign Minister of Eswatini), Denzil Douglas (Foreign Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis), Alva Baptiste (Foreign Minister of Saint Lucia), Maina Talia (Climate Minister of Tuvalu), and Blesoch Aderkeroi (Member of Parliament from Palau). They all showed their strong support for Taiwan to be part of the United Nations system.</p>
