https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nvg84149eo

Families in the UK are finding it very hard to afford basic things like food and heating, according to recent reports from charities. Many are cutting back on essentials because prices continue to go up quickly. Food banks are seeing more and more people who need help, including those who have jobs but still can't make ends meet.

Charities say that the problem isn't just about food. People are also struggling to pay for their energy bills, rent, and other necessary expenses. Some families are skipping meals or turning off their heating to save money. This situation is making daily life very difficult for many households across the country. Experts are worried that without more support, more families will fall into serious money problems as prices remain high.

**New Rules Make Flexible Working Easier for Employees**

https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68742512

Employees in the UK now have a new legal right to ask their employers for flexible working arrangements from their first day at a new job. This change means it will be easier for people to ask to work different hours or from different places, like working from home. Before, workers usually had to wait 26 weeks before they could make such a request.

The new rules mean that employers must deal with requests for flexible working in a more structured way. They need to respond faster and discuss the request with the employee before saying no. This change aims to give employees more control over where and when they work, helping them balance their job with their personal lives, such as childcare or other responsibilities. It is hoped that this will make workplaces more adaptable and supportive.
