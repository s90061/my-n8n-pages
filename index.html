            <h1>Micron Expects Better Sales in Q1 Due to High Demand for AI Chips</h1>
            <p>Micron Technology expects its sales for the first quarter to be better than what experts thought. This is because there is a very high demand for its special memory chips, called High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). HBM chips are very important for companies that are working on Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>
            <p>News reports say that companies are building new AI systems and making their data centers bigger. This has made the demand for Micron's HBM chips go up a lot.</p>
            <p>TSMC, another big technology company, will work with Micron. They will help make the basic parts for Micron's new HBM4E chips. These will include both special versions and standard versions.</p>
            <p>Nvidia is the company with the highest value in the world. So, all the main memory chip companies want to sell their HBM to Nvidia. Micron already sells some HBM chips that Nvidia uses in its products.</p>
            <p>Micron's CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, said in a meeting about money that the company's HBM sales in the fourth quarter grew to almost 2 billion US dollars. This means that if sales continue like this for a year, they would be nearly 8 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>HBM is a type of memory. It works by stacking many chips on top of each other. This way, it uses less power and can process a lot of data quickly. This is very important for creating new AI technologies.</p>
            <p>Mr. Mehrotra also said that Micron expects to sign contracts in the next few months. These contracts will make sure that all HBM chips for the year 2026 are already sold. The prices for HBM3E chips are mostly set. But they are still talking about the prices for the newer HBM4 chips.</p>
            <p>Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer, said that "the price for HBM4 is actually much higher than for HBM3E. Because the industry is very busy, we think our HBM business will make a lot of money."</p>
            <p>Micron expects its sales for the first quarter to be around 12.5 billion US dollars, which could go up or down by 300 million US dollars. Experts had thought the average sales would be 11.94 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Micron also expects its adjusted profit margin to be 51.5%. This is much higher than the 45.9% that experts had expected.</p>
            <p>Chen Jing-gai, an analyst from Summit Insights, a company that gives financial advice, said that the profit margin is higher because "the prices are better than we thought."</p>
            <p>Micron's adjusted profit per share in the fourth quarter was 3.03 US dollars. This was more than what experts had predicted.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Micron received 6.2 billion US dollars from the US government. This money came from the "CHIPS and Science Act," a plan supported by former US President Biden.</p>

            <h1>AstraZeneca Buys NAGH for 20 Billion NTD, Becomes a Top 20 Specialty Drug Company</h1>
            <p>Today, the drug company AstraZeneca announced that it has signed a final agreement. It will buy all shares of New Alvogen Group Holdings, Inc. (NAGH) for about 658 million US dollars (around 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars). NAGH owns Alvogen US, which is a private drug company in America. This purchase will make AstraZeneca one of the top 20 special drug companies in the world.</p>
            <p>Shen Ye, the Vice General Manager of AstraZeneca, said that after the deal is finished, the total sales and profits before certain costs will double. This deal adds new products that go well with AstraZeneca's current products, bringing the total number of products to nearly 100. AstraZeneca will also get its own sales team in the US. This will make AstraZeneca's business stronger. The company will also benefit from a factory in the US that has a good record with the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).</p>
            <p>He also said that this deal joins two large drug companies. This will help AstraZeneca keep its strong position in Asia. It will also gain new abilities in research, making drugs, and selling in America. This will let AstraZeneca sell its special medicines all over the world. It will also help AstraZeneca enter the biggest medicine market in the world, which will help it grow more in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shen Ye mentioned that the total value of this deal is about 2 billion US dollars (60.578 billion New Taiwan Dollars). The deal includes money, special shares, and extra payments that depend on how well the company does in the future. This deal still needs to be approved by the right government offices.</p>

            <h1>Mudslides Block Caixia Tunnel on Southern Cross-Island Highway; Road Expected to Reopen by Sept 25 Evening</h1>
            <p>Due to several days of rain, parts of the Southern Cross-Island Highway, from Xiangyang to Chulai in Taitung, have had many landslides and mudslides. The Caixia Tunnel is now full of mud and rocks. The road is expected to be clear by the evening of September 25th.</p>
            <p>The Guanshan Road Section of the Highway Bureau said this morning that Typhoon Hua Jiansha caused more than 550 millimeters of very heavy rain in Haiduan Township, Taitung County, in the last 24 hours. Because of this, a part of Provincial Highway 20, from kilometer 149+110 to 199+000 (from Xiangyang to Chulai), was closed as a safety measure.</p>
            <p>Early this morning, workers from the Guanshan Road Section checked the road. They found that the road foundation collapsed at kilometer 150+100. Also, there were many landslides and mudslides at other places like 155+100, 161+100, 163+000, 170+100, 179+200, 180+100, 181+800, 185+600, 188+600 (Caixia Tunnel), and 190+600. These blocked the road in both directions. The Caixia Tunnel was particularly affected by the mudslides.</p>
            <p>The Guanshan Road Section stated that they have sent special machines and workers to clear the road. They plan to open the road again by 5 PM on September 25th. The Guanshan Road Section also advises visitors who want to go to the mountains to first check when the road is closed and what the conditions are like in the mountains. Before going up, it is very important to check the weather. If it is raining or very foggy, it is best to avoid going to the mountains.</p>
