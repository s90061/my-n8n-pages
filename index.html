Taiwan's financial authority (FSC) has made new rules for life insurance companies. These rules will help them get ready for new international accounting standards next year. The companies can now use up to 40% of their extra money, called "liability reserves."

This money can be used in two ways: to help with losses from currency changes or to be added to their profits before taxes. This new rule started today and can be used for their financial reports in June. Experts believe this will greatly help insurance companies deal with money lost due to currency changes.

If companies choose to add the money to their profits before taxes, they will pay a 20% tax. Also, if they make money this year, 30% of their profit before taxes must be saved to help with currency changes. This helps to make sure companies are stable.

**Bison Dies in Yellowstone Hot Spring, Tourist Records It**

A wild bison in Yellowstone National Park sadly fell into a very hot spring and died. A visitor used their camera to record the moment. This happened on June 21st, near a famous hot spring called Grand Prismatic Spring.

A tourist named Louise Howard from Colorado was watching the colorful hot spring. She saw two bison and thought it was a good chance for a photo. One bison went near the hot water, stepped in shallow water, and quickly came out. But then, the bison slipped and fell into the hot spring.

Louise said the bison tried to get out but couldn't. Scientists say it's rare but not new for animals to fall into these hot springs. The water was about 88.89 degrees Celsius (192 degrees Fahrenheit). The bison died very quickly. This event was different because it happened during the day in a very busy part of the park.

**China Says Its Aircraft Carriers Finished Training, Claims Foreign Forces Followed Them**

China announced that its two aircraft carriers, Liaoning and Shandong, have finished their training in far-away waters. They have now returned to port. China said that foreign military ships and planes came too close and watched their carriers many times during the training. The Chinese carriers stayed alert and responded to these actions, sending out their fighter jets multiple times.

Taiwan's security experts said this was the first time both Chinese carrier groups went into the West Pacific together. They believe China wants to show its power around the islands and practice blocking sea and air routes. During the training, a Chinese military plane flew too close to a Japanese anti-submarine plane, and Japan protested about it.

The Chinese carriers trained in different areas, practicing things like taking off and landing jets and watching other ships. One carrier group went near the Philippines and Japan before returning home. Taiwan's experts say China wants to show its strong presence in the Indo-Pacific region.
