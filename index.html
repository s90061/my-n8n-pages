            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Helps People Repair Homes by Connecting Them with Companies</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest affected the southern part of Taiwan. Many people's homes were badly damaged. Today, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) announced that there are not enough workers or building materials right now. So, the MOTC has asked different departments to help connect people with construction companies. They want to help residents find workers to fix their houses.</p>
            <p>The MOTC wrote on its Facebook page today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po held a meeting yesterday. He brought together different departments to check how repairs are going in the damaged areas of Tainan. They also talked about how to move forward. So far, they have visited over 100 damaged homes. They are still looking for more workers and resources to help people rebuild their homes as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>The MOTC explained that because there is a lack of workers and materials, people cannot find repair teams. There are also not enough people or machines. The government has gathered many ministries and given each one an area to take care of. The MOTC is responsible for the areas of Xinying, Yanshui, Baihe, and Houbi in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The MOTC said that people who need to repair their homes can first register with their local district chief. The MOTC will then use its different teams to connect these residents with companies that can do the repairs. After this, the residents and the companies will talk and agree on the work. Then, they will sign a simple contract. The MOTC's main job is to help connect people with companies; it does not provide money for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To speed up the rebuilding after the disaster, the MOTC has also set some rules. Besides connecting people with companies, they will first help old, one-story houses that have damaged roofs and cannot be lived in. This is urgent help. Materials like broken asbestos tiles will be gathered in one place. The local district office will then help to remove them.</p>

            <h1>Shigeru Ishiba Shows Concern for Flood Victims in Central and Southern Taiwan; Joseph Wu Thanks Japan and Hopes for Future Cooperation</h1>
            <p>Recently, heavy rains caused floods and damage in Taiwan. Japan's Prime Minister, Shigeru Ishiba, wrote a message to show his concern for Taiwan. Today, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stated that Foreign Minister Joseph Wu thanked Japan again for its care. He also hoped that Taiwan and Japan can work together to solve future problems. Both MOFA and Taiwan's office in Japan have already thanked the Japanese government.</p>
            <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba wrote his message to express his sympathy to Taiwan. In his message, he said he was very sad for those who lost their lives and their families. He also truly felt for the people who were affected by the disaster. He prayed that they would return to their normal lives soon, saying, "Go Taiwan!" The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association later shared his message on Facebook in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Because of this, MOFA released a press statement in the afternoon. It said that MOFA and Taiwan's office in Japan quickly thanked the Japanese government very sincerely.</p>
            <p>MOFA added that Prime Minister Ishiba also sent a message on July 12 to show his concern after Typhoon Danas hit Taiwan. This shows the deep and real friendship between Taiwan and Japan. The government of Taiwan and many different groups in society are still working very hard to help with the disaster and fix things. They are helping the people who were affected to rebuild their homes and get back to their normal lives quickly.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that Foreign Minister Joseph Wu again truly thanked the Japanese government for its warm care and honest help. He also hopes that Taiwan and Japan will continue to work more deeply together in different areas in the future. This will help them build a stronger, more friendly, and tougher partnership to face all kinds of problems together.</p>
