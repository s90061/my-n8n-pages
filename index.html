            <h1>Discussing Ukraine's Security Guarantees, Zelensky Hopes for High-Level Talks Next Week</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky asked allied countries today to quickly hold high-level talks about Ukraine's security. At the same time, defense ministers from EU countries promised to train Ukrainian soldiers in Ukraine if there is a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Kyiv is working hard to end the war with Russia, which is now in its fourth year. Ukraine also wants to make sure its partner countries promise to protect it from any future attacks.</p>
            <p>President Zelensky said he expects to meet with European leaders next week. He wants them to promise to protect Ukraine in a way similar to NATO. He also said that former U.S. President Donald Trump should be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>He explained, "We need everyone to clearly understand this plan." He added that he wants to tell Trump "our ideas."</p>
            <p>Even though Trump met with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders separately this month, efforts to end Russia's full invasion have not been very successful yet.</p>
            <p>Zelensky also mentioned a deadline set by Trump. Trump recently said that if Russian President Putin does not agree to a one-on-one meeting with Zelensky, he will decide on new actions against Russia.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Kaja Kallas, a top official for foreign and security policy in the European Union (EU), said that EU defense ministers met in Copenhagen today. They showed "wide support" for expanding the EU's military training mission into Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Trump seemed more willing to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. He said that Europe must take on more responsibility for making Ukraine safer.</p>
            <p>Kallas wrote on social media platform X: "The EU has already trained more than 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers. We must be ready to do more."</p>
            <p>Russia has always been against any NATO forces being in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Zelensky said he hopes that the parliaments of allied countries will approve security promises. He also spoke about an agreement from 1994, where Kyiv gave up its nuclear weapons for security promises. He said this was not enough to stop Russia.</p>
            <p>He said, "We want security promises that are legally binding. We do not want another Budapest Memorandum."</p>

            <h1>Poor German Economic Data Leads to Decline in European Stocks</h1>

            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 137.71 points, or 0.57%. It closed at 23902.21 points.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London fell by 29.48 points, or 0.32%. It closed at 9187.34 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris dropped by 58.70 points, or 0.76%. It closed at 7703.90 points.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Narrowly Loses to Danish Star Antonsen, Misses Badminton World Championships Semi-finals</h1>
            <p>At the BWF World Badminton Championships in France, Taiwan's top male player, Chou Tien-chen, played against Danish star Anders Antonsen in the men's quarterfinals today. Chou unfortunately lost with scores of 17 to 21 and 21 to 23. This means he did not reach the semi-finals.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen won a bronze medal at the 2022 World Championships. Even though he is 35 years old, he is still a very good player in the world of badminton. He is currently ranked 6th in the world. He was Taiwan's last hope in singles at this year's championships. In today's quarterfinal match, he played against Anders Antonsen, who is ranked 2nd in the world. They know each other well. In their 13 past matches, Chou had won 8 times and lost 5 times, meaning he had a slight advantage. However, in their recent games, Chou had lost more than he won.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first game, both players used careful strategies. This meant many shots went back and forth, and it took a lot of effort to score a point. This really tested how fit both players were. Chou showed his well-known defensive skills and was leading by 2 points when they took a short break. But later in the game, he could not stop his opponent's strong attacks. He also made a serving mistake at an important moment, and so Chou lost the first game 17 to 21.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen was in a tough situation in the second game. He continued to fight closely with Antonsen at the beginning. But after the short break, Chou suddenly scored 5 points in a row, giving him a 6-point lead. However, he then lost points one after another and almost lost his lead. Luckily, he still managed to get 3 chances to win the game. But Antonsen stopped all of them. In the end, Chou hit the shuttlecock into the net, and he narrowly lost the game 21 to 23. This meant he could not reach the men's semi-finals.</p>
