            <h1>Official Document Shared Online; FDA Head Apologizes, Staff Member Punished</h1>
            <p>The head of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Jiang Zhi-gang, said sorry today. This was because an employee took a picture of an official paper from KMT lawmaker Wang Hung-wei and posted it online. Mr. Jiang said this is completely wrong. The employee who did it has been punished and moved to a different job. The FDA will teach its staff better ways to handle official papers.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei wrote on Facebook that on August 1st, she sent letters to different government groups asking for information about their projects. But on the morning of August 6th, someone from the Food and Drug Administration took a photo of her official letter. They then shared it on the social media site Threads and made fun of it. This action goes against being fair in the government and also against rules for handling documents from the Executive Yuan.</p>
            <p>This morning, Jiang Zhi-gang went to a meeting at the Legislative Yuan. Before the meeting, reporters asked him about Wang Hung-wei's paper being photographed and shared. He said he was very sorry and that he should officially apologize to the public.</p>
            <p>Jiang Zhi-gang said, "This kind of behavior is absolutely not allowed." He explained that they immediately started to look into the matter and began an investigation. After they found out what happened, they quickly punished the employee who was involved. They moved this employee to a different job. The FDA will not let any employee break rules when handling official papers. The agency will teach and explain more about this to its staff.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Yang-liu Affects 5 Provincial Road Sections, Causing Blocks</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yang-liu caused damage to roads. Today, the Highway Bureau said that as of 8 AM, 5 roads are still blocked. One of them is the temporary road on Provincial Highway 20, close to Kilometer 93, between Qinhe and Fuxing in Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung City. This section is expected to open again by 5 PM.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Yang-liu has moved away. This morning, the Central Weather Administration removed the typhoon warning. The Highway Bureau said in a press release that by 10 PM last night, 19 road sections were closed to prevent danger. After checking them at 8 AM today, 5 roads are still blocked.
