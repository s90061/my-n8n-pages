            <h1>Landlord of World University Games Relay Station Supports Taiwan: Will Continue to Proudly Display Taiwan Flag</h1>
            <p>During the Rhine-Ruhr World University Games in Germany, the landlord of Taiwan's team relay station in Essen was pressured by the local city government to take down the national flag. This morning, the landlord responded by saying they would "continue to proudly display the Taiwan flag." They will do this to show their support for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team rented a professional physical therapy clinic in Essen, one of the host cities for the World University Games. This clinic, named "Physiotherapie Essen â€“ Phillip DÃ¶rmann," served as a relay station. It offered a place for Taiwanese athletes to train daily, receive care, and rest.</p>
            <p>On Tuesday (July 22), the Essen Mayor's office asked Phillip DÃ¶rmann, the landlord of the relay station, to remove the Taiwan national flag hanging at the clinic's entrance. After hearing about this, Taiwan's representative in Germany, Hsieh Chih-wei, sent a letter of protest to Essen Mayor Thomas Kufen. He also sent a copy of the letter to Mr. DÃ¶rmann, the owner of the clinic and landlord of the relay station.</p>
            <p>Today, Mr. Hsieh shared Mr. DÃ¶rmann's reply on his personal Facebook page. Mr. DÃ¶rmann wrote: "My physical therapy team and I fully support Taiwan!" He also said that he and his team were very honored to help the Taiwan team during the World University Games.</p>
            <p>Mr. DÃ¶rmann believes that Taiwan's national flag should naturally be displayed inside and outside the physical therapy clinic during the games. He said he was "very surprised and disappointed" by the Essen city government's request to remove the flag. He apologized to Taiwan for the trouble this incident caused.</p>
            <p>He also promised that "Physiotherapie Essen â€“ Phillip DÃ¶rmann" will use its social media and other available ways to keep "proudly showing the Taiwan flag."</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsieh was very touched by Mr. DÃ¶rmann's words and shared the original letter on Facebook. Yesterday morning, he also received an official reply from Essen Mayor Kufen. In the letter, Mayor Kufen formally apologized to Taiwan for the city mayor's office asking Mr. DÃ¶rmann to remove the Taiwan flag.</p>
            <p>The Rhine-Ruhr World University Games are held from July 16 to 27. Taiwan sent 196 athletes to compete in 15 sports. Following their experience from last year's Paris Olympics, the Taiwan team set up this relay station. It provides food, physical therapy, sports protection, nutrition, and mental health help for athletes outside the competition venues.</p>
            <p>Physiotherapie Essen â€“ Phillip DÃ¶rmann has a perfect 5.0-star rating on Google Maps and is also an LGBTQ+ friendly place. Besides the clinic's original space and equipment, teams from Taiwan's National Sports Training Center and National Sports Science Center also brought in their own equipment. This allows athletes to exercise at the relay station or use physical therapy and sports protection services whenever needed.</p>
            <p>During the games, Mr. DÃ¶rmann's team posted on the clinic's official Instagram, saying it was a "great honor" to welcome athletes from Taiwan during the World University Games. They praised the Taiwan relay station team for their hard work, passion, and teamwork. (Edited by Chen Cheng-yi) 1140725</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Men's Basketball Loses by 2 Points to Poland at World University Games, Misses Best Team Record</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's men's basketball team played a 9th to 12th place game at the Rhine-Ruhr World University Games in Germany. Hsu Te-chi scored a team-high 17 points and had 5 assists. However, Taiwan still lost to Poland 87 to 89. This means they will not break their best team record.</p>
            <p>At the last World University Games in Chengdu, China, Taiwan's men's basketball team achieved their best record by finishing 11th. This time, the team is still led by You Ai-che, a player who plays abroad. Other players include Lin Hsin-kuan and Chen Fan-po-yen, who play professional basketball in Taiwan. But because they only won one game in the group stage, they could not make it to the top 8. Luckily, after beating India by a large margin yesterday, the Taiwan team moved on to the 9th to 12th place games.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's men's basketball team played against Poland today. They aimed to move on to the 9th or 10th place game and set a new best record for the team. They started the first quarter well. But in the second quarter, their shooting percentage went down, and Taiwan's team went into halftime trailing by 2 points.</p>
            <p>After halftime, the game was still very close. Taiwan's team kept the score tight. At the start of the fourth quarter, they made a 9-3 run and took the lead again. Even though Poland then caught up, Li Yun-chieh and Sung Hsin-hao made shots from outside right before the end of the game. This helped Taiwan's team tie the score and gave them a chance to go into overtime.</p>
            <p>However, with two points down, Hsu Te-chi took the last shot but missed. So, Taiwan's men's basketball team lost closely to Poland. This means they missed setting their best team record. Now, they will play Latvia for 11th place. If they lose that game, they will finish 12th in this World University Games.</p>
            <p>In this game, five players from Taiwan's men's basketball team scored double digits. Hsu Te-chi scored the most with 17 points, also adding 5 assists and 2 steals. Shooter Li Yun-chieh played for less than 12 minutes but scored 14 points efficiently, including four three-pointers. Team captain You Ai-che showed his all-around skills, getting 10 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals. (Edited by Chen Yen-chun) 1140724</p>
