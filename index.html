            <h1>Private Company Donates Canvas, Helping 70 Families in Taibao Get Temporary Covers</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Tsai Zhi-mi, Chiayi County, July 19) Typhoon Danas blew off many roofs in Taibao City, Chiayi County. Because of this, Fuxiong Engineering Company gave more than a hundred pieces of canvas to the Taibao City Office. This helped families in need who were affected by the storm. Now, almost 70 homes have temporary covers to protect them from the wind and rain.</p>
            <p>The Taibao City Office released a press statement today. It said that Mr. Liu Yi-liang, who is the chairman of Fuxiong Engineering Company, gave over a hundred large canvases to the city office for disaster relief. This happened because of help from Mr. Huang Rong-li, a DPP Chiayi County councilor, and Mr. Wu Hong-zhe, a representative from Taibao City.</p>
            <p>Mayor Zheng Shufen said that Mr. Liu Yi-liang learned what the people affected by the disaster needed. He immediately moved the canvas from his warehouse and gave more than a hundred large pieces for free. He also sent dozens of his employees to help after the disaster. They worked to put the canvas on the homes of "elderly people living alone" and "special families" in Taibao City. This made sure that these vulnerable groups were safe from the wind and rain.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zheng Shufen said that almost 70 affected homes in Taibao City have received canvas and now have temporary covers. She greatly praised and thanked the Fuxiong Company employees for their kind actions. (Edited by Long Bo-an) July 19, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Pedestrian Hit and Killed by Bus on Crosswalk; Public Transport Office: Up to NT$90,000 Fine</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chen Yu-ting, Taipei, July 19) Today, a bus from Shin-Shin Bus Company hit a person on a pedestrian crossing while turning. The person died. The Taipei Public Transportation Office said they are checking the details with the bus company. They will punish the company based on Article 77, Section 1 of the "Highway Act." The highest fine could be NT$90,000.</p>
            <p>Around 8:47 AM, Taipei police and firefighters received a report about a car accident at the intersection of Zhongshan South Road and Aiguo East Road. Early investigations show that a 60-year-old man, Mr. Zhou, was walking on the pedestrian crossing. A turning Shin-Shin bus might have hit him, and he got stuck under the front wheel. He was taken to the hospital, but doctors could not save his life.</p>
            <p>Ms. Liang Yun-ling, who is the head of the Business Inspection Section at the Taipei Department of Transportationâ€™s Public Transportation Office, stated that they are working with the bus company to understand what happened. They are also checking details like the driver's years of experience and working hours. However, since this accident happened on a pedestrian crossing, the company will be punished according to Article 77, Section 1 of the "Highway Act." The maximum fine is NT$90,000.

            <h1>US Retired General: Han Kuang Exercise Should Become Taiwan-US Joint Drill, Include Combined Training (Interview)</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hou Tzu-ying, Washington, July 18) Taiwan's annual Han Kuang military exercise has finished. Retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery spoke with the Central News Agency today. He said that Taiwan needs to balance its active soldiers and reserve forces. He thinks that having many reserve soldiers join this time is a good start. He also asked that the Han Kuang exercise slowly become a joint exercise with the U.S. military for combined training.</p>
            <p>The "Han Kuang No. 41" military exercise with real soldiers ended on July 18. Taiwan's military personnel trained for 10 days and 9 nights. They practiced with new weapons and built strong defense systems. This exercise was the longest ever. It also included practice for how to handle China's "gray zone" attacks on Taiwan. Also, 22,000 reserve soldiers took part in the exercise. The entire Army Infantry 206th Brigade was part of this.</p>
            <p>Mark Montgomery is now a senior researcher at a think tank in Washington D.C. called the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies." He told the Central News Agency that this exercise was "great." He said it is very important for Taiwan's army to train for real fighting.</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that how Taiwan uses its reserve soldiers more effectively is a very important issue. Taiwan needs to find the right balance between its active soldiers and its reserve forces. He said that more than 20,000 reserve soldiers joined the Han Kuang exercise this time, which is "a very good start."</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Montgomery still had some worries. He said that even though the U.S. sent observers, Han Kuang is still an exercise done only by Taiwan. Both Taiwan and the U.S. do not want a war with China. But if a war really happens, it will need two or more countries to work together. Taiwan will not fight against the Chinese Communist Party alone.</p>
            <p>So, he asked that the Han Kuang exercise should slowly become an exercise with two countries. It should include people from the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Army for combined training. The "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act," passed by the U.S. Congress in 2023, already told the U.S. Department of Defense to have more joint training exercises with Taiwan's military. He believes the Han Kuang exercise is very good for this kind of training.</p>
            <p>Mr. Montgomery said that the U.S. and Taiwan should not stop their work because they are afraid of making China angry. Instead, they should try their best to improve "interoperability" between Taiwan and the U.S. He said, "The sooner we do this, the sooner we can stop the Chinese Communist Party from doing anything foolish."</p>
            <p>Also, he thinks that if the Chinese Communist Party tries to force Taiwan to unite or give up its independence under the Trump government, the U.S. will step in. In his opinion, the Trump government understands that Taiwan is important for the safety of the U.S. If Taiwan loses its independence, it will hurt the U.S. economy and national security for a long time.</p>
            <p>Regarding Taiwan's defense budget, Mr. Montgomery said that increasing it to 3% this year is enough. He thinks 5% would be a good goal by the end of President Lai's term.</p>
            <p>Mr. Montgomery, who pays close attention to Taiwan's defense, often visits Taiwan. He plans to visit Taiwan again at the end of July. During his visit, he will take part in a war game with the "Center for Technology, Democracy, and Society." They will practice an economic war based on energy and cyber attacks. They will look at how easily Taiwan's power grid can be attacked and how to help Taiwan stop the People's Liberation Army or Chinese coast guard from stopping goods from coming in.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that the most dangerous situation for Taiwan is if the Chinese Communist Party invades Taiwan by crossing the Taiwan Strait or sets up a big blockade. But the most likely situation is that China will keep increasing pressure on Taiwan. This includes pressure on money, energy, and communication. It also means more cyber attacks, false information, and operations to influence people. All these methods are meant to break the will of the Taiwanese people.
