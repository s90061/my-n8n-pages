Apple has recently announced "Apple Intelligence," a new set of artificial intelligence (AI) features coming to its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. This development aims to make daily tasks easier and more personal for users. The AI will help people write better, create unique images and emojis (called Genmoji), and quickly get summaries of long emails or notes. Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will also become much smarter. It will understand conversations better and be able to perform actions across different apps more easily.

A key focus for Apple is user privacy. The company states that much of the AI processing happens directly on the device itself. For more complex tasks that need more computing power, Apple uses a secure system called "Private Cloud Compute" to protect user data. This big step by Apple brings the company fully into the current AI trend, promising to greatly improve how people use their devices for both personal life and work. Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI's ChatGPT, allowing users to access its advanced features with permission for more complex questions.

**Venice Introduces Fee to Manage Tourist Crowds**

The popular Italian city of Venice has started a new system to control the large number of tourists visiting each day. From April 25th, day-trip visitors must pay a 5-euro fee to enter the city during specific busy hours. This trial program is part of Venice's effort to manage over-tourism, which has become a major problem for the city. Local residents often find their daily lives disrupted by the crowds, and the high number of visitors puts a lot of stress on Venice's old buildings and public services.

The fee applies to people visiting between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM on certain busy days. The main goal is to make tourism in Venice more sustainable and improve the quality of life for the city's residents. City officials hope that this new system will encourage tourists to visit during less busy times of the year or day. By doing this, Venice aims to protect its unique culture and delicate environment for future generations.

**Global Progress in Renewable Energy: A Cleaner Future for Earth and Business**

Countries around the world are making significant progress in renewable energy, showing a clear shift towards cleaner power sources. Recent reports indicate that solar and wind power are growing at an incredible speed. In 2023, the world added a record amount of new renewable energy capacity. This means that more power plants using energy from the sun or wind are being built than ever before, producing more clean electricity. This rapid growth is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and fighting climate change.

Businesses are increasingly investing in these green technologies, seeing new opportunities for growth and innovation. Governments are also supporting this trend with policies and funding. This move towards renewables is not only good for the Earth but also creates new jobs and can make energy more affordable over time. While there are still challenges, such as storing renewable energy and building new power grids, the fast expansion of solar and wind power represents a major positive change in the global energy business and for our planet.`;
