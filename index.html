            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu Causes Power Cuts for Many Homes; Thousands Still Without Electricity in Taitung and Tainan</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu came to Taiwan. According to Taipower, about 254,000 homes in Taiwan lost power. Now, about 60,000 homes still do not have power. Most of these are in Taitung County, with 18,981 homes, and Tainan City, with 16,648 homes.

            <p>The weather office said that the typhoon's center is still over Hualien, Taitung, and areas south of Miaoli, including Penghu. But the typhoon is getting weaker and smaller. However, people in areas south of Chiayi should still be careful because of strong winds and rain. Also, some central areas might feel a bit hot tonight because of the typhoon's winds moving downwards.</p>
            <p>Taipower reported that by 7 PM today, 254,302 homes had lost power. Out of these, 192,985 homes now have power again. But 61,317 homes are still without power.</p>

            <h1>"God Says" Company Accused of NT$4.5 Billion Investment Scam; 8 People Charged</h1>
            <p>The Taichung Prosecutors' Office is looking into a company called "God Says International Network Co., Ltd." They believe the company illegally collected money from people for investments. Searches started in April, and more than 60 people were taken in for questioning, including Mr. Chen, who is thought to be the main person in charge. Now, for the first time, 8 people, including Mr. Chen, have been charged with fraud and other crimes. The prosecutors also want to take back over NT$4.5 billion that was gained from the crime.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Prosecutors' Office said today in a press release that they got a warning from an anti-fraud center. They then worked with many police departments to form a special team to investigate.</p>
            <p>The special team worked for many years to gather proof. They carried out three searches in April, June, and August 2025. They found over 60 people who were involved, including Mr. Chen, who is 62 years old, system engineers, main staff, and leaders from different areas. After questioning, Mr. Chen and three others were kept in custody. The other more than 50 people paid bail, from NT$100,000 to NT$3 million.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that Mr. Chen and others from the "God Says" company set up an illegal investment platform to get money from people. They used a "P2P mutual fund" platform called "CCE Chinese Capital Exchange" to ask the public to invest.</p>
            <p>Since 2021, Mr. Chen and others held public meetings across Taiwan. They told people that if they invested NT$560,000, NT$610,000, or NT$760,000, they would get NT$2 million after 8 years. They also said the company would pay for any money that was missing. They used a method where new investors' money paid older investors. This showed very high yearly returns, from 32.14% to 188.39%, which was clearly too high to be real. This made people put in their money, and the company collected over NT$4.5 billion.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors believe there are about 3,000 victims, and over 1,000 people have officially reported the scam. After the investigation by the Taichung Prosecutors' Office, the first group of 8 people, including Mr. Chen, were charged with fraud, breaking banking laws, and money laundering. The prosecutors have asked for the NT$4.5 billion gained from the crime to be taken back.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong Coach Banned and Fined by Chinese Football Association for "Irresponsible Comments"</h1>
            <p>The Chinese Football Association recently stopped Hong Kong's famous female coach, Chan Yuen-ting, from coaching for one game and made her pay a fine. They said she "made comments that were not responsible." This has made many people online criticize the Football Association, saying they are "only brave enough to punish, but not brave enough to say why." Many people online are saying that Coach Chan said after a game, "If the system problems don't change, spending more money will not help."</p>
            <p>On August 8, the Chinese Football Association announced that on August 2, during a women's football match, Ms. Chan Yuen-ting, who works for the Jiangsu Wuxi Women's Football team, "made comments that were not responsible and caused a bad effect." So, based on their rules, they stopped her from coaching for one game and fined her 5,000 Chinese Yuan (about NT$21,000).</p>
            <p>The announcement did not say what Ms. Chan's "irresponsible comments" were. But many people online believe she said, "If the system problems don't change, spending more money will not help." This clearly pointed to the Chinese Football Association.</p>
            <p>It is interesting that videos, writings, and news reports about that press conference cannot be found online anymore.</p>
            <p>A well-known Chinese football expert, Yin Bo, wrote on August 11 that the reporters, the person leading the press conference, and a player from the Jiangsu women's team who was with Ms. Chan were all told not to share what she said.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yin Bo criticized the Chinese Football Association, saying they are "only brave enough to punish, but not brave enough to say why." He said there could only be one reason for this: they feel guilty.</p>
            <p>He said that Ms. Chan did not criticize the referee or the other team. So, the only answer is that she criticized the Football Association.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yin Bo said that in the past, the Chinese Football Association often used secret ways to deal with people who criticized them. But punishing someone openly for "what they said" is new. This is the first time it has happened in their history.</p>
            <p>He strongly said that Ms. Chan has the right to criticize the Football Association, and this is very clear. The Football Association can disagree with her criticism. But using their power to punish her and stop her from speaking is "going too far."</p>
            <p>After the news of Ms. Chan being punished came out, many Chinese internet users supported her in online discussions. They said she "spoke the truth" and criticized the Chinese Football Association, saying, "If they cannot solve the problem, they solve the person who talks about the problem."</p>
            <p>According to a report from Sing Tao Daily, Chan Yuen-ting is 37 years old and from Hong Kong. She started as a female football player. In December 2015, she became the head coach for the Eastern team in Hong Kong's top football league. She was the first female coach for a men's professional football team in Hong Kong. In 2016, she led Eastern to win the Silver Shield and the Hong Kong Premier League title. She became the first female coach to win a title with a men's team.</p>
            <p>In July 2019, Ms. Chan became the head coach for China's Under-16 Women's National Football Team. In March 2022, she became the head coach for the Jiangsu Wuxi Women's Football Club.</p>
