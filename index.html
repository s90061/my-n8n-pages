            <h1>Dingxin, Youshang, Weisheng Work Together to Build AI Autonomous Smart Factories</h1>
            <p>Dingxin Digitized Manufacturing, a company that provides ERP software and services, along with Youshang Technology, a company that makes material handling systems, and Weisheng Drying, a company that makes automatic drying machines, showed their new teamwork at the 2025 Taipei International Automation Industrial Exhibition. They want to help factories become smart factories that use AI to work by themselves. They aim to help companies build teams that work with AI, moving towards a new way of doing business.</p>
            <p>Dingxin Digitized Manufacturing said that in the past, IT (information technology) and OT (operation technology) systems in factories were set up by different companies. Also, each factory had different ways of working and different machines. This made it hard and expensive to combine these systems. But now, AI technology is much better. Smart AI agents can understand IT rules and also what's happening on the factory floor. They can start tasks on their own. Because of this, Dingxin, Youshang, and Weisheng started this new project. They are offering a special "IT Ã— OT + AI Agent" smart manufacturing solution that is not common in the market.</p>
            <p>Dingxin Digitized Manufacturing explained that they showed an example of how to handle "urgent orders." When a company needs to think about customs duty, profit, customer delivery times, and also low-carbon rules, the smart AI agent can help. It looks at things like the customer's credit, past orders, machine performance, material stock, and people working. Then, it suggests the best way to take the order and produce the goods. It also starts tasks like making a schedule, buying materials, and changing machine settings. This helps companies in the future to work in two main ways: quick tasks are decided by data and done right away; for slower tasks, a big AI model uses knowledge and experience to give the best advice to people.</p>
            <p>Dingxin Digitized Manufacturing also said that their "Multi-Agent Operating Platform" is like the smart brain of the factory. It connects IT data (like from ERP and MES systems) and OT data (like from sensors, AMR robots, and drying machines). It works with Youshang's automatic moving and MCS systems, and Weisheng's energy-saving drying machines that have an AIMS AI management system. This allows "Edge AI" (AI at the machine level) to quickly combine different types of information, find the best solutions, and start tasks across different systems.</p>
            <p>Dingxin Digitized Manufacturing stated that this new technical cooperation among the three companies helps their machines share information easily and automates how they are managed. It also brings smart decision-making directly to the factory floor. This creates "AI Autonomous Smart Factories." This also helps companies build teams that work with AI, which will help them make decisions on their own, work quickly and well, and stay strong in the market for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of National Defense Holds Concert; Minister Gu Lixiong Gives Commemorative Badges to War Veterans</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense held a concert today to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II and the War of Resistance. Both local and international artists, like Nine One One and Keril Wierzhel, performed at the event. The Minister of National Defense, Gu Lixiong, attended the concert and gave special badges to two old soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance. These badges also marked the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II and the War of Resistance.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense held the concert in the evening at the main hall of the Taipei International Convention Center. The theme of this concert was "Memory becomes Mission." The concert featured famous songs from different times, along with acrobatic dancers and a band. Light shows and animated videos were also used to create a new, immersive experience on stage. This helped connect historical memories with current duties. Minister Gu Lixiong attended the event with his wife, Wang Meihua.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense specially invited two retired soldiers, Zhang Zuomin and Zhang Yingnan, who fought in the War of Resistance against Japan, to the concert. When the host introduced these two old soldiers, everyone in the audience cheered and clapped loudly. After that, Minister Gu Lixiong went to their seats and personally gave them the special badges designed by the Ministry of National Defense this year to remember the 80th anniversary of the victory in World War II and the War of Resistance. The old soldiers saluted Minister Gu Lixiong, and the atmosphere in the hall was very moving.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense explained that giving these special badges to Zhang Zuomin and Zhang Yingnan was to honor their brave actions and to spread the spirit of resistance and the belief in protecting the Republic of China. It also aimed to push back against the Chinese Communist Party's twisting and taking over the history and story of the War of Resistance. This action helps to confirm the Republic of China's place as the true inheritor of the War of Resistance history.</p>
            <p>The concert also featured the band Nine One One, who performed exciting songs like "Ga Le A Le" and "The World Sees It." Their music helped the audience feel the strong friendship among soldiers in battle. At the end of the show, the choirs from the National Defense University's Political Warfare and Management Colleges, along with the Taipei Philharmonic Youth and Children's Chorus, sang military songs for all three armed forces and uplifting songs. This showed the military's strong will to pass on their traditions and carry out their duties.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense said they hope the concert will help people in the country remember the War of Resistance. They want the spirit of the brave heroes to be kept in people's hearts and passed down through generations. They want the spirit of "protecting the Republic of China," "military and civilians working together against the enemy," "youth standing up to defend the country," and "allies fighting together" to be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. While remembering this brave history, they also thanked every hero who gave their effort for peace. These heroes have taken on the important task of protecting the country, turning the memories of yesterday's war into today's mission to guard the nation.</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian Man Arrested in Italy, Suspected in Nord Stream Gas Pipeline Explosions</h1>
            <p>German prosecutors announced today that a Ukrainian man, suspected of being involved in the 2022 explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines, was arrested today in Italy. These pipelines were used to send natural gas from Russia to Europe.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, German prosecutors stated that a group of people is suspected of putting explosives on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. A man named Serhii K. is accused of being one of them. He is believed to be "one of the people who helped organize this operation."</p>
            <p>The Nord Stream gas pipelines connect Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. In September 2022, parts of the pipelines under the sea were badly damaged by huge explosions. It is believed that these explosions were done on purpose.</p>
            <p>After these mysterious explosions, both Ukraine and Russia have strongly said for years that they were not involved in the incident.</p>
            <p>However, German media had reported that investigations pointed to a group of Ukrainians who carried out this attack. There were 5 men and 1 woman. They rented a fast boat called Andromeda and left from the port of Rostock in Germany to go to the site.</p>
            <p>According to reports from German magazine Der Spiegel and other news sources, the goal of this group of Ukrainians was to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines. This would stop Russia, their enemy in the war, from earning money by selling natural gas to Europe in the future.</p>
            <p>German prosecutors said that Serhii K. was arrested early this morning in the Rimini province of Italy. He and his partners are accused of using a fast boat to carry out the attack, starting from Rostock.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors also said that someone got fake ID documents through another person. Then, these fake documents were used to rent the fast boat from a German company.</p>
