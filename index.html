            <h1>Zhu Lilun on Hualien Disaster: People Don't Want Central and Local Governments to Blame Each Other</h1>
            <p>Keelung, September 26 (CNA) â€” A lake created by a landslide on the Mataian Stream in Hualien heavily damaged Guangfu Township. Today, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Zhu Lilun said that when a disaster happens, people suffer. They do not want to see the central and local governments blame each other. He urged everyone to quickly help with the disaster and solve problems.</p>
            <p>Zhu Lilun attended a birthday party for KMT members at the KMT Keelung City Party Headquarters in the evening. When talking to reporters about the Hualien disaster, he said that the KMT will give all its effort if any help, people, supplies, or money are needed.</p>
            <p>A reporter asked if he thought the central government was blaming the local government. Zhu Lilun replied that people suffer in any disaster. People are not divided into central or local groups. They do not want to see anyone blame each other, especially pointing fingers. At this time, everyone should take responsibility, whether it is the country, the Executive Yuan, different government departments, or the Hualien County Government. They should all quickly help with the disaster. At this moment, people do not want to hear any arguments or blame.</p>
            <p>Before the event started, Zhu Lilun, along with Lin Pei-xiang, who is the head of the KMT Keelung City Party Headquarters and a lawmaker, and others, observed a moment of silence. They prayed for the victims and people affected by the Hualien disaster.</p>
            <p>Zhu Lilun spoke on stage, saying that in any natural disaster or big accident, people need both central and local governments to work together completely. He has been a leader in both central and local government for a long time. He knows that people just want to live safely and happily. When a disaster happens, they want quick help and solutions.</p>
            <p>Zhu Lilun said that if people still argue and blame local governments or anyone else, he believes the public will not accept it. When typhoons happened in Tainan and Kaohsiung, no one blamed the Tainan or Kaohsiung city governments. Everyone hoped for unity and hard work to make the disaster's effects as small as possible and help people live well. This is what Taiwanese people all hope for.</p>

            <h1>Institute of Transportation Promotes Drone Logistics Services in Rural Areas, Moves Towards Commercial Use</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 26 (CNA) â€” The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Institute of Transportation (IOT) announced today that it started a project in 2020 to use drones for logistics services in remote areas. This year, 2025, the project is moving into testing commercial operations. They are working with Chunghwa Post and other public and private groups. They also did a practice drill to use drones to deliver supplies during a disaster, which makes their ability to respond to disasters stronger.</p>
            <p>The IOT held a regular press conference today and said that the "Drone Logistics Services for Remote Areas Project" started in 2020. The goal is to use drones because they can move quickly and be set up fast. This helps overcome transportation problems in far-away places. The project plans for three main ways to use drones: for everyday services, urgent help, and disaster response.</p>
            <p>For everyday services, drones can carry daily items and farm products to and from remote residents. For urgent help, drones can quickly deliver medicines and medical equipment that are needed fast. When remote areas become cut off during natural disasters, the drones used for daily transport can immediately change to help with disaster relief. This makes them very effective and keeps residents safe.</p>
            <p>The IOT explained that this project has been carried out in three stages since 2020. From 2020 to 2022, they did "Proof of Concept" (PoC) to test the technology. They completed tests between Donggang in Pingtung and Siaoliouciou, and in Lalashan in Taoyuan. These tests checked if drones could fly over the sea and in mountain areas, and solved various technical problems. From 2023 to 2025, they are doing "Proof of Service" (PoS). They are doing long-term real-world practice in Qimei and Dali Indigenous communities in Hualien. This helps them gain experience in operating drones and confirm how reliable they are.</p>
            <p>The IOT stated that starting from 2025, they are entering the "Proof of Business" (PoB) stage. They are working with Chunghwa Post and other public and private groups to create a business model that can continue to grow. The goal is to make these services a regular part of life. They are also doing practice drills to use drones to deliver supplies during disasters. This makes their ability to respond to disasters stronger, provides better safety for remote residents, and improves their ability to recover from disasters.</p>
            <p>The IOT noted that in the future, they will continue to test and confirm drone logistics. They will gain practical experience, train skilled workers and operation teams, and help the industry grow. The goal is to use commercial operations during normal times to build up resources. Then, in times of disaster, they can immediately help. This means convenience and happiness in daily life, and protection for lives and homes when disasters happen.</p>
