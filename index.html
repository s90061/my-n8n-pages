            <h1>Trump Government Asks Supreme Court to Keep Freezing Billions in Foreign Aid</h1>
            <p>On September 8, the US government, led by President Donald Trump, asked the Supreme Court for an urgent decision. They want to continue freezing billions of dollars of money meant to help other countries.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, the main point of this legal case is that last month, Trump said he would not use almost $5 billion in foreign aid that Congress had approved.</p>
            <p>Last week, Judge Amir Ali in a federal court in Washington ruled that the Trump government's decision to hold back this money might be against the law.</p>
            <p>On August 28, Trump wrote a letter to the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson. In the letter, he said he would not use the $4.9 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress. This meant he was cutting the budget without Congress's approval.</p>
            <p>Trump used a method called "pocket rescission." This happens when the president asks Congress near the end of the financial year not to use approved funds. If Congress cannot act within 45 days, the money is not used and becomes invalid. The US financial year ends at the end of September.</p>
            <p>Judge Ali said that the law clearly states that Congress must agree to cancel funds for the government to hold them back.</p>
            <p>After a group of federal appeals judges refused to stop Ali's decision, the Trump government went to the Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>Last month, lawyers from the US Justice Department told a federal judge that another $6.5 billion in aid that was also frozen would be used before September 30, when the financial year ends.</p>
            <p>This case has been in court for several months. Non-profit groups suing the government say that freezing the aid breaks federal laws. They also say it has stopped money from reaching important programs that save lives in other countries.</p>

            <h1>Democrats Share Rude Letter Said to Be From Trump; White House Says No</h1>
            <p>On September 8, a Democratic member of the US House of Representatives shared a letter. They said the letter was from President Trump and contained rude words. It was about Trump wishing rich criminal Jeffrey Epstein a happy birthday in 2003. The White House later said this was not true.</p>
            <p>In mid-July, the "Wall Street Journal" reported that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell had collected birthday cards Epstein received for his 50th birthday in 2003. One of these was a rude letter with Trump's signature. It had some typed words and a drawing of a naked woman's body outline, which looked hand-drawn.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal report said: "The person who later became president signed a curvy 'Donald' below her waist, looking like pubic hair. The letter ended with 'Happy Birthday, may every day be another beautiful secret'." Trump said this report was false.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is looking into how Epstein's criminal cases were handled. US media outlet CNBC said that screenshots of the letter, shared by Democratic members of the committee on social media today, seemed to match the Wall Street Journal's report.</p>
            <p>The White House said today that Trump did not sign or draw a birthday card for Epstein.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, wrote on X (a social media platform): "As I have said many times, this drawing was clearly not made by President Trump, and he did not sign it."</p>
            <p>Leavitt also said that the reports about the rude letter were "false." She added that Trump's legal team will keep taking strong legal action against the Wall Street Journal.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Go Up Slightly as Market Looks at OPEC+ Production Plan</h1>
            <p>On September 8, global oil prices went up a little. This happened as the market thought about two things: OPEC+ (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) decided to slowly increase oil production in October, and Saudi Aramco lowered its oil selling prices for Asia.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for delivery in October at the New York Mercantile Exchange went up by 39 cents, reaching $62.26 per barrel.</p>
            <p>The price of Brent crude oil for delivery in November in London went up by 52 cents, reaching $66.02 per barrel.</p>
