            <h1>Chinese Man and Son Enter Taiwan Illegally to Find Work, Turn Themselves in When They Run Out of Money; Taoyuan Prosecutors Charge the Father</h1>
            <p>A 41-year-old man from China, Song Yuan-kun, thought Taiwan was rich. In May, he took his 17-year-old son on a rubber boat from Fujian to Taiwan to find a better life. When they ran out of money, they turned themselves in to the police. Prosecutors in Taoyuan have charged Song Yuan-kun with breaking laws about entering and leaving the country. His son's case will be handled by the juvenile court.</p>
            <p>The official document from the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office says that Song Yuan-kun and his son are both from mainland China. On May 15, around 6 in the morning, they used an inflatable rubber boat they bought from the Chinese shopping website Pinduoduo. The boat had an outboard motor, and they used it to come to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The document states that they started their journey from the coast of Junshan Town, Pingtan County, Fujian Province, which is about 68 nautical miles from Taiwan's coast. At about 5:30 in the afternoon on May 15, they arrived at a beach next to the Guanyin Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Guanyin District, Taoyuan City. This is how they entered Taiwan illegally.</p>
            <p>The document also says that on May 16, around 8 in the morning, they went to the Guanyin Police Station of the Dayuan Branch, Taoyuan City Police Department, to ask for help. This is when the whole situation became known. Police found a gas can, New Taiwan Dollars, and toiletries in their boat.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors looked into the case. Song Yuan-kun and his son are from Yunnan, China. Song Yuan-kun worked as a laborer. He thought Taiwan was a rich place and wanted to bring his son, who works in hairdressing, to Taiwan to study. On the day they left, they traveled from their village in Yunnan to Fujian to pick up the rubber boat, and then went to the sea. After arriving in Taiwan, they used a UnionPay card to get money for dinner. The next day, they had no money, so they turned themselves in.</p>
            <p>During the investigation, police and prosecutors checked if they came to Taiwan to gather military information. They gave both the father and son lie detector tests. Both of them passed the tests. This means that the authorities do not believe they came to spy or to declare ownership of the land.</p>
            <p>The official document says that Song Yuan-kun broke the laws about entering and leaving the country. His case was finished and he was charged today. Also, because Song Yuan-kun's son is a minor, the law asks for a stronger punishment under the Children and Youth Welfare and Rights Protection Act. Any tools they used to enter Taiwan illegally will be taken by the government.</p>

            <h1>Black-faced Spoonbill Brand Wetland-Friendly Seafood: National Park Service Helps Fishermen Affected by Disaster Sell Their Products</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Damrey caused a lot of damage in Taiwan. Today, the National Park Service of the Ministry of the Interior held an event called "Taijiang Eco-friendly Black-faced Spoonbill Brand Product Sale" at Yuanshan Huabo Park in Taipei. They helped fishermen from Qigu sell seafood products. These products have the Black-faced Spoonbill brand and wetland certification, which means they are good for the environment and use resources wisely.</p>
            <p>The typhoon and heavy rains that followed caused much harm to farms. Today, the National Park Service held the "Taijiang Eco-friendly Black-faced Spoonbill Brand Product Sale" at Yuanshan Huabo Park in Taipei. They invited five eco-friendly fish farms from the Tainan coastal area that were badly hit by the typhoon. These farms included Qigu Nanwan Seawater Eco-Aquaculture Farm, Yuti Eco-Aquaculture Farm, Guanteng's Fish, Huang Fenxiang Eco-Aquaculture Farm, and fishermen who raise clams and shrimp. They came to Taipei to sell their products. The first round of sales was sold out by 11 AM, so they restocked by 12 PM.</p>
            <p>Many important people attended the event today. These included Director-General Wang Cheng-chi and Deputy Director-General Chen Chen-jung of the National Park Service, Director Hsieh Wei-sung of Taijiang National Park Management Office. Also there were business partners for ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance) like Mr. Takeichiro Yahachi, Chairman of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. Taiwan Branch, and Ms. Kao Li-hsueh, President of CTBC Financial Holding Co., Ltd.</p>
            <p>When Director-General Wang Cheng-chi spoke, he said that in the past, people thought national parks only focused on protecting nature. But now, they also work to support eco-friendly farming together with the government, fishermen, and businesses. Taijiang National Park is also the only wetland national park, so they also promote a "wetland label." This means that the more than 30 kinds of seafood sold today have both the Black-faced Spoonbill brand approval and the wetland label. The Ministry of the Interior's wetland label means that products from wetlands are made in a way that is good for the environment and uses resources wisely.</p>
            <p>Wang Cheng-chi said that the typhoon caused a lot of damage to Qigu, but Taiwanese people are strong and brave even when things are difficult. He believes that the fishermen will keep working hard, and the government and businesses will actively help them.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Wei-sung said that Taijiang National Park started an eco-friendly habitat farming plan in 2020. At that time, only 3 fishermen participated, covering an area of 10 hectares. Now, there are 20 fishermen, covering over 200 hectares. Promoting eco-friendly practices is not just an idea; it's important to work with fishermen to protect their homes. A good environment naturally produces delicious seafood.</p>
            <p>The Taijiang National Park Management Office of the National Park Service has signed agreements with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd., All One Electronics Co., Ltd., and CTBC Financial Holding Co., Ltd. These agreements are for ESG cooperation. They will work together to protect the habitat of the Black-faced Spoonbill. Mr. Yahachi said that the Black-faced Spoonbill brand shows that protecting nature and economic activities can happen together. He thanked everyone for making sustainability not just a dream but something that is happening now.</p>
            <p>Ms. Kao Li-hsueh said that CTBC Financial Holding and its five companies started a plan in May to protect the Taijiang habitat and species that are in danger. She also hopes that people will buy good quality seafood that is farmed in an eco-friendly way and made locally. This helps to reduce carbon pollution and protect the environment.</p>
