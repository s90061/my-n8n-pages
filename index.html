            <h1>Tsai Chi-Chang Went to Japan to Watch Important Taiwanese Baseball Players for the WBC; Pitcher Ku Lin Rui-Yang is Now Healthy.</h1>
            <p>Tsai Chi-Chang, the head of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL), went to Japan in early September. He visited Taiwanese players who play there. He said today that he met players like Ku Lin Rui-Yang and Song Chia-Hao. Ku Lin Rui-Yang is now fully recovered from his injury. Tsai Chi-Chang also watched key players for Taiwan's World Baseball Classic (WBC) team coach, Tseng Hao-Chu.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-Chang recently visited Japan. On August 31, he attended the Taiwan Day event for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters team. He also visited three baseball teams: the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, and Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He met Ku Lin Rui-Yang and Sun Yi-Lei from the Fighters, Wang Yen-Cheng, Song Chia-Hao, Hsiao Chi, and Yang Po-Hsiang from the Eagles, and Chang Chun-Wei from the Hawks.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-Chang went with Lin Wei-Chu, the vice leader of the Fubon Guardians team. He said he wanted to meet all the Taiwanese players in Japan, but only three teams' game schedules allowed it. Among the seven players Tsai Chi-Chang met, some were players that WBC Taiwan team coach Tseng Hao-Chu had specifically asked him to watch carefully.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-Chang said, "Just like when I went to America before, this time I went to Japan with Wei-Chu following Coach Hao-Chu's instructions. We looked for specific things in the players, and I found the answers for him during this visit."</p>
            <p>Ku Lin Rui-Yang was supposed to pitch his first rehabilitation game in the minor league on September 4, but it was postponed because of rain. He then pitched 30 balls indoors. Tsai Chi-Chang watched Ku Lin Rui-Yang practice. Tsai Chi-Chang noted that Ku Lin Rui-Yang's pitching speed is back to 150 kilometers per hour. He also felt no pain after pitching, which shows his injury has healed.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-Chang also said that during his trip to Japan, besides watching Taiwanese players, he also talked with the three teams (Fighters, Eagles, and Hawks). He hopes to create stronger connections between these teams and the CPBL.</p>

            <h1>Plan to Change City Rules for National Freeway 7 in Kaohsiung is Approved, Making Traffic Better.</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior's City Planning Committee today approved a plan to change city rules for the new National Freeway No. 7 in Kaohsiung. The Kaohsiung City Urban Development Bureau stated that with this approval, the city's traffic will become much better, and the city's ability to compete will grow. The project is expected to be finished by the end of 2030.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior's City Planning Committee held its 1086th meeting today. They approved the plan to change city rules for the "National Freeway No. 7 Kaohsiung Section New Construction Project." Kaohsiung City Vice Mayor Lin Chin-Jung led the city team to the meeting, showing the city's strong will to improve industry and transportation.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-Jung explained that in recent years, Kaohsiung's city areas have grown quickly. Also, Kaohsiung Port handles more than ten million shipping containers every year, which makes traffic more and more complicated. To solve these traffic problems, Taiwan's government approved the "National Freeway No. 7 Kaohsiung Section Construction Project" in March 2023.</p>
            <p>The project starts by connecting to National Freeway No. 10. It then goes south through Dashu, Renwu, Niaosong, Daliao, Fengshan, Xiaogang, and Linyuan districts. It will pass east of the Linhai Industrial Park to Nansing Road, which is a road connecting to the Intercontinental Container Terminal. The freeway will be 23 kilometers long and cost about 135.79 billion New Taiwan Dollars. It is planned to be finished and open by the end of 2030.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, the Urban Development Bureau sent out a press release. It said that the changes in this plan cover eight different city planning areas. These areas include Dashu, Renwu, Chengcing Lake Special Area, Niaosong (Renmei area), Daliao, east of Dapingding, Dapingding Special Area, and the original Kaohsiung City area. The total area affected by the changes is about 133 hectares.</p>
            <p>The changes also involve adjusting land for farming, industry, rivers, parks, and roads. The Urban Development Bureau said they will mainly use public land first. They will also use flexible methods, such as setting up surface rights, to reduce problems with moving people and land disputes.</p>
            <p>Additionally, National Freeway No. 7 will connect with National Freeway No. 1 and No. 10, Provincial Highway 88, and the planned second expressway between Kaohsiung and Pingtung. This will create a circular expressway network in eastern Kaohsiung. It is expected to reduce traffic on National Freeway No. 1 by 14% to 24%, on Provincial Highway 88 (Wujia to Fengshan section) by 30%, and on National Freeway No. 10 (Renwu to Dingjin section) by 29%.</p>
            <p>Once National Freeway No. 7 is built, it will be the main road connecting to the Intercontinental Container Terminal. It will help direct large truck traffic away from local roads, reducing the mixing of big and small vehicles in city areas. This will make local traffic safer and will connect industries to the north, making transportation more efficient for the port area and local places.</p>
