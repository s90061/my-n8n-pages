            <h1>Powell Hints at End of Fed's Balance Sheet Reduction, Warns of Slowing Job Growth</h1>
            <p>Today, Jerome Powell, the head of the US central bank (Fed), suggested that the Fed might soon stop reducing its balance sheet. He did not give clear information about future interest rates. At the same time, he warned that job growth in the US is slowing down a lot.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, a financial news outlet, Powell spoke at an event for the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) in Philadelphia. He talked in detail about the progress of "quantitative tightening" (QT), which means reducing the Fed's assets by over 6 trillion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Powell did not say exactly when the balance sheet reduction would stop. However, he mentioned that current signs show the Fed is getting close to its goal of having "enough reserves" for the banking system.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Powell said, "Our long-term plan is to stop reducing the balance sheet when reserves are a little higher than what we think is enough. We might reach this point in the next few months. We are carefully watching different signs to make this decision."</p>
            <p>When money in the economy is tight, the Fed aims to keep reserves "plentiful" to make sure banks have enough money and the economy keeps working. As conditions change, the Fed will aim for "adequate" reserves to stop too much money from flowing into the market.</p>
            <p>Powell noted that "signs of liquidity tightening are starting to appear." If reserves continue to decrease, it could slow down economic growth. But he stressed that the Fed does not plan to bring the balance sheet back to its level before COVID-19 (2019 coronavirus disease), which was about 4 trillion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Regarding future interest rates, Powell kept his recent stance. He highlighted that officials are closely watching the tight job market and considering the risks between jobs and inflation.</p>
            <p>He stated, "The unemployment rate stayed low until the end of August. However, job growth has slowed a lot. This might be because the number of working people is growing slower, fewer immigrants are coming, and fewer people are joining the workforce. In a less active, slightly weaker job market, the risk of job losses seems to have increased."</p>
            <p>Powell mentioned that the Fed's decision-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decided in September to lower the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to handle this situation.</p>
            <p>Experts expect the Fed to cut interest rates two more times before the end of this year. Several Fed officials also agree with this idea, but Powell did not say anything about it.</p>
            <p>He emphasized, "When we try to balance our goals for jobs and inflation, there is no policy path that is completely safe." The FOMC plans to hold a meeting on policy from October 28 to 29.</p>

            <h1>Trump Government Raids Immigrants in Pope's Hometown; Chicago Catholics Worried</h1>
            <p>Father Brendan Curran, a Catholic priest in the US, knows many church members in Chicago who supported Donald Trump's return to the White House. But now, they are scared as they see immigration raids happening all over the city. Pope Leo XIV, who was from Chicago, also shared these worries.</p>
            <p>Curran told Agence France-Presse (AFP), "Almost everyone is shocked. This is definitely not what they expected at first."</p>
            <p>Trump said Chicago was like a war zone and needed armed soldiers, but this was clearly not true. However, people are now speaking out against his strict immigration policies from a more peaceful group: the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>Pope Leo XIV, who was from Chicago and was the first American Pope, has always openly criticized Trump's policies. When talking about the church's opposition to abortion, an issue where Trump's Republican Party and many Catholics share the same view, he brought up "the inhumane treatment of immigrants in the United States." He questioned if this could be called "pro-life" or respecting life.</p>
            <p>Chicago is the third-largest city in the US. About 30% of its people are Latin American or Hispanic, and many of them are Catholic.</p>
            <p>In Little Village, a mostly Latin American area on the west side of Chicago, clothing store owner Ariella Santoyo admitted that what happened under Trump was very different from what people had hoped for.</p>
            <p>She said that Trump's promises on conservative issues, especially abortion, "attracted many people" in her community. But she pointed out that the arrests of immigrants, often done violently by masked plainclothes officers, were not the results people wanted.</p>
            <p>"We've heard this from many friends and even relatives who voted for Trump: 'I never thought this would happen.'"</p>
            <p>Many Trump supporters were happy to see pictures of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers chasing immigrants, forcing them into vans, and spraying tear gas at protesters. AFP noted that Trump won the election last year partly because he made scary and false statements, saying that violent immigrants were entering the US.</p>
            <p>However, among religious groups, especially Catholics, there is a growing disagreement with the White House.</p>
            <p>Father Curran said, "As a church, church leaders, and believers, we have the right to share our opinions on US immigration policy. Now, we strongly disagree with the federal policies from the White House."</p>
            <p>To show his protest, Pastor Gary Graf walked 1,300 kilometers from Pope Leo XIV's childhood home to the Statue of Liberty in New York, opposing Trump's policies.</p>
            <p>Last weekend, hundreds of believers walked from a Catholic church to an immigrant center in Broadview, a western suburb of Chicago, for a communion parade. They tried to share communion with the immigrants held there, but they were not successful.</p>
            <p>Father Curran, a Dominican friar, said, "Our mission as a church is in danger. When we talk about giving food to the hungry, clothes to the naked, and homes to the homeless, and this is seen as a federal crime, then something is wrong with this country."</p>
            <p>Curran recently went to a prayer meeting outside the ICE facility in Broadview. A helicopter flew overhead, and about 20 Catholic people gathered to pray the Rosary.</p>
            <p>One person there said, "We pray that President Trump" and other US officials can "continue to be open-minded" and create immigration policies that show empathy.</p>

            <h1>US Trade Representative: 100% Tariffs Depend on Beijing's Next Move</h1>
            <p>As trade tensions between the US and China continue, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said in an interview today that President Trump might still put a 100% tariff on goods from China to the US on November 1st, or even sooner. This will depend on what Beijing does next in the rare earth minerals disagreement.</p>
            <p>Greer told CNBC, an American business news channel, that "many things depend on what China does." He also said that China is the one that chose to make the situation much worse.</p>
            <p>CNBC reported that last week, China announced many limits on its rare earth mineral exports. If these rules are put in place, they could hurt US defense, technology, semiconductor, and car industries.</p>
            <p>Greer said, "We cannot let China keep this system," which allows them to stop global high-tech supply chains.</p>
            <p>This new restriction from Beijing surprised the White House. Before this, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were supposed to meet later this month during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Korea.</p>
            <p>Greer said that Trump and Xi Jinping still plan to meet, but he also hinted that plans could change as the situation develops.</p>
            <p>Greer stated, "I don't want to promise anything for us or for China about whether this meeting will happen as planned." But he believes that it is always helpful to talk if there is a chance.</p>
            <p>He also shared that senior officials from the US and China talked yesterday in Washington about the rare earth minerals disagreement. He believes that both sides can solve this trade problem.</p>
            <p>Last week, Trump threatened to put a 100% tariff to get back at Beijing for announcing limits on rare earth mineral exports. US media reported that this new conflict caused US stock markets to drop. Trump even said at one point that he might not meet with Xi Jinping. However, Trump later tried to calm the situation, and both the US and China privately said they wanted to stop their trade problems, at least for a while.</p>
            <p>According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), China controls about 60% of the world's rare earth mining and over 90% of the refining process. Data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) shows that the US relies on China for about 70% of its rare earth imports.</p>
