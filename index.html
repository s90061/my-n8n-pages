            <h1>European School Publication Supports Unification, Causes Questions; Chen Chang-wen Says It's Free Speech</h1>
            <p>Chen Chang-wen, the head of Taipei European School, spoke today. His school's magazine has caused questions because it talks about unification. He said he writes about many topics, like climate and energy. He also writes about Russia and Ukraine. He added that the Constitution of the Republic of China gives people freedom of speech.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Chen Chang-wen used the school's magazine to say that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should not stop trying to reach a goal of diverse unification. He also said that President Lai Ching-te calling China a "hostile force outside our borders" goes against his duty to the Constitution.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Councilor Chao Yi-hsiang, from the Democratic Progressive Party, told Central News Agency that political ideas in a school magazine are not proper. It goes against the rule that schools should stay neutral in politics. Especially because students at Taipei European School come from families of diplomats and foreign business people. Using the school magazine to spread political and cross-strait views seems to have a strong political purpose and is very inappropriate.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Government's Department of Education said that this is a school's internal magazine. They have asked the school to decide for themselves and explain it to the public when ready.</p>
