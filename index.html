            <h1>China Stops Contact with Czech President; Czech Office Says Nothing Changes</h1>
            <p>China is upset because the President of the Czech Republic, Mr. Pavel, met the Dalai Lama in India. China announced it will not talk to President Pavel anymore. The Czech President's office said this does not change anything. This is because the presidents of the Czech Republic and China do not talk directly with each other now.</p>
            <p>On July 27, Czech President Petr Pavel met the Dalai Lama, the main spiritual leader of Tibet. This meeting happened in India, where President Pavel wished the Dalai Lama a happy 90th birthday. China was very unhappy and protested about this meeting.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, Lin Jian, said that President Pavel ignored China's warnings and strong protests. He still went to India to meet the Dalai Lama. China said this breaks the Czech government's promise to China. It also hurts China's power and land. Because of President Pavel's "bad and challenging actions," China decided to stop all contact with him.</p>
            <p>The Czech President's office responded on social media platform X. They said: "The President's meeting with the Dalai Lama was completely personal. Right now, the Czech Republic and China do not have direct talks between their presidents. So, this decision does not change the current situation."</p>
            <p>Some important Czech politicians also spoke about this. The Czech Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavsk칳, said that President Pavel's visit was a private matter. He only personally wished the Dalai Lama a happy important birthday. China should understand it this way.</p>
            <p>The Czech Health Minister, Vlastimil V치lek, wrote on X that he supports the President on behalf of his political party, TOP 09. He compared it to how they supported the party leader, Mark칠ta Pekarov치 Adamov치, when she visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. V치lek added, "We do not want Chinese friends to tell our country's leaders where they can go or not go. Please keep such ideas for those who want to bring us back to the Eastern bloc."</p>
            <p>The Czech Minister of Research and Innovation, Marek 콯en칤코ek, commented on X. He said, "I believe this will not affect the President much. The Chinese Communist Party's main group can only feel helpless."</p>

            <h1>US Stocks Rise: Dow Up Almost 500 Points as Inflation Data Boosts Hope for Lower Interest Rates</h1>
            <p>In New York, on August 12, US stock markets went up. This happened even with worries about taxes President Trump might put on goods. The main reason was that prices in the US did not change much in July. This made people think the Federal Reserve (Fed), which controls money, might lower interest rates. As a result, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock indexes reached their highest points ever, and the Dow Jones index went up by nearly 500 points.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 483.52 points. This is a 1.10% increase. It closed at 44458.61 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up by 72.31 points. This is a 1.13% increase. It closed at 6445.76 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index rose by 296.51 points. This is a 1.39% increase. It closed at 21681.91 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which tracks chip companies, went up a lot by 169.72 points. This is a 2.99% increase. It closed at 5840.09 points.</p>
