            <h1>Welldone Company Records Loss of NT$4.36 Per Share in Q2 Due to Arbitration Payout for Liwei Subsidiary</h1>
            <p>Welldone held a press conference this evening. They announced that their subsidiary, Liwei, which they own 77.25% of, has to pay about 27 million US dollars (around 791 million New Taiwan dollars). A customer started a business arbitration case against Liwei because of faulty products and late deliveries. The International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR) made this decision.</p>
            <p>Welldone's Vice General Manager, Lin Yong-xiang, said that Liwei is a small company. In 2024, it made up only about 3% of Welldone's total sales. Also, because Liwei lost money in 2024, Welldone has recorded this possible loss in its half-year financial report. This is a one-time recording as per international accounting rules (IFRS 10), where the parent company records the loss based on its share in the subsidiary.</p>
            <p>Because of this one-time recording of about 791 million New Taiwan dollars for the Liwei arbitration, Welldone reported a surprising loss in its second-quarter financial report. Welldone announced today that its net loss for the second quarter was about 490 million New Taiwan dollars. This means a loss of 4.36 New Taiwan dollars per share after tax, which is the first quarterly loss in over seven years. For the first half of the year, the net loss was 330 million New Taiwan dollars, or 2.94 New Taiwan dollars per share.</p>
            <p>Welldone stated that in 2021, Liwei's customer started a business arbitration case against Liwei at the American Arbitration Association. The customer said Liwei's products were faulty and deliveries were late. The customer first asked for over 18 million US dollars in compensation. Later, they increased this amount to about 143 million US dollars. On July 31st, Taiwan time, an American lawyer sent the arbitration decision from the ICDR International Arbitration Tribunal. The decision says that Liwei must pay about 27 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Welldone emphasized that this arbitration decision for Liwei will not greatly affect Welldone's money situation or its business. Liwei will hire lawyers and experts to help with legal work to try to reduce the actual loss.</p>
            <p>For Welldone, this loss is just a one-time entry in their accounting books, and no actual cash has been paid yet. After recording this loss, Welldone's total net worth is 3.2 billion New Taiwan dollars, or 28.3 New Taiwan dollars per share. The company's overall financial health remains good.</p>

            <h1>Rakuten Monkeys Leader Apologizes to Players for Food Safety Issue, Says Budget Can Be Changed</h1>
            <p>The leader of the Rakuten Monkeys baseball team, Yuki Makino, apologized today to the players and coaches for a food safety problem. He clarified that the team always cares about the players' nutrition and that the budget can be changed if needed. Also, the team announced that they are immediately changing the company that provides their meals.</p>
            <p>He said that the food quality was not bad because of a low budget. If necessary, the budget can be adjusted; it's not about how much money there is. He added, "We will cooperate and review things carefully, and we will allow inspections." If needed, the team's organization will also change how it handles things.</p>
            <p>Media reported that there were food safety issues with the players' meals, including dead flies and live maggots. The Rakuten Monkeys team released a statement saying they will carefully check their food suppliers again to make sure the players' food is safe.</p>
            <p>Yuki Makino spoke to the media and said he was sorry that everyone was worried. He apologized to the players and coaches who ate the food.</p>
            <p>Before the game, Yuki Makino gathered the whole team and spoke to them. He said he apologized to the coaches and players. However, he also said that reports claiming the team does not care about player nutrition or physical development are not true. The team cares most about player nutrition and will continue to help players by providing good nutrition and food.</p>
            <p>He said that after the problem happened, the team immediately decided to change suppliers. They will be very careful when choosing a new supplier. Until then, they will order meals for the players. Of course, they will talk about the details with the new company. This includes making sure the cooking process is safe, the delivery conditions are clean, and the environment in the staff cafeteria is also clean.</p>

            <h1>Famine Worsens in Gaza: WHO Says Nearly 12,000 Children Under 5 Are Malnourished</h1>
            <p>The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said today that about 12,000 children under five in Gaza are severely malnourished. Also, more and more people are dying because of hunger. He asked for more help to be sent to Gaza continuously.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus spoke at the WHO main office in Geneva. He said that in July, about 12,000 children under five in Gaza were found to be severely malnourished. This is the highest number recorded in one month.</p>
            <p>As of July 29 this year, at least 99 people have died because of hunger. This includes 64 adults and 35 children. Of the children, 29 were under five years old.</p>
            <p>New numbers from UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) show that the number of children treated for malnutrition almost doubled between June and July. It went from 6,344 to 11,877 children. Among them, 2,500 children were severely malnourished.</p>
            <p>Tedros asked for more help to be sent in large amounts and continuously, using all possible ways. The WHO said it is supporting four centers in Gaza that treat malnutrition. However, there is a serious lack of baby formula and nutritious food.</p>
            <p>Rik Peeperkorn, the WHO representative for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, said in a video call, "The total amount of food and nutrition supplies is still too low. It's not enough to stop the situation from getting worse. There must be enough food in the markets, and people need different kinds of food."</p>
            <p>A global group that watches for famine warned that signs of famine are appearing in Gaza. Hunger is spreading, and children are dying because of hunger. Also, it is very difficult for humanitarian aid to reach this war-torn area.</p>
            <p>The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) stated that the amount of food people are eating in Gaza has dropped to the lowest level since the war started.</p>
            <p>Gaza has 2.2 million people. Among them, 81% of families say their food situation is very bad. This is a big increase from 33% in April.</p>
