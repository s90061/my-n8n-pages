            <h1>HBL Nanshan's Star Shooter Huang Hansheng Suffers Knee Injury, May Return in Top 8 Games</h1>
            <p>Huang Hansheng, a main guard for Nanshan High School, a strong team in the HBL (High School Basketball League), has torn a ligament in his right knee. He might not be able to play until the Top 8 games. His coach, Chen Po-ting, said today that they will not rush Huang Hansheng back to play. He said, 'A player's career is long.'</p>
            <p>Last season, Nanshan did not win the HBL championship again. So, during the break, they worked hard to get ready to win the championship trophy this year. But Huang Hansheng, who is a very good shooter, hurt his right knee during the Changyao Cup basketball game. He tore his anterior cruciate ligament. This means he will miss the first rounds of the new school year, including the Top 16 and Top 12 games. This is a big problem for Nanshan.</p>
            <p>Coach Chen Po-ting spoke to reporters today after the Dengfeng Zaoleng basketball game. He said that Huang Hansheng has had surgery. The earliest he can come back to play in the HBL is for the Top 8 games. But the coach wants Huang Hansheng to rest more. They will not hurry him to play again. He also needs permission from the team's physical therapist. The coach said, 'A player's career is long, and there's a long way to go. Don't worry too much. We hope to see him playing on the court again.'</p>
            <p>Even though Huang Hansheng's absence will affect the team's strength, Coach Chen Po-ting said that Huang Hansheng has been in many games and training camps during the summer. He has been away from team training for some time. So, the team is used to playing without him. The coach hopes that another main player, Hsieh Min-keng, will take on more responsibility. This includes making the last shot and being the key player. The coach wants him 'to use his skills as much as possible.'</p>
            <p>Huang Hansheng was named the HBL Rookie of the Year and the MVP (Most Valuable Player) of the championship game when he was in his first year of high school. Recently, he also won the MOP (Most Outstanding Player) award at the NIKE ALL ASIA CAMP for boys. But his third year of high school started with an injury. He said that he was sad for a few days after he knew about his knee injury. But he quickly felt better and decided to be positive about his injury. He said, 'I won't rush. Life is not just about HBL.'</p>
            <p>The Dengfeng Zaoleng basketball game started today at Taipei Arena. Nanshan lost their first game to Kuangfu High School, 58-71. Coach Chen Po-ting said that many experienced players have graduated. So, since early August, the team has been playing many games. This helps the players get experience quickly and grow.</p>

            <h1>Australian Government Says "March For Australia" Rallies Spread Hate and are Linked to Neo-Nazis</h1>
            <p>Today, the center-left government of Australia spoke against anti-immigration meetings held in big cities like Sydney. The government said these events try to spread hate and are connected to neo-Nazis.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the group "The March For Australia" held protests against immigration today in Sydney, Australia's biggest city, and in other capital cities of states and regions. On their website, the group said, "A lot of immigration has broken the strong bonds in our communities."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, "The March For Australia" posted on X (a social media platform) that the goal of their meetings is "to do what mainstream politicians never dare to do: demand an end to a lot of immigration."</p>
            <p>In Australia, one out of every two people was born in another country, or one of their parents was born in another country. Recently, Australia has had problems with extreme right-wing groups, including protests organized by neo-Nazis.</p>
            <p>Murray Watt, the Minister for Environment and Water Resources for the Labor government, spoke on Sky News about the Sydney meeting. He said, "We strongly criticize the 'March For Australia' event held today. This does not help make society more peaceful at all."</p>
            <p>Watt stressed, "We do not support such meetings. These actions only spread hate and divide our society." He also said that neo-Nazi groups "started and promoted" these events.</p>
            <p>According to ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) news, about 5,000 to 8,000 people attended the Sydney meeting.</p>
            <p>Near the "March For Australia" meeting in Sydney, a community group called the "Refugee Action Coalition" held a counter-meeting. A spokesperson for this group said in a statement, "Our event showed our strong dislike and anger towards the extreme right-wing goals of 'The March For Australia'." The organizers said that hundreds of people came to their event.</p>
