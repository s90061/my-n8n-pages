He also mentioned that current global challenges like protectionism and bullying require both countries to work together. Jaishankar agreed, saying that both sides should focus on positive aspects and prevent disagreements from becoming conflicts. He also emphasized that India will follow its own foreign policy.

**Improving Taiwan's Power Grid Strength: Tsai Yi-yu Says Roadside Cables Need to Be Buried**

After Typhoon Danas caused widespread power outages in Tainan and Chiayi, Democratic Progressive Party legislator Tsai Yi-yu suggested using a special budget to put power cables underground along main roads. He believes this will make Taiwan's power grid stronger and reduce risks from disasters. Tsai Yi-yu noted that the typhoon damaged over 700 power poles in Chiayi, showing how weak the power grid is to extreme weather. He emphasized that burying cables would greatly help prevent large power outages caused by strong winds. However, he also admitted that in low-lying areas, underground cables could be harder to fix if there is flooding. Therefore, he suggested starting with higher elevation roads like Provincial Highway 17, 19, 1, and 3. He also said that the Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau should manage this project, including it in existing road maintenance work to make it more efficient.
