            <h1>Coach Hong Thought It Was Fake News, Asks Company to Help Steven Moya</h1>
            <p>The Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) All-Star game is today. But Steven Moya, a foreign player for the TSG Hawks team, will not play. His wife became very sick on a flight to Taiwan and sadly passed away. Hawks coach Hung Yi-Chung felt very sad. He first thought the news online was not true. He said the team will help Moya in every way they can.</p>
            <p>Steven Moya was going to be the third batter and a designated hitter for the TEAM STAR in the All-Star game. But before the game, the Hawks team announced that Moyaâ€™s wife had a very serious health problem on the airplane. After the plane landed, she was taken to the hospital, but she could not be saved. Because of this sudden and sad event, Moya had to decide not to play in the All-Star game.</p>
            <p>Coach Hung Yi-Chung was interviewed before the game. He said this news was very sudden and made everyone sad. He was checking his phone before the game and saw the news on social media. At first, he thought it was fake news. He had not finished reading it when the team's vice general manager called him to explain everything. Coach Hung said the team will give as much help as possible.</p>
            <p>Coach Hong also said that he met Moya's wife and children at last year's All-Star game. He said that people who are not close to the situation cannot understand how sad Moya feels. He wants Moya to take care of things now, and other matters can be looked at later.</p>

            <h1>China Holds Meeting for Private Business People, Hopes to Unite Their Ideas</h1>
            <p>From July 17th to 18th, China held a meeting for people who work in private businesses. Li Ganji, a high-ranking official from the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was there and spoke. He said he hopes to help private business owners think and act in the same way as the CCP Central Committee's plans for China and other countries.</p>
            <p>On July 15th, China's official statistics office shared economic numbers for the second part of the year. The economy grew by 5.2% in the second part of the year. This is a bit slower than the 5.4% growth in the first part of the year. For the first half of the year, China's economy grew by 5.3%. But many people believe the economy will grow even slower in the second half of the year. This is because the Chinese economy is not very strong inside the country and there are trade problems with other countries.</p>
            <p>According to the newspaper People's Daily, China held this meeting for private business people at this time. Around 80 private business owners went to the meeting. Important officials from the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce gave special presentations. Other government officials also attended.</p>
            <p>Li Ganji explained that holding this meeting is important. It helps to tell private business people about the situation and listen to their ideas. This follows the words of CCP leader Xi Jinping at a meeting for private businesses. It also helps private business people to agree with the CCP Central Committee's correct ideas and plans for situations inside and outside China.</p>
            <p>He also said that because the national economy was stable and improved in the first half of the year, they should be sure of themselves and work very hard. Private businesses should make new efforts to help the economy grow more in the second half of the year.</p>
            <p>The report says that Li Ganji hopes private business people will truly follow what Xi Jinping asked them to do. This means they should "want to help their country, focus on growing their businesses, follow laws well, and help others become rich after they become rich." They should "think, stand, and work together" with the CCP Central Committee. They should also be creative and start new kinds of businesses that fit their local areas.</p>

            <h1>Lin Chih-Sheng Sets Records at All-Star Game: "Thanks to My Hard Work"</h1>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng, an experienced player for the Wei Chuan Dragons, is playing in his last All-Star game today. He is starting as the fourth batter, and his playing today will set two new records. He laughed and said he has not played defense for a long time, so he felt a little tired. This is his first time playing in the Taipei Dome, and it is for the All-Star game. He said, "I thank myself because I worked very hard, and that is why people could see me."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng is 43 years old and is an important player. He was chosen for the TEAM TAIWAN in this All-Star game. Today, in the first game, he started as the fourth batter and played first base. After practicing, Lin Chih-Sheng spoke to reporters. He joked, "Today I am the starting fourth batter and first baseman. Chen Chiang-Ho made me work hard just now, and I am a little out of breath."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng has never played in a regular game at the Taipei Dome before. He said he really enjoys playing in the Taipei Dome. He said it is raining outside today, and if there was no Dome, the game would have to be moved to another day. "My first game in the Taipei Dome is for the All-Star game."</p>
            <p>The Dragons team will have special games to celebrate Lin Chih-Sheng leaving baseball from September 5th to 7th at the Taipei Dome. When reporters asked if this All-Star game was like a practice for his retirement games, he laughed. He said time goes by very fast, and it feels like March, but he has always been ready.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Lin Chih-Sheng had played in 20 CPBL All-Star games. This was the same number as a retired player, Peng Cheng-Min. Today, as soon as he plays, he will break that record and become the player who has played in the most All-Star games ever. He will also become the oldest player to bat fourth in an All-Star game. He is 43 years and 199 days old.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng said he learned about many of his records only when he read about them in the news. He feels very proud to break these records. Almost every year, he has been chosen or suggested to play in the All-Star game. He thanked the coaches and fans who voted for him. He also said, "I thank myself, because I worked very, very hard to have the chance for everyone to see what I can do."</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng laughed again and said that being chosen for TEAM TAIWAN, which has many young players, felt a bit strange. He felt that everyone on the bus was very young. He was not from the same generation of players as them. He sat at the back of the bus, and Hu Chin-Lung sat at the front. He said it was like "one boss at the back, one boss at the front." The younger players always came to say hello to them.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng also said he was surprised when he saw that he would be the starting fourth batter. He also knew that this team is getting ready for the World Baseball Classic next year. He said, "I cannot play for too long, I am just helping for a short time." He hopes to have many good memories from this year's All-Star game.</p>
