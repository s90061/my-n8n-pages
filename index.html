            <h1>US Imposes 35% Tariffs, Criticizing Canada for Weak Fentanyl Smuggling Control</h1>
            <p>The US White House said today that President Trump signed an order. This order will raise the tax on all Canadian goods sent to the US from 25% to 35%. These goods are not part of the USMCA trade agreement. One reason for this is that the US believes Canada has not stopped fentanyl from being smuggled.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the White House said goods sent through other countries to avoid the new taxes will get an extra 40% tax.</p>
            <p>This is the newest step in a months-long tax fight started by Trump after he became president. Part of the reason is that Washington says Canada has not stopped fentanyl from being smuggled effectively.</p>
            <p>The White House said Canada "has not acted and has sought revenge." President Trump believes it is necessary to raise the taxes. Before this, Trump said that Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney tried to contact him before the August 1st tax deadline, but they did not talk.</p>
            <p>Trump had said earlier that if a country did not make a deal with the US by August 1st, its goods would face higher taxes. Carney's office did not answer immediately when asked for a comment.</p>
            <p>Officials in Ottawa have often said that very little fentanyl comes into the US from Canada. They also said Canada has taken steps to control its borders better.</p>
            <p>Trump said that even though he loves Canada, Canada has been "very bad" to the US for many years.</p>
            <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that if Carney "starts to charm and stops taking revenge," Trump might think about the taxes again.</p>
            <p>About 75% of all Canadian goods sent out of the country go to the southern border. This means they are easily affected by US trade actions.</p>
            <p>This new 35% tax will affect steel, aluminum, cars, and products that do not follow the rules of the USMCA free trade agreement.</p>
            <p>Experts in economics say that even with the tax pressure, Canada's economy has shown surprising strength. It is expected to avoid a recession.</p>

            <h1>Tropical Depression Forms, Weather Agency Predicts It Will Become a Typhoon Within 24 Hours</h1>
            <p>The Weather Agency said that the 13th tropical depression this year formed this morning. It might become Typhoon Bailu, the 10th typhoon this year, within the next 24 hours. It is expected to move towards the sea southeast of Japan. It will not directly affect Taiwan. But it will make the southwest airflow stronger, causing more rain in central and southern Taiwan tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Lin Ding-yi, a forecaster from the Central Weather Agency, told CNA that the 13th tropical depression this year formed this morning about 1200 kilometers east of Taipei. It is expected to follow Tropical Storm Krosa and move towards the sea southeast of Japan.</p>
            <p>Lin Ding-yi said that the new tropical depression might become Typhoon Bailu, the 10th typhoon this year, within the next 24 hours. It will not directly affect Taiwan. However, it will make the southwest airflow stronger. This will cause another round of heavy rain tomorrow, and the rain in central and southern Taiwan will become heavier.</p>
