            <h1>Putin: Russia Will Also Allow Chinese Citizens to Enter Without Visas</h1>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced that from September 15 this year to September 14, 2026, people with regular Russian passports can visit China without a visa for 30 days. This is a trial program.</p>
            <p>On September 4, Russian President Putin said that Russia will do the same for Chinese citizens. This means Chinese people can also visit Russia without a visa.</p>
            <p>According to Russia's Sputnik news agency on September 4, the 10th Eastern Economic Forum is happening in Vladivostok, Russia, from September 3 to 6. Putin met with Li Hongzhong, who is a vice chairman of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee. Putin thanked China for trying out the visa-free policy for Russian citizens.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "Please tell the Chinese leaders and our friend, President Xi Jinping, that Russia will definitely do the same in return for this friendly act. We will also have the same policy."</p>
            <p>On September 2, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced that China will try out a 30-day visa-free policy for people with regular Russian passports. This will be from September 15 this year to September 14, 2026.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun stated that the relationship between China and Russia is very strong, guided by their leaders. China thinks it's very important to make travel easier for people between the two countries. They want to help people from both countries connect more. This helps to strengthen the "China-Russia New Era Comprehensive Strategic Partnership." At that time, Putin was visiting China.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Water Dance Festival Starts September 13, Rainbow Bridge to Shine for 37 Days</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Water Dance Festival will take place from September 13 to October 19. It will use the Rainbow Bridge and Siko Wharf. For 37 days, there will be five water shows every evening. The city government reminds people that Rainbow Bridge will be closed during the shows. This is to stop people from getting wet from the water spray.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei Department of Tourism and Communications said that this year's event will have the same water shows, light projections, and water screen projections as last year. They have also added a new 120-meter long double water screen platform on the Keelung River. From September 13 to October 19, there will be a 5-minute water show every 30 minutes from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM.</p>
            <p>The Department of Tourism and Communications also said that this year, the shows are bigger and better. For the opening on September 13 and the Love Music Festival on October 4, there will be extra "water and fire dance" and "people and water dance" performances. These will be a great experience for both your ears and eyes.</p>
            <p>Also, during the festival, there will be special light art along the riverside every afternoon and evening. They will also display two different international cartoon character balloons, like Bluey, Hey Duggee, and Peppa Pig. Every Saturday, artists from the YOYO family and other performance groups will take turns performing.</p>
            <p>The Siko Ferry Terminal on the Keelung River, near Gate No. 4 on Songhe Road, has been a busy place for trade for a long time. It was once a very important place for goods to gather. The Rainbow Bridge connects Neihu and Songshan districts. It was finished at the end of 2007. The bridge is 4.5 meters wide and 167 meters long. Only people walking and riding bikes can use it.</p>
            <p>The Department of Tourism and Communications reminds everyone that to stop water from spraying on people during the shows, the Rainbow Bridge will be closed in both directions 5 minutes before each performance. It will open again after the show finishes. Please pay attention to this.</p>

            <h1>Chongqing Slogan Creator Qi Hong: I Acted Out of Sadness, But Not Hate (Interview)</h1>
            <p>Qi Hong, the person who made the anti-Communist Party slogans in Chongqing, said that the most important thing for resistance is determination. He said, "Why worry so much? I don't like to just accept things; I feel very sad and angry." Unlike some people in China who have done random attacks in the last two years, Qi Hong was brave and smart. He did not act out of revenge or hate.</p>
            <p>On August 29, large anti-Communist Party slogans were projected onto a building wall in Chongqing University Town. This surprised people both inside and outside China. It was surprising because it happened in China, where there are many cameras, and the person responsible was not caught.</p>
            <p>One week later, Qi Hong, who is in the UK, still does not have a normal life. He told a CNA reporter that he has lost more than 5 kilograms (about 10 pounds) in these days, and his wife looks worried. They are mainly concerned about their friends and family. Two of his friends in Chongqing have already been taken for questioning.</p>
            <p>Before the event, he had already taken his wife and two children to the UK. Then, he used a computer to project the slogans from far away. No one knew his plan before, not even his wife. He said, "If anyone knew, it would be dangerous. It's better if no one knows; if someone knew, it would put me in more danger." He told his family when they left the country that he might not come back.</p>
            <p>The large projected slogans included: "Down with the red fascists, overthrow the Communist Party's harsh rule!" "There can only be a new China without the Communist Party, freedom is not a gift, you must take it back!" "Rise up, people who do not want to be slaves, rise up and fight to take back your rights!" "No lies, only truth; no slavery, only freedom; the cruel Communist Party must step down!"</p>
            <p>It took the police about 50 minutes to find the projection equipment in a hotel room. Cameras in the room showed police rushing in and quickly turning off the projector. The police also found a letter Qi Hong left for them. In the letter, he wrote: "Maybe you are doing well now, but one day on this land, you will definitely suffer too." He asked them not to "help the evil rulers."</p>
            <p>The anti-Communist slogans on the Chongqing building, the letter to the police, and the video of the police entering the hotel room were posted online a few hours later. Many people shared the videos through accounts like 'Teacher Li is not your teacher' on the X platform. The whole world learned what happened. Even though people in China could not openly talk about it, some online news channels briefly posted articles the next day with titles like 'Tribute to the Hero.'</p>
            <p>When Qi Hong spoke to a CNA reporter by phone, he said that even the strictest surveillance has weak points. He explained that people are key to using technology for surveillance. He said, "Technology for watching people works both ways. The government watches us, but we can also watch them."</p>
            <p>He said that technology definitely gives more tools and chances for people to resist. But he also said he didn't use any high technology. He used a laser engraver to make the projection slides and remote control equipment, which are all normal products.</p>
            <p>After this event, he believes the government will make some changes to keep control, for example, checking hotel registrations more carefully. But he thinks these kinds of actions cannot be stopped unless the government stops everyone from staying in hotels, going abroad, using knives, or buying projectors. He said, "Unless society stops working, like during a lockdown," these things will continue.</p>
            <p>This action against the government was not sudden. Qi Hong usually speaks very boldly. Every year on the anniversary of 'June Fourth,' he posts on WeChat Moments, but his "friends don't dare to like his posts."</p>
            <p>Qi Hong was born in a village in 1982. He left school at 16 to work. Because he didn't have a temporary residence permit, he was often held and beaten by the police in Guangdong and Beijing when he was young. Later, he settled in Beijing. Because of his children's schooling, he learned about public intellectuals like Xu Zhiyong and many human rights lawyers. These people openly asked the government to follow laws and rules. At first, Qi Hong felt very far from these educated people, but his ideas slowly changed because of them.</p>
            <p>Xu Zhiyong is still in prison today. As early as 2000, he started a private organization. It worked to protect citizens' rights and the right to education for children of new city residents.</p>
            <p>Qi Hong said that when he was young, he felt oppressed and helpless. In the past, people who were treated badly wanted revenge. But later, he learned about public intellectuals and lawyers fighting for rights. He also studied Buddhism and learned to be against hate.</p>
            <p>He showed some understanding for the increasing number of random attacks in Chinese society in the last two years. He said, "I believe that when things are normal, these people don't want to hurt others." But when he thought about these problems and planned his actions, he was more logical and also thought about safety.</p>
            <p>As for the recent reason for his action, he was inspired by Peng Lifafa, the "Beijing Sitong Bridge warrior," who put up protest banners. Qi Hong also felt that continuing to live in China had no meaning. He said, "I felt like I couldn't breathe. This kind of life goes against what I want and what life should be. I had no hope."</p>
            <p>He thinks protesting itself is not hard; the most important thing is determination. He said, "Why worry so much? I don't like to just accept things; instead, I feel very sad and angry about how different groups of people are treated." Studying Buddhism also made him feel more sympathy for people living in China. He can understand more deeply the problems the Communist Party system causes for people's bodies and minds. However, he did not expect this action to get such a big reaction, and he does not see himself as a hero or a brave person.</p>
            <p>Qi Hong has never been to Taiwan. From different information, he learned that Taiwan keeps some traditional Chinese culture. In mainland China, Taiwan's democracy is often called 'messy,' but he believes allowing different opinions is good. He said, "Here (in mainland China), there is only one opinion; when you vote, it's always yes." He also said that people in Taiwan don't need to bow to officials. People are very free and dare to say what they think.</p>
            <p>When he left China this time, he did not think about coming to Taiwan. He knew that Taiwan's laws generally do not accept people seeking shelter from mainland China. Also, he heard that many Hong Kong people did not get the treatment they expected when they went to Taiwan. With the disagreements between Taiwan and mainland China, he understood that as a Chinese person, he would face problems in Taiwan right now.</p>
            <p>Qi Hong said that while the Chinese Communist Party does threaten Taiwan, and he understands this causes fear, he does not agree with creating conflict. He feels that Taiwanese people are like family. They share the same language, writing, and similar culture. His grandfather was even a Kuomintang officer. He said, "Taiwanese people don't need to hate people from the mainland. Even though some mainland people are misled, they are also victims." He firmly dislikes creating hate because it is pointless.</p>
            <p>Currently, Qi Hong and his family are in the UK. There are many unknown things about their future, and he is very quiet about it. He said, "I definitely cannot go back to mainland China. Even if they let me go back, I definitely won't. Going to that place, there is no difference between being alive or dead." He stated that many things will need to be decided later, and he hopes to continue learning new things in his new environment in the future.</p>
