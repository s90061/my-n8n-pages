            <h1>Canadian Media: Canadian and Australian Warships Sail Through Taiwan Strait, Chinese Military Calls it Provocation and Follows Closely</h1>
            <p>Canadian media reported that warships from Canada and Australia sailed through the Taiwan Strait on the morning of September 6th, Taiwan time. Chinese naval and air forces followed them closely. China stated that this action by Canada and Australia was "trouble-making and provocative." China also said it "sends wrong signals and increases safety risks." Even though Beijing often protests, Western armies continue to say they have the right to use these waters.</p>
            <p>Canadian TV (CTV) and the Globe & Mail both reported this news recently. The Globe & Mail also said that the Canadian military usually does not talk about these actions. However, the Canadian warship's trip through the Taiwan Strait on September 6th seems to be the first since February this year. It is also the first since Mark Carney became the Prime Minister of Canada. Prime Minister Carney has been trying to improve relations with Beijing.</p>
            <p>In the early morning of September 6th, Taiwan time, the Canadian Navy frigate "HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec" and the Australian guided missile destroyer "HMAS Brisbane" went into the Taiwan Strait. Shi Yi, a spokesperson for China's People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement later that day that Chinese air and sea forces "monitored and watched" the Canadian and Australian warships' passage. He added that they were "highly alert and strongly defended national sovereignty, security, and regional peace and stability."</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said that on September 6th, the military saw 21 Chinese aircraft, including drones, and 6 warships in the Taiwan Strait. They are "watching the situation closely." The Ministry of National Defense also said that the military "sent suitable naval and air forces to make sure the waterway is safe and stable."</p>
            <p>The Globe & Mail pointed out that most Western countries, including Canada, and the Taiwanese government see the Taiwan Strait as international waters. In recent years, the armies of the United States and its allies have said they have the right to do "freedom of navigation" exercises through the Taiwan Strait. This makes Beijing angry, and China has increased its military presence in these sensitive waters to pressure Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Halifax-class frigate "HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec" has been in the Western Pacific since April this year. Canada says this mission is "a full military action by the Canadian Armed Forces to help peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region and support the international system based on international law."</p>
            <p>When announcing this mission, Steve Boivin, the Commander of the Canadian Joint Operations Command, said: "This mission shows again that the Canadian Armed Forces are committed to international peace and security through excellent military skills. Our ability to work smoothly with our allies makes us a valuable partner in keeping global stability."</p>
            <p>The Canadian and Australian warships went through the Taiwan Strait together after they took part in a joint exercise near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. This exercise included the Philippines, Canada, Australia, and the United States, and it made China unhappy. The exercise happened on September 3rd, while China was holding a large military parade in Beijing.</p>
            <p>CTV reported that Wyatt Shorter, a spokesperson for the Canadian Joint Operations Command, said earlier this week that the frigate "HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec" was doing "Operation HORIZON." At that time, Shorter did not want to say if the Canadian frigate would go into the Taiwan Strait. He only said that "talking about the specific travel plans of deployed ships goes against rules for operational safety."</p>

            <h1>Chen Pei-chi: Ko Wen-je Hopes to Immediately Return to Hsinchu to See His Mother After Bail on the 8th</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court decided that Ko Wen-je, the former chairman of the Taiwan People's Party, can be released on bail. Ko Wen-je's wife, Chen Pei-chi, said today that Ko's lawyer told her Ko's first wish. He hopes to go back to Hsinchu right away to see his mother. He also wants "to see where his father's ashes are. This is a wish he has always had on his mind."</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is handling the Jinghua City case. Former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je asked to be released on bail a few days ago. On September 5th, the Taipei Court agreed to set his bail at 70 million New Taiwan Dollars. But Ko Wen-je said after meeting his lawyer that he needed more time to think. The Taiwan People's Party said that they will wait for Ko Wen-je to tell his lawyer that he agrees on September 8th. Then, they will quickly finish the bail process at the Taipei Court to welcome Ko Wen-je out.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi went outside the Tucheng Detention Center this evening to encourage supporters. When she was on a live broadcast, she said thank you to the "Little Grass" and supporters for always standing by Ko Wen-je. She hopes that tomorrow she can pay Ko Wen-je's bail at the Taipei Court easily and safely go home with him.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that the lawyer told her Ko Wen-je's first wish is to go back to Hsinchu to see his mother right away. So, the plan for tomorrow after bail is to go back to Hsinchu first to see Ko's mother. He also wants "to see where his father's ashes are. This is a wish he has always had on his mind."</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi explained that on March 10th, the day of Ko Wen-je's father's funeral, Ko Wen-je kept trying to wait until his father was cremated and placed properly, but his request was not accepted. Not being able to be with his father was Ko Wen-je's biggest regret. So, "tomorrow he will go to Hsinchu to visit his mother-in-law and see where his father is." After that, he will likely focus seriously on how to fight his court case.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi also said that the lawyer told her Ko Wen-je hopes to have a normal desk, chair, and lamp. This is because there were no tables or chairs in the Taipei Detention Center, so he had to kneel or lie down to read things. Also, the lights were dim, and Ko Wen-je's eyes have been getting worse this year.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that a short meeting with everyone will also be arranged in front of the Taipei Court tomorrow. If there is enough time, Ko Wen-je will travel all over Taiwan, from north to south. He will "personally thank" all the people and groups who supported and encouraged him.</p>

            <h1>OPEC+ Main Oil-Producing Countries Decide to Increase Daily Production by Over 130,000 Barrels from October</h1>
            <p>London, September 7th (Central News Agency) â€“ The eight main member countries of OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) said today that they have agreed to increase oil production again. They will increase the daily output by 137,000 barrels starting from October.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that these eight countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman.</p>
            <p>The heads of the energy departments in these countries said in a statement that they decided to increase daily production by 137,000 barrels starting next month.</p>
            <p>In recent years, OPEC+ had often agreed to produce less oil to keep oil prices high. However, since April this year, the eight countries mentioned earlier have changed their plan. They now want to get back more of the market share. They have agreed to a series of increases in production. Currently, international oil prices are around a relatively low level of over 60 US dollars per barrel.</p>
