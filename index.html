            <h1>Man Accused of Harassment on Bus, Claims He Was Saying Goodbye</h1>
            <p>A man named Huang was on a bus in New Taipei City. He is accused of touching a male student's head and his bottom. Mr. Huang said he was just reaching out to say goodbye. However, prosecutors in New Taipei did not believe him. They have recently charged him with breaking the law against sexual harassment.</p>
            <p>According to the official document, in May this year, Mr. Huang was on a crowded bus in the evening. A male student was sitting separately from his mother. Mr. Huang first touched the student's head. Then, when the student moved to another seat and turned around, Mr. Huang touched his bottom.</p>
            <p>The male student cried and told his mother what happened. The mother then told the bus driver, who called the police. During the investigation, Mr. Huang admitted he touched the student's shoulder. But he said he was trying to stop the student from falling. He also said that the video showed his hand out because he was saying goodbye to the student.</p>
            <p>However, when Mr. Huang showed how he would wave goodbye during questioning, it did not match what the video showed. So, the prosecutors did not accept his explanation. The prosecutors have charged Mr. Huang with sexual harassment. They said he touched a private part of the body when the person could not stop him. His punishment will be more severe because it involves a child, according to child protection laws.</p>

            <h1>Poland Limits Flights Near Eastern Border After Suspected Drone Invasion</h1>
            <p>Poland's military said today that it has put limits on flying near its eastern borders. These borders are next to Belarus and Ukraine. This happened one day after a suspected Russian drone flew into Polish air.</p>
            <p>Last night, Poland's air service said that the military asked them to create a special no-fly zone in eastern Poland. This zone is called EP R129. It started at 10:00 PM GMT on September 10 and will last until December 9. This is to keep the country safe.</p>
            <p>The Polish air service explained that normal planes cannot fly in the area near the borders with Belarus and Ukraine. There will be only a few special cases where flights are allowed.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Poland shot down a drone that they thought came from Russia. Planes from NATO countries helped Poland. This was the first time a NATO country had fired at a drone since the war between Russia and Ukraine started.</p>
            <p>Russia's Defense Ministry said yesterday that its drones attacked important military places in western Ukraine. They said they did not plan to attack anything in Poland.</p>

            <h1>Yageo Plans to Buy 28.5% of Oriental Semi for NT$4.889 Billion</h1>
            <p>Yageo, a big company that makes electronic parts, announced today that it will buy 28.5% of Oriental Semi company's shares. They will start buying on September 12. They will pay 229.8 New Taiwan dollars for each share. The total money needed will be 4.889 billion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Reports show that no single investor owns more than 5% of Oriental Semi's shares right now. If Yageo buys at least 5% of the shares, they could become the biggest single owner of Oriental Semi.</p>
            <p>Yageo said that Oriental Semi has been doing well for a long time and makes steady money for its investors. So, Yageo wants to buy Oriental Semi's shares as a financial investment. They expect to earn money over a long time from this investment. This will also give them a chance to talk with Oriental Semi's leaders. They hope to find ways to work together and make Yageo more competitive in the long run.</p>
            <p>Yageo held a meeting this evening to explain important news. Mr. Chang Tien-cheng, a senior manager in Yageo's finance department, said that the company's board decided today to buy 28.5% of Oriental Semi's shares for 229.8 New Taiwan dollars per share. Oriental Semi's shares closed today at 191.5 New Taiwan dollars. This means Yageo is offering about 20% more.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chang explained that Yageo will tell the Financial Supervisory Commission about this offer. The public buying period will be from September 12 to October 1. Yageo plans to buy a maximum of 21,277,245 shares. This is 28.5% of all Oriental Semi's shares. They need to buy at least 3,733,000 shares, which is about 5% of all shares. The deal will happen if they buy at least this minimum number of shares.</p>
            <p>Yageo said that Oriental Semi is a company that designs Power Integrated Circuits (Power ICs). They design, test, make, and sell chips for mixed signals and sensors. Their main products are ICs for fan motors and power management. These are used in laptops, DDR memory, TVs, monitors, electronic devices, graphics cards, and car electronics. Recently, they have also started to work on industrial products.</p>
