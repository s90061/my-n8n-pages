            <h1>Japan and Philippines Deepen AI Disaster Prevention Cooperation, Company Hopes to Introduce System to Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A Japanese company called Spectee introduced a new AI system today. This system helps the Philippines manage disasters and risks. It can find and remove wrong information online when natural disasters happen. Spectee said they visited Taiwan's weather office and hope to bring their system to Taiwan too.</p>
            <p>Spectee started working with the Philippines' Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT). This happened with help from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).</p>
            <p>At a press conference today, Mr. Naobumi Yokota, a Japanese official in the Philippines, spoke. He said that the new Spectee Pro system in the Philippines is a new way for Japan and the Philippines to work together on disaster prevention. Before, their help was mostly about physical things like buildings.</p>
            <p>He added that new digital technologies will help the Philippines and local governments respond to disasters faster and more accurately.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kenjiro Murakami, who started Spectee and is its CEO, said that both Japan and the Philippines often have natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes. He also said that the system has worked well in Japan. So, they chose the Philippines as the first country to offer their system to outside of Japan.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs Accepts Applications for 4 Tariff Support Measures, Prioritizing Urgent Needs to Support Industries</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said today that it has started four new programs to help industries in Taiwan. These programs are for companies dealing with new tariffs from the United States and other changes in the world. Companies can start applying for these programs from July 7th. Even before a special budget is approved, the government will use money from other areas to help industries that need it most.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Development Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained the four programs in a press release.</p>
            <p>First, there's more help for small and medium-sized businesses with loans. Companies affected by tariffs can get a loan of up to 35 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) with an interest rate of 2.22% or less. If the loan is 2.5 million NTD or less, the interest rate will be 1.5% lower for up to six months. For loans of 1 million NTD or less, the government will guarantee 100% of the loan.</p>
            <p>Also, there's more help for export loans. For companies that export a lot and are affected by tariffs, small and medium-sized businesses can get a guarantee of up to 60 million NTD. The government will guarantee up to 95% of the loan, and companies won't pay any guarantee fees for up to two years. For larger companies, the guarantee can be up to 100 million NTD, and the government will guarantee 80% to 90% of the loan. This helps companies with their money problems.</p>
            <p>Second, there is money for research and development (R&D) and changing old equipment. Manufacturing companies affected by US tariffs can get money for new R&D and for replacing old machines. Individual small and medium-sized businesses can get up to 5 million NTD. Groups of companies (industry alliances) can get up to 40 million NTD. This money can be used for things like improving technology, combining different areas of business, and marketing. The goal is to make better products or technologies and sell them to other countries. The government will pay no more than 50% of the total cost.</p>
            <p>For example, companies can use up to 40% of the total money for buying new equipment for R&D, testing, and production. This will help them improve their technology and stay competitive.</p>
            <p>Third, there is help for getting orders from other countries. Companies directly or indirectly affected by US tariffs can get money for this. A single company can get up to 5 million NTD. Two or more companies applying together can get up to 20 million NTD. This money can be used to set up new sales centers, service centers, or warehouses in other countries. It can also be used to sign contracts with new agents or distributors. This helps companies expand globally and get more business.</p>
            <p>Fourth, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, together with the Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund and banks, has a new program. This program helps small and medium-sized businesses get credit guarantees for managing currency risks. Small and medium-sized businesses applying for export loans who need to manage future currency changes can get an extra guarantee of up to 60 million NTD for these currency trades. The government will guarantee 100% of these trades, and there will be no guarantee fees.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that the partner banks will also not charge extra fees or deposits. They will offer good exchange rates. This helps small and medium-sized businesses manage currency risks with low costs and low risk. It helps them avoid losing profits from exports because of currency changes.</p>
            <p>Also, for expanding into new markets, the Bureau of Foreign Trade is giving more money to companies and business groups. This money helps them attend international exhibitions, set up sales points overseas, and use the "TAIWAN SELECT" brand to promote products made in Taiwan around the world. It also helps them invite more buyers to Taiwan for business talks and use digital tools for smart marketing to get more orders from other countries.</p>
