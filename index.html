            <h1>Tariffs and Exchange Rate Disturbances: Many Semiconductor Companies' Q3 Operations Not Strong During Peak Season</h1>
            <p>It is usually a busy time for the semiconductor industry. However, because of changes in tariffs (taxes on goods) and exchange rates (how much one country's money is worth compared to another's), many semiconductor companies expect their business in the third quarter to be slow. They think their sales might not be strong, and could even be lower than in the second quarter.</p>
            <p>Semiconductor companies are holding meetings to talk about their business. A main topic for them is how tariffs and exchange rates affect their work. Companies do not sell much directly to the US, so tariffs do not affect them much in that way. But because of tariffs, customers bought many products earlier in the year. This changed the usual business cycle, so there is not a big difference between busy and slow times.</p>
            <p>Because customers bought products early, most companies had good business in the first half of the year, even when it is usually slow. Now, with new US tariffs starting and customers already having many products, people are buying less in the second half of the year. So, companies might not have strong sales in the third quarter, which is usually a busy time.</p>
            <p>MediaTek, a company that makes phone chips, said that some orders came in earlier this year, so the third quarter's sales pattern is different from before. Another company, PixArt, which makes sensor chips, said that customers for mouse chips bought a lot in the last few quarters. So, in the third quarter, they might buy less. However, PixArt sees more small, quick orders. They can see orders for about 2 to 3 months ahead.</p>
            <p>Novatek, a company that makes display driver chips, said that the effect of early buying due to China's help and US tariffs is slowing down. The market is now waiting to see what happens. Customers are not placing many orders for the third quarter.</p>
            <p>The New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) became much stronger in the second quarter. Most semiconductor companies sell their products in US dollars. This strong NTD not only reduced their sales in NTD but also caused them to lose money from currency exchange. Some companies even lost money overall because of these exchange losses.</p>
            <p>In the second quarter, GUC, a company that makes special chips, made 35 million New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) from its main business. But it lost 33 million NTD from currency exchange. With other small losses, the company lost 2.31 million NTD after taxes. This means it lost 0.06 NTD for each share.</p>
            <p>Since the start of the third quarter, the New Taiwan Dollar has not gotten stronger. It has even gone down a little, close to 30 NTD for one US dollar. However, most companies still think the average value of the New Taiwan Dollar in the third quarter will be higher than in the second quarter. This will continue to affect how well they do business in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>PixArt expects its sales in US dollars for the third quarter to be similar to or slightly higher than the second quarter. However, their sales in New Taiwan Dollars might go down compared to the second quarter. MediaTek thinks its sales in the third quarter will be about 4.49 to 4.83 billion US dollars, which is 1% to 8% less than the previous quarter. Their sales in New Taiwan Dollars will be about 130.1 to 140 billion, a drop of 7% to 13%. This means the decrease in sales could get bigger.</p>
            <p>While tariffs and exchange rates are affecting most semiconductor companies, the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is still very strong. TSMC, a company that makes almost all AI chips, is still positive about its business. They expect their sales in US dollars to grow by 8% in the third quarter. For the whole year, their sales in US dollars are expected to grow by about 30%. This growth is much higher than the 15.4% growth expected for the global semiconductor industry.</p>

            <h1>Trump: If Courts Rule Tariffs Illegal, US Could Face Another Great Depression</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Donald Trump warned that if courts decide his widespread tariffs (taxes on imported goods) are against the law, the American economy could face problems like the Great Depression of 1929 again.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that if a "far-left court" rules his tariff actions are illegal, "such a huge amount of money and honor might never be fixed or paid back."</p>
            <p>He said, "The Great Depression of 1929 will happen again!"</p>
            <p>Trump made these big statements while a US federal appeals court is looking at whether his use of the "Emergency Economic Powers Act" to put general tariffs on US trading partners is legal.</p>
            <p>At the end of May, the US International Trade Court decided that Trump's policy of matching tariffs was beyond his power and therefore not valid. Trump's government quickly appealed this decision. When the US federal appeals court heard the case in June, it decided that the tariffs could continue.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that billions of dollars from tariffs are "pouring into" the Treasury Department. He also pointed to the US stock market reaching new high points recently. He said these things prove that his tariffs have brought "the biggest amount of money, wealth, and power in American history."</p>
            <p>However, many economic experts are worried that the tariffs are making prices go up (inflation). They also think that not knowing what will happen with trade policies is making investments slower.</p>
            <p>This case might finally go to the Supreme Court, where most judges are conservative (6 to 3). But experts believe the final result is still unclear.</p>

            <h1>570,000 People Apply for Real Estate Change Alert Service, Already Successfully Prevented Fraud</h1>
            <p>To stop fraud groups from tricking people into using their land or houses as a guarantee for loans through "fake investments," the Ministry of the Interior started a service called "Real Estate Change Instant Alert." By the end of June, 570,000 people across Taiwan had signed up for it. This service has already helped stop fraud in Tainan.</p>
            <p>With the Ministry of the Interior's "Real Estate Change Instant Alert" service, if a person signs up, they will get an instant message or email when there are changes to their property. This includes when it is bought, sold, or used as a loan guarantee. The message also goes to one contact person they choose. This helps people know about changes to their property right away, making their property safer.</p>
            <p>Liu Se-fang, the Minister of the Interior, said in a press release today that older people living alone or who do not know much about technology can easily become targets for fraud. The instant alert service can also send messages to their children or trusted friends. People can use this service well. A little extra care can make older people's property safer.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of the Interior, by the end of June, 570,000 people across the country had signed up for the instant alert service, and it has already stopped fraud. Recently, in Tainan, the Guiren Land Office received an application from a 77-year-old person to put a loan guarantee on their property. This person had signed up for the instant alert service and put their child's phone number as the second contact. So, when the child got the message from the Land Office, they realized their father might be a victim of investment fraud. After talking, they immediately asked to stop the loan guarantee process.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of the Interior stated that if people want to sign up for the real estate change instant alert service, they can go to any land office in person. They can also apply online through the Ministry of Land Administration's "Digital Counter" website using their personal or business ID. Furthermore, when people buy new property, they can apply for this service at the same time they register the property transfer.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of the Interior reminds everyone that when signing up for the instant alert service, you can also add a trusted friend or family member to receive alerts, in addition to yourself. If there are 12 types of changes to your property in the future, such as buying, selling, auctioning, setting up a loan guarantee, or replacing property papers, the land office will send a text message or email right away.</p>
