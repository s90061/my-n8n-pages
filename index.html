            <h1>US August Producer Price Index Drops 0.1%, First Fall Since April</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 10 (AFP) â€“ The US Department of Labor announced today that the Producer Price Index (PPI) for August went down by 0.1% from the previous month. This was a surprise, and it's the first monthly drop since April. The main reasons for this decrease were lower energy prices and a fall in trade services.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the August PPI dropped by 0.1% compared to July. Analysts had expected it to go up by 0.3%. The yearly PPI increase for August was 2.6%, which is also lower than in July.</p>
            <p>These numbers come at a time when government officials are trying to understand how President Donald Trump's new tariffs are affecting the economy.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve (Fed) will have a meeting next week to decide on interest rates. If inflation stays high, it will be hard for the Fed to lower rates. However, with inflation slowing down and the job market becoming weaker, most people expect the Fed to lower interest rates by 0.25% (25 basis points) this month.</p>
            <p>The Department of Labor said that lower prices for services were the main reason for the PPI decrease, especially the smaller profits from trade services.</p>
            <p>If you take out food, energy, and trade services, the PPI went up by 0.3% from the previous month and by 2.8% from last year. This is the biggest yearly increase since March.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which many people pay more attention to, will be released tomorrow.</p>

            <h1>Minister Lin Chia-lung Writes to Romanian Media, Asks International Community to Help Taiwan Join the UN</h1>
            <p>Prague, September 10 (CNA) â€“ Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung wrote an article for "Newsweek," a major Romanian newspaper. In the article, he asked the global community to reject China's wrong interpretation of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. He said that Taiwan's important place and contributions in the world should be recognized, and that the world should work with Taiwan to let it join the United Nations. This is the first time a Taiwanese government official's article has been published in Romanian media.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from Taiwan's representative office in Slovakia, the Romanian version of the famous American political magazine "Newsweek Romania" published Minister Lin Chia-lung's full article on September 10. This happened as the UN General Assembly officially started on September 9. The article was titled "Working with Taiwan for Global Peace and Prosperity."</p>
            <p>In his article, Lin Chia-lung urged the international community to say no to China's bad twisting of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. He also said that Taiwan's rightful place and good work in the world should be seen and supported.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung pointed out that Taiwan has been kept out of the UN system for many years because China has purposefully misunderstood Resolution 2758. He explained that this resolution did not decide Taiwan's international status. It also did not stop Taiwan from being part of the UN or its special groups, like the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).</p>
            <p>He noted that in recent years, more and more countries have openly said that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are important. They have done this in talks between two countries and in larger groups like the G7. These countries also support Taiwan having a meaningful role in international matters.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung said that authoritarian governments are still using "gray zone" tactics to cause problems with international order. Because of this, peace is not something we can take for granted anymore. He believes democratic countries should work more closely together to make their societies and systems stronger. Taiwan is actively using its "smart diplomacy," which means combining its diplomatic, defense, technology, and economic strengths. It is also making its cooperation with democratic countries deeper to strengthen the global chain of democratic values and work together to protect international rules.</p>
            <p>He further stated that Taiwan is a very important member of the "first island chain." Taiwan not only defends democracy and freedom but also helps a lot with stability and growth in the Indo-Pacific area and the whole world. It does this with its strong economy and world-leading semiconductor industry.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also mentioned that Taiwan is actively creating a "non-red supply chain." This is to reduce its reliance on authoritarian governments and keep key industries safe. Also, through the "Glorious Nation Project," Taiwan is working with friendly countries, both public and private organizations, to achieve real results. For example, it is helping Paraguay build an integrated medical information system, helping Eswatini with an oil reserve project, and helping Palau develop smart and sustainable islands. This shows Taiwan's promise to help global sustainable development.</p>
            <p>He said that Taiwan will continue to strongly defend democratic values both at home and abroad. President Lai Ching-te has suggested a "Four Pillars of Peace" action plan. This plan aims to make defense and social strength better. It also asks Beijing to restart talks based on equality and respect.</p>
            <p>Finally, Lin Chia-lung asked the international community to keep its promise to "leave no one behind." This is especially important as the UN approaches its 80th anniversary and there are only five years left to reach the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He believes that only by truly including Taiwan can the world work together for a more peaceful, rich, and sustainable future.</p>
            <p>The Romanian version of "Newsweek" has been published both in print and online since 2018 and has a big impact on society.</p>

            <h1>Changhua and Kinmen Hope Central Government Won't Reduce Local Subsidies</h1>
            <p>Changhua, September 10 (CNA) â€“ Changhua County Magistrate Wang Huei-mei said today that the central government's decision to stop using a formula to calculate general subsidies has caused a problem. The financial support coming in has decreased, but spending has gone up. The Kinmen County Government's Department of Finance asked the central government to legally ensure that all local governments receive general subsidies that are not less than the amount received in 2025.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Executive Yuan spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said that the new formula for how money is shared had problems. More than NT$30 billion could not be given out. She said the central government wants to give money but cannot, so the law needs to be changed. She also mentioned that the total amount of money the central government will give to local governments next year will be the highest ever. The central government has to look again at how power and responsibilities are divided between the central and local governments. Premier Cho Jung-tai also said he would invite county leaders to talk about the law for sharing money.</p>
            <p>Regarding the law for sharing money and the issue of tax revenue sharing, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen today brought together mayors and county magistrates from 15 blue and white (KMT and Ko Wen-je's TPP) controlled areas, including Chiang Wan-an and Hou Yu-ih. They held a press conference in Taipei titled "Fifteen Counties and Cities Stand Up! Protect Local Subsidies." They released a joint statement to protect local subsidies. Magistrate Wang Huei-mei, who attended the meeting, also explained her position through a county government press release.</p>
            <p>Magistrate Wang Huei-mei said today that because the central government stopped using a formula to calculate general subsidies, the financial income from subsidies has decreased, and expenses have increased. Local governments are facing unclear information about subsidies and a lack of fair subsidy rules. This will directly affect important public works and services for the people.</p>
            <p>Wang Huei-mei said that last year, the county government should have received NT$18.9 billion in general subsidies based on the formula. However, as of September 5 this year, they have only received notices from various central government agencies approving about NT$5.7 billion for regular, widespread, basic construction, or maintenance projects. They also recently confirmed NT$2.2 billion for social welfare subsidies for 2026. This means a total shortage of about NT$11 billion in funds. Because this subsidy information is unclear and not fair, it greatly affects local public works and services. She hopes the central government will listen to the people of Changhua.</p>
            <p>In addition, regarding this issue, the Kinmen County Government's Department of Finance said in a written statement in the evening that, according to information from the Ministry of Finance, Kinmen County has currently received NT$4.835 billion in shared taxes. After the county government calculated it themselves, Kinmen still has NT$4.355 billion that has not been given out. They hope the central government will follow the spirit of the new law for sharing money and provide enough money to support the development of the outlying islands.</p>
            <p>The Department of Finance also stated that Article 30, Paragraph 3 of the new law for sharing money clearly says that the amount of general subsidies cannot be less than the amount from the year before the new law took effect. They asked the central government to legally ensure that all local governments receive general subsidies that are not less than the amount received in 2025. They also said that the central government should not easily cut, reduce, or delay the subsidies it has already approved, so as not to hurt the progress of local government plans.</p>
