            <h1>CDMO Business Grows, Bora Pharma's Half-Year Earnings Per Share Reach NT$19.5</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals announced its financial report for the first half of the year. Its sales were 9.347 billion New Taiwan dollars. Thanks to the growth in its CDMO business, the company's net profit for owners was 2.016 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is an increase of 11.9% compared to last year. The earnings per share (EPS) were 19.5 New Taiwan dollars, which means the company earned almost twice its share capital.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals announced today that its CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year, including internal orders. Sales reached over 5.01 billion New Taiwan dollars. This happened because the company increased its production capacity and started using new types of medicines. However, during a period of change, there were delays in production at its sterile injectable drug factories in Maryland, USA, and Zhunan, Taiwan. This slowed things down. But the situation got better in June, and delayed orders will be filled gradually. The company has a clear view of its orders and strong long-term demand.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals said it continues to invest more in its CDMO business around the world. Recently, a new production line for high-performance skin medicines was added at its factory in Canada. This will allow for faster, larger, and more flexible production of these types of orders. This new line will help the Canadian factory grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injectable drug production line in Maryland, USA, is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. From 2026, the automatic AST isolation filling system will slowly begin operation. Also, in the first half of this year, clinical-stage customers at the Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, became stronger and turned into long-term partners. Many drug companies have started signing contracts because they see the benefits of manufacturing in the USA.</p>
            <p>Sheng Bao-hsi, the chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, said that since the start of this year, the CDMO business has gained 8 new customers. Most of these orders are handled by the Maple Grove factory, which is important for manufacturing in North America. This year, new orders worth 138 million US dollars have been added. Most of these new orders are for the Canadian factory and the sterile drug factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was part of the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started working. Several US drug companies in the later stages of development are asking about the plan to expand production to 2000 liters.</p>
