            <h1>Formosa Petrochemical: Gasoline Prices Increase by NT$0.1, Diesel by NT$0.4 Starting August 25th</h1>
            <p>Formosa Petrochemical announced today that starting from 1 AM on August 25th, the wholesale price of gasoline will go up by NT$0.1 per liter. The wholesale price of diesel will also increase by NT$0.4 per liter. Gas stations will decide their own selling prices.</p>
            <p>Formosa Petrochemical shared the suggested retail prices for their gas stations. 92 unleaded gasoline will be NT$27.3 per liter, 95+ unleaded gasoline will be NT$28.8 per liter, 98 unleaded gasoline will be NT$30.8 per liter, and premium diesel will be NT$26 per liter.</p>
            <p>Formosa Petrochemical said that international oil prices went up. This happened because oil storage in the United States decreased more than people expected. Also, peace talks between Russia and Ukraine are not moving forward. These things made oil more expensive.</p>

            <h1>Venus Williams Ready for Her 25th US Open, Hopes to Play Her Best and Enjoy</h1>
            <p>Venus Williams, who is 45 years old, will play in the US Open for the 25th time in her career. Today, she said she is very excited for this year's competition. She also mentioned that playing on her "home ground" always feels new and exciting.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Venus is a very important player in tennis. This might be her last time playing singles at the US Open. On August 25th, in her first match, she will play against Karolina Muchova from the Czech Republic, who is the 11th seed in the tournament.</p>
            <p>Venus's current world ranking is 610. After getting a special entry into the tournament, she said she is "super excited to be back" at the US Open.</p>
            <p>She told the media, "It never gets old; it just gets more exciting."</p>
            <p>Venus came back to tennis in July this year, after not playing for 16 months. She won her first match at the Washington Open but stopped in the second round.</p>
            <p>Venus first played in the US Open 28 years ago, in 1997. She was 17 years old then and reached the finals, but she lost to Martina Hingis from Switzerland.</p>
            <p>That match made her famous. After that, she slowly became a tennis legend. She won 7 Grand Slam singles titles. She also won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister, Serena Williams.</p>
            <p>Even though she has had a very successful career, Venus said today that her love for tennis has not gone away. She said, "I love this work; it makes me happy."</p>
            <p>Venus stated that she will approach her 25th US Open with a relaxed mind. She said, "I want to play my best. That's what I expect from myself, to play as well as I can. And that's all any player can ask of themselves."</p>

            <h1>Lu Shiow-yen Will Not Run for KMT Chairperson, Will "Stay Home" to Help Industries</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairperson Eric Chu openly asked Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to take over his role as chairperson. Today, Lu Shiow-yen announced that she will not run for KMT chairperson. She said that industries are facing a very difficult time, and during such hard times, she must stay in her current job. She used the phrase "Mom will stay home," meaning she will stay to help.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, after the recall vote results were counted, Eric Chu spoke at the KMT headquarters. He said he sincerely asked Lu Shiow-yen to become the KMT chairperson and take on the important responsibilities. He added that he and all the talented young team members will work hard to help the KMT return to power. He promised to fully support the KMT team led by Lu Shiow-yen to win elections again.</p>
            <p>At noon, after attending an event for the Greater Taichung Chamber of Commerce, Lu Shiow-yen spoke to reporters. She announced that she would not run for party chairperson. She wants to stay in her position and "Mom will stay home" to support businesses and citizens during this tough time.</p>
            <p>About Eric Chu asking her to become chairperson, Lu Shiow-yen said she was thankful for his trust. However, she explained that the KMT is a democratic party, so the chairperson's position should not be chosen by one person. Instead, anyone who wants to run should compete fairly.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen said that Taiwan is facing big problems because of US tariffs. This economic crisis is hitting the central region the hardest. The industries most affected are machinery, precision machinery, machine tools, hand tools, and bicycles. Many of these businesses are in central Taiwan, especially around Taichung.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen explained that these industries and manufacturers have helped Taiwan's economy grow a lot over the past 50 years. If these businesses fail, Taiwan could have a big economic downturn, serious job losses, and even affect millions of families.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen stressed that this "tariff tsunami" has arrived, and Taiwan's economy is getting worse. She must stay in her job to help industries and citizens get through this. She once said, "The harder times are, the more Mom will stay home." This is her promise, and she will keep it. Because of this, she cannot run for KMT chairperson.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen believes that even if she doesn't run for party chairperson, she will always be there if the party needs her. She has participated in all KMT elections, big and small, and always tried her best. Therefore, she doesn't need to be the chairperson to stand with everyone.</p>
