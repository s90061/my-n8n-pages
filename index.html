            <h1>Data Center Demand Is High: Taiwan's Ethernet Switch Market Expected to Grow by 15%</h1>
            <p>International Data Corporation (IDC) said today that the demand for building data centers by public cloud companies and large local businesses in Taiwan has not slowed down. Because of this, they expect Taiwan's Ethernet switch market to grow by 10% to 15% this year compared to last year.</p>
            <p>Ye Zhen-nan, a senior market analyst at IDC, pointed out that the results of tariff talks between the US and other countries might make the global economy uncertain this year. However, public cloud services and generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications are clearly helping to increase sales of fast internet infrastructure in many countries, and Taiwan is also seeing this effect.</p>
            <p>IDC expects that this year, data centers in Taiwan will use faster 800G Ethernet switches for AI model training and other services. Also, Taiwan's semiconductor and high-tech manufacturing companies are continuing to expand globally. These investments in network equipment are expected to make Taiwan's network infrastructure market grow by 10% to 15% this year. From 2024 to 2029, the market is expected to grow by 5.8% each year.</p>
            <p>IDC looked at how major companies sold network products in Taiwan during the first quarter. Cisco, a leading brand in network equipment, remained number one in the Ethernet switch and enterprise router markets. HPE-Aruba was first in the market for commercial wireless network access. For home wireless routers, TP-Link is currently number one. F5 stayed in the top position for ADC application delivery controllers.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that because generative AI applications have become very popular in recent years, public cloud and data center companies bought more fast network switch equipment in the first quarter, especially 400G switches. Because of this trend, companies like Arista, Nvidia, and ODM-Direct, which focus on data center network switches, saw a big increase in their shipments in the first quarter. This was one of the main reasons why the Ethernet switch market grew by a double-digit percentage in the first quarter.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Bamboo Grass Causes Many Flight Cancellations to Shanghai</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 30, Central News Agency) According to China's Central Meteorological Administration, Typhoon "Bamboo Grass" landed on Zhujiajian Island in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, around 4:30 AM today. It is expected to make another landfall around Shanghai Pudong's southern area and Fengxian coast by evening. Today, many flights from Taipei to Shanghai Pudong have been canceled or delayed.</p>
            <p>According to reports from Chinese media, China's Central Meteorological Administration said that Typhoon "Bamboo Grass" landed on the coast of Zhujiajian Island in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, around 4:30 AM today. The Shanghai Meteorological Bureau said that after landing this morning, the typhoon continued to move northwest. It might land a second time on Daishan Island in Zhoushan, and then land again in the southern part of Pudong to Fengxian coast in the evening.</p>
            <p>Because of the typhoon, Shanghai is experiencing strong winds and heavy rain today. All highways in the city now have a speed limit of 60 kilometers per hour, and all city ferry services have stopped. Starting from 12:30 PM, some parts of Shanghai Metro Line 2 in Pudong are running at a slower speed, and all trains on Line 16 are also running slower. Also, flight information shows that many flights from Taipei to Shanghai Pudong today are canceled or delayed.</p>
            <p>On July 29, Shanghai's Pudong New Area entered a "state of readiness." They worked hard to check for possible dangers and planned to move about 110,000 people to safety. They also plan to open 116 places for people to stay, which can hold 14,982 people. In addition, related units in the Pudong area started lowering water levels and emptying pipes on July 28. The entire district has 2,337 flood prevention and rescue teams ready to act at any time to handle the disaster.</p>
            <p>Due to the typhoon, on July 29, heavy rain fell in Zhoushan, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, and Jinhua in Zhejiang; Nantong, Suzhou, and Wuxi in Jiangsu; and Qingpu in Shanghai. Some areas in Ningbo even had extremely heavy rain. After Typhoon "Bamboo Grass" landed in East China, the air currents guiding it were weak, which made it move slowly. As the typhoon continues to affect the area, places like Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui will have rain for a long time, and the rain will be very strong at times. It is important to be careful about the total amount of rain that falls.</p>
