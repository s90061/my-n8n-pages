            <h1>EU Leader Goes to Scotland to Talk Trade with Trump</h1>
            <p>A spokesperson for the European Union (EU) Commission said that the head of the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, went to Scotland today. She plans to meet with US President Donald Trump tomorrow afternoon. European officials said that Europe and the US are close to making a trade deal.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump arrived in Scotland last night. He told reporters that he was looking forward to meeting von der Leyen. He also called her a "respected" leader. Trump will stay in Scotland for a few days to play golf and have meetings with her.</p>
            <p>Trump repeated his idea that there is a 50% chance the US and the EU, which has 27 countries, will make a basic trade deal. He also said that Brussels "really wants" to make a deal.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that if the US and EU make a deal, it would be the biggest trade agreement he has signed since he became president. He said it would be even bigger than the $550 billion deal made with Japan earlier this week.</p>
            <p>The White House did not share details about this meeting. It also did not say what might be in the possible agreement.</p>
            <p>EU foreign affairs people said that a trade deal between Washington and Brussels might include a 15% tax on EU goods sent to the US. This would be similar to the deal made with Japan. It might also include a 50% tax on European steel and aluminum.</p>

            <h1>Aid Ship 'Handala' Is Close to Gaza, Israeli Military Says It Will Stop It</h1>
            <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition announced today that an aid ship they sent to the Gaza Strip is now close. It is expected to arrive tomorrow morning. This ship is going against Israel's blockade.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that this aid ship is named "Handala" after a famous Palestinian cartoon character. It is now only 194 kilometers from its goal. This is closer to Gaza than another ship from the group, "Madleen," was when it was stopped in June.</p>
            <p>The Israeli navy said it will stop the "Handala" from reaching Gaza.</p>
            <p>An Israeli military spokesperson told AFP today that the army "is doing its legal sea security blockade in the Gaza area. It is ready for all situations and will act based on political directions."</p>
            <p>The "Handala" ship has 19 activists and 2 reporters from different countries. It started its journey from Sicily on July 13. Its purpose is to break Israel's blockade of Gaza and give help to the people there.</p>
            <p>The crew of "Handala" posted on social media X that if the Israeli military stops the ship and holds the people on board, they will start a hunger strike.</p>
