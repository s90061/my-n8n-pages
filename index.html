            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Helps People Repair Homes by Connecting Them with Companies</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and southwest air currents have affected the southern part of Taiwan. Some people's homes were badly damaged. The Ministry of Transportation said today that there is a shortage of workers and materials right now. So, they have asked different departments to help connect people with companies. They hope to help residents find workers to fix their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation posted on Facebook today. They said that Vice Minister Chen Yan-bo held a meeting yesterday with different departments. They checked the progress of repairs in the Tainan disaster area and planned what to do next. So far, they have visited over 100 damaged homes. They are also looking for more workers and resources to help people rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that there are not enough workers or materials at the moment. People cannot find workers to repair their homes, and there are no people or machines available. The government has asked all ministries to help and has given them specific areas. The Ministry of Transportation is in charge of Xinying District, Yanshui District, Baihe District, and Houbi District in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people who want to repair their homes can register with their district chief first. Then, the Ministry of Transportation will help find companies for them. After that, residents will talk with the companies. Once they agree, they will sign a simple contract. The Ministry of Transportation's main job is to connect people with companies; they do not pay for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make the rebuilding after the disaster faster, the Ministry of Transportation also set some rules. Besides connecting people with companies, they will first fix old, one-story houses and homes with roofs blown off that people cannot live in. These will get help right away. Waste materials like asbestos tiles will be collected in one place. The district office will then help to remove them.</p>
