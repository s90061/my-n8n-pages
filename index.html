            <h1>Zelenskyy: Discussing Security Details with Allies</h1>
            <p>Ukraine and its Western allies have recently been talking about how to end the war with Russia. However, people in Ukraine are not very hopeful. Today, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that after meeting in Washington D.C., the situation has improved compared to one or two weeks ago. He is now closely discussing security details with many countries. They are talking about what specific help these countries can give, such as support on land, sea, and in the air, as well as information and money.</p>
            <p>Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, visited Kyiv today. He held a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after their talks. They explained issues about security and future cooperation.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said during the meeting that they are still discussing what real support allies can give. This includes military support on land, at sea, and in the air, working together on intelligence, financial help, and weapons. He noted that security is not just about international forces being present, but also about making Ukraine's own defense stronger.</p>
            <p>He stressed that to get security, first, countries need to show they want to help. Second, weapons need to be made and delivered quickly. It's also important that Ukraine gets the equipment it needs first. Finally, there needs to be a clear source of money and how it will be paid for. He also said that a "Coalition of the Willing" has formed, which includes Japan and Canada. There are now 30 member countries, but how much they will take part is still being discussed.</p>
            <p>Regarding Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's earlier statement that Russia should also be part of Ukraine's security plan, Zelenskyy said he found it hard to understand. He asked, "What guarantees does the attacker need?"</p>
            <p>Speaking about a possible meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelenskyy repeated that Ukraine has no conditions for talks. He is willing to have two-way or three-way meetings. But it seems Russia still does not want to end the war and is trying to avoid direct talks with Ukraine.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that Russia's current plan is to avoid sanctions from US President Donald Trump. Russia is also using diplomacy to reduce pressure from the US and its allies. Ukraine will rely on its allies to push for stronger sanctions.</p>
            <p>"If (Russia) does not agree to end the war through diplomacy, if they do not want to end the war, then we will rely on our allies' strong sanction plans. We believe we must do everything possible to make sure Russia no longer avoids meeting," he said.</p>
            <p>Rutte said that NATO is working closely with Europe, the US, and Ukraine in two main ways. First, they are strengthening Ukraine's defense after the war or a long ceasefire. Second, they are creating a specific security plan provided by Europe and the US.</p>
            <p>Rutte admitted that past agreements, like the "Minsk agreements" and the "Budapest Memorandum," did not stop Russia from attacking. So, this new security plan will be different. He also emphasized that at the summit in Washington D.C., it was confirmed that Ukraine's move to join NATO is "unstoppable."</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that NATO has already started many projects with Ukraine. These include joint training in Poland, opening an office in Kyiv, and adding Ukraine's needs to the "Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL)." Within one month, Ukraine received 1.5 billion US dollars (about 45.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in military aid.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Ukraine, Russia, the US, and the UK signed the "Budapest Memorandum." Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons and join the non-nuclear weapon treaty. In return, Russia had to respect Ukraine's independence and borders. However, this agreement and the "Minsk Agreement" signed in 2014 because of fighting in eastern Ukraine only led to repeatedly broken ceasefires. Neither agreement stopped Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Rise as Federal Reserve May Cut Interest Rates</h1>
            <p>New York, August 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices went up today. This happened because Jerome Powell, the head of the US Federal Reserve (Fed), hinted that they might lower interest rates in September. This news helped to cancel out worries about future oil supply.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for October delivery increased by 0.2%. It closed at $63.66 per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price of Brent crude oil for October delivery increased by 0.1%. It closed at $67.73 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Official: National Guard in Washington D.C. to Carry Military Weapons Soon</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 22 (Reuters) - US President Trump recently ordered the National Guard to go to Washington D.C. to help fight crime. Today, a defense official said that the National Guard members in the capital will soon carry military weapons.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, before sending troops to Washington's streets last week, Trump called the area a "crime-filled rat's nest." He also said that Chicago and New York would face similar actions in the future. Both Chicago and New York are currently led by Democratic mayors.</p>
            <p>The defense official, who did not want to be named, said: "Following the Secretary of Defense's directions, members of the Joint Task Force-District of Columbia (JTF-DC) will soon carry their service weapons while on duty." This official explained that the task force's job is to reduce crime in Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>The US Army had previously stated when the troops arrived that "weapons can be given if needed, but these weapons will be kept in the armory."</p>
            <p>Currently, there are over 1900 National Guard members in Washington D.C. They are from the local area and also from Republican-led states like West Virginia, South Carolina, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee.</p>
            <p>Trump said today that Chicago and New York will have similar plans. He told reporters at the White House, "We will make our cities very, very safe." He added, "Chicago will be our next target, and then we will help New York."</p>
