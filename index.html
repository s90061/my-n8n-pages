            <h1>US Minister Confirms Talks to Buy Intel Shares, Says Chip Production Cannot Rely on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, said today that the US is talking about buying 10% of Intel's shares. This comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to give 15% of their chip sales to China back to the government. He also repeated what he said before joining the government: the US needs to make its own chips. He said, "We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Lutnick spoke to CNBC, a financial news channel. He said the US government might become Intel's biggest shareholder. But he also said that the government will not control Intel. "This is not about control," he explained. "We are just changing money given by the Biden government into shares. And the US government will not have the right to vote."</p>
            <p>Lutnick again criticized the Chips Act, which was signed by former President Biden. He said the law gives money to companies that make semiconductors. But American taxpayers do not get anything in return.</p>
            <p>He asked, "Why should we give so much money to a company worth 100 billion US dollars? How does this help American taxpayers?" He added, "Trump's answer is that we should get shares in return for this money."</p>
            <p>Intel has received the most money from the Chips Act. It got 7.9 billion US dollars to make semiconductors for businesses. It also got 3 billion US dollars from a Pentagon project called "Secure Enclave." On top of this, Intel can also ask for 11 billion US dollars in loans.</p>
            <p>Lutnick said, "Imagine this: The Biden government gave money to Intel for free, and also to TSMC for free. All these companies are getting money for nothing."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg news had reported earlier, quoting White House officials, that the Trump government was talking about buying about 10% of Intel's shares. At the same time, Japan's SoftBank Group also said it would invest 2 billion US dollars in Intel. This would make SoftBank one of Intel's top ten shareholders.</p>
            <p>If the White House decides to buy shares, it will greatly help Intel's money situation. Intel has been cutting jobs and spending less money recently. So, people are watching these talks closely.</p>
            <p>Today, Intel's stock price in New York went up by 11% at one point. SoftBank's stock, which trades in Tokyo, went down by 4% when the market closed today.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg said that the US government talking about buying Intel shares shows a big change in America's policy for making semiconductors. If this deal happens, it could make it easier for the US government to make similar deals with other chip makers.</p>
            <p>Lutnick also said today that for national safety reasons, the US wants to bring some chip making back to America. He said, "We need to make our own chips. We cannot rely on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>At the same time, Lutnick did not say no to Nvidia selling its new AI chips, which are still being developed, to China. Reuters reported that this AI chip will use the newest Blackwell technology. It will be more powerful than the H20 chip that is currently allowed to be sold to China.</p>
            <p>When talking about Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, Lutnick said that of course, he wants to sell a new chip to China. Lutnick said, "I have heard him talk to the President. And the President will listen to the ideas from these good technology companies. Finally, the President will decide what to do."</p>

            <p>In New York, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September went down by 1.7%. It closed at 62.35 US dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Cargo Ship Explosion Closes Baltimore Port Channel; Investigators Seeking Cause</h1>
            <p>Last night, a cargo ship full of coal left the port of Baltimore, Maryland. It was going to East Africa. Suddenly, it exploded. Now, people are looking into why it happened. The main shipping channel in Baltimore Port was closed this morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Associated Press, officials said that no one was hurt in the explosion last night. The explosion sent out a distress signal. The ship was reportedly close to where the Francis Scott Key Bridge fell down last year.</p>
            <p>Videos show flames from the explosion shooting high into the sky. Then, a lot of dark smoke covered the Patapsco River.</p>
            <p>The main shipping channel in the Port of Baltimore was closed this morning.</p>
            <p>Port officials said in a press release: "The U.S. Coast Guard is leading this response. They will decide when the channel can open safely again and when ships can enter and leave the port."</p>
            <p>Ship tracking websites show that the W-Sapphire is a 229-meter long trading ship. It was supposed to leave Baltimore and go to East Africa. It was expected to arrive at the Port of Mauritius in about one month. The ship was built in 2012 and sails under the flag of Liberia. Officials said the ship was carrying coal.</p>
            <p>According to people from the US Coast Guard, there were 23 crew members and 2 pilots on the ship when the explosion happened.</p>
            <p>John Marsh, a spokesman for the Baltimore Fire Department, said that his team went to deal with a fire under the ship's deck.</p>
            <p>The Maryland Department of Emergency Management said that no other property was damaged, except for the ship itself.</p>
