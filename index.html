            <h1>Man Accused of Sexual Harassment on Bus, Claims He Was Waving Goodbye</h1>
            <p>A man named Huang from New Taipei City was riding a bus. He touched a male student's head and then his bottom. Mr. Huang said he was just putting out his hand to say goodbye. But the prosecutor from New Taipei did not believe him. So, they charged him with breaking the law against sexual harassment.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor's official paper says that one evening in May this year, Mr. Huang was on a crowded bus. A male student and his mother were sitting separately. First, Mr. Huang touched the student's head. Then, when the student turned to change seats, Mr. Huang touched his bottom.</p>
            <p>The male student cried and told his mother what happened. The mother then told the bus driver, who called the police. During the police investigation, Mr. Huang said he did touch the student's shoulder. But he said he did it to stop the student from falling. He also said that the video showed his hand out because he wanted to say goodbye to the student.</p>
            <p>However, when Mr. Huang showed how he would wave goodbye during questioning, it did not look like what the camera recorded. Because of this, the prosecutor did not believe Mr. Huang's story. The prosecutor charged Mr. Huang with sexual harassment, for touching a private body part when the person could not fight back. The punishment for this crime will be increased because it involves a child or teenager, according to the Child and Youth Welfare and Rights Protection Act.</p>

            <h1>Poland Limits Flights Near Eastern Border to Stop Russian Drones</h1>
            <p>Poland has put limits on flights in the sky near its eastern border. This border is with Belarus and Ukraine. This news comes from the Polish Armed Forces Operations Command today. Just one day before, a suspected Russian drone flew into Polish airspace.</p>
            <p>Last night, the Polish Air Navigation Services Agency said that a special restricted area, EP R129, was created in eastern Poland. This was done because the Armed Forces Operations Command asked for it. It started at 10:00 PM GMT on the 10th and will last until December 9th. This is to keep the country safe.</p>
            <p>The Polish Air Navigation Services Agency also said that civilian planes will not be allowed to fly in the sky near the borders with Belarus and Ukraine. There will only be a few special cases where flights are allowed.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Poland shot down a suspected Russian drone in its airspace. Planes from NATO countries helped Poland do this. This is the first time a NATO country has shot at something in the air since the war between Russia and Ukraine started.</p>
            <p>The Russian Ministry of Defense said yesterday that its drones attacked military targets in western Ukraine. They said they did not plan to attack any targets in Poland.</p>

            <h1>Yageo Plans to Buy 28.5% of Oriental Semiconductor for NT$4.889 Billion</h1>
            <p>Yageo, a large company that makes electronic parts, announced today that it will buy 28.5% of Oriental Semiconductor's shares. This will start on the 12th. They will pay 229.8 New Taiwan Dollars for each share. The total amount of money needed for this is 4.889 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>According to yearly reports, the top 10 shareholders of Oriental Semiconductor each own less than 5% of the company. If Yageo buys at least 5% of the shares, which is the minimum amount for this deal to happen, Yageo could become the biggest single shareholder of Oriental Semiconductor.</p>
            <p>Yageo said that Oriental Semiconductor has been doing well for a long time and gives its shareholders good profits. So, Yageo wants to buy shares in Oriental Semiconductor to make a financial investment. Yageo expects to get steady profits from this investment over a long time. They also hope this will help them start talking with Oriental Semiconductor's management. This could lead to both companies working together and help Yageo become even more competitive in the long run.</p>
            <p>Yageo held an important meeting about this news in the evening. Zhang Tian-cheng, a senior manager in Yageo's global finance department, explained that the company's board of directors agreed today to buy 28.5% of Oriental Semiconductor's shares at NT$229.8 each. If we compare this to Oriental Semiconductor's closing price today, which was NT$191.5, the price Yageo is offering is about 20% higher.</p>
            <p>Zhang Tian-cheng stated that Yageo will report this plan to the Financial Supervisory Commission and announce it. The period for buying shares will be from September 12th to October 1st. Yageo plans to buy a maximum of 21,277,245 shares, which is 28.5% of all Oriental Semiconductor's shares. The minimum number of shares they need to buy is 3,733,000, which is about 5% of all shares. This deal will only happen if they buy at least the minimum number of shares.</p>
            <p>Yageo explained that Oriental Semiconductor is a company that designs power integrated circuits (ICs). They design, test, produce, and sell mixed-signal power chips and sensors. Their main products are ICs that control fan motors and manage power. These are used in things like laptops, DDR memory, TVs and monitors, small electronic devices, graphics cards, and car electronics. Recently, they have also started working on products for industrial uses.</p>
