            <h1>Brazil Plans to React to 50% US Tariffs; Businesses Worry and Ask for Talks</h1>
            <p>On August 29, the Brazilian Embassy in the US officially told the US Trade Representative (USTR) that Brazil would start a process to react to the high 50% tariffs that US President Donald Trump placed on Brazilian goods. This news has made businesses very worried.</p>
            <p>According to reports from CNN Brazil and other news outlets, on August 28, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry told the Foreign Trade Chamber (Camex) to begin an investigation. This investigation will check if Brazil should act against the US based on the "Economic Reciprocity Law" passed this year.</p>
            <p>Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva approved starting this reaction process. Camex will give a report within 30 days to decide if the US actions meet the conditions for a reaction. If it is confirmed that action can be taken, a special team will be formed to create a plan that includes goods, services, and intellectual property.</p>
            <p>Lula said that if the US is willing to talk, "the Lula of peace and love" will return. Vice President Geraldo Alckmin also said that Brazil stands firm on its own rights but is also willing to talk and negotiate.</p>
            <p>However, Brazilian businesses are generally not happy about the government's plan. Eduardo Lobo, the head of the Brazilian Fishing Industry Association (Abipesca), pointed out that businesses are losing customers every day. He is worried that the reaction process will make disagreements worse and hurt exports.</p>
            <p>A representative from the coffee industry called the move a "disaster." He said it is a big worry for all industries and could make the US increase tariffs on Brazilian products even more.</p>
            <p>The Brazilian textile industry has asked the government to be careful. They said it is still early and not clear if Brazil will really act back. Industry leaders want to talk first, believing that an "eye for an eye" policy might not be helpful.</p>
            <p>A group of Brazilian business representatives will soon visit Washington for trade talks. The National Confederation of Industry (CNI) in Brazil also supports solving problems through talking. They said that industries will keep pushing for smart discussions and believe now is not the right time to use the "Economic Reciprocity Law."</p>

            <h1>US Appeals Court Says Trump's Global Tariffs Are Illegal, But They Can Continue For Now</h1>
            <p>On August 29, a US federal appeals court decided that most of the tariffs put in place by President Donald Trump on many trading partners were illegal. The court said that he went beyond his power when he set these tariffs.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, this decision is a problem for Trump, who has often used tariffs as a major tool in his economic plans.</p>
            <p>However, the judges decided that these tariffs can stay for now. They also sent the case back to a lower court to be looked at again.</p>

            <h1>Alcaraz Moves to Fourth Round at US Open; Rybakina Beats Raducanu</h1>
            <p>On August 29 in New York, Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz moved into the fourth round of the US Open. Kazakh player Elena Rybakina also won against British player Emma Raducanu and moved forward. Serbian star Novak Djokovic and last year's women's singles winner Aryna Sabalenka are fighting to keep their hopes of winning alive.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Alcaraz, who is the second seed, won easily against Luciano Darderi from Italy, the 32nd seed. He won in three straight sets: 6-2, 6-4, 6-0.</p>
            <p>Alcaraz, who won the US Open in 2022, finished the match in only 1 hour and 44 minutes. On August 31, he will play against French player Arthur Rinderknech. Rinderknech won against his countryman Benjamin Bonzi with scores of 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2.</p>
            <p>Alcaraz won the French Open in June but lost at Wimbledon last month. He is now trying to do well at the US Open.</p>
            <p>Later today, 38-year-old Djokovic will play against British player Cameron Norrie in a night match. Djokovic hopes to move to the next round to play Alcaraz in the semifinals.</p>
            <p>Djokovic, who is the seventh seed, is trying to win his 25th Grand Slam singles title, which would be a new record. He has won the US Open four times before.</p>
            <p>In the women's singles, world number one Aryna Sabalenka will play against Leylah Fernandez, the 31st seed, in a night match.</p>
            <p>Sabalenka from Belarus is trying to be the first woman to win the US Open singles title two times in a row since American star Serena Williams won three times from 2012 to 2014.</p>
            <p>Fernandez from Canada reached the US Open final in 2021 but then lost to British player Emma Raducanu. Raducanu is the only player ever to win a Grand Slam singles title after starting in the qualifying rounds.</p>
            <p>However, Raducanu's hopes for another surprising run in New York this year ended today. She lost to Elena Rybakina, the ninth seed, with scores of 1-6, 2-6.</p>
            <p>Raducanu talked about Rybakina, who won Wimbledon in 2022, and said, "I think Rybakina played very well. It was hard for me to find any rhythm in the match."</p>
