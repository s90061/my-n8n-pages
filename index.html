            <h1>Taipei Zoo's Brown Bear Qiao Passes Away Peacefully Due to Cancer</h1>
            <p>Taipei Zoo announced today that its brown bear, "Qiao," who was at least 24 years old, sadly passed away today, August 19th. In 2023, during a health check, Qiao was found to have a tumor in her mammary gland. Recently, she started showing various health problems, and today it was confirmed that the cancer had returned. After careful thought about her well-being, the zoo decided to help her pass away peacefully.</p>
            <p>The zoo shared in a press release that the female brown bear, "Qiao," passed away today. The zoo said that recently, keepers noticed Qiao was breathing fast, being lazy, seemed tired, and ate less. In March, the area where her mammary gland tumor was removed became red and lost fur again.</p>
            <p>The zoo explained that today, medical staff used imaging tests and saw that the cancer in her lungs had grown larger and was worse than in March. A sample from the red and swollen area on her lower left belly showed that it was likely a new cancerous growth, meaning the tumor had returned.</p>
            <p>The zoo stated that if treatment continued, Qiao would have to go through another big surgery to remove the mammary gland tumor, and the lung problems would keep getting worse. This would mean she would not have a good quality of life. After thinking about the discomfort and pain Qiao was going through, and after a serious discussion by the animal welfare team, they decided to help Qiao pass away peacefully.</p>
            <p>The zoo believes that Qiao was at least 24 years old. She was taken in by the Taipei Zoo in 2006 after a circus left her. She was always very lively, showing behaviors like swimming, digging, and exploring her environment in her enclosure, and many people liked her.</p>
            <p>Regarding Qiao's health history, the zoo recorded that in 2023, during a health check, she was found to have a mammary gland tumor. At that time, the medical team performed the first surgery to remove it. She recovered well after the surgery and was checked regularly. Then, in 2024, checks showed that Qiao had cancer that had spread to her lungs. In March 2025, a new tumor appeared near her groin, so she had a second major surgery to remove the mammary gland tumor. Even though the broken tumor was successfully removed, the cancer could not be completely removed, and the lung problems got worse. This meant Qiao's health was not good.</p>

            <h1>Philippines Hopes for Deeper Ties with Taiwan While Facing Threats from China</h1>
            <p>In 1975, the Philippines and China signed an agreement to start formal relations, promising to follow the "One China" policy. For many years, the Philippines kept its interactions with Taiwan quiet to avoid making China upset. However, this situation has recently started to change in small but important ways.</p>
            <p>In April this year, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued a special note. This note made it easier for officials from the Philippines and Taiwan to meet, after 30 years of strict rules. Now, government officials, except for the President, Vice President, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister, can visit Taiwan for economic, trade, and investment reasons.</p>
            <p>On June 19th, the Philippine representative office in Taiwan, the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, announced a new rule. Starting July 1st, people with Taiwanese passports who want to visit the Philippines for tourism can stay for 14 days without needing a visa.</p>
            <p>In early July, Roy Vincent Trinidad, a spokesperson for the Philippine Navy, and Jay Tarriela, a spokesperson for the Coast Guard, went to Taiwan for the Taiwan Ocean International Forum. They also took a photo with President Lai Ching-te, along with other participants from different countries.</p>
            <p>Angelito Banayo, a former Philippine representative in Taiwan, told the Central News Agency that both Philippine officials and regular people are very friendly towards Taiwan. He added that the Philippines wants to keep this friendship with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said, "Our friendly relationship with Taiwan has been long-standing. The problem is that we follow the One China policy. For the Philippine government, current rules do not allow the President, Vice President, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister to visit Taiwan, to consider China's feelings."</p>
            <p>Mr. Banayo pointed out that when he was the representative in Taiwan, several Philippine ministers visited Taiwan. He said that President Marcos's decision to make the rules for exchanges less strict actually just puts the current situation into official writing. However, these exchanges are still only for business, tourism, and cultural reasons.</p>
            <p>He believes that the current mood in the Philippine President's office is to make the relationship between the Philippines and Taiwan stronger. From a political view, this might be because the relationship between the Philippines and China is getting colder. Also, Taiwan is the Philippines' 10th largest trade partner, and in today's economy, the Philippines needs more investments, tourists, and cultural exchanges from Taiwan.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Banayo mentioned that because of the One China policy, "This is indeed a difficult balancing act... Even though the relationship between the Philippines and China is bad, making the tension between the two countries worse might also be bad for the Philippines." This could be why some officials choose to keep a low profile even as official interactions between Taiwan and the Philippines increase.</p>
            <p>Reporters have often asked Philippine officials about Taiwan. These officials usually answer by talking about trade and helping people. Some officials in sensitive positions, like those in the military or coast guard, sometimes refuse to be interviewed.</p>
            <p>According to media reports, after Trinidad and Tarriela visited Taiwan in July, the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter criticizing them for "harming efforts to stabilize the relationship between the Philippines and China." Tarriela, however, clarified that he attended the forum as a private individual.</p>
            <p>On August 11th, a Chinese Coast Guard ship (number 3104) crashed into China's own guided-missile destroyer (Guilin) when chasing a Philippine Coast Guard patrol boat near the Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. The front of the Chinese Coast Guard ship was completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>Some experts said this was the first time China used a warship to make a Philippine government boat leave the Scarborough Shoal area. Luckily, the Chinese warship hit its own Coast Guard ship; otherwise, it would have been a more serious international incident. Before this, the situation between the Philippines and China in the disputed South China Sea had been relatively calm for some time.</p>
            <p>Although it is not clear why China is increasing its forceful actions, President Marcos said in India on August 6th that if a conflict broke out between China and Taiwan, the Philippines "cannot stay out of it."</p>
            <p>As expected, Beijing protested President Marcos's statement. In response, the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs said again that it follows the "One China policy" and does not interfere in China's "internal affairs." However, it also said that it always supports talks, regional stability, and solving problems peacefully.</p>
            <p>Last November, the Philippines was hit by several typhoons. Taiwan sent nearly 5 tons of relief supplies to the Philippines using an air force C-130 transport plane. Soon after, there were also reports that China used helicopters to bother Philippine fishing boats near the Iroquois Reef and that its Coast Guard ships hit Philippine government boats and sprayed strong water at them near the Scarborough Shoal.</p>
            <p>It is not known if Beijing intends to warn the Philippine government with these strong actions. But experts agree that the South China Sea and trade are two areas where China can put pressure on the Philippines.</p>
            <p>China has long been one of the main markets for Philippine exports, including farm products. In the first seven months of last year, China imported 49% fewer bananas from the Philippines, and Vietnam took over its market share. Philippine durian exports to China also did not do well. With former US President Trump charging a 19% tax on goods from the Philippines, the Philippines does not want this situation to continue.</p>
            <p>As relations between the Philippines and China continue to get worse, the Philippines and Taiwan are both seen by the United States as partners with similar ideas. Official interactions between the Philippines and Taiwan may happen more often and at higher levels, but many might still happen in secret to avoid upsetting China.</p>
            <p>As Mr. Banayo said, under the One China policy, the Philippines needs to find a balance between Taiwan and China. However, some people in the Philippines are now talking about looking again at the One China policy.</p>
            <p>Rappler, a Philippine news outlet, recently quoted Rommel Jude Ong, a former deputy commander of the Philippine Navy. He said that because the security situation in the region is changing, the Philippine foreign affairs department might need to understand the new situation and decide if the One China policy is helping or hurting the Philippines' national interests.</p>
