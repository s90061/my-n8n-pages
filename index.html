A newspaper called "South China Morning Post" reported that China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, told an EU official that China does not want Russia to lose the war in Ukraine. He is worried that if Russia loses, the United States will then focus all its attention on China.

This statement is different from what China usually says, which is that they are not involved in the war. Some EU officials were surprised that Wang Yi spoke so directly.

However, Wang Yi said that China has not given a lot of money or weapons to Russia for the war. He said if China had done so, the war would have ended already. The newspaper also said that Wang Yi gave the EU official, Kaja Kallas, "history lessons," focusing on China's idea that the US will soon pay full attention to Asia.

News reports have shown that China might be helping Russia, for example, by giving them laser weapon systems. This shows that China has an interest in how the war ends.

Even though their meeting was friendly, the EU and China had planned a two-day meeting in July, but China asked for it to be cut short to just one day. A Chinese spokesperson later said that China is not directly involved in the Ukraine war and wants to see peace talks happen soon. She also said that a long war is not good for anyone.

**Dutch and German Spies Say Russia is Using Banned Chemical Weapons in Ukraine**

Spy agencies from the Netherlands and Germany said today that they have proof Russia is widely using chemical weapons that are not allowed in Ukraine. They said Russia uses drones to drop a gas called chloropicrin. This gas makes soldiers choke and leaves their hiding places, so Russian soldiers can shoot them.

The head of the Dutch military intelligence said they found this out from their own separate investigations. The German spy agency also confirmed these findings.

Last May, the US first said that Russia was using chloropicrin in the war. This chemical is more harmful than tear gas. It can cause burning in the mouth and stomach, and make it hard to breathe. Ukraine says Russia has used chemical weapons thousands of times, perhaps around 9,000 times. The Dutch defense minister said at least three Ukrainian soldiers have died because of chemical weapons, and over 2,500 soldiers have become sick from them.

He also said that Russian soldiers use these chemicals "almost every day." They often put chloropicrin in light bulbs or empty bottles and drop them from drones. The minister said this is very worrying because Russia is using these weapons more and more often.

He asked for strong punishments against Russia. He also suggested that Russia should not be allowed to be part of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which is a group that stops the use of such weapons.
