            <h1>Argentina's President Announces 2026 Budget, Tone Becomes More Calm Before Elections</h1>
            <p>Argentina's President Milei gave a national speech on September 15, announcing the 2026 national budget. Milei spoke in a less excited way than usual. He did not use his famous phrase "Long live freedom." He also said that education, health, and pensions will be the most important spending areas. Argentine media said that he did this to make people feel better, to create agreement in society, and to get support for the mid-term elections in October 2025.</p>
            <p>Since he became president in December 2023, Milei has made big cuts to government spending, fired government workers, stopped energy subsidies, and made market rules more open. These changes caused many protests. In early September, his party, "La Libertad Avanza," lost badly in the local elections in Buenos Aires Province. They only got about 34% of the votes, much less than the center-left Fuerza Patria alliance. Buenos Aires Province makes more than 30% of the country's money and has about 40% of the voters. So, the election results there are a good sign of what will happen in Argentine politics.</p>
            <p>In his speech on September 15, Milei's tone was clearly calmer. He spoke simply to tell people that "the worst times are over." He also said that the government will continue to make changes to balance the budget. Next year, the main focus will be on human capital development. He announced that about 85% of the 2026 budget will go to education, healthcare, and pensions. This includes a 17% increase in healthcare spending, an 8% increase in education spending, and a 5% increase in pensions.</p>
            <p>Major Argentine newspapers had different opinions about Milei's speech. La NaciÃ³n newspaper said it was "a different Milei." They said it was the first time he had given a speech in a calm way since becoming president, showing that he knows reforms need social agreement. ClarÃ­n newspaper said that Milei "is no longer like an emperor." They pointed out that the September election results made the president realize that people are starting to care about the details of policies and how his political team is doing, not just seeing him as a hero who will save Argentina.</p>
            <p>The Argentine mid-term elections will happen on October 26, 2025. People will choose 127 members for the House of Representatives and 24 members for the Senate. This will be the first election for the parliament since Milei became president in 2023. It is seen as an important test to see if his government's changes can go smoothly. It will also decide the direction of policies for the next two years.</p>

            <h1>US Says Taiwan's Status Is Not Decided; Expert Says China Forced Them to Speak</h1>
            <p>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said that China twists documents from World War II to try and force Taiwan. These documents do not decide Taiwan's final political status. A US expert, Yu Maochun, said today that the US position has not changed. The US has never believed that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. They just did not say it clearly before. Now, China is making the US state this simple fact.</p>
            <p>The Hudson Institute, a think tank in Washington, held a meeting today called "Hybrid Warfare and CCP Infiltration: A Shared Challenge for US-Taiwan Security Cooperation." Yu Maochun, the director of the China Center at the Hudson Institute, led the meeting. Sam Sang, the chairman of the Taiwan Hong Kong Association, and Hsu Kai-chieh, a judge from the Taipei District Court, also spoke.</p>
            <p>Yu Maochun was seen as an important advisor for Trump's China policy when Trump was president the first time. When asked about China's legal attacks on Taiwan, he said that the US's main rule on China and Taiwan is to stop any actions that try to change the current situation by force. This policy has always been the same.</p>
            <p>He stressed that the "current situation" means "Taiwan's independent government." But the problem is whether people have the courage to accept this truth. This is why some people in Washington say that the truth should be accepted. This is not about making a new country that never existed. It is simply "to make the world accept that Taiwan is an independent country," which is very different from mainland China.</p>
            <p>He believes, "This is an issue we should face."</p>
            <p>Hsu Kai-chieh, who knows a lot about national security, said that Taiwan and its friends should speak out more. For example, they could make a statement: if China invades Taiwan, Taiwan's friends will say that the "One China policy" is no longer valid. This could stop China from using force against Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Sang also said that when China spreads wrong information, Taiwan must correct their wrong statements right away.</p>
            <p>He also said that the relationships between the US, Japan, Europe, and even Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan are very important. These relationships will help "Taiwanese people really build their own identity and strengths, and show Taiwan to the world."</p>
            <p>China has intentionally twisted old documents from World War II, like the "Cairo Declaration," "Potsdam Proclamation," and "San Francisco Peace Treaty." They do this to say they have the right to control Taiwan. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) recently replied to this, saying that China purposely twists these wartime documents to support its actions to force Taiwan.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the US State Department also told CNA reporters (without giving their name) that Beijing's statements are wrong, just as AIT said. "These documents did not decide Taiwan's final political status." The US will continue to help Taiwan and work with international partners to strongly support peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. This is because China is putting pressure on Taiwan in military, economic, information, legal, and diplomatic ways.</p>
            <p>Yu Maochun said in an interview that the US has never believed that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. This has always been the US policy. All US governments, both Democratic and Republican, have believed that United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, passed in 1971, did not solve the issue of Taiwan's status. It only solved the issue of China's representation.</p>
            <p>He said that the US's position has not changed. They just did not say it clearly before. Now, "China has forced the US to state a very simple fact" because the Chinese government's statement is very silly.</p>
            <p>Also, when asked by a reporter about the possibility of US President Donald Trump visiting Beijing this year, Yu Maochun said that if Trump wants to make a deal with China, and visiting Beijing is part of that deal, "of course he can." But if Chinese President Xi Jinping does not want to work together, then visiting Beijing would not help. "This is a way to make a deal."</p>

            <h1>ChatGPT Introduces Protection for Teenagers; System Will Guess User Age</h1>
            <p>People are thinking a lot about the rules for Artificial Intelligence (AI). Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said today that ChatGPT is building a system that can guess how old a user is. This will help them give extra protection to teenagers.</p>
            <p>Recently in California, USA, a 16-year-old teenager took their own life. The parents said that the AI chat helper ChatGPT was involved. This made many people pay attention. OpenAI launched ChatGPT at the end of 2022. It is estimated that 700 million people use it every week as of August this year.</p>
            <p>Today, Altman wrote an article on the OpenAI website. He talked about three main topics that society cares about: privacy, freedom, and teenagers. He started the article by saying that OpenAI is making better security features to keep users' information private.</p>
            <p>He said that as people talk more and more personally with AI, this technology has their most private personal information. It is like talking to a doctor about medical records or telling a lawyer about legal problems. This information needs to be kept much safer.</p>
            <p>Then he talked about how much freedom users have. He said that while keeping information safe is important, they want users to be free to use the service in their own way. They want to make sure users have the most freedom. They should "treat adults as adults" as long as they do not hurt others or bother them.</p>
            <p>For example, usually, ChatGPT will not have flirty conversations by default. But if an adult user asks for it, they should get the response they want. Another example is that the system will not tell you how to take your own life. But if an adult user wants to write a story about suicide, ChatGPT should be able to help.</p>
            <p>In this article, the part about protecting teenagers was written in bold. Altman said, "For teenagers, we put safety before privacy and freedom. This is a new and powerful technology, and we believe that young people need extra protection."</p>
            <p>Altman said that the company is building a system to guess a user's age based on how they use the service. If they are not sure, they will be careful and assume the user is under 18. He said that in some cases or certain countries, ChatGPT will also ask users to show proof of their age.</p>
            <p>He said that for teenagers, ChatGPT will not respond to flirty requests and will not talk about suicide. If the system finds a young person who might want to harm themselves, it will try to contact their parents or other important organizations.</p>
