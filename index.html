Many young people, known as Generation Z, are choosing to use older "flip phones" instead of modern smartphones. This trend is growing because they feel overwhelmed by constantly checking social media and messages. They want to spend less time looking at screens.

These flip phones are simpler and only allow basic calls and texts. By using them, young people hope to improve their mental health and focus more on real-life activities and relationships. They believe this "digital detox" helps them feel less stressed and more present in their daily lives. The move shows a desire to find balance in a world full of digital distractions.

**AI's Growing Role in the Workplace**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work. Recent reports show that AI is already taking over some tasks and even entire jobs in different industries. This technology can do repetitive tasks faster and more efficiently than humans.

For example, AI is being used in customer service, data analysis, and even some creative fields. While some jobs might disappear, experts also believe that AI will create new types of jobs and change existing ones. Companies are now thinking about how to train their employees for these new roles. The shift means workers might need to learn new skills to work alongside AI, making the future of work a mix of human and machine efforts.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day Visitors**
The famous Italian city of Venice has started a new trial program where day visitors must pay a fee to enter. This rule began recently and is meant to help manage the large number of tourists visiting the city, especially during busy times.

Tourists who come for just one day, without staying overnight, now need to pay a small charge. The goal is to reduce overcrowding and protect the city's unique environment and historical sites. Venice is one of many popular travel destinations facing challenges from too many visitors. This new fee is an effort to find a better balance between tourism and the quality of life for local residents.
