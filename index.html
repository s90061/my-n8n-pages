Taiwanâ€™s Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, Jiang Chi-chen, announced on Facebook today that his father, Jiang Hai-quan, passed away peacefully last night due to old age. Although very sad, he believes his father is now free from suffering. He said his father lived a simple and quiet life, and following his wishes, the funeral will be kept simple.

Mr. Jiang mentioned that his father lived a humble life, not seeking fame but peace of mind. He taught by example, showing how to be honest and work hard. He was tough on the outside but kind on the inside, always showing care and responsibility. His father often said, "Don't trouble others."

Jiang Chi-chen said they will follow his father's wishes. The funeral will be simple, and they politely refuse any funeral money or flower baskets, asking people to send blessings instead. Only a family ceremony will be held, so the family can say goodbye to their father in a warm and simple way.

Local officials from different parties have sent their condolences, asking Jiang Chi-chen to take care. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said, "We are your strongest support." Liao Wei-hsiang, a KMT lawmaker, said, "The old bodhisattva lived a complete life and has gone to practice with the Buddha." Ho Hsin-chun, a DPP lawmaker, also sent her condolences.

**Fritz Reaches Wimbledon Semifinals for the First Time, Will Play Alcaraz for a Spot in the Final**

American tennis player Taylor Fritz overcame some problems in the third set today to beat Russia's Karen Khachanov 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7/4). This is his first time reaching the semifinals of the Wimbledon men's singles. His next match will be against Spain's strong player Carlos Alcaraz.

Fritz, the fifth seed, and Khachanov, the 17th seed, were both trying to reach the Wimbledon semifinals for the first time in their careers.

Fritz won the first two sets easily. Khachanov then won 8 of the next 9 games, taking the third set and pushing the match to a fourth set. However, Fritz quickly recovered and broke Khachanov's serve, taking back control. He then won the tie-break to win the match.

Fritz said, "I've never been in a match that changed so much like this. I felt like I was in control and playing very well, serving great. I didn't feel like my serve was in danger, and I put a lot of pressure on his serve."

Fritz added, "I felt like I wouldn't make mistakes, but then somehow I started making a lot of errors. So I really had to fight hard to break back in the fourth set, which sort of brought the match back."

Fritz was a finalist at the US Open last year. He will now play Carlos Alcaraz for a spot in the final.

Alcaraz easily beat local player Cameron Norrie 6-2, 6-3, 6-3 today, reaching the Wimbledon men's singles semifinals for the third year in a row. He continues to try for his third straight championship.

Alcaraz, the second seed, had lost four sets in earlier tough matches at Wimbledon this year. However, in the quarterfinals, he showed his top form, beating Norrie in just 99 minutes.

Alcaraz said, "It means a lot to be in the Wimbledon semifinals again."

He also said, "Everything will be great. I am very happy with how I played against a very tough opponent."

**Is Han Kuang Exercise Halted During Natural Disasters? National Security Official: Commander-in-Chief and NSC Will Decide**

The Han Kuang No. 41 Exercise started today. This year, it will include urban resilience drills for the first time. If there is a typhoon or earthquake during the exercise, a national security official said that whether the exercise stops depends on how serious the disaster is. The Commander-in-Chief and the National Security Council (NSC) will decide based on the overall situation and how many soldiers are needed to help with disaster relief.

Last year, during the Han Kuang No. 40 Exercise, Typhoon Kaimi caused damage in central and southern Taiwan. The Ministry of National Defense announced that the exercise would end early, and soldiers would help with disaster relief. This year, before the Han Kuang No. 41 Exercise, Typhoon Damrey hit. Also, this year's exercise lasts for 10 days and 9 nights and includes urban resilience drills. If another typhoon or earthquake happens during this exercise, will they still choose to help with disaster relief, or will they use it to test the whole society's defense ability?

A military official said that if a complex disaster, like an earthquake as big as 921, happens in the south during the exercise, what would society think if the military didn't help? So, July is named "National Unity Month," combining the military's Han Kuang Exercise with civilian urban resilience drills. The goal is for the military to defend the country, and local governments to also have basic skills to handle disasters and help themselves.

The military official said the military's main goal is to prepare for the full exercise. For example, when Typhoon Damrey caused damage a few days ago, the military helped with air and ground transport to outer islands. If areas in the south are badly hit and affect society greatly, soldiers must help with disaster relief. But how to fully test the goals of the Han Kuang live-fire exercise is the current main direction for the Ministry of National Defense.

The military official said that the government promotes "whole society defense resilience" so that society has the power to respond, not always relying on the military for disasters. For example, if an earthquake happens, people should know where shelters are and learn basic self-help or mutual aid skills.

The military official noted that, generally, both natural disasters and enemy attacks are harmful to the country. The military's role is to protect the country. When natural disasters are very serious, the military must help with relief. This is clear. And the military's main job is combat training, which is also undeniable.

A national security official stated that if a major natural disaster occurs during the exercise, whether to stop the exercise depends on how serious the disaster is. The Commander-in-Chief and the National Security Council will assess the overall situation and use existing military forces for rescue. If not enough, more personnel might be needed.

The military's "Han Kuang No. 41" exercise will be a 10-day, 9-night continuous drill from July 9 to 18. The exercise has three parts: handling gray zone attacks, emergency operations, and full-scale combat. This year, the exercise area will move from "beaches" to "cities" to practice deeper defense and long-term operations. Protecting key infrastructure, decentralized command and control, and rules of engagement are also important parts this time.

The military official explained that "decentralized command and control" does not mean completely letting go and giving responsibility to lower levels. For example, the Chief of the General Staff's "Joint Operations Command Center" acts as the overall commander. They will hold an "authorization matrix meeting" inside. Whether to give power to the commander to make decisions will be calculated through related meetings before formal orders are given to lower units.
