Typhoon Danas is coming. The weather agency says that some parts of Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan cities will have normal work and school on July 7th. This is because the wind and rain are not strong enough to stop work and school. However, 13 other counties and cities, plus four areas in Taoyuan City, will have a typhoon day off.

The Central Weather Bureau said that Typhoon Danas got stronger in the last three hours. Its strongest wind near the center is now 38 meters per second. It might land in the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area late tonight or early tomorrow morning as it moves north. After it lands, it will become weaker.

According to the weather forecast for July 7th, from 6 AM to 12 PM, the wind and rain in Keelung, Taipei, and New Taipei will not reach the level for closing schools and offices. In Taoyuan, only coastal areas will reach that level. So, Keelung, Taipei, and New Taipei will have normal work and school, and only four coastal areas in Taoyuan will have a day off. The weather agency also said that from early morning to late morning tomorrow, the wind and rain will be more noticeable in northern Taiwan. Areas north of Hsinchu might have heavy rain. In Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan, the average wind from 6 AM to 12 PM is expected to be level 5 to 6, with strong gusts of level 8 to 9. For coastal towns in Taoyuan, the average wind will be level 6 to 7, with gusts of level 9 to 10, then changing to level 8 to 9.

**Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba Expresses Worry About China's Military Near Taiwan**

The election for Japan's Upper House started on July 3rd, and people will vote on July 20th. Today, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba gave a speech in Yokohama. He was helping a candidate from his party, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). During his speech, he said he was worried because China has put aircraft carriers around Taiwan.

According to Japan's Kyodo News, Prime Minister Ishiba, who is also the head of the LDP, spoke in Yokohama. He showed his concern about China, which is acting more aggressively. He said, "China is making its army much bigger and has placed aircraft carriers near Taiwan." He also criticized China for supporting Russia's attack on Ukraine.

Ishiba stressed that "everyone should know that Russia's attack on Ukraine and the situation in the Middle East are connected to safety in Asia." He stated that "working for safety and protecting Japan's independence and peace is the job of the LDP." On July 4th, Ishiba also spoke in Naha City, Okinawa. He said that China's military activities near Taiwan are increasing, and China has three aircraft carriers. He added, "We must think about how to deal with this situation."

**New Taipei Metro to Change Services Due to Typhoon Danas**

Typhoon Danas is coming. The New Taipei City Government announced tonight that most people will work and go to school as usual tomorrow. The New Taipei Metro company said they will change how their trains run depending on the wind and rain. They ask everyone who needs to use the metro during the typhoon to be careful and stay safe.

New Taipei Metro said in a press release that trains will run as usual tomorrow, following the normal weekday schedule. Both the Danhai and Ankeng Light Rail lines, and the Circular Line MRT, have prepared for the typhoon. They will change train times based on the weather and follow their safety rules to keep passengers safe.

The New Taipei Metro also said that if the wind on the Danhai or Ankeng Light Rail lines reaches level 8 suddenly, trains will slow down to 30 kilometers per hour. If the average wind speed for 10 minutes is level 6, or the wind suddenly reaches level 9 or higher, trains will stop running. If water on the tracks is deeper than 6 centimeters, trains will not go into that area, and they will use other ways to operate. For the Circular Line MRT, if the wind reaches level 8 suddenly, or if the average wind for 10 minutes is level 7 or the wind suddenly reaches level 10 or higher, trains will slow down to 30 kilometers per hour. When a train first arrives at a station, it will stop for two minutes to check the wind. If the wind does not get weaker, people will be asked to leave the train, and services will stop. New Taipei Metro reminds everyone to be extra careful if they need to use the metro during the typhoon. If trains slow down or stop, please follow the instructions from drivers and station staff to stay safe.
