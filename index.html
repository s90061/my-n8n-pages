            <h1>US-Russia Meeting to Happen Soon, Trump Says He Won't Be Scared by Putin</h1>
            <p>The important meeting between the US and Russia will start tomorrow. Today, US President Trump said he will not be scared by Russian President Putin. He also said that Ukraine will be part of any agreement about its future.</p>
            <p>News from AFP says that Putin will fly to Alaska, USA, tomorrow because Trump invited him. This is his first visit to a Western country since 2022, when he ordered a full invasion of Ukraine, causing many deaths.</p>
            <p>Russia has won some battles. The Kremlin said that the two presidents plan to talk one-on-one. This has made European leaders more worried. They are afraid that Putin will trick Trump into accepting a deal that is bad for Kyiv.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters at the White House, "I am the President, he will not mess with me."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "In the first 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes, I will know if this meeting will go well or badly."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "If it's a bad meeting, it will end quickly. If it goes well, we will find peace soon." Trump thinks there is a 25% chance the US-Russia meeting will fail.</p>
            <p>In the past, Trump has said he liked Putin. At a meeting in Helsinki in 2018, he seemed to agree with Putin's denial that Russia interfered in the US election. Because of this, Trump faced a lot of criticism after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy was not asked to come to the Alaska meeting. He said the meeting was like a reward for Putin. He also said no to Trump's idea of giving up land.</p>
            <p>Trump promised not to make any deals with Putin alone. He also said he wants to have a meeting with Zelenskyy and Putin together, possibly right after the Alaska meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump told Fox News Radio, "The second meeting will be very, very important. This is because it will be the meeting where they make an agreement. I don't want to use the word 'divide.' But you know, in some ways, it's not a bad word."</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that any future agreement must make sure Ukraine is safe.</p>

            <h1>Lawmaker Liu Shu-bin Asks About Energy Instead of Fraud; Speaker Han Kuo-yu Says It's Not Right</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho Jung-tai to talk about how to stop fraud. However, lawmaker Liu Shu-bin from the Taiwan People's Party started asking questions about energy instead. The head of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, stopped her and said her questions did not fit the topic. He reminded her to go back to the topic of stopping fraud.</p>
            <p>Even though Han Kuo-yu reminded her, Liu Shu-bin continued to talk about energy. She said that the government's wrong energy policy was like a scam. Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Liu Shu-bin's questions did not follow what Han Kuo-yu said and made no sense. He could not understand her.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party suggested inviting Premier Cho Jung-tai to the Legislative Yuan to report on "Anti-Fraud Strategy Action Plan 2.0." Both sides of the government agreed to have the report today, August 15th. So, the Legislative Yuan asked Premier Cho to present the report and answer questions.</p>
            <p>At first, Liu Shu-bin said that the government has not done well in stopping fraud for a long time. But soon after, she started talking about renewable energy and a nuclear-free country. She said that strong winds in the south and middle of Taiwan left solar panels piled up, and they have not been cleaned yet. She also said the government keeps saying good things about renewable energy, like its costs will go down. But she believes that recent storms showed these systems are weak, and many testing devices lost money before they even produced power.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai replied that the phrase "storms showed these systems are weak" might need to be changed. Liu Shu-bin was quiet for a moment but then said "no need." She meant places used for solar power. After that, she continued to talk about the cost of making electricity, giving NT$100 billion to Taipower, and electricity prices.</p>
            <p>During her questioning, Han Kuo-yu suddenly stopped her and said that the meeting today was to hear the Premier and his team report on anti-fraud strategies, as per the Legislative Yuan's rules. He told Liu Shu-bin that if she wanted to ask about energy, the Legislative Yuan should agree on it first and then invite Premier Cho to report on energy. He said it was not right to ask about energy when the topic was fraud.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that in the past, the Legislative Yuan might have allowed wrong things to become normal. So, he especially reminded Liu Shu-bin to go back to the topic of stopping fraud. Premier Cho Jung-tai then said, "Thank you, Speaker Han, for your decision."</p>
            <p>However, Liu Shu-bin replied right away that she respected Han Kuo-yu's decision, but she would quickly finish this topic. After that, Liu Shu-bin continued to ask about renewable energy. She also said that TSMC building factories overseas is related to energy. She even called out to Lin Chang-tso, Taiwan's representative in Finland, suggesting he could learn about nuclear energy there.</p>
            <p>Liu Shu-bin also said that people in Taiwan are most unhappy about three things: equal taxes, energy policy, and fraud. People do not trust the government, and the ruling party has hidden the truth for a long time. She said the Democratic Progressive Party government lied for votes, which led to bad energy policies, government money loss, and even companies moving out of Taiwan. Because of this, people think the government is a scam group.</p>
            <p>In response, Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Liu Shu-bin's questions did not follow Han Kuo-yu's decision and made no sense at all. He could not understand her. When he finished speaking, the questioning time ended. Liu Shu-bin looked a little helpless, and Han Kuo-yu said, "You've worked hard, Legislator Liu Shu-bin."</p>

            <h1>Taichung Man Rides Motorbike Against Traffic Without Helmet; Police Stop Him and Find Drugs</h1>
            <p>A man named Li, who is over 50 years old, was riding his motorbike in Taichung without a helmet and going the wrong way. When he saw police officers on patrol, he felt guilty and threw away the drugs he had. The police stopped him. The man tried to turn and get away. The police found an e-cigarette, drugs, and other things. He was sent to court according to the law.</p>
            <p>Today, the Dajia Police Station in Taichung City said in a written statement that officers were on patrol. When they were at the crossing of Jingguo Road and Jinhua Street in Dajia, they saw a man riding his motorbike without a helmet and going the wrong way. He turned out of the crossing and met the police officers by chance.</p>
            <p>The police used their car to block him, telling him to stop. The man did not want to stop. He tried to turn his motorbike and get away. He also threw away etomidate e-cigarettes along the way to avoid being caught. The police then found one etomidate e-cigarette, two bottles of etomidate e-liquid, and two bags of marijuana drugs on him. Initial tests showed that all these items contained drugs.</p>
            <p>The police checked further, and Mr. Li admitted that the drugs were for his own use. He used drugs at home. After using drugs, he felt confused and not clear-headed. That is why he rode his motorbike without a helmet, which made the police notice him. After questioning, he was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office. He is accused of breaking drug laws and committing a public danger crime.</p>
