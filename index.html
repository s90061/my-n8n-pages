            <h1>Chen Pei-chi: Ko Wen-je hopes to visit his mother in Hsinchu immediately after bail on the 8th</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 7 (CNA) â€“ The Taipei District Court ruled that former Taiwan People's Party chairman Ko Wen-je can be released on bail. Ko Wen-je's wife, Chen Pei-chi, said today that his lawyer told her Ko Wen-je's first wish is to immediately go back to Hsinchu to see his mother. "He also wants to see where his father's (ashes) are. This has always been important to him."</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is handling the Jinghua City case. Former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je asked to be released from custody on bail earlier. On the 5th, the court decided to set his bail at NT$70 million. But after meeting his lawyer, Ko Wen-je said he needed more time to think. The Taiwan People's Party stated that after Ko Wen-je tells his lawyer to agree on the 8th, they will quickly complete the bail process at the Taipei District Court to welcome him out.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi went outside the Tucheng Detention Center tonight to show support to Ko Wen-je's supporters. During a live broadcast, she thanked the "Little Grass" (supporters) for their constant support for Ko Wen-je. She hopes that tomorrow, after she helps pay his bail at the Taipei District Court, she can go home with Ko Wen-je smoothly and safely.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said the lawyer told her that Ko Wen-je's first wish is to immediately go back to Hsinchu to see his mother. So, the plan for tomorrow, after he gets bail, is to first return to Hsinchu to see his mother. "He also wants to see where his father's (ashes) are. This has always been important to him."</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi pointed out that on March 10, the day of Ko Wen-je's father's funeral, Ko Wen-je tried hard to stay until his father's cremation and burial were done, but he was not allowed. Not being able to be with his father was Ko Wen-je's biggest regret. So, "tomorrow he will visit his mother-in-law in Hsinchu and see where his father is." After that, he will likely focus on how to fight his case.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi also said that the lawyer told her Ko Wen-je wants a normal desk, chair, and desk lamp. This is because there are no tables or chairs in the Taipei Detention Center, so he has to kneel or lie down to read. Also, the light is dim, and Ko Wen-je's eyes have almost been damaged this past year.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that tomorrow they will also arrange a short meeting with everyone in front of the Taipei District Court. If there is enough time, Ko Wen-je will travel all over Taiwan, from north to south, to thank the people and groups who supported and encouraged him. "We will thank everyone one by one."</p>

            <h1>OPEC+ main oil-producing countries decide to increase daily output by over 130,000 barrels starting in October</h1>
            <p>London, September 7 (CNA) â€“ Eight main member countries of OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) said today that they have agreed to increase oil production again. They will raise daily output by 137,000 barrels starting in October.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that these eight countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman.</p>
            <p>The energy ministers of these countries stated that they decided to increase daily output by 137,000 barrels starting next month.</p>
            <p>In recent years, OPEC+ often agreed to cut production to keep oil prices high. However, since April this year, these eight countries have changed their policy. They are now focusing on getting back their market share and have agreed to a series of production increases. Currently, international oil prices are around a relatively low level of over 60 US dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>EuroBasket: Georgia beats France 80-70 in a surprise win, reaching the quarterfinals for the first time in history</h1>
            <p>Riga, September 7 (CNA) â€“ Today, Georgia surprised everyone by beating France 80-70 in the EuroBasket (European Basketball Championship). France's NBA star Wembanyama was not playing. This win means Georgia has reached the quarterfinals for the first time in its history.</p>
            <p>The 2025 EuroBasket has many NBA players from the United States playing for their countries. The French team includes good players like Zaccharie Risacher, a top draft pick for the Hawks, Guerschon Yabusele, a forward for the Knicks, and Alex Sarr, a center for the Wizards.</p>
            <p>However, important tall players like Victor Wembanyama, a star for the Spurs, and Rudy Gobert, a center for the Timberwolves, did not play for France in this tournament.</p>
            <p>For Georgia, tall players like Goga Bitadze from the Magic and Sandro Mamukelashvili from the Raptors were on the team.</p>
            <p>Before the game, France was expected to win. But Georgia started strong, ending the first quarter 24-20. They had a small lead at halftime, 38-37. Kamar Baldwin, their point guard, scored 14 of those points.</p>
            <p>In the second half, Georgia continued its good play from the first half. They increased their lead to 58-54 by the end of the third quarter. But France stayed close. With 4 minutes and 19 seconds left in the game, Elie Okobo made a two-point jump shot, tying the score at 66-66.</p>
            <p>However, Georgia won in the end, 80-70, because Tornike Shengelia, Baldwin, Bitadze, and Mamukelashvili scored important points at key moments.</p>
            <p>For Georgia, Baldwin was the best player, scoring 24 points. He made 3 out of 4 three-point shots, 5 out of 6 two-point shots, and all 5 free throws. Shengelia also scored 24 points and got 8 rebounds.</p>
            <p>France had a better team on paper, but their NBA players Risacher and Yabusele only scored 7 and 12 points respectively. Another NBA player, Sarr, was not playing due to injury.</p>
            <p>Georgia will play Finland in the quarterfinals next. Finland surprised many yesterday by beating Serbia, a team expected to win the championship, 92-86 in the Round of 16. This shocked the international basketball world.</p>
