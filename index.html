            <h1>US Lowers Car Tariffs for EU to 15%, Starts August 1st</h1>
            <p>The United States announced today that it will lower the import tax on cars from the European Union (EU) to 15%. This change started on August 1st. This is part of a trade agreement that both sides announced before.</p>
            <p>According to a report from Agence France-Presse and documents from the U.S. Commerce Department and Trade Representative's Office, the tax on EU cars will go down from 27.5% to 15%.</p>
            <p>In July, U.S. President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a basic agreement. This agreement said that most EU products sent to the U.S. would have a 15% tax. The decision to lower the tax on cars and car parts depended on whether the EU would pass laws to lower its own taxes on American industrial goods and some farm products that are not sensitive.</p>
            <p>In August, the EU took action. This made it possible for the Trump government to change the car taxes starting from August 1st. This was done to help protect Europe's car industry, which is very important.</p>
            <p>The documents also say that from September 1st, some products will not have these taxes. These include airplanes, airplane parts, generic medicines and their materials, and some metals and minerals.</p>
            <p>The U.S. said in its announcement that this list of products might change later.</p>

            <h1>Trump Plans to Change Foreign Aid to Focus on 'America First'</h1>
            <p>The Trump government plans to use 1.8 billion U.S. dollars of foreign aid money for projects that put "America First." This is according to documents sent to the U.S. Congress. These projects include investing in Greenland, fighting against "anti-U.S. governments" in Latin America, stopping illegal immigration, and reducing China's influence.</p>
            <p>Reuters looked at a Congressional Notification from the Trump government today, dated September 12. It said that the U.S. needs to use foreign aid money to deal with new problems to keep America safe, strong, and rich. This is to protect the country's security.</p>
            <p>In this document, the Trump government said that the 1.8 billion U.S. dollars (about 56.7 billion New Taiwan dollars) will be used for projects that "make America's global leadership stronger." These projects will focus on important areas of the Trump government's policies.</p>
            <p>These projects include making the supply chains for important minerals more varied, helping to invest in and build important infrastructure, stopping China's influence, and "dealing with the immigration problem."</p>
            <p>The document also mentioned that 400 million U.S. dollars will be used for projects in Europe. These include energy and important mineral plans in Ukraine, and also work to help Greenland's economy and protect its environment.</p>
            <p>Trump has said before that he wants to control Greenland, which is a part of Denmark but governs itself. This island is a very important place. It has a lot of oil, natural gas, and minerals needed for many high-tech industries.</p>
            <p>The document also said that in the Western Hemisphere, 400 million U.S. dollars will be used to stop illegal immigrants from entering the U.S. It will also be used to limit China's influence in important minerals and artificial intelligence (AI). Furthermore, it will be used to "fight against the Marxist anti-U.S. governments in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua."</p>
            <p>Since Trump came back to the White House in January this year, the U.S. government has been making big changes to how it gives foreign aid. This new way of thinking is different from the old idea that food, health care, and money help are important parts of "soft power" for America's global influence.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Health Insurance Budget for 2026 Sees 5.5% Increase</h1>
            <p>For the year 2026, the negotiations for Taiwan's National Health Insurance (NHI) budget reached an agreement with a 5.5% increase. This was a rare moment where doctors and those who pay for health insurance both agreed. Doctors who work in basic Western medicine clinics pointed out that the plan to prevent metabolic syndrome is a very important part of the "Healthy Taiwan" goal, but it did not get enough support in the talks. They hope the National Health Promotion Administration will use public money to provide the needed resources.</p>
            <p>The NHI global budget is the total amount of money set aside. Every September, the NHI Committee holds a meeting to discuss the budget for the next year. They talk about the budgets for hospitals, basic Western medicine clinics, Chinese medicine, dentists, and outpatient dialysis. In past years, it was often hard for the people who pay for health insurance and the doctors to agree on how much the budget should grow. They usually had to send two different plans to the Ministry of Health and Welfare to decide.</p>
            <p>The 2026 NHI global budget meeting happened on September 24th. Wang Hong-Yu, who is the head of the Kaohsiung County Medical Association and works in a clinic, spoke to CNA early this morning. He said the meeting started at 9:30 AM. They discussed the budgets for hospitals, dialysis, basic Western medicine, Chinese medicine, and dentists. The discussions for hospitals and dialysis went well and they reached an agreement. However, for a while, the basic Western medicine clinics could not agree.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-Yu shared that after the hospital and dental budgets were successfully agreed upon, it was already 8:50 PM. They then talked about the basic Western medicine budget again. Chen Xiang-Guo, the new head of the National Medical Association, asked for everyone's opinions. After giving up a few hundred million dollars from the budget, they had a final talk with the NHI Committee members. The meeting lasted until about 9:30 PM, and they finally reached an agreement.</p>
            <p>For 2026, all budgets for hospitals, dialysis, basic Western medicine, Chinese medicine, and dentists reached an agreement. The high estimate is a 5.5% increase, meaning the total budget next year will be about 988.31 billion New Taiwan dollars. This is the first time since 2002 that all budgets were agreed upon at once. Wang Hong-Yu said it was very unusual to reach an agreement so quickly. He believes that both the payers and the doctors saw that Minister of Health and Welfare Shi Chong-Liang and NHI Administrator Chen Liang-Yu were sincere, which made both sides willing to "bear with it for the country."</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-Yu felt a bit disappointed about the compromises made for the basic Western medicine budget. He said that local clinics are very important for preventing long-term illnesses. These include getting rid of stomach cancer, slowing down kidney disease so people don't need dialysis too soon, and stopping high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol from causing strokes or heart attacks. He noted that the metabolic syndrome prevention plan is a key part of President Lai Ching-Te's "Healthy Taiwan" goal, but it was not favored in the budget talks.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-Yu explained that basic Western medicine clinics planned for 1.2 billion dollars for treating stomach cancer, but they only got 300 million dollars this time. For reducing strokes and heart attacks, they asked for 1.5 billion dollars, but got 700 million dollars. For slowing down kidney disease in patients needing dialysis, they estimated 500 to 700 million dollars, but only received 353 million dollars. For the metabolic syndrome prevention plan, the needed costs were 887 million dollars, but the budget talks resulted in 0 dollars for this.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-Yu asked the National Health Promotion Administration to set aside money for managing patient cases, follow-ups, and yearly evaluations. He also asked them to include the extra costs for next year. This would allow basic Western medicine clinics to do their work without worry, helping everyone to achieve President Lai Ching-Te's "Healthy Taiwan 888" goal. He also found that the main members of the NHI Committee who were leading the talks did not know much about "Healthy Taiwan." He suggested that they should be allowed to join the "Healthy Taiwan" promotion committee in the future to understand its goals.</p>
