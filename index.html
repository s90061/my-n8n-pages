            <h1>Trump's Family Business Plans to Get $1.5 Billion, Start a New Company Called WLFI</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported on August 8th that former US President Trump's family cryptocurrency business, World Liberty Financial, wants to raise 1.5 billion US dollars. They plan to use this money to create a new public company that will own the cryptocurrency $WLFI.</p>
            <p>Sources say that the details of the deal are not yet final. However, the company has already talked to big investors in cryptocurrency and technology about this new joint business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that World Liberty Financial is a "decentralized platform." Their official website says that Trump and his son are the co-founders of this platform. Since it started, the platform has made 500 million US dollars for the Trump family.</p>
            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has not yet called $WLFI a security. This means it will not be checked as strictly as investments like stocks.</p>

            <h1>Putin's Special Envoy Says Some Countries Don't Want Russia-Ukraine Peace, Will Try to Stop Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>US President Trump announced yesterday that he will meet with Russian President Putin on August 15th. Today, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy for international economic and investment cooperation, said that some countries will try very hard to stop this meeting.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had said Russia and Ukraine are close to a ceasefire agreement. This agreement could end the conflict that has lasted for three and a half years. The details of the agreement are not public yet. However, Ukraine might be asked to give up a lot of its land. Many European countries do not like this idea.</p>
            <p>Today, Dmitriev said that some countries want the war to continue. He wrote on his Telegram account: "Some countries want the conflict to continue. They will surely try very hard to stop the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump."</p>
            <p>Dmitriev also said that these efforts mean "provocation and spreading false information." But he did not say which countries he meant or what kind of "provocation" it might be.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin had already confirmed that this meeting between Russian and American leaders will happen. Yuri Ushakov, Putin's aide, said that the two leaders will "focus on discussing options for a lasting peaceful solution to the Ukraine crisis."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said: "This will clearly be a difficult process, but we will work hard and actively on it."</p>

            <p>In Singapore, at the World Aquatics Masters Championships, a special swimmer from Taiwan, Grandma Tang Cheng-yao, won a gold medal today. She is 97 years old.

Many water sports are part of it, such as swimming, diving, water polo, open water swimming, and artistic swimming. Since 2015, these championships have been held at the same time as the World Aquatics Championships.</p>
            <p>Tang Cheng-yao is 97 years old now. She was the only person in the 95-99 age group for the 100-meter breaststroke. Even so, Tang Cheng-yao swam strongly to the end. She was happy to break the event record, and all the people watching cheered for her when the race finished.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Tang Cheng-yao took part in the Taipei World Masters Games. She swam and did land sports and won five gold medals. She will be 98 in October this year. She has said before that she wants to keep moving as she gets older. She hopes to become an athlete who is 100 years old.</p>
