In the Wimbledon tennis tournament, top player Aryna Sabalenka won her third-round match against Emma Raducanu from the UK. The score was 7-6 (8/6) and 6-4. Sabalenka said it was a great atmosphere, and the crowd was very loud.

Many seeded players, 36 in total, did not make it past the third round this year, which is a new record. This means there have been many unexpected results. For example, Madison Keys from the US and Naomi Osaka from Japan both lost their matches today.

Sabalenka is now the only top 10 player left in the top half of the women's singles draw. This makes her feel like this year could be her chance to win. If she wins Wimbledon, this tough match against Raducanu will be an important moment for her.

**Taiwan and Paraguay Agreement: 19 Products Get Lower Taxes**

Taiwan and Paraguay have signed a new agreement, called the 8th Resolution of the Economic Cooperation Agreement (ECA), which started today. This means that 17 products from Paraguay, like frozen boneless pork, prepared beef, wheat flour, and textiles, will have zero import taxes when they come to Taiwan. Also, the tax on rice cakes will go down to 10%, and natural honey will have its tax slowly lowered to 20% over three years.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs stated that Paraguay's economy mostly depends on farm products. Since 2017, Taiwan has bought about 45.44 million US dollars worth of these products from Paraguay, mostly frozen boneless pork. This tax reduction will help increase trade and business between the two countries and strengthen their friendship.

Paraguay is an important friend to Taiwan in South America and has always supported Taiwan's involvement in international events. The government of Paraguay is especially focused on making its farm products more competitive for export and wants to improve its industries and attract more investments.
