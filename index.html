            <h1>New Rules for Insurance Companies: Taiwan's Financial Watchdog is Checking the Effects</h1>
            <p>News reports say that Taiwan's financial authority, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), and the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation are planning to change the new financial rules for life insurance companies. These new rules are called TW-ICS. It means that the way they deal with financial differences will not always be spread out over 15 years. The FSC said today that they are still discussing these changes. They need to see how these changes will affect insurance companies. They will announce the final plan when it is ready.</p>
            <p>Insurance companies will start using new accounting rules (IFRS17) and the new TW-ICS system on January 1st next year. News reports said that the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation has suggested three main changes. First, for companies with enough capital (RBC above 250%), any financial gap after switching to ICS will be calculated as 125%. These companies can spread out the payment of this gap over 15 years. Second, if a company has less capital (RBC below 250%), their ICS will be half of their RBC, and they must fix any financial gap within 5 years. Third, if a company wants their ICS to be higher than 125%, they must fix this extra part within 5 years.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Huo-yen, the deputy head of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said that the FSC announced in September 2020 that it would introduce the new TW-ICS system. This was to help insurance companies manage their money better, correctly show their business risks, protect customers, and keep the financial system stable. The system will start next year on January 1st. To help companies get ready, the FSC has already released four sets of temporary and local support measures in 2023 and 2024.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Huo-yen stated that the four sets of temporary and local support measures that have already been released have not changed. Regarding the news reports that the Central Deposit Insurance Corporation is looking into the details of these temporary measures for insurance companies, Mr. Tsai said that these rules are still being discussed. They need to see how they will affect companies. The final version will be announced once it is decided, which will definitely happen this year.</p>

            <h1>Councilor Tsai Cheng-yi, Known as "Windshield Wiper," is Held for Money Laundering</h1>
            <p>Tsai Cheng-yi, a county council member from Chiayi who is not part of any political party and is known as "Windshield Wiper," was recently arrested by police and prosecutors at Taoyuan Airport. He is suspected of breaking money laundering laws. After questioning by the Ciaotou District Prosecutors Office, they asked the court to hold him. The Ciaotou District Court held a hearing this afternoon and decided to keep Mr. Tsai in custody and not allow him to see visitors.</p>
            <p>The Ciaotou District Court announced tonight that Mr. Tsai Cheng-yi is strongly suspected of being involved in leading a criminal group and laundering more than 100 million New Taiwan Dollars (which is also more than 20 billion Thai Baht). He was arrested at Taoyuan Airport, which suggests he might try to run away, hide evidence, or talk to other people involved in the crime or witnesses.</p>
            <p>The judge believes this case involves international money laundering, with a total amount of over 20 billion Thai Baht (more than 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars). This seriously affects the financial order in Taiwan and other countries. Therefore, the judge decided that it is necessary to hold Mr. Tsai. He will be held for two months starting today, and he cannot see or communicate with anyone. This decision can be appealed.</p>
            <p>This case started when the Ciaotou District Prosecutors Office learned that an international money laundering group had set up an operation center in Kaohsiung. This center helped gambling and other criminal groups to launder money across countries. It is estimated that they laundered 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars. In May, a special team searched the place and arrested several people, including a Mr. Xiao and a Mr. Li. They were later held in custody.</p>
            <p>Later, on August 31st, prosecutors arrested Tsai Cheng-yi at Taoyuan Airport. They also used a search warrant from the court to search places in Chiayi and Kaohsiung and took away related evidence. After questioning, prosecutors believe Tsai Cheng-yi broke several money laundering laws and laws against organized crime. They asked the court to hold Mr. Tsai and not allow him to see visitors.</p>

            <h1>Band AccuseFive Finishes World Tour; Singer Quan Qing Happy to Sing Chinese Songs Abroad</h1>
            <p>The band AccuseFive recently released their new music album. They just finished a two-year world tour and went to a radio station to talk about it. Band member Quan Qing said she was proud to sing Chinese songs in other countries. Yun An, another member, talked about a scary and funny moment when they performed in France, saying it felt like the doll Annabelle could appear at any time.</p>
            <p>AccuseFive became music producers themselves and released their fourth album, "We Are Like Those Silly Fools." They recently visited the POP Radio show Fun Music. There, they talked openly with the host, Emily, and also shared some silly things they have done in the past.</p>
            <p>To go with the album's title "Silly Fools," AccuseFive shared their silliest life experiences in a press release. Kian, a band member, laughed and said he once put his phone in the refrigerator to cool it down. But he forgot about it after going to the bathroom, and when he remembered, the phone was frozen solid. Quan Qing remembered that when she was little, she often called her teacher "mom." Yun An once threw a pillow into a field with his younger brother to see how it would fly.</p>
            <p>They just finished a world tour that lasted two years. Quan Qing said emotionally that she felt very proud to sing Chinese songs in foreign countries. She even met foreign fans who spoke to them using both Chinese and English, which surprised and touched all three band members.</p>
            <p>Yun An also said with a smile that their most special experience was performing at a theater called "La Cigale" in France. The theater was like a maze, and the backstage area had many small, narrow rooms. The strange atmosphere made the three members joke that "Annabelle could appear at any moment." They agreed that if they ever got lost, they should scream loudly for help.</p>
            <p>AccuseFive has been a band for eight years and has grown a lot. Yun An said that now the three of them are like hurdlers; they can easily get over different problems. They can also calmly deal with negative comments from others. He said, "We are just doing what we love." Next, they plan to perform in more cities at smaller live music venues.</p>
