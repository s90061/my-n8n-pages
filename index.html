Many people saw what looked like a tornado in Pingtung and Kaohsiung around noon today. The Hengchun Weather Station said they are not sure yet if it was a real tornado. They explained that a true tornado must touch the ground.

A tornado is a strong spinning column of air that comes from a storm cloud and reaches the ground or sea. It forms when the air is very unstable, or when hot, wet air mixes strongly with cold air. Many people shared videos of the possible tornado on social media.

A weather station official, Mr. Hsueh, said that tornadoes are usually small, so it's hard to see them clearly on radar. They need videos and signs of damage on the ground to confirm if it was a tornado. He added that the weather in Taiwan has been unstable recently. They saw strong storms near Kaohsiung that moved towards Wandan, which matches when people saw the possible tornado. However, it's still unclear if it touched the ground.

**Taipower Reminds People About Power Safety After Disaster: Check Wires First**

A typhoon caused a lot of damage to the electricity system in Chiayi County. In some areas, after the power came back on, over 100 pigs died at a farm because of an electric shock. Taipower warns everyone that power equipment and wires can be damaged after a storm. It's very important to check your electricity meter, wires, and other equipment for any problems before you use power again.

Taipower said that if your electricity meter or wires are leaning, broken, or got wet, you should not touch them or try to turn the power back on yourself. Also, if any electrical appliance or equipment got wet, do not use it until a professional electrician checks it. This is to stop short circuits or electric shocks.

If your power was off, check your main power switch carefully. Make sure it is dry and smells normal before you turn it on. If you are not sure, ask a professional to help. If you see fallen wires or leaning power poles outside, stay away from them and call Taipower or your local government right away. Taipower's 24-hour service number is 1911. The typhoon caused power to go out for 255,000 homes in Chiayi, and about 19,000 homes still do not have power.
