            <h1>Germany Train Crash: At Least 3 People Die, Many Hurt</h1>
            <p>Police say that a regional train in southwest Germany went off the tracks in a forest. About 100 people were on the train. At least 3 people have died.</p>
            <p>A police person spoke to AFP news agency and said that 3 people have died and many more are injured from this accident.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that the police in Stuttgart said two parts of the passenger train went off the tracks. This happened between the towns of Riedlingen and Munderkingen, near the borders of Germany, Switzerland, and France. The reason for the accident is still not known.</p>
            <p>DPA news agency showed pictures. The parts of the train that went off the tracks were mostly not broken. But two parts of the train were lying next to each other on the railway.</p>
            <p>Deutsche Bahn, the German railway company, said in a statement that "many people were hurt" in the accident. They will help the police with their investigation.</p>

Today, Tainan City, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Yunlin County, and Taichung City will have local heavy rain or very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration also said that Miaoli County and Changhua County will have local heavy rain. Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Nantou areas might have local heavy rain. Please be careful of lightning and strong winds. In the mountains, please be careful of falling earth, rocks, and sudden floods. In low areas, please be careful of floods.</p>

            <h1>US Commerce Secretary Says Report on Computer Chips Will Be Ready in Two Weeks</h1>
            <p>The United States started an investigation into the computer chip industry in April for national security reasons. The details about new taxes on these chips are not out yet. Countries like Taiwan, which make a lot of computer chips, are watching closely. Today, the US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said the results of the investigation will be public in two weeks.</p>
            <p>US President Trump finished a tax agreement with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Scotland today. Howard Lutnick answered reporters' questions about computer chip taxes there.</p>
            <p>In February, Trump said he might put a 25% tax on computer chips from other countries. Two months later, the Commerce Department started a study on semiconductors. They used Section 232 of the 'Trade Expansion Act' from 1962 to do this.</p>
            <p>This study looks at many things. These include parts for chips like silicon wafers, machines that make chips, and products that use chips. The Commerce Department wants to see if it is possible to make more chips in the US. This would make the US depend less on chips from other countries. They also want to know if new taxes or other trade rules are 'needed' to protect national security.</p>
            <p>The US buys a lot of chips from Taiwan. The previous President, Joe Biden, tried to change this. He helped pass a 'CHIPS Act' to give money to chip factories to make more chips in the US. TSMC, a big chip company from Taiwan, also got money from this law.</p>
            <p>After Trump said he would put a 25% tax on chips, many people asked him not to. In May, a research group in Washington called the 'Information Technology and Innovation Foundation' (ITIF) used a model to guess what would happen. They said if a 25% chip tax started, the US economy would grow 0.18% less in the first year. If it continued for ten years, the US would lose 1.4 trillion US dollars (about 41 trillion New Taiwan dollars) in total economic growth.</p>
            <p>Also, if the cost of chips goes up by 25%, the price of cars could go up by as much as 1000 US dollars. The 'Information Technology and Innovation Foundation' guessed that the US government would lose more money in taxes from a smaller economy than it would get from the new chip tax.</p>
            <p>The group also said that the US government would lose 165 billion US dollars in net taxes. Each American person would lose 122 US dollars in their living standard in the first year. Over 10 years, this would be 4208 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Regarding important industries like AI and cars, the group said that higher chip costs would make it more expensive to train AI systems. This would make the US less able to compete in AI. At the same time, China will continue to give a lot of money to its AI and chip industries. This means Chinese companies can grow their AI without the same high costs. They might become the leaders in AI.</p>
