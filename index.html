            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: Government Will Borrow Money to Cover Big Budget Gap Next Year</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the government is working hard to prepare next year's budget. However, because of changes to the law about how money is shared (the "Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Allocation Act"), there will be a very big shortage of money. The government will need to borrow money to deal with this.</p>
            <p>The central government's budget for next year is expected to be finished by the end of August. Premier Cho recently held a meeting to review it. The new "Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Allocation Act" means the central government must give NT$375.3 billion to local governments. Also, the defense budget must be more than 3% of the country's total economic output (GDP). People are watching to see how the budget will be made.</p>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan invited Premier Cho and other government officials to give a special report. The report was about the recovery and rebuilding efforts after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rains on July 28. They also answered questions.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting, Premier Cho talked to reporters. He answered questions about whether the Executive Yuan's new "Resilience Special Act" will include giving money to everyone. He also talked about problems the central government might face when making next year's budget, now that the new money-sharing law is in effect.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that President Lai Ching-te has officially announced the "Resilience Special Act," and it is now active. Based on this, the government will study how to change or increase support for industries, especially for specific ones. They hope to make changes to this special act and send it to the Legislative Yuan for approval. For other parts, the government will mostly follow what President Lai has announced.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that they are working very hard to prepare the central government's budget for next year. Because the law about sharing money has changed, there will be a very large financial gap. They will have to borrow money to cover it. This means that next year's central government budget will have a lot of borrowed money.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Both Russia and Ukraine Must Give Up Land to End War</h1>
            <p>Washington, Kyiv, and Brussels, August 11, 2025 (CNA) â€“ U.S. President Donald Trump said today that both Kyiv (Ukraine) and Moscow (Russia) must give up some land to stop the war. He also said that his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week will quickly show if Putin wants to make a deal.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump will meet Putin in Alaska, USA, on August 15. European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy plan to talk with Trump first. They are worried that Washington might try to force Ukraine to accept a bad peace deal.</p>
            <p>Trump has taken a tougher stand against Moscow. He agreed to send more U.S. weapons to Ukraine. He also threatened to put taxes on people who buy Russian oil. But Europe is still worried that Trump might agree to a deal that makes Kyiv give up a lot.</p>
            <p>Kaja Kallas, a senior official for foreign policy in the European Union (EU), said today that ending the Russia-Ukraine war needs "unity across the Atlantic, support for Ukraine, and pressure on Russia." She also said it needs to "stop Russia from attacking in Europe again in the future."</p>
            <p>During a press conference at the White House, Trump talked about his meeting with Putin. He said, "This is really a first talk." He added that they would know if they could make progress "probably in the first two minutes."</p>
            <p>He said, "I will tell him (Putin) that you must end this war."</p>
            <p>Trump said that future talks might include Zelenskyy. The U.S. goal is to quickly stop the fighting in this bloody conflict, which has lasted three and a half years. Trump plans to talk with European leaders soon after his meeting with Putin.</p>
            <p>Trump has talked about trading land before. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine wants to give up land as part of a peace deal.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters, "There will be some land swapping."</p>
            <p>The Hill newspaper reported that Trump also said, "So there's good and bad, but it's very complicated because the borders are not straight. There will be some exchanges and some changes in land."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I have learned from talking to Russia and everyone that this will help Ukraine." He stated that Russia has taken some "very important land," but "we will try to get some important land back."</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that Trump said if Putin offers a "fair deal" in their talks, he will tell European leaders the latest news. He added that "out of respect," he would talk to Zelenskyy first.</p>
            <p>He said, "I will call him first... and after the meeting too. I might say, 'Good luck, keep fighting,' or I might say, 'We can make a deal.'"</p>
            <p>Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff, said he talked with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio today. He wrote on X (social media) that lasting peace needs "a ceasefire without conditions, which is needed before real talks can happen."</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Yang-liu Still Getting Stronger and Bigger; Hualien-Taitung and Southern Areas to Prepare for Strong Winds and Heavy Rain on August 13</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 12, 2025 (CNA) â€“ The weather agency announced a sea typhoon warning for Typhoon Yang-liu early this morning. They expect the typhoon to get a bit stronger and its stormy area to get a bit bigger as it gets closer to Taiwan. Yang-liu will pass over Taiwan tomorrow. People in Hualien-Taitung and southern Taiwan should prepare for very heavy rain or more.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration put out a sea typhoon warning for Medium Typhoon Yang-liu at 5:30 AM today. They expect to issue a land typhoon warning between noon and afternoon. At 8:00 AM, the center of Yang-liu was at 20.7 degrees North latitude and 127.8 degrees East longitude. This is about 730 kilometers southeast of Taitung. It is moving northwest at 25 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Yang-liu's center pressure is 970 hectopascals. The strongest winds near its center are 33 meters per second. Its average storm radius for level 7 winds is 120 kilometers, and for level 10 winds, it is 40 kilometers.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-chi, a forecaster from the weather agency, said in a press conference that Yang-liu is a danger to the waters east of Taiwan and the Bashi Channel. It will affect Taiwan tomorrow, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. As Yang-liu gets closer to Taiwan, it is expected to get a bit stronger and its stormy area will get a bit bigger. Tomorrow, Yang-liu will pass over Taiwan during the day and move into the Taiwan Strait at night.</p>
            <p>Regarding wind, Liu Yu-chi said that from tonight until early tomorrow morning, there will be strong winds of 8 to 9 levels offshore in eastern Taiwan. Coastal winds will also get stronger. During the day tomorrow, most coastal areas will have strong winds of level 8 or higher. Areas south of Changhua and Hualien-Taitung might have winds up to level 11. If the typhoon lands in Taitung, there could be even stronger winds.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-chi also said that moisture from the outer parts of the typhoon will start moving in late tonight. This means there will be scattered showers in Keelung's north coast and Yilan. Tomorrow, due to the typhoon, Hualien-Taitung and southern areas will have very heavy rain or more. Chiayi and areas south of it, as well as Penghu, will also have heavy rain or very heavy rain. On August 14, the typhoon will move away slowly. Kinmen will still have heavy rain and wind in the early morning, but the rain and wind on the main island will become weaker.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-chi warned that from tonight, the waves in the waters east of Taiwan and the Bashi Channel will slowly get bigger, reaching 2 to 3 meters high. Especially near the center of the typhoon, there could be very large waves up to 5 meters high.</p>
