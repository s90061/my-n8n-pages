            <h1>A Doctor's Words Gave Courage: A Person with HIV Lives with AIDS for 40 Years</h1>
            <p>For A-Jen (not her real name), 61, getting HIV was once her biggest fear. She was too scared to tell anyone. But a doctor told her, "It's like a cold, you'll get better slowly with medicine." These words gave her the courage to face it. Now, she has lived with HIV for 40 years. She is most happy that she did not pass the virus to her daughter.</p>
            <p>A-Jen's husband had HIV. He did not get treatment and sadly passed away later. A-Jen found out she had HIV during a blood test when she came to Taiwan for work. Today, at a training camp for women with HIV, organized by the Harmony Home Association Taiwan, she shared her 40-year journey with HIV.</p>
            <p>"At that time, I was completely afraid to tell anyone about it," A-Jen said. Thinking back to those worrying days, she is still thankful for the doctor's words that gave her hope. "The doctor told me it's like a cold, and I would get better slowly with medicine." But she was still worried if she would give it to her daughter.</p>
            <p>After A-Jen was sent to Harmony Home, she found out that many other people were going through the same thing. Many years later, when her daughter grew up, A-Jen finally found the courage to tell her the truth. Luckily, her daughter's test result was negative. This removed a worry she had for many years.</p>
            <p>According to data from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control, by the end of 2024, there were 45,381 people with HIV in Taiwan. Only 5% of them were women. Because there are fewer women with HIV, Harmony Home Association Taiwan said that these women are often left out. They suffer from the illness and social pressure quietly.</p>
            <p>Harmony Home Taiwan also said that many women with HIV are also caregivers for their families. They are daughters and mothers. But when they have health problems, they cannot get enough help. They often hide their illness because they are afraid of being treated badly. This causes them a lot of mental stress and they miss chances to get medical and social help.</p>
            <p>Harmony Home said that in the past, HIV services were mostly for gay men and people who used drugs. The identity, experiences, and needs of women were often forgotten. So, since 2019, they have held special training camps for women with HIV every year. They want to create a safe space where these women feel understood.</p>
            <p>Now, medical science has greatly improved. The idea of "U=U" (Undetectable = Untransmittable) is becoming more common. Harmony Home Taiwan says that HIV is no longer a deadly disease. For most women with HIV, the real difficulty is not the illness itself, but the lack of understanding from society. They ask society to look at the situation of women with HIV. They also ask to check if HIV services are fair to all genders, so that no one is left without care and help.</p>

            <h1>Russia Says It Took Another Village in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, Moving from East to Central Ukraine</h1>
            <p>Moscow, September 13 (Central News Agency) â€“ Russia said today that it has taken another village in the Dnipropetrovsk region of central Ukraine. Russian forces said they had already moved into this region in early July.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Russia's Ministry of Defense said its troops took the village of Novomykolaivka. This village is near the border of the Donetsk region. The Donetsk region is where most of the fighting is happening.</p>
            <p>AFP could not check if this information is true.</p>
            <p>But DeepState, an online map of the battlefield run by Ukrainian military experts, shows that Kyiv still controls the village.</p>
            <p>Russian forces have better weapons and many more soldiers than Ukraine. In recent months, they have continued to attack Ukraine. They have gained some ground in the eastern part of the country.</p>
            <p>At the end of August, Kyiv first admitted that Russian troops had entered the Dnipropetrovsk region. Moscow had said it was moving forward there in early August.</p>
            <p>Currently, Russian forces control about one-fifth of Ukraine's land.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin has asked Ukraine to pull back its troops from the Donbas region in the east. This was a condition for a ceasefire, but Kyiv clearly said no.</p>
            <p>The Dnipropetrovsk region is not one of the five Ukrainian regions that Moscow publicly claims as Russian territory. These five regions are Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Crimea.</p>

            <h1>President Lai Ching-te's Meeting in New Taipei City Focused on Fake News and Fighting Fraud, Did Not Talk About Elections</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City, September 13 (Central News Agency) â€“ The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) held a national party meeting in New Taipei City today. Su Chiao-hui, who is the head of the DPP in New Taipei City and a lawmaker, said after the meeting that they talked about things important to people's daily lives. These included the economy, stopping fake news, and fighting fraud. When asked if they talked about the 2026 New Taipei City mayoral election, she said they did not mention it at all.</p>
            <p>The DPP's national party meeting was held this afternoon with party members and officials from New Taipei City. President Lai Ching-te, who is also the party chairman, attended. Other attendees included DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung and Deputy Secretary-General Ho Bo-wen. Su Chiao-hui, along with New Taipei City council members Tai Wei-shan and Cho Kuan-ting, spoke to reporters after the meeting about what was discussed.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui said that President Lai Ching-te led the DPP's main team to New Taipei City for a meeting with local party members and officials. The meeting lasted more than two hours. During the meeting, local members shared their opinions on central and local policies, and discussed them with the central team.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui also pointed out that the meeting focused on economic issues that affect people's lives. They talked about special policies needed for small and medium-sized businesses when they face problems like US tariffs. They also discussed benefits and welfare plans for people from students to older family members. She said these plans need to be stronger, faster, and well-advertised.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui mentioned that local members also told the central party and government teams that they need to stop fake news more quickly. President Lai Ching-te and Hsu Kuo-yung explained the reasons and details of the policies the central government is currently working on. They also said they would do more if needed. They stressed that the team works together, both central and local, and everyone must work hard together.</p>
            <p>Su Chiao-hui said that overall, it was a very positive meeting between the central and local teams. People at the meeting also said they hope there will be more such meetings in the future, in different formats. She hopes the central government will take these practical ideas back to make national policies more complete and thoughtful.</p>
            <p>When asked about the New Taipei City mayoral election, Su Chiao-hui replied that it was not mentioned at all during the meeting.</p>
            <p>Tai Wei-shan said that the meeting mostly talked about false information. She added that not only the DPP but all political parties should be responsible for this. They should work together to change laws to deal with fake news and stop it from spreading.</p>
            <p>Cho Kuan-ting explained that besides stopping fake news, another main point was fighting fraud. President Lai answered all the suggestions from the council members. On the topic of fraud, President Lai clearly said that the fight against fraud will become stronger. He also mentioned that laws related to fighting fraud have been passed. The government will make fighting fraud a very important job, as required by law.</p>
