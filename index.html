            <h1>High-Speed Rail says a story about a mother with two kids in a 'quiet carriage' is not true</h1>
            <p>Taiwan High-Speed Rail (HSR) has a rule for quiet carriages, but they also want to be friendly to families. A story was shared online that said a mother with two small children was asked to leave the quiet carriage to calm her baby. The story said she had to leave her older child alone. HSR says this is not true. They did not give a sign to any specific passenger or ask them to go to the train's entrance area to calm a child.</p>
            <p>Taiwan HSR started its "quiet carriage" rule on September 22. Recently, people have been talking about it a lot. HSR has said many times that making carriages quieter is for people who talk on the phone or use electronic devices without headphones, which can bother other passengers. If a baby, young child, or someone with a health problem cannot control their actions and makes noise, the staff always help them and their family with care.</p>
            <p>A user wrote online that yesterday on the HSR, they saw a mother with two children. She was given a sign to be quieter. She was also told to take her baby to the hallway outside the carriage to calm the baby. Because of this, the mother had to leave her older child alone in the seat and take the baby outside. The user also wrote the train number and the time this happened.</p>
            <p>Taiwan HSR sent a message to explain. The train conductor of train 153 yesterday said that he saw parents with children when he walked through the carriage. But he did not see any children crying loudly and needing help. He also said that no one on that train was told to go to the train's entrance area to calm a child.</p>
            <p>Taiwan HSR also said that when staff push trolleys to serve passengers, they do not tell parents to stop babies from crying. The train security guards show a sign during their rounds in the carriage, but they do not show it to specific passengers.</p>
            <p>Taiwan HSR wants to make it clear that the idea of "quiet carriages" is not against children. In the past and now, they always give out stickers or small snacks to help parents calm their children. The goal is to make children pay attention to something else, not to put pressure on parents. HSR hopes parents feel good about riding the train, and they hope people do not misunderstand the rule.</p>

            <h1>Denmark will spend 4.26 billion US dollars to make its Arctic defenses stronger and buy 16 more F-35 planes</h1>
            <p>Helsinki, October 10 (Central News Agency, foreign reports) â€“ Denmark announced today that it will spend 27.4 billion Danish kroner, which is about 4.26 billion US dollars. This money will be used to make its military stronger in the Arctic region. Denmark also plans to buy 16 more F-35 fighter jets. This decision comes after the United States criticized how Denmark defends Greenland, which is a big island that partly controls itself.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Denmark's Minister of Defense, Troels Lund Poulsen, told the media that Denmark will buy another 16 F-35 fighter jets. These will be added to the 27 American-made F-35s they already promised to buy. The new jets will cost about 29 billion Danish kroner. This shows that Denmark really wants to keep making its defense stronger.</p>
            <p>Poulsen said, "These investments are needed at a difficult time when war has sadly started again in Europe."</p>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump once said he wanted to take control of Greenland. He believed that Greenland is very important for US military defense and for systems that warn about missiles. He also said that the shortest way to fly from Europe to North America goes over Greenland.</p>
            <p>Both the governments of Denmark and Greenland said no to giving up the island. Greenland is a very large island with many natural resources. The Danish government has admitted that in the past, they did not pay enough attention to how important Greenland is for military reasons.</p>
