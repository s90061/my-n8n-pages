            <h1>Actor Li Liren: I Drove a Taxi for a Year After Starting My Career and Always Feel I Need to Be Ready</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hung Su-chin, Taipei, August 1st) Actor Li Liren is in a TV show called "Saturday Sunday." In the show, he meets his first love again and his business fails. This story shows a very real part of life. He shared that he drove a taxi for one year before and after he started acting. He also had times when he had no acting jobs. He said, "For the past 20 years, I have always felt that I need to be ready for problems."</p>
            <p>Li Liren has shown great acting in both movies and TV shows. In the TV show "Saturday Sunday," he meets his first love again, and his business fails. This part of the story made him think about his own life. Recently, he talked to the "Central News Agency." Li Liren said that before and after he started acting, he also worked as a taxi driver for one year. He explained, "Because I had to go to class during the day, I couldn't work. I also had to take care of my mother, so I drove a taxi at night." At that time, Li Liren only thought about earning money and taking care of his mother.</p>
            <p>Li Liren has been acting for almost 30 years. He said that even now, he still feels like he needs to be ready for problems. "I always feel it's not enough, like I can still do better. This is true for my work success and the money I earn. I still want to get more."</p>
            <p>Now, Li Liren does not put money first. When he chooses a job, he also thinks about if he can act the role well. These are important things Li Liren considers when taking a job. "I think the money for acting now cannot compare to before. If you can enjoy the feeling of doing well in acting, that will make you happier."</p>
            <p>During the talk, Li Liren suddenly asked, "What is a good actor?" For Li Liren, anyone who has been married for more than 10 years is a good actor. "Why do I say this? It's very hard to keep a marriage going. If you are good for 10 years, how many times have you 'acted' during that time?" Li Liren's idea of "acting" does not mean lying to the other person, but giving your true effort. "In life, you must 'act' for your husband's parents. I also have to 'act' for my own parents, and for her family. So, if you've been married for more than 10 years, you are a good actor."</p>
            <p>Speaking of family, Li Liren and Tao Ching-ying have been married for many years and have two children. Their family life is happy and has no secrets. He even asked his children about the topic of "coming out." Li Liren said, "I think no matter if you like people of the opposite sex or the same sex, children want their family's support for everything they do. So you need to tell me, then I will know how to support you." He has an open and clear way of teaching his children.</p>
            <p>Li Liren also shared that he and Tao Ching-ying openly talked about their first loves. He admitted that he didn't know how to be in love before, and he always felt sad about his first love. A few years after they broke up, Li Liren went back to find his first love. He didn't go for anything else, he just wanted to know if she was doing well. "It was like seeing an old friend, that's all. After going through those young years, I felt very sorry for her."</p>

            <h1>US Lowers Tariffs on Cambodia to 19%, Hun Manet Calls it the Best News</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Phnom Penh, August 1st, by foreign wires) Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet today was happy about the 19% trade tariff announced by US President Trump. He called the drop from 36% to 19% "good news" for Cambodia.</p>
            <p>News from the Associated Press and AFP says that Hun Manet posted on social media. He said that after almost a week of fighting between Cambodia's and Thailand's armies, Trump not only helped them agree to stop fighting but also helped Cambodia's economy by lowering tariffs.</p>
            <p>Hun Manet said on Facebook, "This is the best news for the people and economy of Cambodia. It will help Cambodia keep growing its economy."</p>
            <p>Donald Trump had threatened to put equal tariffs on many trade partners in early April. He wanted to change global trade to be better for the US. He had said he would put a 49% equal tariff on Cambodia. But this rate was lowered to 36% in July.</p>
            <p>Trump approved high equal tariffs for many countries on July 31st, US Eastern Time. This rule will start in the next week.</p>
            <p>Cambodia is a main place where Western brands make cheap clothes. In 2024, Cambodia sent about 10 billion US dollars worth of goods to the US, and most of this was clothing. Many factories in Cambodia are owned by Chinese companies. The White House says that Cambodia lets Chinese goods go through Cambodia before being sold to the US. This helps these goods avoid the higher US tariffs on China.</p>

            <h1>Machine Tool and Machinery Associations Say: We Hope the Government Keeps Working with the US for the Best Outcome</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chung Jung-feng, Taipei, August 1st) The US announced that the temporary tariff rate for Taiwan will be 20%. The Machinery Association said this morning that this will affect the machinery industry more than expected. The association suggests that the government should continue to talk and work with the US at a national level. They hope to get a tariff rate similar to what competitor countries have. They also suggest controlling the exchange rate to protect their industry's ability to compete around the world.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Machine Tool & Accessory Builders' Association (TMBA) also sent out a press release at noon. It said that before, the tariff on machine tools from Taiwan to the US was about 2% to 5%, and for parts, it was about 8%. The association thanked the government for actively helping the industry with tariff talks. However, the temporary result is still higher than the 15% tariff for competitor countries like Japan and South Korea on goods sent to the US. They hope that the government can quickly finish talks with the US through diplomatic ways to get the best benefits for Taiwan's industries.</p>
            <p>The White House announced that the temporary tariff rate for Taiwan is 20%. President Lai Ching-te said today that the US first announced a "temporary tariff rate" of 20% for Taiwan. If an agreement is reached later, the tariff rate could be lowered again.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry sent out a statement this morning. It said that compared to the 15% tariff rate for competitor countries like Japan and South Korea, the 20% tariff from the US on Taiwan will greatly hurt the machinery industry. It will also continue to affect Taiwan's ability to compete in machinery exports around the world.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association pointed out that recently, companies have been losing money because the exchange rate for the New Taiwan Dollar is stronger than for competitor countries. This has made it harder to compete for export orders. The association said that after the tariffs were announced, it might cause international supply chains to move. This could lead to small and medium-sized supply chains in Taiwan shrinking and breaking.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association suggests that the government should continue to talk and work with the US at a national level. They hope to get a tariff rate similar to what competitor countries have. They also suggest controlling the exchange rate to help the machinery industry stay competitive around the world and keep its operations in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>About tariffs, the Machinery Association said that the machinery industry has long been concerned about the difference in tariffs with Japan and South Korea. The newest result shows that Taiwan's tariff is still 5% higher than Japan and South Korea. This affects the machinery industry more than expected. They suggest that the government continues to talk and work with the US. They hope to lower the tariffs on Taiwan. If it cannot be lower than Japan and South Korea, they at least hope it can be the same.</p>
            <p>About the exchange rate, the Machinery Association said that the exchange rate is still important for the machinery industry to compete in exports. Data shows that from 2021 to July 31st this year, the New Taiwan Dollar only went down in value by 4.6%. The Japanese Yen went down by 46.2%, and the Korean Won went down by 28%. In the past, Taiwan's equipment was 20% to 30% cheaper than Japan's, but this price difference is now gone. This has caused serious harm to machinery equipment exports, especially for companies that stay in Taiwan and mainly export. It is also the main reason for fewer orders.</p>
            <p>The Machinery Association also said that the machinery industry has been greatly hurt recently. It especially needs money and policy support from the government. They suggest the government creates special loan plans (not the original loan limit, but extra money) to help companies with their cash flow. The Machinery Association also asks banks not to stop helping when times are tough. They should consider making loan periods longer and allowing delayed payments to reduce the pressure on companies. Also, they suggest the government increases local spending and helps local manufacturing industries to improve. They encourage local manufacturing industries to replace old equipment with new and use equipment made in Taiwan. They also suggest giving full subsidies for new purchases. This would help manufacturing industries improve and also keep Taiwan's machinery industry groups and related supply chains alive.</p>
