            <h1>Federal Reserve Governor Steps Down as Trump Asks for Lower Interest Rates</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 1st (Central News Agency) â€“ The US central bank, called the Federal Reserve (Fed), said today that Governor Adriana Kugler will leave her job next week. This gives President Trump a chance to pick a new person for the Fed's board. He has been pushing for interest rates to be lowered.</p>
            <p>News from Agence France-Presse says that Ms. Kugler was made a Fed governor in 2023 by former President Biden. She did not say why she is leaving now.</p>
            <p>Ms. Kugler's time in the job was supposed to end in January 2026. But she is leaving early next week. This gives Trump a chance to choose someone new for the Fed's leaders sooner than expected.</p>
            <p>This change in staff happens as the Fed is getting more pressure from Trump. He has been criticizing the head of the Fed, Jerome Powell, for not lowering interest rates yet.</p>
            <p>The Fed said that Ms. Kugler plans to go back to Georgetown University this year to be a professor.</p>
