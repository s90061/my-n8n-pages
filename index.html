            <h1>Past Donation of Tarpaulins Criticized as Political Interference in Schools; Vice President: "Fighting for the People of Hualien"</h1>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim gave large tarpaulins to schools when she ran for legislator in Hualien in 2016. The Hualien County Government said this was politics getting involved in schools. Last night, she said she felt many emotions about this old event. She now understands she was never alone. Many Hualien citizens are still working hard for Hualien. She said, "We are fighting for the people of Hualien. Keep going!"</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Liberty Times newspaper reported that Hualien County Councilor Hu Ren-shun of the Democratic Progressive Party said Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim gave large sign tarpaulins used for her campaign to schools in 2016 when she was running for legislator in Hualien. But the Hualien County Government criticized this, saying it was "political power entering schools."</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao wrote on Threads late last night that she felt many emotions after seeing this news. She said it was an old story from after the 2016 election. At that time, her simple and good intention to reuse materials caused problems for the schools. She felt sad then. But looking back, she said it was a normal part of her work in Hualien for many years.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said she learned a lot from this hard experience. She said her life has now moved to a new chapter.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that besides her picture on the tarpaulin, it also said "Fighting for the people of Hualien." She now understands she was never alone because many Hualien citizens "are still working hard for their hometown and for a better Hualien. Keep going!"</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Dashu Heshanshan Solar Power Project: Business Owner, Engineer Held by Court</h1>
            <p>(Kaohsiung, July 23, Central News Agency) The Dashu Heshanshan solar power project in Kaohsiung has caused problems. A business owner named Lin and an engineer named Wu, who was in charge of the soil and water conservation plan, were held by the court. After a court hearing today, the court decided to keep both of them in custody and not allow them to see visitors. This is because their statements did not fully explain everything, and other people involved have not yet been caught.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou District Court explained that Mr. Lin only admitted to some parts of the crime. He is suspected of breaking important laws like the Slope Land Conservation and Utilization Act and the Soil and Water Conservation Act. His statements about the solar power project's soil and water conservation plan are different from what other accused people said. Mr. Wu, on the other hand, said he did not commit the crime. He is also suspected of breaking important laws, and his statements about the plan seem to hide some facts.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou court said the judge considered that other people involved in the crime have not yet been caught. The judge believes that Mr. Lin and Mr. Wu might work together with these people. After looking at all the facts, the judge decided that both men need to be held in custody and cannot see visitors or send messages.</p>
            <p>The Dashu Heshanshan solar power project in Kaohsiung was built illegally. They dug too much and did not follow soil and water conservation rules. Because of this, their building permit was canceled. The Energy Administration and other groups asked them to remove the illegal parts and return the land to its original state. In June, the Kaohsiung City Government asked the Qiaotou District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. The prosecutors looked at related documents and brought in the people involved for questioning. After questioning, Mr. Lin and Mr. Wu were held by the court. Three employees from companies working with them were released on bail, each paying between NT$80,000 and NT$100,000.</p>
