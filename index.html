            <h1>National Guard Enters Washington D.C., Trump Announces He Will Patrol Streets With Military and Police at Night</h1>
            <p>After President Trump sent the National Guard to Washington, D.C. last week, he said today that he will patrol the streets of Washington with the military and police tonight.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump spoke on a radio show with Todd Starnes, a reporter for Newsmax, a conservative news outlet. He said, "I think I will go out tonight with the police, and of course, the military."</p>
            <p>Trump used his power as president to send a thousand National Guard members and federal agents to Washington. He said he did this because of a lot of violent crime in the city. This was an unusual step.</p>
            <p>However, officials in Washington D.C. did not agree with Trump's statement. They showed official numbers from both the federal government and the city. These numbers showed that violent crime has gone down a lot since it increased in 2023.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, when U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looked at the National Guard at Union Station in Washington, people protested loudly and made fun of them.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu: Start Gaza Ceasefire Talks, End War, Release Hostages</h1>
            <p>Today, Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said that Israel will start talks right away. They will ask Hamas to free all the people held hostage in Gaza. He also said they want to end the war, which has lasted almost two years, under conditions that Israel can accept.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Netanyahu spoke to soldiers in Gaza. He said he is meeting with military leaders to approve plans to take Gaza City and defeat Hamas, a Palestinian group.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu stated, "I have given instructions now to start talks immediately to free all hostages and end the war under conditions that Israel can accept." He added that Israel is currently making decisions.</p>
            <p>Even though many countries have spoken against it, the Israeli army continued to put pressure on Gaza City today. Yesterday, the army called up 60,000 reserve soldiers. This means that the Israeli government is getting ready to take over Gaza City.</p>
            <p>Hamas has agreed to a new plan for a temporary ceasefire. However, the Israeli government has not yet officially replied to this. Because it might take weeks to call up tens of thousands of reserve soldiers, this gives people trying to help peace talks time to bring both sides closer.</p>
            <p>This new plan asks for a 60-day ceasefire. Hamas would release 10 hostages held in Gaza and return the bodies of 18 people who died. In return, Israel would free about 200 Palestinian prisoners who have been held for a long time.</p>
            <p>The Israeli government had said that the remaining 50 hostages in Gaza must be released all at once, and right away. Israeli officials believe about 20 of these hostages are still alive.</p>
