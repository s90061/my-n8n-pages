https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/27/is-ai-coming-for-our-photos-the-rise-of-ai-photo-editing-and-what-it-means-for-consumers

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we edit our photos. AI tools can now do much more than just fix small mistakes in pictures. They can remove unwanted objects, add new things into a scene, or even change a photo completely. This technology is becoming very common and is even included in our smartphones and popular photo apps. For everyday users, AI makes photo editing easier and more creative, allowing people to make their pictures look perfect with just a few taps. However, this new ability also brings concerns. Some people worry about privacy, as AI might learn too much from our images. There are also worries about whether photos can still be trusted when AI can make them look real even if they are not. As AI photo editing grows, we need to think about how it affects what we see and share online.

**More Companies Asking Employees Back to the Office**

https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/22/success/return-to-office-hybrid-mandates/index.html

After a few years of many people working from home, more companies are now asking their employees to return to the office. This is a big change from the fully remote work models that became popular during the pandemic. Businesses are deciding to bring staff back, at least part-time, for several reasons. Many leaders believe that being in the office helps with better teamwork and communication. They also feel it creates a stronger company culture and makes it easier for new ideas to form. Some managers also think that working together in person can lead to more creativity and better problem-solving. This shift means that fewer jobs will be completely remote in the future, and more companies will choose a hybrid model, where employees work some days in the office and some days at home.

**European Cities Are Setting New Rules for Tourists**

https://www.euronews.com/travel/2024/05/14/europe-travel-popular-cities-cracking-down-on-tourist-behaviour

Many popular cities in Europe are starting to put new rules in place to manage the large number of tourists. Places like Rome, Venice, and Amsterdam are very beautiful, but they can get very crowded, which sometimes causes problems for local residents and historical sites. To protect their cities, local authorities are now taking action against bad tourist behavior. For example, some cities are fining people for littering, climbing on monuments, or swimming in famous fountains. Venice has even introduced an entry fee for day-trippers during busy times to control crowds. The aim of these new rules is to encourage visitors to respect the city and its people, ensuring that these wonderful places remain enjoyable for everyone, both locals and tourists.`;
