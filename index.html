            <h1>Taiwan Wins Little League World Series After 29 Years, Playing Perfectly Against USA</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan team played almost perfectly in pitching, hitting, and defense at the Little League World Series today. They did not let the American team score any points and won the championship with a score of 7 to 0. This is the first time Taiwan has won the Little League World Series since 1996.</p>
            <p>The Little League World Series championship game was held on August 24. The Taiwan team, which won the international group, and the American team, which won the American group, played against each other for the top prize for the second year in a row.</p>
            <p>The team that won the international group was the Taiwan team, made up of players from Dongyuan Elementary School in Taipei. They won all four games in their group. The American group champion was the Rocky Mountain team, representing six states: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the first inning, Lin Jin-tse, the strong pitcher from Dongyuan Little League, started the game. The fielders quickly caught three batters out. In the second part of the first inning, Tsai Yu-ko and Chang Chun-po hit the ball well. Liu Wei-heng got to base because of a wild pitch, filling the bases, but they did not score any runs.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the second inning, the American team could not get on base. In the second part of the second inning, the American pitcher, Luke D'Ambrosio, threw several wild pitches. Jian Zi-de ran the bases smartly and scored a run.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the third inning, American batters still could not get past Lin Jin-tse's fast pitches and strong defense. In the second part of the third inning, Chen Shih-jung hit the ball, and because of a wild pitch and a throwing error by the other team, he ran home and scored. Taiwan was now leading 2 to 0.</p>
            <p>In the second part of the fourth inning, Lai Yu-han got to third base but could not score.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the fifth inning, the American team finally got a player on base, but they still could not score. In the second part of the fifth inning, D'Ambrosio threw all his pitches. Jayden Lee came in to pitch for the American team. With two players on base, Lin Jin-tse hit a ground ball to third base. The American team made a fielding mistake, and the Taiwan team scored 5 more runs, taking a big lead of 7 to 0.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the sixth inning, Chen Qi-sheng came in to pitch. The young Taiwanese players played strong defense. The American team still could not score any runs, and the game ended early. The Taiwan team won the championship 7 to 0 because there was a big difference in skill between the two teams.</p>

            <h1>US Vice President Says Russia Has Made Big Steps in Ukraine Peace Talks</h1>
            <p>US Vice President Vance has said that Russia has made "significant concessions" in talks to end the war with Ukraine. Even though it is not clear when the fighting will stop, he is hopeful about the progress.</p>
            <p>Regarding the Russia-Ukraine war, President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska this month. Vance stated in a pre-recorded interview that was broadcast today that Trump has been working hard and actively with both Moscow and Kyiv to find a compromise and stop the killing.</p>
            <p>Trump wants the Ukrainian and Russian presidents to talk directly. However, both countries blame each other for not making these talks happen.</p>
            <p>While Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Western countries are trying to "block" peace talks, Vance was more friendly towards Russia, saying that Moscow was not trying to trick Trump.</p>
            <p>Vance told NBC's "Meet the Press" program: "I believe that for the first time in this three-and-a-half-year conflict, Russia has made important concessions to President Trump."</p>
            <p>"They have shown that they are willing to be flexible on some of their main demands."</p>
            <p>Vance said that Moscow has stepped back and "agreed that Ukraine will keep its land whole after the war." But he did not clearly say if Ukraine would keep the same borders it had before Russia attacked.</p>
            <p>He also stressed that Russia has "agreed that they cannot put a puppet government in Kyiv."</p>
            <p>He added: "Again, have they made all the concessions? Of course not. But we are making progress."</p>
            <p>Vance said that Washington will keep working to make sure Ukraine is safe. He also said that "the President has already made it clear that no American troops will be directly in Ukraine."</p>

            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: Working for Fair Tariffs Without Adding Them, Agreement to Be Sent to Congress</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai will give a report to the Legislative Yuan today about the trade talks between Taiwan and the US. In his written report, he said that Taiwan wants to get better and fair tariff rates. They also want to discuss Article 232 at the same time and try not to add new tariffs on top of existing ones. If an agreement is made, the full text of the agreement will be sent to the Congress for review.</p>
            <p>The US has started its matching tariffs, and Taiwan's temporary rate is 20%. Premier Cho Jung-tai will go to the Legislative Yuan today to give a report on "The Progress, Policy, Principles, and Impact Assessment of Taiwan-US Tariff Negotiations on Taiwan's Industries" and answer questions.</p>
            <p>Regarding how the matching tariffs are calculated, Premier Cho stated in his written report that the US announced on April 2 and July 31 that the calculation method is "existing tariffs on products imported to the US" plus "matching tariffs." "Existing tariffs on products imported to the US" means the US's most favored nation (MFN) tariffs for all countries. Currently, only the European Union has a different way of calculating because it has already reached an agreement with the US.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-tai said that based on 2024 statistics, the value of US imports from Taiwan was 112.86 billion US dollars for industrial products and 890 million US dollars for agricultural products. The average existing tariff rate for all Taiwanese products imported to the US is 3.3%.</p>
            <p>Regarding non-tariff issues that the US annual trade barrier report brought up about Taiwan, Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan will follow the rule of protecting public health. Taiwan will also find a balance that fits scientific proof, international rules, and international trade rules. Also, Taiwan and the US largely agree on making supply chains stronger, especially regarding illegal transshipments. Both Taiwan and the US are working together to stop companies from falsely claiming where products come from. They are also discussing how to improve controls on high-tech goods exports and investment safety.</p>
            <p>For purchasing, Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan and the US want to buy more agricultural and industrial products like soybeans, corn, wheat, oil, and natural gas from the US. This is because both sides care about food security and energy security. For investments, Taiwan and US industries have worked well together for a long time. In recent years, investment between Taiwan and the US has grown a lot. Both sides believe that more investment can help them grow together and create the best environment for promoting and making cross-border investments easier.</p>
            <p>Regarding the US Trade Expansion Act, Section 232, Cho Jung-tai said that the next goals for talks will be to get better and fairer matching tariffs. They also want to discuss Article 232 at the same time. During the process of reaching a matching tariff agreement, they will also try hard to make sure new tariffs are not added on top of existing ones.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-tai also said that if an agreement is reached with the US in the future, the government team will fully explain the agreement to Congress and the public right away. They will also send the full text of the agreement to Congress for review and provide an assessment of the impacts.</p>
            <p>Regarding the impact assessment, Cho Jung-tai said that the US announced on July 31 that Taiwan's matching tariffs would be lowered from 32% to 20%. After asking a think tank to calculate, the impact on Taiwan's exports, output, GDP, and jobs is about 50% less than the impact assessed in early April. Also, as of August 15, 73 businesses and 2,388 people had reported being affected by tariffs and had to reduce work hours or close temporarily. These were mainly in industries like machinery manufacturing, metal manufacturing, other transportation equipment like rail vehicles, aircraft, electric scooters, and their parts. Cho Jung-tai said that the Executive Yuan has told all government departments to provide necessary support to affected industries by moving resources where they are needed most. To support industries, the Executive Yuan approved a revised draft of the "Special Act for Strengthening Economic, Social, and Livelihood National Resilience in Response to International Situations" on August 14. This draft has been sent to the Legislative Yuan for review, and they hope lawmakers will support it.</p>
