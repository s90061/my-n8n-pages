**Taiwanese Boxer Gan Chia-wei Loses First Match at WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing Event**

Taipei, June 30 (CNA) â€“ Today, at the WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing competition, Taiwan's boxer Gan Chia-wei lost his first match in the men's 70 kg category. He was defeated by Hitesh from India with a score of 0-5 and is now out of the competition.

The WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing tournament is organized by World Boxing (WB) and gives points for world rankings. This year, over 400 athletes from 31 countries are taking part. There are 10 different weight classes for both men and women.

Gan Chia-wei, a good male boxer who represented Taiwan in the Paris Olympics, faced Hitesh from India in his first 70 kg match. In the first round, Gan Chia-wei was very active and pushed his opponent to the ropes many times. However, halfway through the round, Gan Chia-wei had some gaps in his defense, and his opponent attacked. At the end of the first round, only 3 judges gave Gan Chia-wei 10 points.

In the second round, the situation changed. Hitesh from India attacked steadily and with good rhythm. Gan Chia-wei was at a disadvantage in many exchanges. At the end of the second round, all 5 judges gave the Indian boxer 10 points. In the third round, Gan Chia-wei tried to fight back, but his punches were not smooth, and he could not hit his opponent well. Again, all 5 judges gave Hitesh 10 points. In the end, Gan Chia-wei lost with a score of 0-5.

Before going to Kazakhstan, Gan Chia-wei had just participated in the National Games boxing qualification rounds and was in good condition. It's a pity he was eliminated in the first round of the WB Cup Kazakhstan Boxing competition. Taiwan sent 7 athletes to this competition.
