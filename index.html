            <h1>Lin Chia-cheng Joins Independent League Blue Crabs, Former Team of Wang Chien-ming's Return to MLB</h1>
            <p>Lin Chia-cheng, a good baseball player from Taiwan, was released by his team last week. Today, he announced that he will play for the Blue Crabs, a team in an independent league. Ten years ago, the famous player Wang Chien-ming also played for this team. He returned to Major League Baseball the next year.</p>
            <p>After waiting for one week, Lin Chia-cheng announced on social media today that he has joined the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in the Atlantic League.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-cheng flew to join the team on the 4th. Today, he played as the second batter in an away game in North Carolina.</p>
            <p>The Southern Maryland Blue Crabs' home is in Waldorf, Maryland, on the East Coast of the United States. This will be Lin Chia-cheng's new home for the next month or so. He will stay ready to play for the rest of the season, hoping to get attention from American professional baseball teams.</p>
            <p>People generally think that the Atlantic League is as good as Minor League 2A or 3A. Many players in this league have played in 3A or Major League Baseball. Also, some new players who were released from Minor League teams come here to try to improve. Wang Chien-ming, a famous retired pitcher from Taiwan, played for the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs in 2015.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Wang Chien-ming was 35 years old. He started that year playing for the Braves' 3A team. On June 19, the Braves released him. Four days later, he joined the Blue Crabs in the Atlantic League. That year, he said, "Pitchers who have been injured need to work twice as hard." His strong spirit touched many fans.</p>
            <p>That year, Wang Chien-ming pitched well in three games for the Blue Crabs. The Seattle Mariners liked him and signed him to their Minor League 3A team. The next year, he got a chance to return and played in Major League Baseball for the Royals. After working hard for three years, he played in 38 more Major League games.</p>

            <h1>Unboxing Old Photos: The Integration of Life Line 1995 Hotline</h1>
            <p>When news talks about cases related to suicide, they often add a warning at the end. This warning tells readers to pay attention to their feelings and offers help for mental health. One of these is the "1995" Life Line counseling service. It started from the "Suicide Prevention Center" at MacKay Memorial Hospital.</p>
            <p>In 1969, MacKay Memorial Hospital started the Suicide Prevention Center. It gave immediate help to people in emergency situations related to suicide. On July 1st of the same year, the center worked with the Taipei North Rotary Club to start the "Life Line." They opened two phone lines, "514242" and "514343," to offer mental health counseling. This was the first organization in Asia to prevent suicide by phone counseling. Later, it became an example for countries like Japan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>The Life Line works because trained volunteers help. In the beginning, local groups were started in places like Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Hsinchu, and Pingtung. To make the service the same everywhere and to connect better with international groups, the "International Life Line Association Republic of China" was started on April 15, 1977. This group was in charge of managing the work of all the local associations.</p>
            <p>In earlier years, the phone numbers used by Life Lines in different cities and counties were not all the same. Most of them had the last four digits as "9595" (which sounds like "save me, save me" in Chinese). But because local phone numbers were different lengths, from 6 to 8 digits, it was hard to remember and dial quickly. So, in 1998, with help from the Ministry of Transportation and Chunghwa Telecom, the Life Line general association worked to combine the phone numbers. On August 10, they held a press conference. They announced that the national Life Line would use one 4-digit number, "1995." This number sounds like "want to save me" in Chinese. This makes it easier for people to call for help. They hope to give mental support as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Value life. Suicide cannot solve problems. There is always a way out in life. If you need advice or help, you can call the Ministry of Health and Welfare's special line "1925," the Life Line's special line "1995," or the Teacher Chang service line "1980."</p>

            <h1>Trump Forms 2028 Olympics Working Group, Committee Chairman Invites Him to Carry Torch</h1>
            <p>Today, U.S. President Trump announced that he has created a special White House group for the 2028 Summer Olympics. This group will use the power of the federal government to make sure the Olympics happen smoothly. When Casey Wasserman, the head of the organizing committee, spoke, he asked Trump to carry the Olympic torch. Trump smiled and nodded.</p>
            <p>Today in Washington D.C., Trump signed an official order. He and Casey Wasserman, the head of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic organizing committee, spoke one after another.</p>
            <p>Many government leaders were there, showing that the federal government supports the Los Angeles Olympics. These leaders included U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Trump said that the U.S. team has been number one in medals at the Summer Olympics for eight times in a row. The U.S. also has the most gold medals in the Summer Olympics, three times more than the country in second place. He believes that the U.S. team will win the most medals again in 2028.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the 2026 World Cup will be held in the U.S. Also, 2028 is the 250th birthday of the United States. He said that this is the best time to be an American sports fan, and 2028 will be a very special year in American history.</p>
            <p>Casey Wasserman, the head of the Los Angeles Olympic organizing committee, spoke and thanked the federal government for its support. He said that the Trump government has approved important money for security. This money will be given to local, state, and federal groups for security plans to make sure the Olympics are safe.</p>
            <p>Wasserman's presentation mentioned that about 150 world leaders will visit Los Angeles. More than 10,000 Olympic athletes and 4,500 Paralympic athletes will compete. Millions of people across the U.S. are expected to come and watch the games.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Olympic torch relay went through 38 states in the U.S. Wasserman said that for these Olympics, they will do something new: the torch will go through all 50 states. He directly invited Trump, saying, "Mr. President, if you would like to run along Park Avenue again and remember history, we would be very happy to have you."</p>
            <p>Before the 2004 Athens Olympics, Trump was a torchbearer. He ran on Park Avenue in New York as part of the torch relay.</p>
