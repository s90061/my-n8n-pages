            <h1>Golden Eagle Lecture Series Starts in September to Train Financial Professionals</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance and National Chengchi University's Finance Department announced today that they will start the "Golden Eagle Lecture" series of courses in September. This program will continue the teaching ideas of Hou Chin-ying, who is 95 years old and known as the "Godmother of Taiwan Finance" and is the chairperson of Far Eastern International Bank. The goal is to keep training financial professionals.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance held an event to celebrate the start of the Golden Eagle Lecture series tonight at the Far Eastern Shangri-La Hotel in Taipei. Teachers and former students from Chengchi University's Finance Department gathered together. Yang Chin-long, the governor of the Central Bank, who was a student of Hou Chin-ying when she taught at Chengchi University's Banking Department (now the Finance Department), sent his good wishes in writing and gave her a glassçºªå¿µ plaque to show his respect.</p>
            <p>Jiang Yong-yu, the head of the Chengchi University Finance Department Alumni Association, said in his speech that Hou Chin-ying helped plan and set up the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance in 1995, which built a strong foundation for financial education. After she became the chairperson of Far Eastern International Bank in 2008, she continued to show great vision and leadership. Now, the Golden Eagle Lecture series is being created to honor her dedication and impact on financial education.</p>
            <p>Chen Su-tien, the former chairperson of Taiwan Life Insurance, said that Hou Chin-ying has always paid close attention to details and worked very hard in education and in her job. She not only taught with words but also by example, which greatly influenced many generations of students.</p>
            <p>The Chengchi University Finance Department said that the Golden Eagle Lecture series will carry on the friendships among the alumni of the Finance Department and its mission to educate in finance. The courses will combine academic knowledge, practical skills, and social contexts, becoming an important link between financial education and the industry.</p>

            <h1>Pixel 10 Review: Experts Say TSMC Process Makes AI More Practical</h1>
            <p>Google's new Pixel 10 phone series went on sale in Taiwan today. After testing, experts in 3C technology found that the new phone uses chips made by TSMC. This makes the artificial intelligence (AI) functions much more useful. This helps Google keep its lead in AI. In the future, Android phone brands will be more willing to use Google's AI services, which will give users a smoother and more consistent experience.</p>
            <p>The Pixel 10 series has a new Tensor G5 processor, made with TSMC's 3-nanometer technology. This is Google's biggest improvement for its own chips ever. It allows for over 20 different AI services on the phone. The G5's different processing parts work much faster, with the main processor (CPU) being about 34% quicker on average.</p>
            <p>Yi Ge, the editor-in-chief of the YouTube channel "Yi Ge's Tech Life," told CNA that AI features have been developing for 2-3 years. They often affect if people want to buy a new phone. But most users don't think about how cool AI features are; they think about how useful they are.</p>
            <p>After testing the Pixel 10, Yi Ge found three main things to note. First, Google's engineering team in Taiwan is the biggest outside of the U.S. Many AI features are tested in Taiwan, so they are available there as soon as they are launched.</p>
            <p>Second, Yi Ge said that in the past, Pixel phone users often complained about the phones getting too hot. Now, because the Pixel 10's chips are from TSMC, it did not get hot during testing and worked very smoothly.</p>
            <p>Also, Yi Ge mentioned that the Pixel 10 series, even the standard model, has three cameras and the full-power G5 chip, but the price has not increased. This makes it easier for people to buy. Even if some parts are not as good as other phones, AI can make up for it. For example, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has 100x zoom. After taking a photo, AI identifies the scene and improves the image. This takes about 3 to 5 seconds, but the result is amazing.</p>
            <p>Yi Ge also noticed that the Pixel 10's battery lasts much longer. Last year, the Pixel 9 standard model almost ran out of battery by afternoon. This year, the Pixel 10 can last all day until you get home without problems.</p>
            <p>A reporter tested the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It has a matte glass back and polished metal sides. It feels light and balanced. Both the fingerprint sensor and face unlock are very fast, and apps open quickly. This matches what you expect from a top-level phone.</p>
            <p>Using the Geekbench 6 test for performance, the Pixel 10 Pro XL's CPU scored 2302 for single-core and 6248 for multi-core. This is more than a 30% improvement from the previous Pixel 9 series, close to the official claim of a 34% CPU performance increase.</p>
            <p>When testing the 100x zoom on a teddy bear at home, the phone first needed to download an AI image model. After AI improved the image, the text on the tag, which was hard to see, became very clear. However, the word "miffy" on the tag was a little twisted. We hope this can be fixed with future software updates.</p>
            <p>The reporter also tested the "Photo Guidance" feature. You just press the button in the top right corner of the camera app to start it. The AI scans the scene and gives several ideas for themes, such as "Get Inspired," "Dolls on the Sofa," "Learning Corner by the Window," or "Study Supplies on the Desk." After choosing a theme, the AI gives text instructions, like "Move the camera to the left to avoid cutting off the desk and make the picture more complete," to help users take better photos.</p>
            <p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL's main camera can also take portrait photos with 50 million pixels. Testing showed that details around hair, depth estimation, and separating subjects from the background are much better. There are no unnatural blurry edges. (Edited by Yang Kai-hsiang) 1140828</p>

            <h1>Rogo Settles Down After Home Run, Brothers Beat Monkeys; Coach Says Hsieh Jung-hao Needs to Improve</h1>
            <p>In today's CPBL game at Taipei Dome, CTBC Brothers pitcher Nivaldo RodrÃ­guez (Rogo) gave up a home run in the first inning but still pitched six good innings. The Brothers eventually won 8-6 against the Rakuten Monkeys. However, manager Hirokazu Hirano said that closer Wu Chun-wei had to come in during the 9th inning, and Hsieh Jung-hao needs to think about his performance.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 1st inning, the Monkeys scored first when Lin Cheng-fei hit a 3-run home run. But in the bottom of the 2nd inning, the Brothers sent 10 batters to the plate. After Hsu Chi-hung got a walk, Chang Chih-hao, Yueh Tung-hua, Chiang Kun-yu, Kao Yu-chieh, and Wang Wei-chen all got hits, scoring 5 runs to take the lead. Wang Wei-chen hit a 2-run single that put them ahead when the score was tied.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chi-hung of the Brothers hit a 2-run home run in the bottom of the 7th inning, his 16th of the season. They added another run in the bottom of the 8th. In the top of the 9th, Brothers pitcher Hsieh Jung-hao left the game with the bases loaded, forcing Wu Chun-wei, the closer, to come in. Although Chen Chen-wei hit a 2-run single and then a wild pitch gave up another run, the Brothers still won 8-6, giving the Monkeys their third straight loss.</p>
            <p>After the game, Brothers manager Hirokazu Hirano said directly that in the 9th inning, because they were leading by 5 runs, he wanted to save closer Wu Chun-wei. But in the end, Wu still had to pitch. "Jung-hao needs to reflect on this. Especially as an experienced veteran, he's had more situations like this this year. If there were competitors, he might not even be on the first team."</p>
            <p>Brothers starting pitcher Nivaldo RodrÃ­guez (Rogo) threw 98 pitches over 6 innings in this game. He gave up 5 hits, including Lin Cheng-fei's home run in the first inning. He walked 1 batter and struck out 4, giving up 3 runs. This was a good start, and he got his 9th win of the season, his first in almost a month. He was also named the MVP of the game.</p>
            <p>Hirano said that Rogo did not get much help from his offense in several games, but today the fielders successfully helped Rogo score runs. Especially Yueh Tung-hua was concerned about an error he made during Rogo's last start. "Tung-hua helped the starting pitcher a lot today, both offensively and defensively."</p>
            <p>When asked about Yueh Tung-hua, Rogo said, "He is a very good player. I take off my hat to him. Anything can happen in a game, and no one wants to make an error. The most important thing is to keep moving forward. We are a team, and when a teammate makes an error, we should support him and try to make up for it."</p>
