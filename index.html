            <h1>川普簽行政命令對印度加徵25%關稅 27日起生效</h1>
            <p>The President of the United States, Mr. Trump, signed an order today. This order says that because India buys oil from Russia, either directly or indirectly, the U.S. will add another 25% tax on goods from India. Before this, a 25% tax was already announced. So, goods from India coming to the U.S. will now have a total tax of 50%. This new tax will start on August 27.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Mr. Trump said, "We put a 25% tax on India, but I think I will greatly increase this tax in the next 24 hours because they are buying Russian oil."</p>
            <p>Then, today, Mr. Trump signed the order. It states that because India buys Russian oil directly or indirectly, the U.S. will add a 25% tax on goods from India. With the previous 25% tax, which was supposed to start on August 7, Indian goods coming to the U.S. will now face a 50% tax.</p>
            <p>The White House released a list of facts, which confirms that the extra 25% tax on India will begin on August 27.</p>
            <p>Earlier, foreign news reported that on August 4, India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the U.S. and the European Union were "targeting" India because it bought Russian oil. India said these actions were "not fair" and that India would protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>India buys a lot of oil from Russia. This oil is a main source of money for Moscow's military actions in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for more than three years, and there is no sign of it ending soon. Mr. Trump had previously said he would put "secondary tariffs" on countries that continue to trade with Russia, such as China and India.</p>

            <h1>真主黨遭黎巴嫩內閣決定年底前解除武裝 揚言拒服</h1>
            <p>The government of Lebanon held a meeting yesterday and decided that the military should make a plan for Hezbollah to give up their weapons by the end of the year. Hezbollah is a strong group in the country that Iran supports. Today, Hezbollah said they will not follow this decision. They also said the government's decision makes Lebanon weaker.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Lebanon government made this difficult decision yesterday after almost 6 hours of talks. President Joseph Aoun was in charge of the meeting. This happened because of strong pressure from the United States.</p>
            <p>This decision also aims to make real the agreement to stop fighting that Lebanon and Israel made last November. That agreement was meant to end the fighting between Hezbollah and Israel, which lasted for over a year and included two months of full war. After the war, Hezbollah became much weaker. Their weapons were badly damaged, and many of their important leaders were killed.</p>
            <p>Lebanon's Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, announced at a press conference yesterday after the meeting that the government has asked the military to present a plan by the end of the month. This plan will be discussed and approved by the government. The goal is that by the end of the year, only the national army and other state forces will have weapons.</p>
            <p>However, Lebanon's Information Minister, Paul Morcos, said that the Minister of Health, Rakan Nassereldine, who is connected to Hezbollah, and the Minister of Environment, Tamara Elzein, who is connected to Hezbollah's friend "Amal Movement," both left the meeting because they did not agree with the government's decision.</p>
            <p>Hezbollah is the only group in Lebanon that still has weapons after the civil war from 1975 to 1990. They say they keep weapons to fight against Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>
            <p>During the government meeting yesterday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem already said in a TV speech that they would not give up their weapons as long as Israel's attacks do not stop.</p>
            <p>Today, Hezbollah released another statement. They said they will "consider the government's decision as if it does not exist." They also said, "The Salam government's decision to make Lebanon give up its weapons against the Israeli enemy is a big mistake. This hurts Lebanon's power and allows Israel to do whatever it wants regarding safety, land, politics, and its future existence."</p>
            <p>Hezbollah has been the strongest political group in Lebanon for a long time. People who are against them say they use their weapons to force their will in the country's matters. But after recent fights with Israel, Hezbollah's power has become less.</p>
