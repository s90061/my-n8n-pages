            <h1>Japan's 102-year-old sets new record for oldest person to climb Mount Fuji</h1>
            <p>A 102-year-old Japanese man with a serious heart problem has become the oldest person to climb Mount Fuji. But he doesn't think it's a big deal.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Yukichi Akuzawa, born in 1923, climbs mountains almost every week to train. He finally reached the top of Japan's highest mountain.</p>
            <p>He climbed Mount Fuji in early August, and Guinness World Records recognized his achievement.</p>
            <p>Akuzawa told Agence France-Presse, "I am six years older this time than when I climbed it before." He climbed the 3,776-meter-high mountain when he was 96.</p>
            <p>He said, "I've been many times and seen the view from the top. It's nothing special."</p>
            <p>In January, Akuzawa fell while climbing near his home. He then got shingles and was in the hospital because his heart was failing. After that, he started to get ready to climb Mount Fuji.</p>
            <p>His family worried about his health. But his 75-year-old daughter told Agence France-Presse that Akuzawa still wanted to climb. "He got better so quickly that the doctors couldn't believe it."</p>
            <p>Akuzawa took three days to climb Mount Fuji. He stayed in mountain huts for two nights. But the high altitude almost made him give up.</p>
            <p>Akuzawa's daughter said that with help from his companions, including his granddaughter, who is a nurse, he finally reached the top.</p>
            <p>When asked if he wanted to climb Mount Fuji again, Akuzawa strongly said, "No."</p>

            <h1>Japan Political Party Poll: Sanseito Ranks First Among Opposition Parties</h1>
            <p>A new poll from Japanese media shows that the Sanseito party, which is only 5 years old, has 9.9% support. This is the second-highest after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Sanseito, which used the slogan "Japanese First" in the July upper house election, has the most support from people in their 30s and 40s.</p>
            <p>Sankei Shimbun and Fuji News Network (FNN) did a joint poll on party support rates on August 23rd and 24th. It showed that the Liberal Democratic Party had 22.2% support, which was the highest.</p>
            <p>After that, Sanseito had 9.9%, the Democratic Party for the People had 9.3%, the Constitutional Democratic Party had 5.2%, Komeito had 4.2%, Nippon Ishin no Kai had 4.0%, Reiwa Shinsengumi had 3.9%, the Communist Party had 2.8%, the Japan Conservative Party had 2.4%, the Future Party had 1.0%, and the Social Democratic Party had 0.3%.</p>
            <p>Compared to the last poll in July, the Liberal Democratic Party gained 1.2 percentage points this time. Sanseito gained 0.1 percentage points. The Democratic Party for the People lost 4.6 percentage points, and the Constitutional Democratic Party lost 1.6 percentage points. The poll shows that support for the Democratic Party for the People went down, and support for Sanseito went up.</p>
            <p>Let's look at the top three parties with the most support by age group. For people aged 18 to 29, the Democratic Party for the People had 22.1%, Sanseito had 10.6%, and Reiwa Shinsengumi had 6.2%. The Liberal Democratic Party only had 4.1%.</p>
            <p>For people in their 30s, Sanseito had 18.9% support, the Democratic Party for the People had 16.9%, and the Liberal Democratic Party had 9.6%. For people in their 40s, Sanseito had 21.0% support, the Liberal Democratic Party had 15.9%, and the Democratic Party for the People had 11.5%.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Traditional Opera Goes to Osaka Expo, National Flag a Stage Highlight</h1>
            <p>After the "We TAIWAN" event finished, the Ministry of Culture went to Osaka, Japan again. This evening, they performed "Voices of the Island â€“ Temple Opera" for the first time on the Osaka Expo stage. The stage background showed many symbols of Taiwan, like Yushan Mountain and Taipei 101. The national flag was also there.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze, the Deputy Minister of Culture, told the media today that the Ministry of Culture asked to perform under the name "We TAIWAN." The Osaka Expo officials agreed. On their website, you can see the "We TAIWAN" show and its name. She said, "Basically, they respect our performance as a cultural exchange."</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze said that the event's background, the performance, and any words shown during the performance all needed to be checked and approved by the Osaka Expo committee. She said, "Our application process went very smoothly, and we didn't have any problems." The background was designed to show symbols of Taiwan, which "We TAIWAN" represents. So, you can see the Alishan Forest Railway, Tainan Confucius Temple, and "of course, our national flag."</p>
            <p>It took two months just to wait for the application to perform at the Osaka Expo stage to be reviewed. The Osaka Expo also promoted the event on its official website with the full name "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka/Kansai Expo." This means the name "Taiwan" is officially on the Expo's stage. It also marks a new step after the "We TAIWAN" event ended on the 20th. After today's first show, there will be two more performances on the same stage.</p>
            <p>Wang Shih-sze admitted that when the application was approved, "everyone looked at each other with an 'Are you sure?' expression." But since they accepted it, "we are very happy. We also hope that this cultural performance can be recognized by the world."</p>
            <p>"Voices of the Island â€“ Temple Opera" brings together nine groups to perform. It includes songs in Indigenous languages, Hakka, and Taiwanese. Wang Shih-sze said that when she saw the end of the first rehearsal, she almost cried. "Everyone used different languages but sang the same tune. That is what Taiwan is like, and what we hope Taiwan will be like. We can have different languages, but we can all work together to protect our Taiwan."</p>
            <p>The "We TAIWAN" series event, "Voices of the Island â€“ Temple Opera," will perform for three days from today until August 28th. It will be from 5 PM to 6 PM Japan time, at the Pop-Up Stage North in the Yumeshima area of the Expo.</p>
