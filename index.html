            <h1>Sri Lanka's new government arrests former president over corruption</h1>
            <p>Police in Sri Lanka arrested former President Ranil Wickremesinghe today. He was arrested for corruption. This is part of a new government's plan to stop corruption. The new president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, leads this left-wing government. Mr. Wickremesinghe is the highest-ranking opposition member arrested so far.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that President Dissanayake won the election last September. He promised to fight corruption and beat Mr. Wickremesinghe. Now, the country's anti-corruption team is leading this effort.</p>
            <p>A police officer in Sri Lanka told AFP that Mr. Wickremesinghe, who is 76 years old, was questioned. He was asked about a trip to London, England, in September 2023. He went there for a ceremony for his wife at a British university. After questioning, he was taken into custody.</p>
            <p>The police officer also said they accused Mr. Wickremesinghe of using government money for private things. "We will take him to the local judge in Colombo Fort," the officer said.</p>
            <p>Before going to London, Mr. Wickremesinghe went to Havana, the capital of Cuba. He attended the G77 summit there. On his way back, he stopped in London. He went with his wife, Maithree, to the University of Wolverhampton. She received an honorary professor title there.</p>
            <p>Sri Lanka's police department, CID, says Mr. Wickremesinghe used public money to pay for a private trip. They also say the government paid for his bodyguards.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wickremesinghe's office had said before that he did not use his presidential position wrongly for the London trip. He also said that his wife paid for her trip to the UK herself, not with government money.</p>
            <p>Since President Dissanayake started his job, some important opposition politicians in Sri Lanka have been put in jail for corruption. Some have been given sentences of up to 25 years. This includes two former high-level ministers.</p>

            <h1>Shengmao Company Fails to Pay NT$87.29 Million, Biggest Amount This Year</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market has been changing a lot this week after reaching high points. Today, there was news of a very large missed payment for stock trades. The Taiwan Stock Exchange announced tonight that two stockbrokers, Capital Securities Donghu and Hwata Securities Fengyuan, reported a big missed payment from Shengmao Company. Shengmao Company is part of the PCB group. The amount was 87.2956 million New Taiwan Dollars. This is the largest amount this year.</p>
            <p>This is the second time this year that a company listed on the stock market has failed to pay such a large amount. Before this, on August 4, brokers also reported that Thunder Tiger Company had a big missed payment of 58.7657 million New Taiwan Dollars. Counting both listed and over-the-counter (OTC) companies, this is the ninth big missed payment case in the market this year.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market uses a "T+2" system for payments. This means payments are due two business days after a trade. The missed payment announced today by the Stock Exchange was for trades made on Wednesday, August 20. On that day, Shengmao's stock price went down by 10.6 New Taiwan Dollars. It closed at its lowest price of 95.9 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Recently, there has not been enough raw material for making PCBs (printed circuit boards). This has caused the stock prices of companies in this group to change a lot. The OTC market also announced on August 19 that a stockbroker, First Securities, reported that Kingboard, a copper foil company, had a missed payment of 10.93 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei: 76-Year-Old Man Accused of Killing Mother, Held by Court</h1>
            <p>A 76-year-old man named Kuo from Tucheng District, New Taipei City, is accused of using a knife to kill his 93-year-old mother. She died in the hospital because of her serious injuries. After questioning, the New Taipei Prosecutor's Office said Mr. Kuo is suspected of killing a direct family member (his mother). They asked the court to hold him. Tonight, the New Taipei District Court decided to hold him. He is allowed to see people.</p>
            <p>On August 16, the New Taipei City Fire Department received a call for help from a home on Yanji Street in Tucheng. When they arrived, they found the woman had many knife wounds and had stopped breathing. She was taken to the hospital but could not be saved. Another man at the scene also had knife wounds, but he was awake. He was also taken to the hospital.</p>
            <p>Police from the Tucheng Precinct of the New Taipei City Police Department looked into the case. They found that Mr. Kuo and his mother had not gotten along well for a long time. On that day, they had an argument. Mr. Kuo is accused of stabbing his mother and then hurting himself with the knife. When Mr. Kuo is better and can talk to the police, they will ask him more questions to find out why this happened. He will then be charged with killing a direct family member.</p>
            <p>The police said that Mr. Kuo was taken to the Taiwan New Taipei District Prosecutor's Office this afternoon for more questioning. The prosecutors believe Mr. Kuo committed the crime of killing a direct family member. They asked the Taiwan New Taipei District Court to hold him.</p>
            <p>After questioning the judge, the judge believed Mr. Kuo is very likely guilty of killing a direct family member, which is a serious crime under Taiwan's criminal law. The judge thought he might try to run away or hide evidence. So, the judge decided to hold him. He is allowed to communicate with people.</p>
            <p>Remember that suicide does not solve problems. There is always a way out in life. If you need advice or help, you can call the Ministry of Health and Welfare helpline "1925," the Lifeline "1995," or the Teacher Chang helpline "1980."</p>
