            <h1>Instant Noodles: 4 Billion Fewer Packs Sold in 3 Years, Being Abandoned by Young Chinese</h1>
            <p>The instant noodle market in China is going through a very difficult time. In 2020, people in China ate more than 46.3 billion packs of instant noodles in one year. This means each person ate about 32 packs. But in the next three years, the number of packs sold dropped by 4 billion. News from China says that young people are not buying instant noodles anymore because they are becoming more expensive. Instead, they prefer takeout food and pre-made meals, which offer better value and are healthier.</p>
            <p>News reports from Chinese media, including 21 Economy Net and Cover News, mention that Kang Shi Fu, a leading instant noodle company in China, shared its financial report on August 11. This report shows the current situation of the market. In the first half of the year, Kang Shi Fu's instant noodle sales went down by 2.53% compared to last year. This means they earned 350 million yuan less. Also, the number of their distributors went down by 3409 in six months.</p>
            <p>Data from the World Instant Noodle Association (WINA) shows that the amount of instant noodles eaten in China (including Hong Kong) dropped from a high of 46.36 billion packs in 2020 to 42.21 billion packs in 2023. This is a big drop of over 4 billion packs in three years. In the second quarter of 2025, sales in the instant noodle industry fell by 8.9%. This popular fast food item is slowly losing its charm.</p>
            <p>Why do young Chinese people not like instant noodles anymore? News reports often say that takeout food is easy to get and pre-made meals are becoming popular. Young people are starting to stop eating instant noodles, which they say are "not enough if you eat one, but too much if you eat two." Some internet users commented, "For 6 yuan, you can order a takeout meal with meat and vegetables. Why would anyone spend 15 yuan on expensive instant noodles?"</p>
            <p>At the same time, instant noodles in China are becoming more expensive. Classic types that used to cost less than 5 yuan now often cost 6 yuan. More expensive instant noodles with a slice of meat can cost 15 to 20 yuan. Kang Shi Fu even sells a high-end instant noodle product with Sam's Club for 79.9 yuan, which makes many customers decide not to buy it.</p>
            <p>The reports also mention that the spread of high-speed trains in China has made instant noodles less popular for travel. In the past, the smell of instant noodles was common on old green trains. But now, travel times are shorter, and you cannot eat instant noodles on Chinese high-speed trains.</p>
            <p>The report quotes Zhang Ji-wei, an expert in marketing for fast-moving consumer goods. He says that as people's living standards get better, they care more about healthy eating. This has reduced the market for instant noodles. Also, takeout apps have grown quickly, making it easy for people to buy fresh, hot food. This food tastes better than instant noodles, and its price is becoming similar.</p>
            <p>Li Wei, a food industry analyst, says that young people have not given up on instant noodles. Instead, instant noodles have not changed to meet what young people want. New generations of consumers are happy to pay 28 yuan for a good cup of coffee, but they are not interested in traditional instant noodles that cost less than 5 yuan.</p>
            <p>Zhu Dan-feng, a Chinese food industry analyst, said that the decrease in the instant noodle market is a natural result of people wanting to buy better quality things. In the future, companies need to put more effort into new products and healthy options, or they will find it hard to compete in the market.</p>

            <h1>Ambassador Hotel Renovation: New Office Building to Be Completed in Q2 2026</h1>
            <p>The Liufu Tourism Group is actively working to make its property business bigger. Today, they announced that the main structure of the new Liufu Hotel-style Office Building is complete. This building is in the center of Taipei's Songjiang Nanjing business area, and it used to be the Liufu Grand Hotel (Ambassador Hotel). The whole project is expected to be finished by the second quarter of 2026.</p>
            <p>Lai Zhen-rong, the president of Liufu Tourism Group, said in a press release that the construction is now planning the different floors. Some floors will have a restaurant with great views, banquet services, and private dining. This will bring back the famous dining experience of the former Liufu Palace. Currently, foreign companies, technology companies, and brands that need a main company office are very interested in renting spaces.</p>
            <p>Lai Zhen-rong pointed out that there are not many high-quality "Grade A" office buildings with ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) certification available in the market. However, the need for them continues to grow. The rent and sales of office buildings in the Songjiang Nanjing business area have gone up a lot. According to the Taipei City Land Administration Department, this area had the most office building leases last year. Also, rents have increased by 15% in the last 5 years. Many important office building rebuilding projects are happening now. In the future, with many office buildings in the area, the business district will grow very well. This is expected to bring many high-level office workers and will likely make housing prices and rents nearby go up.</p>
            <p>Liufu Group explained that the new Liufu Hotel-style Office Building is on the same land where the Liufu Grand Hotel used to be. It will be a steel structure building with 6 floors underground and 21 floors above ground. After being rebuilt, the total floor area will be 6350 ping (about 20,950 square meters). It is being built by Hua Hsiung Construction, which is the Taiwan branch of the big Japanese construction company Kumagai Gumi.</p>

            <h1>Magang Beach Debris Affects Art Island Aesthetics; County Government: Restoration by End of Month</h1>
            <p>The Matsu International Art Island event is about to start. People living in Matsu Village, located in Nan'gan Township, have noticed that the beach near the art piece "The Sea is My Land" is full of trash like styrofoam and bamboo. This not only makes the area look bad but also makes it difficult for fishing boats to move. The Lienchiang County Industrial Development Department has said that the beach will be cleaned up and returned to its original state by the end of August.</p>
            <p>Several Matsu villagers told reporters today that the beach next to Matsu Temple is covered with a lot of styrofoam, bamboo, and even excavators, making it very messy. The art piece "The Sea is My Land" is in this area, which is also close to the famous giant Matsu statue. The items piled on the beach not only spoil the view for tourists and make it hard to take nice pictures but also block the way for small fishing boats going out to sea. Villagers hope the items will be removed quickly.</p>
            <p>Chen Zhi-wei, the head of Matsu Village, said that these items belong to a fish farming company. They are used to build sheds, which are then pulled by boat to an area near the Shui Ao Reservoir. The company first said they would only put a small number of items there, but they actually filled half of the beach. Chen Zhi-wei asked the company many times to move the items quickly, but they kept giving different excuses, like typhoons or stranded boats. This has made the villagers very unhappy.</p>
            <p>Lin Zhi-feng, the director of the Lienchiang County Industrial Development Department, said in a phone interview today that the styrofoam, bamboo sticks, and other items near the "The Sea is My Land" art piece were put there temporarily by a legal fish farming company in the county since July. The company promised to finish building their sheds and clean the beach by the end of August. So, during the Matsu International Art Island event, these items should not affect the view around the art piece.</p>
            <p>Lin Zhi-feng also said that for the issues raised by the public about blocked paths and the view around the giant Matsu statue, the county government will send people to check the site. They will ask the company to finish building the sheds on time and make sure that during the time the items are there, the paths remain clear for fishing boats to move easily.</p>
            <p>Chen Qi-ping, the secretary of the Lienchiang County Government's Art Island Project Office, said that they had already asked the company to clean the area through the Industrial Development Department. Regarding the public's concern that the area around the "The Sea is My Land" art piece looks messy, they will ask the relevant departments again to quickly remove the items from the beach. This is to make sure that people can enjoy the art without any problems.</p>
