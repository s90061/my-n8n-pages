            <p>The Hong Kong financial authority announced today that the total value of assets managed in Hong Kong reached US$4.53 trillion (about NT$133.3 trillion) in 2024. This is a 13% increase from the year before. Also, new money coming into the city grew by 81% compared to the previous year.</p>
            <p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong shared its "2024 Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey" today. The survey said that the growth in managed assets mainly came from US$91 billion of new money. The survey also described Hong Kong as an important place for managing money and wealth, saying it is "getting better."</p>
            <p>The survey pointed out that in private banking and wealth management, the assets managed went up by 15% to US$1.3 trillion. For funds started in Hong Kong and approved by the SFC, their total value increased by 22% to US$211 billion. By the end of May this year, this value grew even more to US$256 billion.</p>
            <p>In 2024, new money coming into these funds was US$20.9 billion. For the first five months of this year, it was US$30.5 billion.</p>
            <p>The survey also showed that 59% of the assets managed in Hong Kong are invested outside mainland China and Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>Overall, Hong Kong's asset and wealth management business includes managing assets, advising funds, private banking and wealth management, and real estate investment trusts and trust assets approved by the Hong Kong SFC.</p>

            <h1>Man Who Ran for Chiayi City Councilor, Wanted for Drug Dealing, Surrenders and Gets NT$500,000 Bail</h1>
            <p>A man named Chou, who once ran for Chiayi City Councilor but did not win, was involved in a drug dealing group. They sold drug-laced coffee bags. In over two years, they made more than NT$500 million illegally. The case was brought to court four years ago. Mr. Chou was wanted by the police for many years, but he recently turned himself in. After questioning by the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office, he was released on NT$500,000 bail.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou, who had been wanted for many years, turned himself in to the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office on July 11, with his lawyer. The prosecutor who first handled the case four years ago has now been promoted. So, another prosecutor questioned him that day and allowed him to be released on NT$500,000 bail.</p>
            <p>According to the charges from the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office, Mr. Chou, also known as "MÃ¹jÃ¬ng" (meaning "glasses"), wanted to make a lot of money from selling drugs. Starting from July 2018, he worked with a man named Huang and others. They made, moved, and sold coffee bags that contained third and fourth-grade illegal drugs.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou created his own drug-laced coffee brand called "MÃ¹jÃ¬ng Group Drug Dealing Organization." They even made special "Rainbow Little Devil" packaging bags. This helped their drug coffee bags become known and trusted in the market. They used mobile phones and other messaging apps to share information, and people working at hotels and KTVs, as well as smaller drug dealers, helped sell them. This way, they quickly built a network to sell their drugs.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi District Prosecutors Office and the police formed a special team. In October 2020, they searched seven places in Chiayi County and Changhua County at the same time. They found the drug factory of the MÃ¹jÃ¬ng drug group. They seized 12 boxes of Little Devil packaging bags (360,000 bags), new drug materials (like mephedrone, nimetazepam, hallucinogens), over 2,000 kilograms of other materials, and tools like grinders and crushers.</p>
            <p>At that time, the police also found other people involved in the drug group, such as Mr. Huang. The special team looked at the records of raw materials bought for making drugs. They estimated that over two years, the drug group made about 3,625,000 bags of drug-laced coffee. They made about NT$540 million illegally.</p>
            <p>The case was finished and charges were made in February 2021. Mr. Chou, the main person in the drug group who had run for Chiayi City Councilor in 2018 but lost, never showed up. So, the prosecutor issued a warrant for his arrest that same year.</p>

            <h1>Afternoon Thunderstorms Cause Songshan Airport to Stop Ground Work Twice, Affecting 19 Flights</h1>
            <p>Due to afternoon thunderstorms, Songshan Airport stopped its ground operations two times today. This affected a total of 19 flights.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications issued a heavy rain warning. This is because strong rain clouds are forming, which can cause heavy rain for short periods. Today, Taipei City and New Taipei City might have heavy rain or downpours. Keelung, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Nantou, and mountainous areas in Miaoli, Yilan, and Hualien might also have heavy rain. People should be careful of lightning and strong winds. In mountainous areas, there is a risk of landslides and falling rocks. In low areas, be careful of flooding.</p>
            <p>Because of the afternoon thunderstorms, Songshan Airport stopped ground work at 1:21 PM. The storm passed at 2:17 PM. This affected 10 flights.</p>
            <p>Since the rain kept falling, Songshan Airport stopped ground work again at 2:53 PM. Some flights might be delayed because of this.</p>
            <p>The Civil Aeronautics Administration of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said that Songshan Airport stopped having thunderstorms at 3:17 PM. This second stop affected 9 flights.</p>
