            <h1>Fed Official Says Interest Rates Should Be Cut to Help Job Market</h1>
            <p>Michelle Bowman, who is a top official at the US central bank (the Federal Reserve), said today that the latest report on jobs in America shows that the job market is "weak." Because of this, she supports cutting interest rates three times this year. This is to stop the job market from becoming even weaker.</p>
            <p>Bowman, who is in charge of checking how banks work at the Federal Reserve, spoke at a meeting in Colorado. She asked for "strong actions" to lower the main loan interest rate.</p>
            <p>She said that doing this would "help stop the job market from getting worse without a good reason." Also, if the job market does get worse, lowering rates now means the committee that decides rates will not need to make bigger cuts later.</p>
            <p>Bowman also said that prices went up this year because President Trump put taxes on many goods. She thinks this might be a "one-time effect."</p>
            <p>She believes that when these tax effects go away, prices will go back down to the Federal Reserve's goal of 2%.</p>
            <p>She said in her speech: "We should not focus too much on the higher price numbers. We should also remove some rules to prevent the job market from getting even weaker."</p>

            <h1>Trump Family Business Wants to Get $1.5 Billion to Start New Company Called WLFI</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported on August 8th that the US President Trump's family cryptocurrency business, "World Liberty Financial," plans to get $1.5 billion. They want to use this money to start a public company that will own the cryptocurrency called $WLFI.</p>
            <p>The report said, citing people who know about the plan, that the details of the deal are not finished yet. But the company has already talked to big investors in cryptocurrency and technology about this joint business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that World Liberty Financial is a "decentralized platform." Its official website says that President Trump and his son started the platform together. Since it began, the platform has made $500 million for the Trump family.</p>
            <p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has not yet called $WLFI a security. This means it will not be checked as strictly as other investments like stocks.</p>

            <h1>Putin's Envoy Says Some Countries Don't Want Peace in Ukraine and Will Try to Stop Trump-Putin Talks</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said yesterday that he will meet with Russian President Putin on August 15th. Today, Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's special envoy for international money and investment, said that some countries will "try very hard" to stop this meeting.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had said before that Russia and Ukraine were close to an agreement to stop fighting. This agreement might end the conflict that has lasted for three and a half years. The details of this agreement are not public yet. However, Ukraine might have to give up a lot of land. Many European countries do not agree with this idea.</p>
            <p>Today, Dmitriev said that some countries want the war to continue. He wrote on his Telegram social media account: "Some countries want the fighting to go on. They will definitely try very hard to break up the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump."</p>
            <p>Dmitriev also said that these efforts mean "causing problems and spreading false information." But he did not say which countries or what kind of "problems" he meant.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin had already confirmed that this meeting between the Russian and US leaders will happen. Yuri Ushakov, Putin's aide, said that the two leaders will "focus on discussing ways to find a lasting peace for the Ukraine crisis."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said: "This will clearly be a difficult process, but we will work hard and actively on it."</p>
