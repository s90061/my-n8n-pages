            <h1>Twelve People Charged in Case of Vietnamese Woman Forced into Sex Work, Even During Her Period</h1>
            <p>The Yilan District Prosecutor's Office has broken up a group that forced Vietnamese women into sex work. A woman named Chen ran this group in Jiaoxi, making Vietnamese women have sex with customers. Even during their periods, the women were forced to work. The group made over 8 million New Taiwan Dollars in five months. Today, the prosecutor charged Chen and 11 other people.</p>
            <p>The Yilan District Prosecutor's Office said that this case started when a victim, who was held by Chen and others in Jiaoxi, sent a private message on Facebook to a Vietnamese friend asking for help. She also sent a picture taken from her room through the window. After police and prosecutors received the message, they started an investigation right away.</p>
            <p>Prosecutor Guo Ting-yu received the report in June and thought the situation was urgent. Two days after getting the case, she asked for a search warrant and led the team to carry it out. When Chen and the others saw the police and prosecutors, they hid the victims (the women who were forced to work) on the top floor of the building. Then, they ran to the top floor of the next building to avoid being caught. The police and prosecutors found 4 group members and 11 Vietnamese women there.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors searched eight times and arrested eight people. They also saved many Vietnamese women who were victims. Prosecutors found that Chen started renting a hotel in Jiaoxi in January to run the sex work group. She used messaging apps to trick Vietnamese women into coming to Taiwan. She told them they could have "free jobs" with good pay and no government control. Chen also paid for their travel costs first.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that Chen and her boyfriend, You, worked with Vietnamese and Taiwanese job agents, including a man named Huang. They found fake employers and used false documents to apply for legal work permits for the Vietnamese women. After the women arrived in Taiwan, the fake employers picked them up. Then, the group controlled the women by taking their passports, forcing them to pay high service fees, and reporting them as missing if they tried to leave. This made the victims do sex work in brothels or hotels.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors also said that even during their periods, the victims were forced to work. Records show that the group made about 1.69 million New Taiwan Dollars in sales each month, with over 8 million New Taiwan Dollars in illegal profits over five months. In addition, prosecutors also found another sex work group led by a man named Li, which made 20 million New Taiwan Dollars a year. The prosecutors asked the court to take back the large amount of illegal money.</p>
            <p>After their investigation, the Yilan District Prosecutor's Office charged Chen and 11 other people with crimes like human trafficking and forcing people into sex work for profit when they are in a difficult situation and cannot easily get help. Prosecutors asked for at least 9 years in prison for Chen and You for their actions.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan People's Party Will Support Auditor-General Appointment</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan voted on the appointment of Chen Ruey-min as the Auditor-General of the National Audit Office. Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party group in the Legislative Yuan, said that all eight members of their party will vote yes for the Auditor-General's appointment. He said this is because the National Audit Office, even after some political problems, still clearly points out mistakes made by government departments. Also, their investigations are fair and true.</p>
            <p>This morning, Huang Kuo-chang and all the party members held a press conference to explain their decision about the Auditor-General vote. He said that the Taiwan People's Party group decided to vote yes for two reasons. The first reason is that, recently, the National Audit Office has been one of the government's independent agencies that works quite well. Every summer, the office gives a report about government spending. This report clearly shows important problems in government departments. Even with political issues, the National Audit Office still clearly shows these problems in its reports.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said the second reason is that when the Taiwan People's Party group reports a problem, the National Audit Office always investigates it. And the results of these investigations are fair and true. For example, last year, there was a big issue with the illegal use of labor funds. The National Audit Office bravely made a report about it and asked for the misused money from the labor funds and employment stability funds to be returned.</p>
            <p>Next, Huang Kuo-chang said that the Legislative Yuan passed a law to increase pensions for police and firefighters, and also military pay. The President approved this law. However, Premier Cho Jung-tai did not put the necessary money for this in the central government budget, even though the law says he should. This shows a big disrespect for the law passed by the Legislative Yuan and hurts the rights of retired police, firefighters, and military personnel.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the party group discussed sending the whole central government budget back. They wanted the Executive Yuan to put the money in the budget as the law says. But later, they hoped to solve the problem calmly. They also hoped the Executive Yuan would admit its mistake and take steps to fix it.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the party group will not suggest sending the budget back in today's meeting. But they will also not sign a paper saying they won't ask for another vote on it. He also asked Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu to quickly hold a meeting with all parties to discuss this. He emphasized that the ruling party should prepare the budget according to the law. He said their next actions will depend on the Executive Yuan's final decision.</p>

            <h1>Gold Circuit Electronics to Expand Production in Thailand in Second Half of Next Year</h1>
            <p>Gold Circuit Electronics (GCE), a big company that makes server boards, is getting ready for the demand for AI servers. To meet orders, they are quickly setting up more factories overseas. GCE said that the first part of their factory in Thailand is getting approval from customers. It will start making products and earning money in the fourth quarter of this year. At the same time, they are also working on building the second part of the factory. They expect that by the second half of next year, the amount of products made there will be many times more than the first part.</p>
            <p>GCE is a main supplier of PCBs (printed circuit boards) for CSP (cloud service provider) ASIC servers. They have orders for AI ASICs and will plan to make more products to meet these orders.</p>
            <p>GCE said that their factory in Thailand will be a very important place to make AI server orders in the future. The first part of the Thailand factory got approval from customers in the second quarter of this year. In the third quarter, they are still making a small number of products for testing. They plan to start making products officially in the fourth quarter, and this will start bringing in money. They have already started building the second part of the factory in Thailand. They expect to make more products in the second half of next year. The value of products made in the second part is expected to be several times higher than the first part.</p>
            <p>Besides expanding overseas, GCE is also making more products in Taiwan. GCE had announced earlier that they bought a factory from Coretronic in Taoyuan's Zhongli for 1.6 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This was to expand their factory in Taiwan because there is a strong demand for AI servers and network products.</p>
            <p>Experts in the industry say that GCE has good technology for server and network boards, especially for thick multi-layer boards. They also have long-term orders for AI servers from CSP companies. Looking ahead to 2026, as the demand for AI ASICs is clear and more 800G switches are being used, GCE expects to earn more money from high-end network boards and AI server products. Their plan to make products in both Thailand and Taiwan is expected to help their income grow a lot.</p>
