            <h1>Pope Establishes New Diocese in China; Public Worries About CCP Persecution of Underground Church</h1>
            <p>The Vatican announced today that Pope Leo XIV has created a new Catholic area called "Zhangjiakou" in Hebei, China. Following an agreement between the Vatican and China, a new bishop, Wang Zhengui, was appointed. The Vatican also closed two older Catholic areas in the region, Xiwanzili and Xuanhua, and combined them into the new Zhangjiakou area. Some Catholic news groups are concerned that this action might cause the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to increase its unfair treatment of the secret Catholic church in China.</p>
            <p>A Chinese Catholic website reported today that Bishop Wang Zhengui had his special ceremony. The Vatican news office also said today that Pope Leo XIV chose Wang Zhengui, 62, to be the new bishop of the Zhangjiakou area on July 8th. The Pope agreed to Wang Zhenguiâ€™s appointment based on a temporary agreement between the Vatican and the People's Republic of China.</p>
            <p>The Vatican stated that on July 8th, the Pope closed the Xiwanzili and Xuanhua Catholic areas, making them part of the new Zhangjiakou area. The Zhangjiakou area is now under the Beijing church region.</p>
            <p>Asia News reported that this decision by the Pope is very important. Hebei province is one of the oldest and strongest Catholic areas in China. Many Catholic priests and followers there still refuse to join the "Patriotic Church," which the CCP controls. They face serious pressure from the CCP. Now, the Pope has recognized the Catholic areas and bishops that the CCP has set up. This sends a strong message to the secret church.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Bishop Cui Tai of the now-closed Xuanhua Catholic area refused to join the CCP's Patriotic Church. Because of this, the CCP often stopped him from doing his religious duties. The Vatican's statement did not say what would happen to Cui Tai after Xuanhua was closed. However, Catholic priests in Hebei province have been told that a "retirement ceremony" for Cui Tai will happen on the 12th. Also, the previous bishop of the Xiwanzili Catholic area will now be an assistant bishop for the Zhangjiakou area.</p>
            <p>"Xiwanzili" is well-known in Chinese Catholic history. For 100 years during the Qing Dynasty, when Catholic faith was forbidden, many foreign Catholic priests found safety there. They built churches and shared the Christian message, making it a famous Catholic village. In 1945, during the Chinese Civil War, there was fighting in the Xiwanzili area. The Communist army killed and stole from Catholics and burned churches. This event is known as the "Xiwanzili Incident."</p>
            <p>Pope Pius XII gave an important order on April 11, 1946, to set up the Catholic church structure in China. The Xiwanzili and Xuanhua Catholic areas were created at that time.</p>
            <p>Asia News pointed out that Pope Leo XIV might want this new appointment to help bring the Chinese church together. But many signs show that this might not happen. The CCP government has been taking more control over religion recently. They keep telling people to love the party and love the country more. For example, Bishop Shen Bin of Shanghai even brought church members together to watch a live broadcast of China's big military parade on September 3rd.</p>

            <h1>Macron Appoints New Prime Minister, But Cannot Stop Public Anger; Anti-Government Protests Erupt in Many Places</h1>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron appointed a new Prime Minister, SÃ©bastien Lecornu, yesterday. However, this did not calm the public's anger. Today, many people in different parts of the country joined protests against the government. They were angry about cuts to the budget and unfairness in society. To keep order, the government sent 80,000 police officers and military police.</p>
            <p>This protest movement, called "Bloquons Tout" (Block Everything), started online through social media. Many young people joined. It grew bigger as people became more upset about rising prices, less money in the budget, and a feeling that the government did not understand what regular people needed. Some left-wing groups also supported the protests.</p>
            <p>The French Interior Ministry said that about 175,000 people protested across the country, and police arrested 473 people. However, the CGT, a large workers' union in France, estimated that 250,000 people took to the streets. The protesters wanted things like social fairness and for the government to stop its current budget plans.</p>
            <p>In Paris, many protesters gathered in the ChÃ¢telet and Les Halles shopping areas in the afternoon. Police asked nearby subway stations to close for a while. Many shops in the area also closed their doors.</p>
            <p>Protesters held signs that said, "Emmanuel Macron Resign," "People Stand Up," and "Tax the Rich." They also shouted slogans. Some people burned trash cans and set fire to a building. The fire was put out quickly, but it left a black mark. Police used shields and tear gas to make the crowds move away.</p>
            <p>Hector, who is under 30 and works at a public museum, made a pirate flag for the protest that said "Tout Bloquer" (Block Everything).</p>
            <p>He told the Central News Agency (CNA) that he was unhappy because important government departments like health and education had their budgets cut. Money was moved to security and police services instead. He said hospitals do not have enough workers, social support for disabled people is getting smaller, and the education budget has also shrunk. This means classrooms are too full, and teachers do not get paid enough, which makes it hard for students to learn well.</p>
            <p>Hector said, "We want to keep our rights. In the early 20th century, we successfully fought for paid holidays and many social rights. Now, we are losing all of this. We want to slow down this change."</p>
            <p>AmÃ©lys, 25, told CNA that she is against the government and capitalism, and she does not like Macron. She said that Macron appointing Lecornu as the new Prime Minister "does not help at all; it is just a different person continuing the same policies."</p>
            <p>The former Prime Minister, FranÃ§ois Bayrou, had earlier suggested a budget plan to save 44 billion Euros. This was to reduce the country's debt and to get rid of two public holidays. This made the opposition parties and the public very unhappy. So, Bayrou asked for a special vote in parliament to see if people still trusted him, but he did not win the vote. He then resigned to Macron yesterday.</p>

            <h1>UN General Assembly Begins; Times Square Advertisement in New York Calls for Taiwan's Participation</h1>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly started on September 9th at the UN headquarters in New York. Today, Taiwanese business groups from North America put up an advertisement on a screen in Times Square, asking for Taiwan to be allowed to join the United Nations. Hsu Chia-ching, the Minister of the Overseas Community Affairs Council, said she was grateful that countries around the world spoke up. They said that the way Resolution 2758 was understood in the past was wrong. Now, Taiwan should be able to join the UN and other international groups in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p>As the UN General Assembly began, questions about Taiwan joining the UN and its inability to take part in UN-related activities became important topics again. From the first day of the assembly, North American Taiwanese business groups gathered money to show advertisements on the Times Square screens. These ads asked everyone to continue thinking about this issue.</p>
            <p>The North American Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce led this advertisement. Besides the English word "Taiwan," the ad also showed other words starting with "U" like "Unlock," "Unfold," "Unveil," "Unleash," and "Unbound." These words were chosen to connect with the English name "UN" (United Nations).</p>
            <p>The video also included the words "AI" and "UN2025." It showed slogans like "Better Together," which is the theme of the UN General Assembly, and "Chip in with Taiwan," meaning Taiwan can help and contribute.</p>
            <p>Minister Hsu Chia-ching, Director-General Li Chih-chiang of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, and Bai Yue-chu, President of the North American Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, along with other leaders from Taiwanese communities in North America, all gathered in Times Square to see the advertisement for Taiwan's participation in the UN.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching explained that when the Republic of China was forced to leave the UN, the People's Republic of China took its place to represent China. At that time, Resolution 2758 was passed. However, the original words and meaning of this resolution only said that the People's Republic of China would represent China, not Chiang Kai-shek's government. This resolution did not include the Republic of China or Taiwan.</p>
            <p>She emphasized that for the past 50 years, this understanding of the resolution has sadly been incorrect. Today, she thanked the international community, including the European Union, the United States, and Canada. These countries have said that the old way of understanding Resolution 2758 was wrong. Now, Taiwan should be able to join the UN and related international organizations in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p>Li Chih-chiang spoke at a press conference at the New York office. He said that the UN General Assembly started on September 9th. The theme for this 80th assembly is "Better Together." He noted that the theme for last year's 79th assembly was "Leaving No One Behind." He sadly pointed out that Taiwan has been left out of the UN since 1971.</p>
            <p>He explained that the main reason for this problem is China wrongly changing the meaning of Resolution 2758 and wrongly linking it to its "One China Principle." This has made it very difficult for Taiwan to participate. He believes it is important to let the international community know about this unfair situation that Taiwan is facing.</p>
