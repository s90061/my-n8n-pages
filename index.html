            <h1>Nscale Wins Big Microsoft Order, Will Put 200,000 Nvidia AI Chips in Europe and US Data Centers</h1>
            <p>Nscale, a British Artificial Intelligence (AI) company, announced today that it has signed a bigger agreement with Microsoft. Nscale will put about 200,000 Nvidia AI chips in its own data centers in Europe and the United States. These chips will help with Microsoft's computer needs.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Nscale did not say the exact amount of money for the deal. However, The Financial Times estimated similar deals could bring Nscale up to US$14 billion in sales.</p>
            <p>Nscale said that this agreement will be carried out with Dell Technologies.</p>
            <p>Microsoft did not immediately reply when Reuters asked for a comment.</p>
            <p>According to the plan, Nscale will start supplying Nvidia's Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to Microsoft next year. This will be done through Nscale's data centers in Texas and Portugal. The company also plans to make its operations in Texas bigger in the coming years.</p>
            <p>This new agreement builds on Nscale's previous plans. The company said that its joint company with Norway's Aker Group has signed a long-term agreement. This agreement is to supply about 52,000 Nvidia GPUs to Microsoft from a very large AI park in Narvik, Norway.</p>
            <p>In September this year, Nscale received US$1.1 billion from investors, including Aker and Finland's Nokia. This money will help the company build its data centers faster.</p>

            <h1>Hanwha Group Considers Selling Anti-Ship Missiles to the Philippines After Chinese Sanctions</h1>
            <p>Hanwha Group, a big company from South Korea, might sell anti-ship missiles to the Philippines. This news comes after China put sanctions on Hanwha's weapons-making part because the company sold weapons to Taiwan. A person who knows about the situation told Reuters that Hanwha has offered to sell anti-ship missiles to the Philippines.</p>
            <p>This situation shows that other countries might get weapons if China continues to put sanctions on companies that sell weapons to Taiwan. However, the South Korean government has not made a public statement about this. It is also unclear if the Philippines will actually buy the missiles.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has been strengthening its defense because of worries about China's actions. Taiwan has bought many weapons from different countries, including South Korea.</p>
