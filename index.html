**New Study Shows Flexible Work Improves Employee Well-being**

A recent study has found that allowing employees to work flexibly, such as having control over their working hours and location, has a significant positive impact on their well-being. Researchers analyzed data from thousands of workers across various industries and discovered that those with greater flexibility reported lower levels of stress and burnout, and higher levels of job satisfaction.

The study suggests that flexible work arrangements empower employees to better manage their work-life balance, leading to reduced stress and improved mental health. For example, being able to adjust working hours to accommodate family responsibilities or personal appointments can significantly alleviate the pressure that many employees face. Furthermore, the option to work remotely can reduce commuting time and provide a more comfortable and productive work environment. The findings highlight the importance of companies offering flexible work options to support the well-being of their employees and improve overall organizational performance. It's a win-win situation where employees are happier and more productive, and companies benefit from a more engaged and motivated workforce.

**Venice to Charge Tourists an Entry Fee to Combat Over-Tourism**

Venice, the famous Italian city known for its canals and historical architecture, is introducing a new entry fee for tourists. This measure aims to reduce over-tourism, which has been causing problems for the city and its residents. From certain dates in the spring and summer, day-trippers will have to pay a fee to enter Venice's historic center.

The city council hopes that this fee will discourage large crowds from visiting during peak season. The money collected will be used to improve services for residents, such as waste management and public transport. Residents, commuters, students, and tourists staying overnight will be exempt from the fee. The introduction of the fee has been met with mixed reactions. Some argue that it is necessary to protect Venice's unique cultural heritage, while others worry that it will make the city less accessible to tourists. However, the city council believes that this is a necessary step to ensure the long-term sustainability of Venice.
