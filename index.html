            <h1>Boy Rescued in Mountain Accident; Grandfather and Female Hiker Die</h1>
            <p>In Xinyi Township, Nantou County, a mountain accident happened today on Mount Kekean. A 70-year-old man and a 63-year-old female hiker had no signs of life when they were rescued and brought down the mountain. The 8-year-old boy with them showed signs of hypothermia but was stable. He is now in the hospital for treatment and observation.</p>
            <p>The Nantou County Fire Department received a call at noon today. The 8-year-old boy, his grandfather, and another female hiker started their climb on August 8th from Hualien County. They planned to hike the Southern Third Section and expected to come down at Dongpu, Xinyi Township, Nantou County, on August 17th. They met a typhoon during their trip, which caused them to be cold for a long time. It is believed that they lost strength because of this. The fire department thought the patients' lives were in danger, and the place was far away, so they immediately asked for a helicopter to help.</p>
            <p>The Air Force team sent a helicopter, which arrived at Mount Kekean in the afternoon. They landed and helped the old man, the female hiker, and the boy come down the mountain. Later, they were taken to the hospital by ambulance. However, the old man and the female hiker had no signs of life before reaching the hospital and died even after rescue efforts. The boy had symptoms of hypothermia but was stable. The full details of the accident are still being investigated.</p>
            <p>The Fire Department asks people to be very ready before going to the mountains, as the weather can change very fast. They suggest checking your own abilities and not trying to climb routes that are too hard for you. Also, carry satellite communication devices. These can quickly give your location in an emergency, saving important time for rescue.</p>

            <h1>Famous Chef Andr√©s Goes to Gaza, Leads World Central Kitchen to Provide 1 Million Meals Daily</h1>
            <p>Famous Spanish-American chef Jos√© Andr√©s recently visited the Gaza Strip. He went to encourage his food aid organization, "World Central Kitchen," and asked for more help. His goal is to provide 1 million meals daily to quickly end the hunger crisis there.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s, who is 56 years old this year, was born in northern Spain and built a successful restaurant business in the United States. In 2010, after the big earthquake in Haiti, he started World Central Kitchen (WCK). Its main office is in Washington D.C. The organization focuses on solving hunger problems caused by natural disasters and wars. It gives food help to people in disaster and war areas, working hard to provide fresh, hot meals. Since the conflict between Israel and Palestine began, World Central Kitchen has given more than 145 million meals to people in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Even though it is very difficult to provide help in the Gaza Strip, and seven of their workers were killed by an Israeli army attack in April 2024, which stopped their work for a while, World Central Kitchen has continued. They use land, sea, and air to bring supplies. They have set up four large field kitchens in southern and central Gaza. They have also created a network of community kitchens led by Palestinians. With help from local partners, they have expanded their meal delivery to northern Gaza.</p>
            <p>World Central Kitchen stated that they can currently provide about 200,000 meals daily in Gaza. However, because food supplies are often stopped and limited, the amount of cooking this year has greatly decreased.</p>
            <p>According to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, World Central Kitchen founder Jos√© Andr√©s visited Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on August 14th. He went to see the field kitchens set up by World Central Kitchen. He encouraged the local workers and volunteers who are helping people.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s asked for much more help for the Palestinian people. He promised to work hard to quickly make more food. His goal is to increase the daily meal supply to an unseen 1 million meals. This is to stop the hunger crisis in Gaza from getting worse.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s also visited a bakery and two aid places. He saw how the local teams continue to cook meals, even when hunger is spreading and there is a big lack of help.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s said on Instagram (IG) that his feelings are hard to explain. He said, "How can we be very excited and happy about feeding people, while at the same time feeling so much pain from seeing hunger?"</p>
            <p>He said that because of this, World Central Kitchen must grow its operations. Providing 1 million meals daily means: 5 large field kitchens, 100 community kitchens and bakeries, over 100 trucks for supplies, a steady supply of fuel and food, safe and open land routes for transport, and clean drinking water.</p>
            <p>He said, "Gaza is almost starving, and the world should not ignore it."</p>
            <p>Besides the Gaza Strip, Andr√©s also visited Israel. He went to the Nova Festival site, where Hamas attacked. He paid his respects to the victims and their families there.</p>
            <p>The war between Israel and Palestine started on October 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked southern Israel. About 1,200 people died, and 251 people were taken as hostages. Israel then started a large attack on the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas. Israel promised to destroy Hamas. According to statements from the Gaza Ministry of Health, this war has caused over 60,000 Palestinians to die so far.</p>
            <p>During his visit, Andr√©s also said, "World Central Kitchen is on the side of humanity, providing food for people." He asked for kindness and care for both Palestinians and Israelis. He also asked for "the release of Israeli hostages, a ceasefire, and an end to all cruelty and suffering."</p>
