            <h1>Macron Again Names Lecornu as Prime Minister; Far-Right Wants to Remove Him</h1>
            <p>Today, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that Sebastien Lecornu will be Prime Minister again. Lecornu had resigned only four days ago. Macron told him to form a new government. After this news, the main far-right political party, the National Rally (RN), promised to try and remove the government.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Elysee Palace said Macron has chosen Lecornu to be Prime Minister and given him permission to create a government.</p>
            <p>Lecornu later posted on X, a social media site, that he accepted the job again "because it is his duty." He also said that "France must get out of its current political problems."</p>
            <p>He stated that he would "do everything possible" to make sure France passes its budget bill before the end of the year. He also said that making the country's money situation better is "very important for the future of the nation."</p>
            <p>Lecornu also warned that anyone who wants to join the new government must promise to put aside their personal goals for the 2027 presidential election for a while.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, France's main far-right party, the National Rally, promised to try and remove the new government led by Lecornu right away. They believe this team "has no future."</p>
            <p>Jordan Bardella, the leader of the National Rally, said that Macron's choice to name Lecornu again was a "bad joke." He called Macron "lonely and out of touch with reality." Bardella said that the National Rally will "immediately propose a no-confidence motion against this government with no future." They will try to remove the government in parliament.</p>

            <h1>Yonhap News: North Korea Holds Night Military Parade for 80th Anniversary of Workers' Party</h1>
            <p>South Korean news said, quoting unnamed people, that North Korea seems to have started a military parade tonight in Pyongyang, its capital. This parade is to celebrate the 80th birthday of its Workers' Party. This is the first night parade North Korea has held in over two years, since September 2023.</p>
            <p>According to South Korea's Yonhap News Agency and Reuters, North Korea, which has nuclear weapons, often holds military parades on important dates. Recently, many of these parades have been at night. They use these events to show their new and better ballistic missiles and military equipment. This shows that their army is getting stronger.</p>
            <p>People and experts are watching to see if Pyongyang will show a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) at this week's parade. This missile uses solid fuel and can reach the US mainland.</p>
            <p>In yesterday's events, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was with leaders and officials from friendly countries like China and Russia. He said that North Korea's position in the world is growing. He called North Korea a " loyal member of socialist forces" and an "independent fort" against the threat of Western global power.</p>
            <p>Details about the parade, such as who attended and what weapons were shown, have not been announced yet. It is also not yet known if Kim Jong Un will give a speech or if his daughter, Kim Ju-ae, will be with him on the main stage.</p>
            <p>However, important guests expected to be there include Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev, and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam's Central Committee To Lam.</p>
            <p>Khang Vu, a visiting scholar of East Asian politics at Boston College in the US, said that Vietnam and North Korea see each other as possible economic partners. Even though international rules limit what they can do together, To Lam's large group visiting Pyongyang shows that Vietnam wants to make their long friendship, which started during the Cold War, more meaningful.</p>
            <p>Khang Vu said, "As Russia becomes more isolated and China causes more worries, Vietnam can also be an important way for North Korea to talk with Western countries."</p>
