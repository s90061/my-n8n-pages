            <h1>US Agency Rules China's BOE Stole Samsung Display Secrets</h1>
            <p>On July 13th, the US International Trade Commission (ITC) made a first decision. They said that a Chinese company, BOE, took secret information from Samsung Display, a South Korean company.</p>
            <p>Samsung Display had complained to the ITC on October 31, 2023. News from the screen industry in Korea says that the ITC found BOE illegally took and used Samsung Display's secret information about OLED (organic light-emitting diode) products. This caused Samsung to lose a lot of money and faced big problems.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the ITC has stopped BOE from importing their OLED screens for 14 years and 8 months. They also told BOE's main office in China and its US branch that they cannot market, sell, or promote their products in the US.</p>
            <p>The ITC will make its final decision in November of this year. Experts believe that the first decision will probably not change. This is because the ITC has already said that BOE stole secrets and got information by hiring Samsung's employees.</p>
