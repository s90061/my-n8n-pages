            <h1>Man Drunk Drives, Hits Bank Door in Taichung and Runs Away; Police Quickly Catch Him</h1>
            <p>In Taichung City's Nantun District, on Wenxin Road Section 1, there was a loud noise at a bank around 2 AM today. People saw a small car hit the glass door and then drive away. The police were told and checked street cameras. Around 7 AM, they found the man named Zhu who caused the accident while drunk driving.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Police Division of Taichung City Government said that the car went straight into the bank's right glass door. This caused the glass to break and also damaged a motorcycle parked nearby. Luckily, no one was hurt. The car then left the scene.</p>
            <p>The Dadun Police Station of the Fourth Division received the report. They immediately sent officers to the scene. Using information from people who saw the accident and the car's license plate left behind, they checked more street cameras in the area and quickly found out who the driver was.</p>
            <p>Police investigation showed that Mr. Zhu drove after drinking alcohol at a stir-fry restaurant. He might have had a blackout from drinking. His car drove directly into the bank. When the car hit the bank, Mr. Zhu woke up, but he didn't know what to do, so he just ran away.</p>
            <p>The police said that they tested the driver's alcohol level, and it was higher than allowed by law. The case will be sent to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for investigation under public danger charges. For running a red light, he will be fined between NT$1,800 and NT$5,400 according to the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act.</p>

            <h1>Many Arguments about "Necessary Medical Treatment" in Insurance Claims, Says Financial Ombudsman Institution</h1>
            <p>The Financial Consumer Protection Center (è©•è­°ä¸­å¿ƒ) has reported that in the first half of this year, there were 7,737 complaints and 3,167 arbitration cases. Looking at the second quarter, insurance companies received the most complaints, more than 70%. Banks received 23% of complaints. For life insurance, most arguments were about whether medical treatment was "necessary." For banks, most arguments were about credit card spending.</p>
            <p>If people have problems with financial services, they can first complain to the company, as stated in the Financial Consumer Protection Act. If the problem is not solved, they can ask the Financial Consumer Protection Center for help. The center's records show that during the pandemic, complaints increased a lot because of special epidemic insurance policies. In 2022 and 2023, the total complaints went up to 52,288 and 21,767 cases. Last year, the number of complaints went down and returned to normal levels.</p>
            <p>Looking closely at the types of problems in the first half of this year, banks often had problems with credit card spending and not explaining financial products or risks clearly. For life insurance, the main problem was about "necessary medical treatment." For property insurance, the most common issue was about how much to pay for a claim. For securities and futures companies, the main problem was about selling funds (including investment trust funds and foreign funds).</p>
            <p>Looking further at the 3,680 complaints in the second quarter, insurance companies had the most complaints, making up 71.52% (2,632 cases). Banks were next with 23.43% (866 cases). Then came securities and futures companies with 4.29% (158 cases). Finally, electronic payment companies had only 0.65% (24 cases). Among insurance companies, life insurance had the most complaints with 1,835 cases, followed by property insurance with 746 cases, and insurance assistants with 51 cases.</p>
            <p>According to the information, life insurance companies had 1,835 complaints in the second quarter. Most of these were about whether medical treatment was "necessary." This kind of problem often happens when an insurance policy covers medical actions and costs, but there's a disagreement about whether the treatment was truly needed.</p>
            <p>The center stated that medical technology has improved in recent years. Many new medical treatments were not clearly mentioned in old insurance policies as to whether they would be covered. So, when people later apply for claims, there are often different opinions about whether the treatment was "necessary." The center suggests that people should check their insurance policy before getting medical services to avoid problems later.</p>
            <p>Banks had 866 complaints in the second quarter, mostly about credit card spending. The center pointed out that some of these cases involved bad people tricking consumers into giving them OTP (one-time password) text messages. However, this trend has not increased. Banks have also recently improved how they show information in OTP text messages, for example, by showing the currency, to make sure consumers know what they are spending money on.</p>
            <p>Also, the Financial Supervisory Commission plans to regulate financing and leasing companies in three steps. In the first step, 13 financing and leasing companies under four listed groups (Chung Jih, Hotai Finance, Chailease Finance, and Union Leasing) will be included under the Financial Consumer Protection Act. This will start on September 15. If these companies are later found to have misleading advertisements, use violence to collect debts, or have illegal contract terms, people can complain to the center.</p>
            <p>Du Yi-ching, the chairperson of the Financial Consumer Protection Center, said that the center has already held several training sessions. These included inviting judges and people from the industry to discuss possible problems with financing and leasing companies. The arbitration committee also has special groups to handle future cases. The center has also told financing and leasing companies about the process and rules for solving disputes to make sure they understand.</p>

            <h1>To Protect Land, People's Party Suggests Environmental Review Before Solar Power Development</h1>
            <p>The People's Party caucus has proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act. They want to add rules for solar power systems. These rules would say that environmental reviews must be done before development in places like national parks, wildlife habitats, important wetlands, land owned by state-run and public companies, hillside areas, and water-based systems. The proposed changes were sent straight to a second reading in the legislative session on August 29.</p>
            <p>Recently, photos of solar panel waste after Typhoon Danas were shared on social media, titled "solar power graveyard," which caught a lot of attention. The People's Party caucus has held several press conferences to question the problem of discarded solar panels. They also proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act, adding rules for solar power systems.</p>
            <p>The People's Party caucus explained in their proposal that solar power systems have often damaged the environment in recent years, leading to "solar panels everywhere, on mountains and by the sea." However, most solar power projects did not need an environmental impact assessment. The Ministry of Environment did nothing for a long time and failed its duty. It was not until January 2025 that they changed the "Standards for Identifying Development Activities Requiring Environmental Impact Assessment" to include more solar power systems in the environmental impact assessment scope.</p>
            <p>The People's Party caucus pointed out that the current rules still have problems. For example, water-based solar power systems do not need an environmental impact assessment. Also, some projects in certain areas do not need an environmental impact assessment if the main authority approves them, which seems like an unfair exception. To stop solar power systems from damaging the land again and again, it is important to raise the need for environmental reviews to a higher legal level and make it apply to more areas.</p>
            <p>The People's Party caucus's proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act add rules for solar power environmental reviews. They list 10 main types of project environments that need an environmental review. First, areas in national parks, national scenic areas, or sensitive regions. Second, areas in wildlife protection zones or important habitats. Third, areas in important wetlands. Fourth, natural protected areas in coastal regions. Fifth, agricultural land in specific agricultural zones. Sixth, land where the government supports or encourages afforestation, and land owned by the state or public companies.</p>
            <p>The seventh point in the proposed changes is for hillside areas where the installed capacity is 10,000 kilowatts or more, or the total area is 5 hectares or more. The eighth point is also for hillside solar systems, but it also includes projects on the same land lot or separated only by roads or drainage channels. The ninth point is for water-based solar power systems where the installed capacity is 10,000 kilowatts or more, or the total area is 5 hectares or more. The tenth point is for projects where the installed capacity is 20,000 kilowatts or more, or the total area is 10 hectares or more.</p>
            <p>However, the People's Party caucus's proposal also clearly states that these environmental review rules for solar power systems do not include rooftop solar power systems.</p>
            <p>The People's Party caucus's proposed changes to the Environmental Impact Assessment Act were listed in the legislative session report on August 29. During that session, the People's Party caucus suggested sending it directly to a second reading. Since no one disagreed, the President of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, decided to send it directly to a second reading. The People's Party caucus will then lead the discussions.</p>
