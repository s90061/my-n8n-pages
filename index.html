            <h1>Fishing Boat Catches Fire in Keelung Badouzi, 6 Crew Members Jump into Sea to Escape</h1>
            <p>Late tonight, a 56-ton fishing boat named "Jindecai" from Shen'ao, New Taipei City, caught fire at Badouzi Fishing Port in Keelung. The fire was very big, and thick black smoke went up into the sky. The fire was controlled around 10 PM. Six crew members on the boat saw the fire and jumped into the sea to get away. Luckily, no one was hurt. The reason for the fire is still unknown.</p>
            <p>The Keelung City Fire Department received a report at 9:32 PM that a fishing boat was on fire about 200 meters from the shore. They quickly sent 12 different types of vehicles and 24 firefighters to help. When the firefighters arrived at the parking lot next to the Keelung District Fishermen's Association, they saw the whole fishing boat was on fire, with black smoke rising high. They immediately started spraying water to put out the fire.</p>
            <p>The firefighters continued to spray water, and the fire got smaller around 10 PM. However, because the boat was on fire, it was hard to tie it with ropes, so it drifted away from the shore. This made it difficult for firefighters to put out the fire effectively. The Coast Guard sent fire boats to help and pulled the fishing boat closer to the shore. With the help of both the Coast Guard and firefighters, the fire was controlled at 10:43 PM. They are now taking care of the remaining small fires.</p>
            <p>The captain, whose last name is Luo, said that after they finished unloading the fish, he was going to move the boat to the side to tie it up. But then he saw a lot of smoke and fire coming from inside the boat. To stop the fire from harming other fishing boats, he quickly moved their boat away from the shore. The six crew members on the boat jumped into the sea to escape. Luckily, no one was hurt.</p>

            <h1>Asia Cup Men's Basketball Returns to Top 8, Taiwanese-American Adam Hinton Honored to Represent Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan men's basketball team beat Jordan 78 to 64 in a special playoff game. This win was helped by Adam Hinton, who scored the most points for the team with 18. This means Taiwan is back in the top 8 of the Asia Cup after 12 years. Adam Hinton, who is half Taiwanese and half American, said he feels honored to play for Taiwan in international games.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan men's basketball team, led by captain Chen Ying-chun, wanted to get back into the top 8 of the Asia Cup. They remembered losing to Jordan at the last Asia Cup when Jordan scored the winning point at the end. This time, the "Hinton brothers," Adam and Robert, who are Taiwanese-American, joined the team. This made the team stronger. In their first group game, they beat the strong team from the Philippines, and then they moved to the playoffs as the second-best team in their group.</p>
            <p>In the playoff game, Taiwan played against Jordan again. But this time, Adam Hinton scored 18 points, which was the most in the game. Captain Chen Ying-chun also added 15 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists, including two important three-point shots in the fourth quarter. Also, "new Taiwanese" player Kao Po-kai had 9 points, 12 rebounds, and 7 blocks, protecting the area near the basket. Finally, Taiwan got revenge for their loss three years ago and returned to the Asia Cup top 8 after waiting for 12 years.</p>
            <p>Adam Hinton, who is called "Super Dan," spoke to reporters after the game. He said the most important part of their win was that everyone worked together. He also praised Kao Po-kai, saying he was a "rebound monster" who helped Taiwan get many rebounds. He also said Captain Chen Ying-chun made several important three-point shots. He said, "He shot from places like Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard would shoot. Those shots were very important for this win."</p>
            <p>When foreign media asked him why he chose to play for Taiwan, Adam Hinton explained that his mother was one of the biggest reasons. He also said he is truly honored to play for Taiwan, especially playing with his brother Robert on the international stage. He added, "I can't ask for anything more. This moment feels like a dream come true."</p>
            <p>Next, the Taiwan team will play against the strong team from Iran to try to get into the top 4. Coach Gianluca Tucci said it might be a very tough game. He said that when playing against a very confident team, they must stay humble and try to limit what the other team can do. He also said, "We will get ready like we did for the game against the Philippines. I believe the players are also looking forward to and excited for the next game."</p>
