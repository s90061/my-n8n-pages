            <h1>Yageo: Shibaura Electronics Officially Supports Takeover Bid, Deadline Extended to October 3rd</h1>
            <p>Yageo, a big company that makes electronic parts, has made good progress in buying Japanese company Shibaura Electronics. Japanese news reported last night that Shibaura Electronics now supports Yageo's offer to buy their shares. Yageo sent out a press release last night saying they are thankful that Shibaura Electronics officially supports their offer and tells its shareholders to join the bidding process.</p>
            <p>Yageo explained that because of Japanese rules, if there are big changes to the offer, the process of buying shares must be extended by 10 days until October 3rd. This is to make sure shareholders have enough time to think about this good news and finish their part in the bidding.</p>
            <p>Japanese news said that Shibaura Electronics stated yesterday that Yageo's takeover offer could bring many good things, like making their business stronger overseas and having more types of products. Shibaura Electronics also announced today that they support Yageo's offer.</p>
            <p>Japanese media also reported that Yageo and Shibaura Electronics agreed yesterday that after Yageo's planned takeover is finished, Shibaura Electronics will remain a legal company. Yageo will respect Shibaura Electronics' ability to run its own business as much as possible. Both sides also agreed that Shibaura Electronics will keep all its current employees.</p>
            <p>Yageo said last night that, as Shibaura Electronics mentioned in their announcement, both companies have talked a lot and worked together positively over the past few months. This was the main reason for Shibaura Electronics changing its mind and supporting the offer.</p>
            <p>Yageo said they are happy that Shibaura Electronics fully agrees on the good things they can achieve together. Yageo strongly believes that this cooperation will create a better future for Shibaura Electronics and its employees.</p>
            <p>Yageo officially started trying to buy Shibaura Electronics shares at 6200 Japanese Yen per share on May 9th. During this time, they changed the deadline for buying shares several times. Because of competition from Minebea Mitsumi in Japan, Yageo announced on August 23rd that they would raise their offer price for Shibaura Electronics shares to 7130 Japanese Yen per share.</p>
            <p>On September 2nd, Yageo said that they have received permission from Japan for foreign direct investment (FDI). They expect to finish the process in the third quarter of this year.</p>
            <p>According to information, Shibaura Electronics mainly makes NTC thermistors, which are electronic parts that sense temperature. They also make and sell sensors for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</p>

            <h1>Chih Yu-jen Makes Amazing Comeback in Deciding Game, Advances in China Masters Badminton</h1>
            <p>In the BWF Super 750 China Masters badminton tournament, Taiwanese player Chih Yu-jen made a surprising comeback today in the deciding game of the men's singles first round. He was behind by 6 points but managed to win against Japanese player Yushi Tanaka, moving on to the next round.</p>
            <p>Chih Yu-jen, who is ranked 28th in the world, played against Yushi Tanaka, a Japanese player with a similar ranking, in the men's singles first round today. Their past matches show that Chih Yu-jen has a very good record against Yushi Tanaka. He had won all four previous games in two straight sets, so he is like Tanaka's biggest challenge.</p>
            <p>Playing again after two months, Chih Yu-jen showed strong control in the first game. He was ahead for almost the entire game and increased his lead after a technical break, winning easily 21 to 12. However, in the second game, Chih Yu-jen could not keep his strong play and suddenly started making mistakes. This allowed Yushi Tanaka to take control, and Tanaka won the game 21 to 14, making the score equal.</p>
            <p>In the third and final game, Chih Yu-jen still could not find his good form. He started by being 5 points behind. After a technical break, he was even further behind, 10 to 16. It looked like he would not win. But, surprisingly, Chih Yu-jen quickly recovered. He scored 8 points in a row to take the lead. Even though Tanaka caught up immediately, Chih Yu-jen then scored 3 more points quickly and won the game closely, 21 to 18.</p>
            <p>After this tough match that lasted over an hour, Chih Yu-jen not only kept his perfect record against Yushi Tanaka but also moved on to the next round of men's singles. In his next game, he will play against Nhat Nguyen, a Vietnamese-Irish player, to try and get into the top 8.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwanese women's singles player Chiu Pin-chian played against the 7th seed, Indonesian new star Putri Kusuma Wardani, today. Sadly, she only played for 37 minutes and lost with two scores of 15 to 21. She did not advance to the next round of women's singles.</p>
