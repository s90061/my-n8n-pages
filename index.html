            <h1>石破茂促推進關稅談判 美財長：必達成良好協議</h1>
            <p>The US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Bessent, is in Japan for "America Day" at the Osaka Kansai Expo. Today, he met with the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Shigeru Ishiba. About the tariff talks between Japan and the US, Mr. Bessent said, "A good agreement will definitely be made."</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent will go to "America Day" on July 19th at the 2025 World Expo in Osaka, Kansai.</p>
            <p>The Japan Economic News reported that Mr. Ishiba met with Mr. Scott Bessent at the Prime Minister's office for over 30 minutes today at 5:30 PM (4:30 PM Taiwan time). Japan's Minister for Economic Revitalization, Mr. Akazawa Ryosei, who talks with the US about tariffs, was also there. Mr. Bessent is the US Secretary of the Treasury who talks with Japan about tariffs.</p>
            <p>During their meeting, Mr. Ishiba and Mr. Bessent confirmed that Japan and the US will make their relationship stronger in areas like economy and security. Also, about the Japan-US tariff talks, Mr. Ishiba hopes that Mr. Bessent will keep talking closely with Mr. Akazawa. This is to reach an agreement that is good for both Japan and the US.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba also said that Japan will make its defense stronger on its own to keep peace and safety.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bessent replied to Mr. Ishiba, saying: "A good agreement will definitely be made."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said on July 7th that the US will start adding a 25% tax on goods imported from Japan from August 1st. The Japanese government hopes to talk with the US through different levels of communication.</p>
            <p>However, people from the Japanese government said that Mr. Bessent came to Japan as part of the US team for the Osaka Expo. He did not plan to have talks with Japanese ministers.</p>
            <p>About the Japan-US tariff talks, Japan suggested investing a lot of money in the US and buying more American-made goods. This is to reduce the US trade deficit. The US government is still carefully looking at Japan's suggestion. The Japanese government is thinking about sending Mr. Akazawa to the US again soon to help the tariff talks move forward.</p>
            <p>After his meeting with Mr. Bessent, Mr. Ishiba told the media, "During the meeting, I said that the safety of Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia are connected. Japan and the US should work more closely. Also, in economic security, there are many areas where Japan and the US should work together."</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba said, "In the meeting, I said that I hope Mr. Bessent can keep talking closely with Minister of Economic Revitalization Akazawa. This is to reach an agreement that is good for both Japan and the US. My meeting with President Trump has not been scheduled yet. But because it's important for our country, I will have a chance to talk directly with President Trump. The decision will depend on how the talks go."</p>
            <p>After the meeting between Mr. Ishiba and Mr. Bessent, Mr. Akazawa told the media, "The meeting was friendly. Japan and the US understood each other better. We also hope to talk more. The meeting also included important political topics."</p>

            <h1>憂中共利用AI發展軍事 美眾院大老反對輝達H20晶片銷中</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 18 (CNA) – Today, Mr. Moolenaar, who leads the US House of Representatives' special committee on strategic competition with the Chinese Communist Party, sent a letter to the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Lutnick. He is against the government lifting rules that stop Nvidia H20 chips from being sold to China.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Mr. John Moolenaar wrote in his letter to Mr. Howard Lutnick: "The Department of Commerce made the correct decision before to stop H20 chips from being sold to China."</p>
            <p>Mr. Moolenaar pointed out: "We cannot let the Chinese Communist Party use American chips to train AI models. They could use these models to make their military stronger, stop their people's freedom, and make American new ideas weaker."</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, after this news came out, Nvidia's stock price went down. The US Department of Commerce and Nvidia's representatives did not answer questions right away.</p>

            <h1>歐盟通過第18輪制裁 調降俄國石油出口價格上限</h1>
            <p>Brussels, July 18 (CNA) – The war where Russia fully attacked Ukraine has been going on for over three years. Today, countries in the European Union (EU) agreed to put the 18th set of economic punishments on Russia since the war started. They hope to put more pressure on the Kremlin by making the highest price for Russian oil exports lower.</p>
            <p>The EU's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, Ms. Kaja Kallas, said: "The EU has just approved one of the toughest plans to punish Russia so far."</p>
            <p>This highest price for oil is a system started by the Group of Seven (G7) rich countries. Its goal is to limit how much money Russia makes from selling oil to countries like China and India.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the G7 set the highest price for Russian oil exports at $60 per barrel. With the EU's new plan, the new highest price is now $47.60 per barrel. This price can change in the future based on oil prices. The EU hopes that other G7 allies, like the UK and Canada, will also join this new plan.</p>
            <p>EU officials said that the EU also put over 100 oil tankers from Russia's "shadow fleet" on a list of banned items. These tankers are used to get around the rules on oil exports.</p>
            <p>The EU will also take steps to stop the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea from working again in the future.</p>
