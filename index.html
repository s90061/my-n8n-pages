            <h1>US-Venezuela tensions rise, many UN Security Council members concerned</h1>
            <p>Many countries in the United Nations Security Council showed worry today about the growing tensions between the United States and Venezuela. Russia even said that Washington was using a "shoot first, ask questions later" approach to attack ships that were thought to be carrying drugs.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Russia's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, spoke at a meeting of the 15-member Security Council. He said that Venezuela had good reasons to believe that the US was ready to turn its threats into real actions.</p>
            <p>France, Greece, and Denmark, who are allies of the US, also asked for the situation to calm down. They called for talks to solve the problem and asked everyone to follow international law.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, the US has launched air attacks on several ships near Venezuela that were suspected of carrying drugs. The government of US President Trump had earlier said it was fighting against drug groups. These air attacks made some Democratic members of the US Congress worried. They questioned if these actions were legal, especially as Trump was using more and more power as president.</p>
            <p>John Kelly, a US representative at the meeting, said that Washington "will continue to act strongly to protect our country from drug terrorists."</p>
            <p>Nebenzia said that Russia strongly disagreed with these air attacks. He called them a serious violation of international law and human rights. He said that "shooting at ships with people on them in international waters without a trial or investigation" was like "acting on the cowboy rule of shoot first, ask questions later."</p>
            <p>He added, "And now they ask us to believe that there were criminals on the ships afterwards."</p>
            <p>Samuel Moncada, Venezuela's ambassador to the UN, said at the meeting that because of the US military build-up in the area and Washington's "warlike words and actions," Venezuela "is facing a situation where it can reasonably expect an armed attack soon."</p>
            <p>Ricardo Moscoso, Panama's deputy ambassador to the UN, said that Panama understood the worries about drug smuggling and piracy in the region's waters. He said, "We believe that these problems can be solved not only with military actions but also with planned and continuous strategies."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Panama thinks that the global threats in our region need a united response from all countries. This response should be based on respecting international law and also on our shared promise to keep peace and stability in our part of the world."</p>
            <p>Jay Dharmadhikari, France's deputy representative to the UN, said that France supports working together with many countries to stop smuggling and improve border control. But he also said that these actions must follow international law, including human rights law. He stated, "Because of this, countries must avoid any military actions on their own."</p>

            <h1>Poor children in Vietnam can't afford a NT$45 picture book; Taiwan's love helps them read</h1>
            <p>In Quang Ngai, Vietnam, a girl from Ha Tinh loved to read and wrote a letter. Her words touched many people online and helped save a classmate who was about to leave school. This showed how powerful reading can be. But in Vietnam, a picture book costs about 45 New Taiwan Dollars (NT$), which many families cannot afford. For poor children, reading a book is a special wish that is hard to come true.</p>
            <p>This is a true story told by Huang Chung-shih, the director of the Zhi Shan Foundation's office in Vietnam. This girl, who lived in Ha Tinh Province, was from a poor family and had no books. But after the Zhi Shan Foundation set up a loving reading room in her school with free books, she started to love reading.</p>
            <p>Later, she sent a letter to Huang Chung-shih to say thank you. She also talked about a classmate who was very poor and might have to stop going to school. Huang Chung-shih put the letter online. Her honest words made many people cry and encouraged many to help her classmate continue studying.</p>
            <p>"No books, no toys" is a common situation for children in central Vietnam. There are not many educational resources in rural areas. Huang Chung-shih said, "Many children have almost never seen a book." He explained that a picture book in Vietnam costs about NT$45. Many families cannot buy them, and even if they wanted to, they cannot find bookstores. Toys cost even more.</p>
            <p>Seeing this need, the Zhi Shan Foundation started a reading and early childhood care program in central Vietnam. They built reading rooms in schools, offering free books. They also set up toy libraries where children can play freely.</p>
            <p>One morning in late September, over 20 students at Puhe Elementary and Junior High School in Vietnam sat quietly in their classroom. There was no teacher, but the room was even quieter than during class. This was because the students were deeply focused on the picture books in their hands. In another kindergarten, a group of children were happily playing with toys and did not want to stop.</p>
            <p>These new reading rooms and toy libraries were built by the Qing Bao Qin Lao Foundation and the Zhi Shan Foundation together. Because of their bright decorations, many books, and toys, they became the most popular places in the schools in less than a month.</p>
            <p>According to official Vietnamese numbers, children in central Vietnam read less than one book per year on average. Huang Chung-shih said that many children do not have clear ideas about their future because they lack reading experience. "When you ask them about their dreams, they cannot answer," he said. The reading program aims to open up children's minds. Now, children in the areas served by the foundation read an average of 67 books per school year. Children have learned to express themselves and are willing to think. Reading helps children see not just stories, but also dreams.</p>
            <p>A kindergarten teacher who has worked there for 10 years also said that in the past, children could only play with simple teaching materials made by the teacher. Now, the many toys help children be creative and develop in a balanced way. She said, "Seeing the children play happily truly touches my heart."</p>
            <p>The Zhi Shan Foundation has been working in Vietnam for 30 years. This year, the Qing Bao Qin Lao Foundation kindly gave money to build four reading rooms and one toy library for schools in central Vietnam, including Puhe Elementary and Junior High School. Wang Ping-chen, a representative from the Qing Bao Qin Lao Foundation, said that reading is key to learning and seeing more of the world. He hopes this program will plant seeds of hope in children's hearts and help them break free from poverty.</p>
            <p>The Zhi Shan Foundation continues its reading and early childhood care program in Vietnam. They build reading rooms, kindergartens, and toy libraries for local schools. They also provide money for lunch and soy milk to help children grow up.</p>

            <h1>Seattle mall "Time Gate" appears, takes people through time to Northern Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Tourism Administration is encouraging international travelers to stop in Taiwan. Recently, they set up a "Time Gate" in a shopping mall in the Seattle area. This special red door has white words on it, looking very suitable during the National Day celebrations. When people open each door, they can see immersive videos of famous places in Northern Taiwan. This has made many people stop to look and take pictures.</p>
            <p>This interactive experience is called "Hey Hey Taipei." It uses "doors" as its main idea. This symbolizes how easy it is to travel to and from Taiwan, which acts as a main point in Asia. The Tourism Administration invited tourists and local people in Seattle to open the "Time Gate" and start a journey to Taiwan. Li Szu-hsien, the director of the Tourism Administration's office in San Francisco, hopes this creative design will catch people's attention.</p>
            <p>The "Time Gate" uses changing lights and sounds with immersive videos to show many famous places in Northern Taiwan. These scenes include the romantic sky lanterns floating up in Shifen, the lively sounds of Keelung Miaokou Night Market, the bright night view of Taipei 101, the quiet light and shadow of New Taipei's Yinhe Cave Waterfall, and the moving tides at Laomei Green Reef. Each scene feels like traveling through time, stepping onto the island of Taiwan, and starting a trip.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration has also worked with the international online travel website Expedia and three major airlines. Together, they are offering special travel deals.</p>
            <p>The "Time Gate" is attracting many people in the Seattle mall. At the same time, the Tourism Administration has also started a one-month campaign to promote "Taiwan as a Transit Hub" at two light rail stations in Seattle. This aims to help more people see and feel Taiwan.</p>
