<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia has reportedly secured all production capacity at Wistron's newly opened Taiwan server facility until 2026. This move is to meet the increasing demand for AI servers. According to reports from *Economic Daily*, Nvidia has effectively reserved all future output from this plant.

The facility in Zhubei, Taiwan, which started operations this quarter and was officially opened on June 19, will produce Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. Wistron's CEO confirmed that contracts for AI server production already extend at least a year.

Wistron's operations currently produce an estimated 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter. The company has acknowledged that its current capacity might not be enough to meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has obtained an adjacent building to become a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its output in Taiwan.

AI server shipments are a major growth driver for Wistron, as well as for companies like Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is also expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By booking the full production capacity at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia ensures that its cloud and system partners receive the necessary quantities of AI servers, while competitors face tighter supply. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity shows its strategic goal to dominate the AI hardware market.

**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation came after his speech, where he stated that the island is "of course" a country, supported by historical and legal evidence.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory, belonging to China since ancient times. They consider the island one of their provinces, without the right to be called a state.

President Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have offered to hold talks with China multiple times, but these offers have been rejected. China refers to Lai as a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, claimed that he deliberately twisted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

Their statement said, "It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly incited confrontation across the strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' false beliefs and heresies full of mistakes and omissions."

It added, "The false ideas created by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and law, will only be discarded into the garbage of history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply stating historical facts. They added that Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis."

They further stated, "We urge the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'."

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists, and this remains the island's official name.

Lai has consistently stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future, and since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has faced increased military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.

**Emerging Currencies Pare Drop as Dollar Wavers on Fed, Mideast**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/emerging-assets-drop-us-strike-045157182.html">News Link</a>

Currencies in developing nations saw mixed movements, with Latin American currencies rebounding as investors considered the future of U.S. interest rates and the situation in the Middle East. There was a sense that the conflict would remain limited, which helped ease concerns.

The MSCI index for emerging market currencies nearly recovered its losses after Iran's retaliatory strikes on a U.S. air base in Qatar were viewed as symbolic. This led President Donald Trump to express hope for de-escalation of the conflict. The South African rand, often seen as a sign of risk appetite, led the gains with a 0.7% increase.

However, adjustments at the end of the day still left the index 0.3% lower, with Asian currencies experiencing the largest declines. Meanwhile, the dollar fell after some Federal Reserve officials suggested they might support lowering borrowing costs as early as July.

Iran launched several missiles at a U.S. air base in Qatar, but these were intercepted with no injuries. Investors saw these events as a sign that tensions had reached their peak, leading to optimism for a diplomatic solution. Oil prices dropped more than 9%.

"Financial markets are experiencing a relief rally, and oil prices are falling sharply," said Brendan McKenna, an emerging market strategist at Wells Fargo. "The developments today seem more directed toward de-escalation rather than escalation."

Israel's shekel and its government dollar bonds performed well compared to other emerging market assets.
