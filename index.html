            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: We Won't Give Up Until Ko Wen-je Is Released After Street Clashes with Police</h1>
            <p>Today, Huang Kuo-chang, the leader of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), led a public event about judicial reform. The group faced off against the police early in the morning. Many party members crossed barriers and pushed against police officers several times. The event lasted for six hours and then ended. But Huang Kuo-chang said that they will not stop until Ko Wen-je is released.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je, the former leader of the TPP, has been held for nearly a year. Huang Kuo-chang started the event at 7:30 AM today. He said they want to bring back fairness to the justice system. But the police closed the road to the President's Residence early in the morning. They said the group was breaking the law about public gatherings. However, the people did not leave. They shouted things like "Give us back our road rights," "End the bad law on public gatherings," and "Ko Wen-je is innocent." The two sides faced each other many times.</p>
            <p>Around 11:00 AM, the first pushing started between the two sides. Huang Kuo-chang, other TPP members, and the crowd tried to push down the barriers. Many police officers stood as a wall on the other side of the barriers to stop them. After that, the crowd broke through the first layer of barriers. Many TPP members crossed the barriers and moved over the police line like "body surfing." There were several fights between both sides.</p>
            <p>After 1:00 PM, someone from the Presidential Office came to the site. They received a paper with the group's demands from the TPP. After Huang Kuo-chang gave the paper to the representative from the Presidential Office, Chen Pei-chi stepped forward to share her demands, asking for a fair trial.</p>
            <p>The event finished after about six hours. Huang Kuo-chang announced that the TPP will keep taking action. He said they will not stop until Ko Wen-je is released by the government. He mentioned that this event lasted six hours, but "next time it might be twelve hours."</p>

            <h1>US Senate Committee Shows Support for Taiwan; Taiwan Concerned About Weapon Buys and Suggests Co-Production</h1>
            <p>Roger Wicker, who leads the US Senate Armed Services Committee, finished his two-day visit to Taiwan today. Someone involved in foreign affairs said that the visiting group was happy with how Taiwan is handling its security and how much progress it has made. Taiwan, on its part, shared its worries about delays in buying weapons and said that making weapons together is very important.</p>
            <p>Roger Wicker and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29. They left today at 3:40 PM on a US Air Force plane. This was the first time Wicker led a group to Taiwan since he became the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It was also the first visit by a US Senate Armed Services Committee chairman in nine years.</p>
            <p>The person involved in foreign affairs told the Central News Agency this afternoon that the visiting group reacted positively to the messages Taiwan gave them. The group wanted to show that "the US strongly supports Taiwan and sees Taiwan's efforts in security and defense." They were pleased with Taiwan's actions and progress, which makes the US willing to continue helping Taiwan with its defense efforts.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te met with the group yesterday. He said that Taiwan's defense budget for next year will be more than 3% of its GDP. He expects that by 2030, the defense budget will reach 5% of GDP, like NATO countries. The foreign affairs person said that Wicker and Fischer reacted very positively to this news.</p>
            <p>Regarding the delays in buying weapons, the foreign affairs person said that Taiwan expressed its concern, and the visiting group understood. Taiwan also emphasized how important it is for both sides to make weapons together. Wicker also mentioned that the US Senate Armed Services Committee will start discussing the "2025 National Defense Authorization Act" next Tuesday. This act will include many bills that support Taiwan, which was also one of the messages Wicker wanted to share.</p>
            <p>When asked about opposition parties trying to limit the defense budget, the foreign affairs person stated that the visiting group met with various groups through arrangements made by the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT). They believe the group had good talks and learned that many people in Taiwan agree that the defense budget needs to increase appropriately.</p>
