            <h1>Helping Auto Parts Industry: Ministry Proposes 6 Strategies, Suggests Reviewing Commodity Tax</h1>
            <p>On August 11, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, met with companies from the car parts industry. He wanted to help them deal with new taxes from the United States. The minister suggested 6 ways to help. These include asking the Ministry of Finance to look at car taxes again. This would help people buy new cars and make the market bigger in Taiwan. The Ministry will also help companies buy raw materials together. It will also help China Steel make its production cheaper, so that other companies can also save money.</p>
            <p>Starting August 7, the United States put a 20% extra tax on some products from Taiwan. For car parts, most of them already had a 25% tax since early May. This tax is under Section 232.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said in a press release that Minister Kuo Chih-hui held a meeting this afternoon. The meeting was about how the US taxes affect car parts companies. Big companies that make car parts for repair (AM) and for new cars (OE) were invited. They talked about the taxes between Taiwan and the US, and also about the value of the New Taiwan Dollar. The goal was to hear what the companies think.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo Chih-hui suggested 6 ways to deal with the US taxes and currency changes. First, he wants to use smart ways of making things and AI to help car parts companies. This will make their production lines work better and reduce mistakes. Second, a policy will help companies buy new machines that save energy. This will reduce carbon and lower costs over time, helping companies be more sustainable. Third, companies will buy raw materials together to get better prices. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will also help China Steel make its production cheaper, so smaller companies can benefit.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry will give more support for new ideas in companies. They will get more tax benefits for research and development. The government will help companies quickly and easily with money for research. This will encourage companies to develop new things. The Ministry will ask the Ministry of Finance to check the car tax rules. This will help old cars be replaced faster and make the local market bigger. Finally, the Ministry will help small and medium-sized companies get guarantees to protect themselves from currency changes. This will lower the risk from changing exchange rates.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo Chih-hui said that the government is still talking to the US to get lower taxes. This will help Taiwan's car parts be more competitive in trade. It will also help companies keep their strong position in selling goods to other countries.</p>
            <p>Most car parts companies at the meeting said that Japan and Korea pay only a 15% tax on their parts sent to the US. They suggested that Taiwan should also try to get lower taxes for its parts. They also said that electricity prices, currency changes, raw material costs, and a slow local market are causing problems. They really need the government to keep electricity prices and the currency stable. They also want the government to look at international rules and change laws about repair responsibility. At the same time, by making the local market bigger, they can make sure the car industry stays strong and can continue to grow.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo Chih-hui stated that about 1741 companies in Taiwan make car parts. In the last three years, the value of their exports has been more than 220 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The US market makes up about 50% of these exports. So, companies are very sensitive to changes in taxes and currency. These changes directly affect how much money they make and how well they do in business. The effects can be very big.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuo Chih-hui stressed that the world's trade environment is changing very fast and affects many areas. It is important to talk with companies more often and in different ways. The government needs to connect with the industry quickly and listen to their ideas. This will help create better and stronger plans to support the industry. These plans will help companies turn challenges into chances to grow internationally. This will make their businesses stronger and build Taiwan's car industry's power to compete around the world.</p>

            <h1>Miyano Mamoru Announces 2026 Taipei Concert, Demon Slayer's Doma Role Becomes Focus</h1>
            <p>Japanese artist Mamoru Miyano gave a great performance as "Upper Rank Two, Doma" in the movie "Demon Slayer." Recently, he released a new song called "Try Jumping." He also announced that he will have a concert tour in Taipei next year. This is to get ready for his 8th original album, which will come out in November.</p>
            <p>After 6 years, Mamoru Miyano will perform in Taiwan. Today, he announced in a press release that Taipei will be the first city for his Asian concert tour next year. About his voice acting in "Demon Slayer," Mamoru Miyano said, "I really like Doma. The more I think about Doma, the more I feel he is my favorite character. Some people say he is hard to understand or unpleasant, but because I thought about him so much, I understand him very well. This includes why he does things and what he thinks when he speaks. I studied him completely before acting, so it felt very natural."</p>
            <p>Miyano also said that people might feel "unpleasant" or "hard to accept" about the character he played. But he believes that because the character can make people feel this way, Doma is a complete character. This also helped the work become successful.</p>
            <p>Mamoru Miyano shared that he will release new digital songs in September and October. These songs are to prepare for his new album. The new album will be officially released on November 19.</p>

            <h1>China's Domestic Car Market Share Exceeds 70% in July, Tesla Sales Continue to Decline</h1>
            <p>New numbers show that China sold over 18 million cars in the first seven months of this year, which is a 12% increase. In July, Chinese-made passenger cars made up over 70% of the market. This means foreign brands are selling less. The big electric car company Tesla's sales in China went down by 13.7% in the first seven months. It dropped from third to sixth place in the new energy vehicle ranking.</p>
            <p>According to the "Daily Economic News" from China, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) shared car sales numbers for July today. In July, 2.593 million cars were sold. This is 10.7% less than in June, but 14.7% more than July last year. Chen Shihua, an assistant secretary-general at CAAM, explained that July is usually a slower month for car sales. Also, some factories did their yearly machine checks, so production and sales slowed down a bit.</p>
            <p>The numbers show that from January to July, China made 18.235 million cars and sold 18.269 million cars. This is an increase of 12.7% for production and 12% for sales. The growth rate for both production and sales was a little higher than from January to June.</p>
            <p>The Chinese government continues to give money to people who buy new cars and give in their old ones. In July, 2.287 million passenger cars were sold across the country, which is 14.7% more than last year. From January to July, 15.841 million passenger cars were sold, an increase of 13.4% from last year.</p>
            <p>The data shows that sales of Chinese-made passenger cars keep going up. In July, 1.604 million cars were sold, which is 21.3% more than last year. They made up 70.1% of all passenger car sales, which is 3.8% more than last year. From January to July, 10.873 million Chinese-made passenger cars were sold, an increase of 24.4%. They now have 68.6% of the market, which is 6.1% more than last year. This continues to put pressure on foreign brands.</p>
            <p>Cui Dongshu, the Secretary-General of the China Passenger Car Association, explained that Chinese car companies are using a strategy of "many paths at once" for new energy vehicles (electric cars and hybrid cars). Also, they are doing well in the market for expensive cars. Because of this, the share of Chinese brands in the passenger car market will continue to grow.</p>
            <p>In July, sales of new energy cars in China kept growing quickly. Sales reached 1.262 million, an increase of 27.4% from last year. These cars made up 51.4% of all car sales in China. This is the first time since December last year that new energy cars have made up more than 50% of sales.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Tesla's sales in China did not increase. Instead, they kept going down.</p>
            <p>The numbers show that 811,000 pure electric cars were sold in China in July, a big increase of 47.1%. However, Tesla only sold 68,000 cars in July. This is 5.2% less than in June and 8.4% less than July last year. From January to July, a total of 5.246 million pure electric cars were sold in China, an increase of 46.9%. But Tesla China sold a total of 432,000 cars in the first seven months, which is 13.4% less than last year.</p>
            <p>In the first seven months, Tesla was ranked 11th among car companies in China. Its market share went down to 5.3%. In the new energy vehicle ranking, it dropped to 6th place. The top five companies are BYD, Geely, SAIC, Changan, and Dongfeng.</p>
            <p>In 2024, Tesla's total sales in China reached 657,000 cars. This was a record high, 8.8% more than the year before. At that time, it was ranked 3rd among new energy car companies in China, after BYD (3.718 million cars) and Geely (863,000 cars).</p>
            <p>Also, from January to July, China exported 3.68 million cars, which is 12.8% more than last year. Exports of traditional fuel cars went down by 7% to 2.373 million. However, exports of new energy cars grew a lot, by 84.6%, to 1.308 million.</p>
