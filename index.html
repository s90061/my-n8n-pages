            <h1>ASE Technology Plans to Rebuild Factory for Advanced Chip Packaging</h1>
            <p>ASE Technology Holding (ASEH) said today that its company, ASE Semiconductor, will tear down and rebuild a factory. This factory used to belong to Sumitomo Bakelite Technology. The new building project, called K18B, will be given to a related company, Fuhua Engineering. This is because ASE needs more space for advanced chip packaging in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tung Hung-ssu, ASEH's finance chief, explained this afternoon. He said that to help their Kaohsiung factory grow, ASEH bought Sumitomo Bakelite Technology completely earlier this year. This let them get the land for the factory. Today, they decided to tear down the old factory and build a new one.</p>
            <p>The new factory will have two floors underground and eight floors above ground. It will be about 60,634 square meters in total. ASE Semiconductor looked at four companies that wanted to do the building work. They chose Fuhua Engineering based on their skills, past building projects, how long the work would take, how good the work would be, and how well they would work together. Both companies agreed on a price of NT$4.008 billion, not including tax.</p>
            <p>In the middle of March, ASE Semiconductor announced that it bought all shares of Sumitomo Bakelite Technology from a Japanese company. The main reason for this was to get the right to use the land in Kaohsiung's Nanzih Park for building factories.</p>
            <p>ASE Semiconductor is working hard to make more advanced packaging products. In the middle of August, they also said they would buy a factory and other buildings in Luzhu District, Kaohsiung City, from Winbond Electronics.</p>
            <p>ASE Technology Holding is focusing on advanced packaging in Kaohsiung. They have already put in $200 million to set up their first production line for large fan-out panel level packaging (FOPLP), which can handle sizes up to 600x600.</p>
            <p>In October 2024, ASE Semiconductor started building a new K28 factory. This factory is expected to be ready in 2026. Its main purpose is to make more CoWoS advanced packaging. In August 2024, ASE Semiconductor bought the K18 factory in Nanzih, Kaohsiung, from Hung Ching Construction. This factory will be used for making wafer bumps and flip-chip packaging.</p>
            <p>In late December 2023, ASE also announced that it would rent a factory from Formosa Advanced Technologies in Nanzih, Kaohsiung. This was to make more packaging products. Experts in the industry think this is to increase the amount of advanced packaging for AI (Artificial Intelligence) chips.</p>

            <h1>Chiayi Shopping Festival Starts October 1st, Main Prize is a Camper Van</h1>
            <p>The "Chiayi Good Gifts" shopping festival in Chiayi County will begin on October 1st. It will last for two months. More than 1,000 shops will be part of this event. If you spend NT$200 or more, you can sign up to win prizes. This year, the top prizes are a special camper van worth more than one million NT dollars and a Jimny off-road car.</p>
            <p>Today, the Chiayi County Government held a meeting to share this news. The yearly shopping festival will be from October 1st to November 30th. This year, you can win big prizes like the million-dollar camper van and the off-road car. There are also electric scooters, new iPhone 17s, massage chairs, smart projectors, and over 290 other prizes.</p>
            <p>County leader Weng Chang-liang spoke to reporters. He said this is the fourth time the shopping festival is happening. Many people have liked it every year. This year, they made the festival longer so more people can join.</p>
            <p>Mr. Weng also said that last year, the Chiayi County shopping festival made over NT$450 million in sales. This year, the event is even bigger. During the festival, if you spend NT$200 or more at any of the 19 business areas or shops from the Grand Chiayi Tourism Factory Association, you can go online to get a lucky draw number. You can spend and get numbers as many times as you want, so spending more gives you a better chance to win.</p>
            <p>Ms. Li Ya-ping, who leads the Economic Development Department, said they made it easier to join. The registration will now work with the government's electronic invoice system. You can connect your cloud invoice account on the sign-up page. Then, after you buy something, you will automatically get a lucky draw number. For paper receipts or shops that do not give invoices, the steps to sign up have also been made simpler, so people can finish faster.</p>

            <h1>Johnny Chiang Hopes for Good Results in Taiwan-US Tariff Talks</h1>
            <p>A group from an American think tank called the Institute for Indo-Pacific Security (IIPS) visited Taiwan's parliament today. Johnny Chiang, the vice leader of the parliament, said he hopes that talks about taxes on goods between Taiwan and the US will end well for both sides. He also wants Taiwan to join more regional security talks and global groups so people can hear Taiwan's ideas.</p>
            <p>Mr. Randall G. Schriver, who used to work for the US defense department, led the IIPS group. This morning, they met with Mr. Chiang and other parliament members from different political parties. Mr. Schriver first sent his sadness for the people who died in the Hualien disaster and wished for the rescue work to go smoothly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang said that Mr. Schriver's old group, "Project 2049 Institute," changed its name to "Institute for Indo-Pacific Security" on May 1st this year. This shows that the Indo-Pacific area is becoming more complex and that they care a lot about its safety.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang said that Taiwan and the US have been friends for a long time because they share important ideas like democracy, freedom, human rights, and fair laws. They also work together to keep the area peaceful, rich, and steady. Lately, the US government, through laws like the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and help for military money (FMF) or presidential orders (PDA), has helped Taiwan get stronger in defense and safety. Taiwan is in an important place in the West Pacific. It knows its key role and its duty to be safe. Taiwan will keep working with the US and other friends in the region to deal with problems and dangers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang explained that Taiwan is important for its location and for its economy. It plays a big part in making computer chips and other products for the world. In the future, companies like TSMC making chips and other Taiwanese companies doing quick assembly will become even more important. Because of its location and its role in making things, Taiwan is a very important partner for the US in its plans around the world.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang said that because Taiwan is so important, it will continue to act as a good partner in the region and a good citizen of the world. It will also show that it is ready to defend itself. The government has said that next year's defense budget will be more than 3% of the country's total income. The parliament should check what the government does, and all political parties should talk about any money spent, plans, or purchases that help Taiwan's defense. They should make the best choices for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang added that besides safety, the most important thing for Taiwan-US relations right now is talks about taxes on goods. He hopes these talks will lead to a good result for both sides and create a free, fair, and helpful trade relationship.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang said he hopes Taiwan can have more chances to talk with the US. He also wants Taiwan to join more discussions about safety in the region and other global groups. If Taiwan's ideas can be heard by other countries and discussed globally, it can help make the world safer and more peaceful.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schriver said he was happy to meet with parliament members from different parties. He said that to talk about problems everyone cares about, it is important to hear different ideas and work together.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schriver used a famous saying from an American basketball coach, John Wooden: "Be quick but don't hurry." He said this might sound strange. Many Americans say Taiwan's defense money needs to be approved quickly, and many things are urgent. But the parliament, which speaks for the people and checks the government, needs to make sure that any extra defense money is used wisely and for the right things.</p>
            <p>Mr. Schriver said that his group, the Institute for Indo-Pacific Security, and the American people are happy to give more help to Taiwan's parliament and its people. This is because the group studies how wars change and knows what Taiwan needs, not just about computer chips. He hopes they can continue to talk in the future.</p>
