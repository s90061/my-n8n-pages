            <h1>Man Took Money for House Repairs from Typhoon Victims in Tainan and Disappeared; Police Caught Him in Hengchun</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Yang Si-rui, Tainan, July 20) In Tainan City's Xuejia District, a 70-year-old man named Chen had his house damaged by a typhoon. He looked online for workers to fix it. A man agreed to do the repairs. But after he asked for a deposit of NT$190,000 and received it, he disappeared. Last night, the police found the 31-year-old man, Mr. Zhou, in Hengchun Township, Pingtung, and arrested him.</p>
            <p>Huang Hsin-pei, who leads the detective team at the Xuejia Police Station in Tainan City, told reporters that the police got a report from the victim on July 18. The victim said his house roof was damaged by the typhoon. He could not find workers to help for many days, so he posted a request for help online. A person on the internet called "Jiang Wei" kindly offered help. He came to the house and did some repairs. Then, he made the victim sign a contract for a large amount of money for the repair work.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said that the person who reported the crime told the police that the worker asked for a large deposit before finishing the repairs. He asked for the money in several parts, totaling NT$190,000, and then he disappeared. The victim felt something was wrong and reported it to the police. After getting the report, the Xuejia Police Station worked with the Tainan City Criminal Investigation Division, Taichung City Police, Nantou County Police, and Pingtung County Police. They formed a special team to find the man.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said that after their investigation, they quickly found out who the suspect was. They used vehicle information to track him. The suspect tried to escape the police by turning off his phone, changing cars, and moving around at night. But the special team found and arrested him last night in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County. After questioning, the police will send the case to the prosecutors.</p>
            <p>Wu Jian-de, the head of the Xuejia Police Station, wants to remind everyone to be careful when choosing companies for home repairs. If a company you don't know well asks for a lot of money before they finish the work, it might be a scam. You should be careful and check everything carefully. This is the best way to avoid being cheated. (Editor: Tsai Chia-min) July 20, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Hsinchu City Dual Recall Vote Nears; Both Sides Hold Rallies in Final Week</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Lu Kang-chun, Hsinchu City, July 19) The recall vote is coming soon. Tonight, groups in Hsinchu City who want to recall officials held an event. They asked people to vote to remove those who are not doing their job well. The people facing recall, Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an (who is currently suspended from duty) and Kuomintang Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien, also held rallies. They hope citizens will go out and vote against the misuse of power.</p>
            <p>Tonight, the Hsinchu City recall group, "Hsinchu Dual Recall," held an event at the 228 Memorial Park in Hsinchu City. The event was called "Recall is Love, Against Communism, Protect Taiwan." Legislator Ker Chien-ming, who leads the Democratic Progressive Party group in the Legislative Yuan, and several Hsinchu City council members from the same party came to support the event.</p>
            <p>Ker Chien-ming gave a speech. He said he was the first to call for a big recall. The main goal is "to fight communism and protect Taiwan." He said the Kuomintang and Taiwan People's Party in the Legislative Yuan not only want to give the country to China but also want to weaken the central government through the "Fiscal Equalization Act." He also said that Cheng Cheng-chien rarely goes to the Legislative Yuan. Kao Hung-an was found guilty of corruption in her first trial. He believes all these people who are not fit for their jobs should be recalled.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chieh, the spokesperson for Hsinchu Dual Recall, stated that Kao Hung-an did not value the chance given by Hsinchu citizens. City development has stopped, and local areas are not being taken care of. He added that Cheng Cheng-chien is involved in many lawsuits and is possibly working with the Chinese Communist Party. He asked people to recall those who have not done their job well and have disappointed the public. He wants Hsinchu City to get its development moving again.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the Taiwan People's Party held a rally at Tiangongtan Park in Hsinchu City. It was called "July 19 Against Bad Recalls, Protect Hsinchu." Besides Party Chairman Huang Kuo-chang, Miaoli County Magistrate Chung Tung-chin, Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui, and New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih also came to speak. They all asked people to vote "no" to support Kao Hung-an and Cheng Cheng-chien.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the Legislative Yuan is working to add holidays, reform the justice system, and support workers and soldiers. But he said the Democratic Progressive Party is using government power to control those who disagree with them. He asked his supporters to vote on July 26. He wants them to protect democratic values, stand together against misuse of power, and end this "big show."</p>
            <p>Kao Hung-an said in her speech that the Democratic Progressive Party started this recall. She reminded citizens to understand how a "one-party recall" would affect democracy and city affairs. If she is recalled, citizens will not have the right to choose. The central government will then directly send someone to take over. She asked citizens to vote "no to recall" to protect Hsinchu City's development.</p>
            <p>Cheng Cheng-chien pointed out that the Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for a long time but has not increased Hsinchu City's shared tax money. Instead, it has limited the city government's building projects. He asked citizens to vote "no to recall" on July 26. He wants them to refuse political attacks and protect Hsinchu City's future development and fair share of resources. (Editor: Chen Yen-chun) July 19, 2025.</p>
