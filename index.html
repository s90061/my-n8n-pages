<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility, and provocation, following a speech in which he said the island is "of course" a country and that historical evidence and legal proof support this claim.

Beijing states that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have offered talks with China multiple times, but these offers have been rejected. China refers to Lai as a "separatist".

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had intentionally twisted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions," it said in a statement.

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality, and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

In response, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Lai was simply stating historical facts, and Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that, as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Taiwan has over the past five years faced increased military and political pressure from China, including war games.

**Taiwan Expo Deepens AI Cooperation with Malaysia**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%BD%A2%E8%B1%A1%E5%B1%95-%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%88%87%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9Eai%E5%90%88%E4%BD%9C-213000941.html">News Link</a>

Taipei, June 23 (CNA) ‚Äì The Bureau of Foreign Trade of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) are holding the Taiwan Expo in Malaysia this month at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC). This is the eighth time the exhibition has been held, and it is the largest in history, focusing on AI-driven smart manufacturing and applications. TAITRA stated that Taiwan has strong capabilities in semiconductors, information and communication technology, smart manufacturing, and system integration. Malaysia, on the other hand, aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center and is accelerating its digital infrastructure development. The two countries are expected to establish a broader cooperative and complementary relationship.

Malaysia aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center, with both sides complementing each other.

TAITRA Secretary-General Wang Hsi-meng said that this year's expo focuses on five major themes: smart manufacturing, the big health industry, green sustainability, smart living, and tourism and culture. He specifically highlighted the potential for deeper cooperation between Taiwan and Malaysia in smart manufacturing, stating that by combining their expertise, both sides can upgrade smart systems and jointly achieve their digital vision.

TAITRA added that Malaysia is seeking to become Southeast Asia's largest data center, and in recent years has actively set up data centers and promoted 5G digital infrastructure. This has led to strong demand for high-performance computing, data analytics, and smart applications. Taiwan, in turn, produces over 90% of advanced AI chips, providing a crucial hardware foundation for global AI innovation. To meet Malaysia's AI needs, this year's expo also highlights AI, and for the first time, features an "AI Innovation Application Zone" to showcase the latest technologies in Taiwan's AI ecosystem.

TAITRA noted that Malaysia has designated the health industry as one of its key national development areas. The post-pandemic era has further highlighted the importance of digital health solutions and remote care. This year's health industry pavilion also demonstrates Taiwan's innovation and integrated applications in fields such as preventive medicine and precision diagnostics.

Regarding green sustainability, Wang Hsi-meng stated that Malaysia has ambitious environmental policy goals, and Taiwan can offer practical solutions to improve energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies, helping factories move towards a more sustainable and competitive future.

**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%A5%A8%E5%83%B9%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train (ÂçÄÈñìËªä) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

TRA fares will be fully adjusted on June 23, with an average increase of 26.8%. This adjustment covers various train ticket prices, lost and found return fees, luggage, and bicycle transportation fees. For example, the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will increase by NT$153. In addition to fare adjustments, TRA will implement a major timetable change on June 26, and revise its refund policy for delays and other promotional measures. Taiwan PASS prices will also be adjusted, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version seeing the highest increase.

This fare adjustment marks the end of a 30-year freeze on TRA prices. Specifically, local train fares from Taipei to Banqiao will increase from NT$15 to NT$22, and the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will increase to NT$975. Luggage and parcel fees will see an average increase of 36%, with items under 70 kg for distances within 300 km increasing from NT$70 to NT$100, a hike of 43%. Transportation scholar Huang Tai-sheng noted that TRA's price increase is significant, roughly one-third.

In addition to fare increases, TRA's discount measures have also been reduced. The free mileage for using EasyCard or iPASS on Tze-Chiang Limited Express trains will be shortened to 50 km. The "Love Child Ticket," which used to cost one-quarter of the full fare for children aged 6 to 12 with disabilities, will also be canceled, though children aged 6 to 12 will still receive a half-fare discount. For residents of Hualien and Taitung, TRA offers point rewards, with 8 times points on weekdays and 5 times on holidays, which can be used to offset ticket purchases.

Regarding train delays, TRA has also set new rules. If a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes due to a malfunction or reasons not attributable to the passenger, or if the departure time is uncertain, passengers can choose not to travel and apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Huang Tai-sheng pointed out that if the High-Speed Rail were to follow suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to manage demand by adjusting prices. He hopes that TRA passengers will not switch to the High-Speed Rail.

It is worth noting that the TPASS commuter monthly pass is not affected by this price increase, but the government's subsidy amount will increase. Transportation scholar Chang Sheng-hsiung believes that while it will not create a financial black hole, it will indeed increase the financial burden. He explained that the increased burden mainly comes from the TRA portion, while the use of MRT, city buses, and national highway buses remains unaffected.

The Taiwan PASS offered by the Tourism Administration will also see price adjustments, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version having the largest increase, from NT$1900 to NT$2500. This comprehensive fare adjustment means that the public will face higher costs for their daily commuting and transportation.
