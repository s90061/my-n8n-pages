            <h1>Israeli Military: Fighting in Gaza Will Not Stop Unless Hostages are Released Quickly</h1>
            <p>Sami, the head of the Israeli military, said today that if talks with Hamas do not lead to the quick release of hostages, the Israeli military will continue fighting in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military shared a statement. Sami spoke to Israeli officers in Gaza. He said, "I think in the next few days, we will know if we can make a deal to free our hostages. If not, the fighting will go on and not stop."</p>
            <p>The Israeli army also released a video. It showed Sami watching soldiers in a control center.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that Hamas took 251 people when they attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Now, 49 of these people are still in Gaza, which Hamas controls. 27 of them have died.</p>
            <p>This week, some Palestinian armed groups shared two videos. In these videos, some hostages looked thin and weak.</p>
            <p>The USA, Egypt, and Qatar helped Israel and Hamas talk about stopping the fighting and releasing hostages. But the talks failed in July. After that, some Israelis wanted stronger military actions.</p>
            <p>But Israel also felt more pressure from other countries and from its own people. They asked for new talks with Hamas to stop the fighting. Many families of the hostages also asked for this.</p>
            <p>At the same time, groups that help people warned that people in Gaza are facing hunger. This is because Israel has limited aid.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Hits Thailand, Causes 6 Deaths and Affects Over 230,000 People</h1>
            <p>Today, Thailand's disaster agency said that Typhoon Wipha has caused floods and mudslides since July 21. These have killed 6 people across Thailand and affected more than 230,000 people.</p>
            <p>The disaster agency said that Wipha brought heavy rain. This caused floods in 12 areas of Thailand, mostly in the north or middle parts.</p>
            <p>Pictures on social media showed dirty floodwater. Houses had sandbags outside them. People were using rubber boats to move through flooded streets.</p>
            <p>Luckily, Thailand's weather office said that the rain will get less in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Every year from May to October, Thailand has monsoon rains. But scientists say that climate change, caused by humans, is making weather more extreme. This means there is a higher chance of very strong floods.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Thailand had very big floods. More than 500 people died, and millions of homes were damaged.</p>

            <h1>Hawks Win Against Dragons Because of Rain; Foreign Pitcher Hagens Is First This Season to Get 10 Wins</h1>
            <p>Today, the TSG Hawks played the Wei Chuan Dragons at home. Their foreign pitcher, Bradin Hagens, played well, allowing only 1 run in 5 innings. The game ended early because of rain, and the Hawks won 5 to 1. Hagens not only got his 10th win this season, being the first pitcher to do so, but he also achieved 20 wins in a row over two seasons.</p>
            <p>The Hawks are playing well in the second half of the season. In today's game against the Dragons, they started scoring in the first inning. Wang Po-hsuan hit a single. Then, the Dragons' foreign pitcher, Aaron Leasher, had trouble throwing strikes. This allowed the Hawks' foreign hitter Steven Moya, Chang Chao-yuan, and Wang Po-jung to walk. Kuo Fu-lin was hit by a pitch, and Tseng Yu-ching also walked. Because of this, the Hawks scored 3 runs in one inning.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 4th inning, the Hawks scored again. Wu Nien-ting hit a double to left field. Then, Yen Yu-hsuan, who came in to bat, hit a timely single to center field. This gave the Hawks another important run. The Dragons scored 1 run in the top of the 5th inning. But "the Great King" Wang Po-jung hit a home run to right field in the bottom of the 5th. The game was stopped early because of rain. The Hawks won by 4 runs at home.</p>
            <p>In this game, the Hawks' foreign pitcher, Bradin Hagens, started. He pitched 5 innings, giving up 5 hits and only 1 run. He also struck out 2 batters. He is the first pitcher in the CPBL this season to reach 10 wins. He has also won 20 games in a row over two seasons. He has not lost a game since joining the Hawks and has not lost in almost two years.</p>
            <p>The Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions, who won the first half of the season, played against the Fubon Guardians today. Their foreign pitcher, Felix Pena, pitched well, giving up only 1 run in 7 innings. In the 7th inning, their catcher Chen Chung-yu and Chen Sheng-ping hit back-to-back home runs. The Lions won 5 to 3 and have now won 3 games in a row.</p>
