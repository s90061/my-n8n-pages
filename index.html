<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s overseas branch plans to issue $10 billion in new shares. This is their largest effort yet to manage the changing value of the local currency.

TSMC Global Ltd. will issue these shares to help protect against currency fluctuations, the company announced. This is the third such deal since 2024, and by far the biggest. These actions have happened when the Taiwan dollar was getting stronger. The moves give TSMC Global, which handles overseas investments and currency hedging, more financial flexibility to deal with exchange rate risks.

Recent increases in the Taiwan dollar have caused concern in Taipei because the economy relies heavily on exports. In May, the currency made its largest one-day gain since the 1980s, leading the central bank to ask for measures to control speculation.

"Generally speaking, increased currency volatility would mean that banks might be changing their margin requirements," said Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco in Singapore. "Issuing new shares and bringing in an immediate cash injection could help companies meet the margin requirements for both existing and new hedges."

TSMC, a major chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is Taiwan's largest company and exporter, as most of its production is local. A stronger Taiwan dollar harms exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would be worth less in local currency, or they would need to raise prices overseas, which could reduce demand.

In June, CEO C. C. Wei informed shareholders that the company's operating profit margin had dropped by several percentage points due to the stronger local currency.

**Taiwan's new AI supercomputer Nano5, Compal, ASE and other Taiwanese manufacturers adopt its computing power**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%96%B0ai%E8%B6%85%E7%B4%9A%E9%9B%BB%E8%85%A6nano5-%E4%BB%81%E5%AF%B6%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E5%85%89%E7%AD%89%E5%8F%B0%E5%BB%A0%E6%8E%A1%E7%94%A8%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B-073107510.html">News Link</a>

(Central News Agency, Taipei, June 24) The National Center for High-performance Computing (NCHC) under the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) held a press conference today to demonstrate how its new national AI supercomputer, Nano 5, is driving innovation and improvements in the semiconductor industry. Companies and academic institutions such as Compal Electronics, ASE Technology Holding, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, and National Cheng Kung University also attended and shared their experiences.

It is understood that Nano 5, Taiwan's new generation AI supercomputer, is scheduled to launch on June 25th. It features NVIDIA H100 GPUs, providing strong AI computing capabilities to various industries.

The NCHC stated that Nano 5 will combine Taiwan's strengths in semiconductors to create a complete AI ecosystem, forming an "AI Team Taiwan."

Nano 5 has a computing power of 4.15 Petaflops. Companies like Synopsys have already benefited from using Nano 5 to make their semiconductor design processes better. Additionally, 15 AI startups are also using Nano 5 to speed up their AI model development and implementation. The NCHC aims to provide full support for Taiwan's AI development, from advanced research to industrial applications.

**Nvidia Secures Entire Wistron Plant Through 2026 to Build AI Servers**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) has reportedly reserved all production capacity at Wistron's newly opened server facility in Taiwan until 2026. This move is to meet the increasing demand for AI servers, as reported by Economic Daily.

Nvidia has reportedly secured all server manufacturing capacity at Wistron's recently launched plant in Zhubei, Taiwan. This is for the production of its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. These orders, which extend through 2026, show Nvidia's strong effort to guarantee essential AI infrastructure capacity, as demand continues to be higher than supply.

The plant began operations this quarter and was officially opened on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production are already in place for at least a year. Economic Daily and Commercial Times reported that Nvidia has effectively secured all future output from the plant.

Wistron's combined operations are estimated to produce 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter. The company has warned that its current capacity might not meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has acquired an adjacent building to serve as a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its production in Taiwan.

AI server shipments have become a main driver of growth not only for Wistron but also for Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is simultaneously expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By reserving full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is ensuring that its cloud and system partners receive the necessary quantities of AI servers, while competitors face tighter supply limitations. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity indicates its strategic goal to dominate the AI hardware ecosystem.
