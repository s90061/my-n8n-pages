        const text = `**Ukraine's Prime Minister May Change; Zelensky Begins Government Reform**

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky announced a plan to change the government. He has suggested Yuliia Svyrydenko, who is currently the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy, to become the new Prime Minister. She will replace Denys Shmyhal, who has been in the role since 2020. This change is part of a larger reform to make the government work better, especially to improve the economy, help citizens more, and make more weapons in Ukraine.

Zelensky believes Svyrydenko will bring new ideas and changes to the government. He is looking forward to seeing her plans soon. Svyrydenko, 39, has experience in both private business and government, focusing on economic development and trade. She has also been important in energy cooperation with the US.

Because of the war, Ukraine spends a lot on defense and relies on help from other countries for social and public services. Zelensky choosing Svyrydenko may mean he wants to improve how money is managed and how resources are used inside the country. For a new Prime Minister to be appointed, the current Prime Minister, Shmyhal, must resign, and then the parliament needs to vote. Since Zelensky's party has most of the seats in parliament, it is expected that the new nomination will be approved.
