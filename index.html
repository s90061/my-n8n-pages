            <h1>Two Men Lost on Baxianshan Mountain in Taichung, Rescued with Help from Other Hikers</h1>
            <p>Taichung, September 28th â€“ Two hikers from Taichung went missing on September 26th after climbing Baxianshan Mountain. The fire department received a report from helpful hikers who pinpointed their location. The two men were found yesterday and arrived at the mountain entrance early this morning.

            <h1>US Government Faces Another Shutdown Risk; Trump to Meet with Congress Leaders on September 29th</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 27th â€“ As the US federal government's budget is about to run out on September 30th, White House officials said today that President Trump will meet with high-ranking leaders from both parties in Congress on September 29th. They will talk about government funding to avoid the government stopping its operations.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had previously posted on his social media that he no longer planned to talk with Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives. These talks were about the government funding problem before the September 30th budget deadline.</p>
            <p>Jeffries and Schumer released a joint statement tonight. They confirmed that they would meet with Trump on September 29th and said, "We are determined to avoid a government shutdown."</p>
            <p>The main disagreement now is about "discretionary spending," which is about one-fourth of the 7 trillion dollar federal budget. If Congress cannot agree by September 30th, the US government will face its 15th shutdown since 1981.</p>
            <p>The House of Representatives had earlier passed a temporary spending bill to keep the federal government running until November 21st. However, Democratic senators refused to support it. They asked Republicans to negotiate a plan that both parties could agree on, which might include extending the Affordable Care Act subsidies that are ending soon.</p>
            <p>The American political news website "Punchbowl News" was the first to report today that Trump would meet with congressional leaders on September 29th.</p>

            <h1>Russian Foreign Minister Criticizes Israel, Accusing It of Trying to Ignite Middle East Conflict</h1>
            <p>New York, United Nations Headquarters, September 27th â€“ Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov today accused Israel of trying to "ignite" the entire Middle East. He criticized Israel's recent military actions against Iran and Qatar and spoke against the idea of right-wing Israelis taking over the West Bank.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Lavrov said at the UN General Assembly: "Israel's illegal use of force against Palestinians, and now its aggressive actions against Iran, Qatar, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, are threatening the whole Middle East region."</p>
            <p>Lavrov strongly criticized the idea from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's extreme right-wing allies to take over the West Bank. This would stop the possibility of a Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>He stated: "There is absolutely no reason to take over the West Bank. What we are really dealing with is a hidden coup. They want to completely get rid of the UN resolutions about creating a Palestinian state."</p>
            <p>In the past week, several Western countries, including France and the United Kingdom, have recognized a Palestinian state. This shows their unhappiness with Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The United States, an ally of Israel, strongly disagrees with recognizing a Palestinian state. However, after some Arab allies showed their concern, US President Trump also advised Netanyahu not to take over the West Bank.</p>
            <p>Lavrov spoke with sarcasm about the timing of Western countries recognizing a Palestinian state. He asked, "Why are they making this decision now?"</p>
            <p>He suggested that these countries might be thinking: they will only make a statement when the UN General Assembly meets, "by which time, under Israel's attack, there will be nothing left of Gaza, and no Palestinians."</p>
            <p>Russia has recognized the State of Palestine since the time of the Soviet Union. Even so, Israel has tried to keep good relations with Moscow. This is because Russia has a lot of power in the Middle East and there is a large Jewish community in Russia.</p>
