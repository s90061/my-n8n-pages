            <h1>Foreign Investors Buy Taiwan Stocks for 9th Day, Add NT$7.3 Billion, Heavily Sell Taishin Financial Preferred Shares</h1>
            <p>Market waits for news about tariffs and company earnings. Taiwan stocks today stayed around the same level. The Taiex index finished slightly down by 9.35 points, closing at 23364.38 points. Big investors bought a total of NT$10.546 billion. Foreign investors bought an additional NT$7.361 billion. They bought a lot of airline stocks but sold a lot of Taishin Fintech and Taishin Financial stocks.</p>
            <p>Today, technology stocks rested. Traditional industry stocks supported the market. The Taiex finished slightly down by 9.35 points, at 23364.38 points. The total value of trades was NT$291.926 billion. This week, the Taiex moved up and down, and the weekly closing was down by 18.75 points.</p>
            <p>Looking at what the three main types of investors did, all of them bought stocks today. Foreign investors (not including their own trading) bought stocks for the 9th day in a row, buying NT$7.361 billion today. Investment trusts bought NT$2.098 billion, and dealers bought NT$1.087 billion.</p>
            <p>For individual stocks, the top 3 stocks foreign investors bought today were Evergreen Marine (17,259 shares), Yuanta Futures Brent Crude Oil ERN (00715L) (10,572 shares), and E.SUN Financial (10,243 shares). Foreign investors also bought China Airlines (7,864 shares), placing it 5th. Both major airline companies were among the top 5 stocks bought by foreign investors.</p>
            <p>The top 3 stocks foreign investors sold today were Taishin Fintech (280,893 shares), Taishin Financial (51,259 shares), and Nan Ya Plastics (7,598 shares).</p>
            <p>It's important to note that Taishin Financial and Shin Kong Financial finished merging yesterday. Today, foreign investors sold a large amount of Taishin Fintech, 280,000 shares. Taishin Fintech is a special type of preferred stock issued after the "Xin-Xin merger." Taishin Financial's regular shares were also heavily sold by foreign investors today, over 50,000 shares.</p>
            <p>Today, big technology stocks were quiet, and money moved to traditional industry stocks. Paper and steel industries showed strong performance. Cai Ming-Han, a manager at Cathay Securities, thinks this is good. He explained that last week, TSMC's earnings report was good, but sadly, its stock price did not reach a new high. The market became more careful, and money moved to raw material stocks that were at lower prices. This is a healthy movement of money between different industries.</p>
            <p>Cai Ming-Han observed that recently, traditional industries like petrochemicals, ceramics, paper, and steel have been rising. There haven't been very clear big good news events for them. The main reason is probably that their stock prices were quite low. Also, when traditional industry stocks rise, it often happens when the overall market index does not rise. This shows that money is moving from one place to another.</p>

            <h1>Central Taiwan Film and TV Base Talent Development Program Shows Results; TV Series Scenes Recreated Attract Attention</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Su Mu-Chun, Taichung, July 25) The "Central Taiwan Film and TV Base Talent Development Program," supported by the Ministry of Culture and Taichung City Government, held its results presentation today. It showed scenes from the TV series "Heaven on the Fourth Floor" recreated. The organizers hope this program helps train students and makes Taichung a place where film and TV talent grows.</p>
            <p>The "Central Taiwan Film and TV Base Talent Development Program â€“ Film Art Design and Set Decoration Workshop" is supported by the Bureau of Audiovisual and Music Industry Development, Ministry of Culture, and Taichung City Government Information Bureau. It is organized by Chaoyang University of Technology and China Motion Picture Corporation. Today, the results presentation was held at the Central Taiwan Film and TV Base. Many people attended, including Chen Yu, Deputy Director of Taichung City Government Information Bureau, and Hsu Sung-Chi, Vice President of Chaoyang University of Technology.</p>
            <p>Chen Yu spoke at the event. She said that this workshop is now in its third year. The city government continues to give money for it. Through this workshop, students are trained, and people from the industry are also drawn back to learn. This is very important for the long-term growth of the film and TV industry. She also hopes that Taichung will become a place where film and TV talent can grow.</p>
            <p>Hsu Sung-Chi said that the workshop combines studios and practical training to offer courses for training film art professionals. This year, over 100 students from 17 universities and colleges in Taiwan and other countries applied. These students came from film, theater stage design, interior design, and visual communication departments. In the end, 24 students were chosen to join the 17-day intensive practical course.</p>
            <p>Hsu Sung-Chi also mentioned that this year, people already working in the industry could join. This helps share knowledge and skills deeply within the industry. University professors from related subjects were also invited to observe the classes. This helped them understand current film and TV practical skills and how to connect teaching with industry trends.</p>
            <p>The organizers explained that this workshop used the TV series "Heaven on the Fourth Floor" as the main text for creation. It included a full work process: reading the script, deciding on the art style, arranging for set building, making the sets, and handling props and their look. This allowed students to work in real studio spaces. The Central Taiwan Film and TV Base will be open to the public for free on July 26th and 27th, from 11 AM to 4 PM.</p>

            <h1>Ko Wen-je's Request to Vote in Recall Election Denied; Lawyers File Appeal</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Hsing-En, Taipei, July 25) Former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je is in custody because of the Jinghua City case. He asked for a temporary order to allow him to vote in the recall election tomorrow. The Taipei High Administrative Court denied his request this morning. Ko Wen-je's lawyer, Hsiao Yi-Hung, filed an appeal this afternoon.</p>
            <p>The Taipei High Administrative Court stated that once they receive the appeal document, they will send the case files to the Supreme Administrative Court for review, as required by law.</p>
            <p>This case started because Ko Wen-je was accused by the Taipei District Prosecutors Office in the Jinghua City case. The case is now being heard by the Taipei District Court. The Taipei District Court decided that it could not be sure he would not destroy evidence or talk to other people involved in the case or witnesses. So, the reason and need for keeping him in custody still exist. The court recently decided to keep Ko Wen-je in custody for another 2 months, starting from August 2nd.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je asked for a temporary order. He said that according to election laws, he has the right to vote. He asked the Taipei City Election Commission and the Agency of Corrections, Ministry of Justice (Taipei Detention Center) to allow him to vote in the recall election for the 11th Legislator (Taipei City's 6th Election District) Lo Chih-Chiang before the administrative lawsuit is finished. He suggested three ways: setting up a polling place in the detention center, voting by mail, or being escorted to a specific polling place.</p>
            <p>The Taipei High Administrative Court heard the case yesterday and made its decision today. The court's decision said that according to election laws, voters must vote in person where they are registered. How to let people in custody vote is something the legislature needs to think about carefully. The Detention Act does not have rules for this. If escorting is too strict, it can harm a person's rights. If it's too loose, it increases the chance of escape and makes security more difficult, which could harm public safety.</p>
            <p>The court's decision stated that if they temporarily allowed Ko Wen-je's request, the big harm it would cause to public interest by affecting the election results would be much greater than the harm of not allowing his request and then him winning the case later. So, the court denied the request. An appeal can be made.</p>
