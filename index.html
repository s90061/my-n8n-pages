            <h1>Oracle Stock Jumps 40%, Founder Ellison Becomes Richest Person, Ahead of Musk</h1>
            <p>Oracle, a big software company in the US, saw its stock price go up by more than 40%. Because of this, the company's founder, Larry Ellison, now has more money than Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla. Ellison is now the richest person in the world.</p>
            <p>By 10 AM today in New York, Larry Ellison's total wealth was almost 400 billion US dollars. According to Bloomberg, Elon Musk's wealth is about 385 billion US dollars right now.</p>
            <p>After Ellison and Musk, the next richest people are Mark Zuckerberg, who started Meta; Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon; and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who started Google.</p>
            <p>Ellison's money grew fast because he and his family have been working hard in artificial intelligence (AI), media, and politics.</p>
            <p>Oracle's stock went up a lot today because the company said it has over 450 billion US dollars in cloud service orders that are not yet delivered. Also, Oracle signed deals worth billions of dollars for computing services with Nvidia, a big AI company, and OpenAI, which supports ChatGPT.</p>
            <p>The Ellison family's business reach is also growing. Larry Ellison's son, David, recently bought Paramount Global for 8 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison is a strong supporter of President Trump. He recently visited the White House. There, he announced a plan to build large data centers with Masayoshi Son, the head of Japan's SoftBank Group, and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison is 81 years old. He started Oracle more than 40 years ago. Today, during trading, the company's total value almost reached 1 trillion US dollars.</p>

            <h1>European Stocks Had Mixed Results as US Rate Cut Hopes Balanced Geopolitical Risks</h1>
            <p>Today, the main stock markets in Europe had different results, with some going up and some going down. This happened because people expect the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to lower interest rates. This expectation made people less worried about the growing political problems around the world.</p>
