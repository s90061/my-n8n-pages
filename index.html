            <h1>Companies on Taiwan's GreTai Securities Market Had Strong Sales in September and the First Nine Months</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's GreTai Securities Market announced that in September, all companies on this market had a total income of NT$259.8 billion. This was 7% more than the same month last year. 485 companies earned more money, 369 companies earned less, and one company's income stayed the same.</p>
            <p>The GreTai Securities Market released a press statement today. It said that 856 companies on the market needed to report their September income. This included 28 KY companies (companies registered overseas but listed in Taiwan). All but one company, Da Lue International Holding (4804), reported their income before October 13.</p>
            <p>The GreTai Securities Market also stated that for the first nine months of this year, all companies on the market earned a total of NT$2.2033 trillion. This is an 8% increase compared to the same period last year. During this time, 515 companies earned more, 339 companies earned less, and one company's income stayed the same. This shows that the companies on this market are growing well.</p>
            <p>The GreTai Securities Market explained that the main industries that earned more in September compared to last year were the semiconductor industry, other electronic industries, and electronic component industries. The semiconductor industry grew because of the demand for AI (Artificial Intelligence) applications and cloud computing services. Other electronic industries grew because of new factory construction for semiconductors and the need for cooling systems for AI servers. The electronic component industry grew due to the demand for AI servers and other advanced products.</p>
            <p>However, the main industries that earned less in September were building materials and construction, electronic sales channels, and the steel industry. Building materials and construction companies' income depends on when their building projects are finished and homes are sold. Electronic sales channels earned less because people bought fewer consumer electronics. The steel industry's income went down because steel prices dropped and there was less demand from the international car market.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Special Zone Open for 3 Months, 34 Financial Companies Want to Serve Rich Clients</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung Special Zone has been open for three months. Today, Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) shared the results. A total of 34 financial companies have started to offer services in the Kaohsiung Special Zone. For banks, family offices and working with investment companies to sell foreign funds (that are not like regular stock investment funds) were popular. For insurance companies, 28 new insurance policies were sold for wealth management services in the zone.</p>
            <p>The FSC wants Taiwan to become a main center for managing money in Asia. The Kaohsiung Asset Management Special Zone (Kaohsiung Special Zone) started in July. Many financial companies have announced their plans to attract rich clients there.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wang Yun-chung, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Banking Bureau, explained at a press conference today that 17 banks have joined the Kaohsiung Special Zone so far. They offer services like loans, family offices, and international financial services. Looking at all the services, two types of services were most popular. First, family offices. Second, banks working with investment companies to sell foreign funds that are not like regular stock investment funds. Many people are interested in this because it's the first time banks are trying this type of cooperation with investment companies.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wang also mentioned that bank lending services include giving loans using assets as security, insurance financing, and loans based on a collection of financial assets (Lombard Lending). Many of these services are new, and many clients have asked about them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ku Kun-rong, the Chief Secretary of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said that five life insurance companies asked the FSC to offer services in the special zone. So far, four companies have been approved: Cathay Life, Fubon Life, Nanshan Life, and KGI Life. The fifth company's application is still being reviewed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ku further explained that these companies mainly offer wealth management and international insurance services. They offer insurance products that do not follow the usual rules for minimum death benefits compared to the policy's value. They also work with OSU (Offshore Securities Unit), OBU (Offshore Banking Unit), and OIU (Offshore Insurance Unit) to do marketing together, promote products, or help clients open accounts.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ku noted that by the end of September, 28 new insurance policies had been sold in the Kaohsiung Special Zone for wealth management. The life insurance services in the zone mainly include selling US dollar interest-linked products and participating life insurance. The FSC continues to encourage more companies to join the zone.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Hou-ming, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that 10 investment trust and consulting companies and 3 securities companies have joined the Kaohsiung Special Zone. The investment trust and consulting companies mainly offer multi-channel services for foreign funds that are not like regular stock investment funds. They have sold two such funds. The three securities companies do not have any services yet.</p>

            <h1>Chou Yu-kou Must Pay NT$3.2 Million in Second Trial for Saying "CTI Has the Communist Party Behind It"</h1>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Eng-meng, the chairman of Want Want China Times Group, and CTI Television sued media person Chou Yu-kou. They were unhappy that she said CTI was a "red media" company. The Taipei District Court told Chou Yu-kou to pay NT$2.8 million for breaking an agreement. Today, the Taiwan High Court changed the decision, telling Chou Yu-kou to pay NT$3.2 million. She can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>In 2017, Chou Yu-kou had accused Mr. Tsai Eng-meng of being a "mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party." She was sued for this, but both sides reached an agreement and dropped the case. Then, in 2020, Chou Yu-kou said things like "the Chinese Communist Party is behind CTI News" and "Tsai Eng-meng respectfully reported to Wang Yi, who was then the head of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and listened to his instructions."</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Eng-meng and CTI Television believed that Chou Yu-kou's words went against their earlier agreement. So, they started a civil lawsuit, asking for money for breaking the agreement. The Taipei District Court decided that Chou Yu-kou should pay Mr. Tsai Eng-meng NT$800,000 and CTI Television NT$2 million. Both sides appealed this decision.</p>
            <p>The High Court decided that Chou Yu-kou's statements meant that CTI Company had a close relationship with the Chinese Communist government, and Mr. Tsai Eng-meng also had a close connection with it, taking orders from the Chinese Communist government. She did not provide proof that she asked Mr. Tsai Eng-meng or CTI Television before saying these things. So, this was a breach of their agreement, and she must pay a fine. The court ordered Chou Yu-kou to pay Mr. Tsai Eng-meng NT$800,000 and CTI Television NT$2.4 million. She can still appeal this decision.</p>
