            <h1>Expert: If Ukraine Loses Donbas Defense, It Could Be Like Czechoslovakia Losing Sudetenland in 1938</h1>
            <p>Reports say that Russia wants Ukraine to give up Donbas as one condition to end the war. A Czech expert says that if Ukraine loses its important defenses in Donbas, Russia will be able to invade Ukraine's open land more easily. This would be like when Czechoslovakia lost the Sudetenland in 1938, and then the Nazis took over the country.</p>
            <p>After talks between the leaders of the US and Russia, it was reported that Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Ukraine give up Donbas as one way to end the war.</p>
            <p>Zdeňka Petráš, an expert from Brno Defence University, told the Czech News Agency (ČTK) today: "Let's not talk about money for now. Donbas is an industrial area with coal and oil. But more importantly for Ukraine, this area has a very important line of defense."</p>
            <p>This defense line is made of Ukrainian military structures in key parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions. This line was slowly built after fighting started between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian groups in 2014. It was made much stronger after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, to stop Russian forces from moving west.</p>
            <p>This defense line covers Sloviansk and Kramatorsk in the north. In the middle, it includes the area around Lyman. In the south, it is near Pokrovsk.</p>
            <p>Petráš pointed out that this defense line is very important for Ukraine's protection. "If Ukraine loses this defense line, it will become land that Russia can easily invade again. New defense points cannot be built there."</p>
            <p>Petráš compared this situation to Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement in 1938. At that time, because it lost its defenses in the border area of Sudetenland, Nazi Germany could easily take over the whole country.</p>
            <p>In the current international talks, one topic is how to keep Ukraine safe. Petráš said that these safety guarantees are not clear yet. They only say they should be strong. "But in reality, Russia is stronger in the war. So, if we talk about safety guarantees, they must be something Russia will also accept."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and representatives from Germany, the UK, France, Italy, Finland, along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, met at the White House on August 18. They talked about how to end the war, which has lasted for over three years. After the meeting, they decided to arrange a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.</p>
