A recent survey by Allianz Life shows that nearly half of adults in the U.S. are finding it hard to save money for their retirement. The main reasons for this difficulty are high prices and the rising cost of living.

Younger adults, like Gen Z and millennials, are feeling this financial pressure the most. They often have to choose between paying for daily needs, paying off debts, or saving for the future. Many of them say they cannot afford to save money at all right now.

Even older adults are changing their retirement plans because of the current economic situation. The survey also found that financial stress is causing mental health problems for many people across different age groups.

**How AI Is Changing the Way We Work**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing many jobs around the world. While some people are worried about losing their jobs to AI, others are excited about the new possibilities it offers.

AI tools can do many repetitive tasks, like writing basic emails or analyzing large amounts of data. This can help workers save time and focus on more creative or complex parts of their jobs. Experts believe that AI won't always replace jobs completely, but it will change how jobs are done. This means people will need to learn new skills, such as how to use AI tools effectively.

Companies are starting to invest in training their employees to work with AI. However, there are still discussions about the ethics of using AI and ensuring that technology helps people rather than harms them. Overall, AI is becoming a key part of the modern workplace, and employees will need to adapt to these changes.

**Popular European Cities Face Challenges from Too Many Tourists**

Many famous cities in Europe, like Amsterdam, Venice, and Dubrovnik, are struggling because too many tourists are visiting them. This problem, called "overtourism," is causing difficulties for local people and harming the cities' environments and historical sites.

When too many people visit, streets become very crowded, and prices for things like food and housing go up, making life harder for residents. Tourist activities can also cause pollution and damage historical buildings.

To solve these problems, cities are trying new rules. For example, some are charging a tourist tax, limiting the size of tour groups, or stopping new short-term rental apartments. Some cities are also trying to reduce the number of large cruise ships. The goal is to create a better balance so that tourists can still enjoy the cities, but locals can also live comfortably, and the cities can remain beautiful for the future.
