            <h1>Taichung City Government Approves Drainage Improvement Plan Between Hungkuang and Providence Universities</h1>
            <p>In the past, when it rained heavily in the coastal area of Taichung City, floods often happened. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that between Hungkuang University of Science and Technology and Providence University, scooters were often washed away by strong water. The city government has set aside 150 million NT dollars to fix this problem. They also got another 18 million NT dollars. The work is expected to finish by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>The Taichung branch of the Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation Agency has approved a project for Taichung City Government. This project is called "Taichung City Shalu District Providence University and Hungkuang University Campus Area and Traffic Safety Road Improvement Project â€“ Hungkuang University to Beishi River Section Slope Drainage Improvement." The central government will give 9 million NT dollars for this. The local government will also add 9 million NT dollars. This makes a total of 18 million NT dollars. The city government approved paying this money first at today's city council meeting. It will then go to the Taichung City Council for approval.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen explained that in the area from Hungkuang to Providence, even though there are drainage pipes, the water flows very fast when it rains heavily because of the land's shape. People and scooters were often washed away. This problem has not been fixed for decades. She believes new ways of building can help. By using new methods and finding money, they spent 150 million NT dollars for 1.5 kilometers to solve the flood problem.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen said that the Hungkuang section is now finished. The work is now moving to Providence and is expected to be done by the end of the year. During Typhoon Danas and heavy rains recently, the new system was tested. They found that even with heavy rain, the fast water flow was much better. They had to work hard to get the money for this project.</p>
            <p>Chen Da-tian, the director of the Taichung City Construction Bureau, explained that the coastal area often suffers from floods, especially with the strange weather recently. Before, between Hungkuang University of Science and Technology and Providence University, when it rained a lot, students on scooters were often washed away, or the roads turned into rivers. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen cares a lot about flood control. Many years ago, she made a plan. Starting last year, they spent 150 million NT dollars to improve drainage and pedestrian paths for a total length of 1.5 kilometers from Hungkuang to Providence.</p>
            <p>Chen Da-tian said that they recently got 18 million NT dollars from the Soil and Water Conservation Agency. The central government and the local government each pay 9 million NT dollars. This money is for making the drainage pipes bigger between Hungkuang University and Beishi River. During Typhoon Danas and heavy rains this year, the drainage worked well. Students' safety when going to school and traffic safety were protected. The whole project will be finished by the end of this year. The money they got this time will be used to improve small connecting pipes and sidewalks. This will solve the drainage problems for both universities at once.</p>

            <h1>China Again Claims Legal Right Over Taiwan; Foreign Ministry Says A Thousand Lies Won't Make It True</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said again that it is a clear historical and legal fact that Taiwan belongs to China. Today, the spokesperson for Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Hsiao Kuang-wei, said that even if the Chinese Communist Party tells a lie a thousand times, it will not become true. He said that it is a fact that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are separate and do not belong to each other. He also said that the People's Republic of China has no right to speak for Taiwan in the world.</p>
            <p>A few days ago, Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung strongly disagreed with what China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. Lin Chia-lung said that after the war, the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" replaced other political statements like the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation." He said that this treaty did not give Taiwan to the People's Republic of China, and that the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan. In response, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called these statements wrong at a press conference on August 18th. She said it is a clear historical and legal fact that Taiwan belongs to China.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hsiao Kuang-wei said at a regular press conference that the Chinese Communist Party's lies will not become true even if said a thousand times. He said that the current political situation in the Indo-Pacific region is very difficult. Especially in recent years, China has often challenged the "rules-based international order." This has greatly harmed democracy, the rule of law, human rights, freedom, and fair trade. This has made other countries worried. More and more countries are sending warships through the Taiwan Strait to show that the Taiwan Strait is international water. This shows how important they think peace and stability are in the Indo-Pacific area.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei also mentioned that China has put pressure on Taiwan for a long time in international meetings. This includes making laws like the "Anti-Secession Law" and "22 measures to punish independence supporters." At the same time, China wrongly changes the meaning of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. China tries to use this resolution as a way to attack Taiwan with force and stop Taiwan from joining international groups. Based on this, China falsely claims that "Taiwan is a part of China" and "the Taiwan Strait is China's internal sea." China's claims clearly go against facts and democratic values. Many countries' parliaments and governments have also spoken out strongly against China's wrong explanations.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei repeated what Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said recently. He stressed that Taiwan started to become more politically free and democratic from the mid-1980s. This process came from the people. In 1996, Taiwan had its first direct election for president. The central government's executive and law-making officials are all chosen by the people of Taiwan. From that time, this government became the only legal government that effectively rules Taiwan and represents Taiwan to the world. This also made it clear that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China exist equally and do not belong to each other.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei said that since then, the Republic of China (Taiwan) has had three changes in political parties leading the government. This has made Taiwan's democratic system and its own identity stronger. It also shows the strong belief and will of the people of Taiwan to seek freedom and democracy.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei said again that it is a clear fact that the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People's Republic of China are separate and do not belong to each other. He also said that the People's Republic of China has no right to speak for Taiwan in the world. He asked the government in Beijing to understand clearly and reasonably that relations between the two sides can only get better through respectful and equal talks with Taiwan's elected government, which represents its people.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Kuang-wei said that Taiwan will also stand together with its democratic partners. They will together hold up a "democratic umbrella." They will face the challenges from authoritarian governments together, protect shared values, and keep the rules-based international order safe.</p>

            <h1>Chiang Wan-an Suggests Forming a Cabinet; T.H. Tung: I Don't Comment on the President's Power</h1>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an suggested that President Lai Ching-te should ask T.H. Tung, the chairman of Pegatron, to form a new cabinet. This idea caused much discussion. Today, T.H. Tung said that choosing cabinet members is the president's power according to the constitution. He will not easily comment or talk about this matter. He added that Premier Cho Jung-tai is currently facing a lot of pressure from inside and outside the country, and all cabinet members are working very hard.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City branch of the Taiwan People's Party is holding a special exhibition called "Talking About Nuclear Power: August 23rd Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 Extension Referendum" from August 9th to 22nd. It is at the plaza outside Exit 6 of Ximen MRT Station. T.H. Tung visited the exhibition this morning. Professor Lee Min from National Tsing Hua University's Institute of Nuclear Engineering and Science gave him a tour. Several people from the Taiwan People's Party were with him, including legislator Liu Shu-bin and Taipei City Council members Chang Chih-hao, Huang Ching-ying, and Lin Chen-yu.</p>
            <p>Before visiting the exhibition, T.H. Tung was asked about Chiang Wan-an suggesting he form the cabinet. He said he already answered this question on August 4th. He explained that choosing cabinet members is the president's power under the constitution. "So I will not just comment or talk about it," he said. He added that the current cabinet and Premier Cho Jung-tai are working very hard. They are facing a lot of pressure from inside and outside the country. He showed his respect and support to all cabinet members for their hard work.</p>
            <p>The media then asked if he would agree if President Lai invited him to form the cabinet. T.H. Tung said that he also mentioned on August 4th, "I am not good at it."</p>
            <p>About media person Li Cheng-hao saying that only 5% of people would vote in the August 23rd referendum, T.H. Tung said he had not studied Li Cheng-hao's opinion. He still asked people to come out and vote to support extending the life of Nuclear Power Plant No. 3. This is because Taiwan needs electricity, good quality electricity, and electricity at a fair price. It also needs electricity to support people's lives and industries.</p>
            <p>The media asked T.H. Tung if he had any thoughts on the emotional manipulation in politics, since he recently talked about the Japanese anime "Demon Slayer."</p>
            <p>T.H. Tung said that after July 26th, he saw politicians trying to control each other with emotions. For example, members of the same party were arguing with each other over issues like women's equality. He felt sad that from small groups to large political parties and society, people should be more reasonable when they face pressure. They should face problems, understand problems, and solve problems, instead of using emotional control on each other.</p>
            <p>T.H. Tung said, "Even though comics are small stories, they contain big lessons." For example, in "Demon Slayer," Nezuko was controlled by magic and became a demon. But she did not want to drink blood or eat people; she kept her human nature. This can be seen as people needing to keep their original intentions when faced with outside pressure. And Nezuko's relative Tanjiro did not give up. This family love shows kindness, pity, and trust.</p>
