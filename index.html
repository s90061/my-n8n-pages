            <h1>Cheng Li-Wen, a Former DPP Member, Becomes KMT Chairperson</h1>
            <p>Former Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Cheng Li-Wen started her political career with the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). She was part of the student movement generation. After leaving the DPP, she joined the KMT and held many important positions in the party and government. When she was young, she supported Taiwan's independence. However, in this election, she said, "I am Chinese." She was a surprising candidate and won the KMT chairperson election because of her fighting spirit. She defeated other candidates, like former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-Pin. This is a big surprise in politics.</p>
            <p>The results of the KMT chairperson election are out. Cheng Li-Wen won against Hau Lung-Pin, KMT lawmaker Lo Chih-Chiang, and other candidates. She is now the new KMT chairperson. She is also the second woman to become KMT chairperson through a direct election by party members, after former chairperson Hung Hsiu-Chu.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-Wen was born in Yunlin and grew up in Tainan. She studied law at National Taiwan University and took part in the Wild Lily student movement. After university, she joined the DPP. She was a National Assembly member and a deputy director of the DPP Youth Department. But in 2002, the DPP stopped her membership because she commented on the "Tu Hsing-Che ear-licking case." So, Cheng Li-Wen decided to leave the party.</p>
            <p>After leaving the DPP, Cheng Li-Wen stayed out of politics for a while. On March 27, 2004, the pan-blue parties gathered on Ketagalan Boulevard to protest unfair presidential election results. Cheng Li-Wen was the host and was seen as officially supporting the pan-blue side. Later that year, she ran for a lawmaker position in Kaohsiung but lost.</p>
            <p>However, Cheng Li-Wen's good speaking skills, sharp hosting, and clear arguments impressed Lien Chan, who was the KMT chairperson at the time. In 2005, she was invited to join the KMT. She then worked as the KMT's Culture and Communication Committee chairperson and spokesperson. In the 2008 legislative election, the KMT chose her as a non-district lawmaker, and she won. But in 2012, she ran for a local lawmaker position in Taichung and lost to DPP lawmaker Ho Hsin-Chun.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-Wen was brave to run in difficult election areas. She showed a rare fighting spirit for a KMT member. After losing the lawmaker election, Chen Chun, who was the Premier at the time, asked her to be the Executive Yuan spokesperson. She was highly trusted by top officials.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Cheng Li-Wen resigned as the Executive Yuan spokesperson and started working in the media, hosting shows. In the 2020 legislative election, Wu Den-Yih, who was the KMT chairperson at the time, chose her as a non-district lawmaker for the 10th Legislative Yuan. She won again and returned to the Legislative Yuan. She then became the KMT party caucus whip.</p>
            <p>During the 10th Legislative Yuan session, the COVID-19 pandemic started around the world. As the party caucus whip, Cheng Li-Wen acted as a strong voice for the party. She asked tough questions and often stood at the front to argue for the party.</p>
            <p>In this KMT chairperson election, Cheng Li-Wen was a surprise candidate. She visited local communities a lot and showed a fighting image that was different from traditional KMT members. She got a lot of support from military, public servant, and teacher groups. Finally, she won against her opponents and became the party chairperson.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-Wen has successfully become the party chairperson. However, she is not from the traditional KMT background. It will be a challenge for her to manage the KMT, which has a complex organization and strong local groups. She also needs to handle the competition and cooperation with the Taiwan People's Party carefully. Her ability to help the KMT win back power in 2028 is a big test that has just begun.</p>
