            <h1>Chinese businesswoman admits guilt in UK court, involved in Bitcoin fraud case over 200 billion yuan</h1>
            <p>A Chinese businesswoman named Zhimin Qian has admitted in a UK court that she was the leader of a very large Bitcoin fraud case. The amount of money involved is billions of British pounds.</p>
            <p>Qian, who used the name Yadi Zhang, admitted to her role in a major global cryptocurrency seizure. The Bitcoin assets that were seized are now worth about 5.5 billion British pounds (around 230.6 billion New Taiwan dollars). She admitted to getting and keeping this illegal money.</p>
            <p>The Metropolitan Police in London said that from 2014 to 2017, Zhang planned a huge fraud in China. More than 128,000 victims lost money, which was then changed into Bitcoin. </p>
            <p>Police added that Zhang then used fake documents to leave China and enter the UK. In September 2018, she tried to make the illegal money look legal by buying property.</p>
            <p>Will Lyne, who is in charge of economic and cybercrime at the UK police, said this case is "one of the biggest cases in British history, and also one of the largest amounts of money involved in a cryptocurrency case worldwide."</p>
            <p>This case was investigated for 7 years. Last year, another woman involved in the case, Jian Wen, was sent to prison for 6 years and 8 months. Police found that Wen helped move a cryptocurrency wallet that had 150 Bitcoins. At that time, they were worth about 1.7 million British pounds.</p>
            <p>After Zhimin Qian admitted her guilt, the case will continue on the 30th. (Edited by Chi Chin-Ling) 1140930</p>

            <h1>Chip manufacturing 50-50 idea causes a stir; Taiwan stock market sees high-level changes, monthly line becomes key support</h1>
            <p>After Taiwan's stock market reached a new high last week, it dropped 443 points to 25580 points on the 26th. This happened because people were waiting to buy before a long holiday. The US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, talked about an idea for Taiwan and the US to share chip manufacturing 50-50. It is not yet clear how this will affect Taiwan's stock market. Experts say that the Taiwan stock market has been changing a lot at high levels recently. They suggest watching the monthly average line, which is about 25267 points, to see if it can hold as a support level.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick told American media that he spoke to Taiwan about an idea for chip manufacturing to be split 50-50. During the holiday, US stocks went up more than 300 points, and TSMC's American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) also increased. It is not clear yet how Taiwan's stock market will react to the 50-50 chip idea. Also, the TSMC investor conference in mid-October will be very important.</p>
            <p>On the 26th, Taiwan's stock market closed at 25580.32 points, falling below 25600 points. It dropped 443.53 points, going below the 10-day average line of about 25770 points. Experts say that the short-term trend for Taiwan stocks is a bit weaker. The market is generally moving up and down at high levels. For investors, it is suggested to pay close attention to the monthly average line, around 25267 points, to see if it acts as a strong support.</p>
            <p>The main US stock market indexes closed higher today. However, worries about new taxes, the government possibly shutting down, and important economic reports coming soon limited how much they went up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up 68.78 points, or 0.15%, closing at 46316.07 points. The S&P 500 index rose 17.51 points, or 0.26%, closing at 6661.21 points. The Nasdaq index went up strongly by 107.09 points, or 0.48%, closing at 22591.16 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index increased 10.06 points, or 0.16%, closing at 6315.11 points.</p>
            <p>TSMC will hold its third-quarter investor conference on October 16th. The progress of making 2-nanometer advanced chips in large amounts will be a main topic. Experts expect TSMC's 2-nanometer chip production to increase fastest in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>On the 28th, Hotai Motor said at the Toyota GAZOO Racing Corolla Cup 2025 series that the Taiwan car market still looks good in the fourth quarter. They are trying to keep car sales in Taiwan the same as last year. Hotai Motor's sales target for this year remains unchanged, aiming for 165,000 new vehicles sold across passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and commercial vehicles.</p>
            <p>Yang Chi-Jen, the chairman of Kenda Rubber Industrial Co., Ltd., a tire manufacturer, said at a new product launch event on the 28th that Taiwan's tires sold to the US have a 25% tariff. Although this affects how much people want to buy, Kenda has not had to "work 3 days and rest 4" as some TV commentators mentioned, nor have they put workers on unpaid leave. The company keeps its competitive edge with products that offer good quality for their price. Currently, they are focusing on promoting electric vehicle tires. (Edited by Yang Kai-Hsiang) 1140930</p>

            <h1>Major League Baseball has not seen a back-to-back champion in 25 years; rich Dodgers aim to defend their title in first game against the Reds</h1>
            <p>Major League Baseball (MLB) playoffs start tomorrow. The Los Angeles Dodgers, led by Shohei Ohtani, will begin their journey to win the World Series again.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the Dodgers could be the first team in 25 years to win the MLB championship two times in a row. They will play against the Cincinnati Reds at home in a Wild Card series, where the first team to win two games wins the series.</p>
            <p>The Dodgers, who spent a lot of money to build their team, won the World Series last year by beating the New York Yankees. Many experts thought they would easily reach the playoffs this season. However, things were not as smooth as expected. The team had many injured players and their performance was inconsistent. Their closer, Tanner Scott, who signed for 2.37 billion dollars over 4 years, did not play well. In the end, they only made it to the playoffs as a Wild Card team in the National League.</p>
            <p>Even though the Dodgers have won the National League West title 12 times in 13 years, this year they still need to fight through the Wild Card game. Only then can they try to challenge the Philadelphia Phillies in the Division Series.</p>
            <p>However, the Dodgers' recent performance has improved, which gives them more confidence for the playoffs. The Dodgers won 8 out of their last 10 regular season games and swept the Seattle Mariners, who were the second seed in the American League, winning 3-0.</p>
            <p>More importantly, almost all of the Dodgers' main pitchers are healthy. Their starting lineup, which is envied by all other teams, includes former Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell. He will be the starting pitcher for the first game of the Wild Card series. Japanese star pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto will also pitch later.</p>
            <p>As for the "two-way" star player Shohei Ohtani, he returned to pitching this season and did very well. He also set a personal and team record with 55 home runs in one season. If the series goes to a deciding third game, he will be the starting pitcher. (Edited by Chu Hsiang-Ping) 1140930</p>
