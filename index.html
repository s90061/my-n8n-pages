            <h1>Trump to Meet Netanyahu, Hopes for Gaza Peace Deal</h1>
            <p>Cairo/Washington (CNA) â€“ U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters today that he hopes to finalize a peace plan for Gaza during his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tomorrow. Meanwhile, Israeli tanks are moving deeper into Gaza City. Hamas's armed group says they have lost contact with two people they were holding.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the safety of these two people is a big worry in Israel. This might make the meeting between Netanyahu and Trump difficult tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Hamas's armed wing, the Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades, asked Israel today to take its soldiers out of Gaza City and stop air attacks for 24 hours. This would let their fighters look for the people they are holding.</p>
            <p>Trump told Reuters in a phone interview that his peace plan for Gaza has received "very positive" feedback from Israeli and Arab leaders. He said, "Everyone wants to make a deal." Hamas, however, said they have not yet received any clear plan from Trump or any other mediator.</p>
            <p>Recently, the Israeli army launched a big ground attack on Gaza City. They destroyed many areas and told hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to move to tent camps. Netanyahu said this was to completely defeat Hamas.</p>
            <p>Even though the fighting continues, talks to find a diplomatic solution to the nearly two-year war in Gaza have increased recently.</p>
            <p>Trump's Middle East peace plan has 21 points. It asks for all Israeli people held to be released (whether alive or dead) and for Israel to stop attacks on Qatar. It also asks Israel and Palestine to start talking again for "peaceful living together."</p>

            <h1>Spain's Valencia Issues Red Alert for Heavy Rain, Worries About Another Flood Disaster</h1>
            <p>Madrid (CNA) â€“ Spain's weather agency today put the eastern Valencia region on a red alert for heavy rain. They are worried that a bad flood, like the one that killed 235 people last October, might happen again.</p>
            <p>AFP news says that the Spanish National Meteorological Agency (Aemet) warned of "extremely dangerous" weather in Tarragona, Castellon, and the Valencia region. This bad weather is expected this afternoon, evening, and tomorrow. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez also gave the same warning.</p>
            <p>Local officials in Valencia said that schools and universities in Valencia city will be closed all day tomorrow. Also, all public places like libraries, parks, gardens, markets, and cemeteries will be closed temporarily.</p>
            <p>People in Valencia also got a red alert message on their phones this afternoon. The message told them to be careful because of the bad weather.</p>
            <p>Climate change makes the effects of heavy rain worse. Last October, the Valencia region had very bad floods. After that, many people protested. They said that the government did not handle the problem well. They pointed out that even though the weather agency gave warnings, officials did not tell people quickly enough.</p>

            <h1>US Military Generals to Gather Globally, Trump Plans to Greet and Encourage Them</h1>
            <p>Washington (CNA) â€“ U.S. President Donald Trump announced today that he plans to greet and encourage military generals at a meeting on September 30 in Quantico, Virginia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has called a rare meeting. All U.S. military generals from around the world will gather in one place for this meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump told Reuters, "I want to tell these generals that we love them. They are respected leaders. They need to be strong, tough, smart, and full of passion... This is all about teamwork. It's time for someone to do this."</p>
            <p>Trump's presence at the meeting might draw more attention than Hegseth. U.S. officials told Reuters that Hegseth is expected to talk about the importance of a "warrior spirit" for the whole military. He might also talk about other topics.</p>
            <p>Hegseth mentions "warrior spirit" and the need for the U.S. military to have a "warrior mindset" in almost every public speech he gives.</p>
            <p>U.S. military members are stationed all over the world, including in South Korea, Japan, and the Middle East. These troops are led by two-star, three-star, and four-star generals or admirals.</p>
            <p>More than one official told Reuters that the meeting is expected to happen at the Marine Corps University in Quantico.</p>
            <p>Some high-ranking officials will fly on military planes to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland.</p>
            <p>It is not clear why this meeting cannot be held online. The cost for transport and security might be at least several million U.S. dollars.</p>
