Typhoon Danas brought strong winds and heavy rain to Kaohsiung. The Qijin Central Wastewater Treatment Plant had too much water, and a water pipe broke. This caused an alley to flood with 40 centimeters of water, affecting about 50 homes.

The Kaohsiung City Water Resources Bureau quickly sent machines to help. They made a new path for the water and put up barriers to stop more flooding. People living there were busy cleaning their houses. Their furniture was in dirty, muddy water, so they quickly moved their electronics to higher places.

One resident said the water was up to their waist at one point. Many vehicles were partly underwater, and most furniture inside homes was ruined. The Water Resources Bureau is working to fix the system and help the affected residents with cleaning and claims for damage.

**Typhoon Causes Major Power Outages in Chiayi, 150,000 Homes Affected**

Typhoon Danas hit Chiayi hard from late last night to early this morning. This caused a very big power problem, with 150,864 homes in Chiayi County and City losing electricity. Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) has been working all night to fix it, and over 20,000 homes now have power again.

Taipower said that more than 300 power poles in Chiayi are broken or have fallen down. Many power lines are also damaged by fallen trees. Taipower calls this the biggest power problem in Chiayi's history. By 8 AM today, more than 20,000 homes had power back, but over 127,000 homes are still without electricity, mainly in coastal and mountain areas.

Taipower has sent all its workers to fix the problem. They are also working closely with the Chiayi county and city governments to clear roads and obstacles. Taipower asks for people's understanding because they have to fix the power in different areas one by one.
