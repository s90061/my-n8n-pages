            <h1>Wicker Meets with Taiwanese Lawmakers; KMT Says Taiwan-US Ties Are for Everyone</h1>
            <p>US Senator Roger Wicker, who leads the US Senate Armed Services Committee, visited Taiwan. Today, he had a breakfast meeting with the head of Taiwan's parliament, Han Kuo-yu, and other lawmakers from different political parties. Hsu Chiao-hsin, a lawmaker from the Kuomintang (KMT) party, said it was a good meeting that will help Taiwan and the US become closer friends. She also said that the relationship between Taiwan and the US is important for all political parties in Taiwan, and the KMT will work actively to keep good communication and interactions going.</p>
            <p>Senator Roger Wicker and Senator Deb Fischer arrived in Taiwan on August 29. Senator Wicker's visit is important because it's the first time in nine years that a leader of the US Senate Armed Services Committee has visited Taiwan. The last time was in June 2016, when Senator John McCain came. It's also Senator Wicker's first visit to Taiwan in 24 years; he last came in 2001 when he was a member of the US House of Representatives.</p>
            <p>KMT lawmaker Hsu Chiao-hsin thanked Senators Wicker and Fischer for their visit. She explained that the head of the parliament, Han Kuo-yu, and the vice-head, Chiang Chi-chen, brought together lawmakers from different parties for this special breakfast meeting.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiao-hsin repeated that the relationship between Taiwan and the US is not only for one political party. She said that the KMT and its group in parliament will actively join in discussions, share their ideas, and build good ways to talk and work together.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chiao-hsin said it was a pleasant meeting held on a holiday morning. She hoped that having coffee together would help everyone feel closer and make the friendship between Taiwan and the US even stronger.</p>
            <p>People who were at the breakfast meeting from the US side included Senator Wicker, Senator Fischer, and the head of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), Sandra Oudkirk. From Taiwan's parliament, those present were Han Kuo-yu, Chiang Chi-chen, KMT lawmakers Hsu Chiao-hsin and Chen Yong-kang, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Chen Kuan-ting, and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) lawmaker Lin Yi-chun.</p>

            <h1>Government Says New Law Causes Problems: Over NT$30 Billion Cannot Be Given Out</h1>
            <p>Li Hui-chih, a spokesperson for Taiwan's government, said today that the money given to local governments next year will be the highest ever. However, it will also be the most unfair. She explained that a problem in the new law about how money is shared means that over NT$30 billion cannot be given out. The central government wants to give this money, but it cannot because of the flawed law. So, the law needs to be changed again.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance announced how much money each county and city would get next year. This was based on the new law. Regarding the more than NT$30 billion that cannot be given out, the Ministry of Finance said that this money still belongs to local governments and the central government cannot use it for other things. It will be given out once the law is fixed.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih wrote on Facebook that the ordinary shared tax money for local governments next year will be a record high of NT$848.8 billion. This is NT$402.7 billion more than this year, which is over a 90% increase. But the formula in the new law is problematic, causing some areas to get a very large increase. For example, Yunlin County received NT$11 billion this year but will get NT$24.6 billion next year. This is a huge increase of 123%.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Lienchiang County would receive less money with the new formula. Li Hui-chih said that the Ministry of Finance had to find a way to make sure Lienchiang County's amount stays the same as this year, which is NT$723 million.</p>
            <p>She also said that because of the conflicting formula in the new law, the central government cannot even give out the money, and over NT$30 billion of shared tax money cannot be distributed. This problem can only be solved by changing the law again.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih pointed out that even though the shared tax money is at a record high, the difference between cities and rural areas has become bigger. Because the central government can only give a limited amount of aid, they must review how responsibilities are shared between the central and local governments. Premier Cho Jung-tai has already said that he will invite local leaders next week to talk about this issue.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Finance's list, comparing this year's and next year's shared tax money for the six main cities: Taipei City will get a large increase from NT$70.702 billion to NT$114.924 billion. New Taipei City will go from NT$55.061 billion to NT$95.768 billion.</p>
            <p>Taichung City will increase from NT$45.244 billion to NT$74.104 billion. Tainan City will go from NT$32.721 billion to NT$49.670 billion. Kaohsiung City will increase from NT$50.741 billion to NT$75.780 billion. Taoyuan City will go from NT$36.275 billion to NT$65.285 billion. Lienchiang County will stay at NT$723 million because the central government covered the difference.</p>
