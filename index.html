The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, plans to visit Japan around July 19th. He will go to an event at the Osaka-Kansai Expo. This will be his first visit to Japan since he started his job in January.

President Trump recently said that the US will put a 25% tax on Japanese goods starting August 1st. People are watching to see if Bessent will talk with Japan's Minister Akazawa about these taxes. Minister Akazawa has already visited the US seven times to discuss this issue.

The World Expo in Osaka will have "National Day" events where countries show their culture. The US National Day is on July 19th, and Bessent will represent the US government there.

**Old Printing Factory Hua Wang Uses AI to Mix Ink, Reduces Complaints by 80%**

Hua Wang, an old and well-known printing company in Taiwan, has started using AI technology to mix inks. This new system helps them get colors right the first time, saving a lot of time and ink.

Before, experienced workers had to mix colors by hand, which could be slow and sometimes led to different shades. With AI, the color matching is very exact. This has helped the company reduce complaints from customers about color differences by more than 80%.

Hua Wang also uses environmentally friendly inks made from plants instead of minerals. They are also planning to use AI to check for mistakes in printed materials.

**German Chancellor Merz Plans First Visit to China, Possibly in October**

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is planning to visit China later this year, possibly in October. He will go with a group of business leaders. This trip is important because it can help make the relationship between Germany and China stronger, especially as the US and China have trade problems.

China wants to invest more in Germany, and Merz's visit might help fix some past disagreements between the two countries. Germany's Foreign Minister has already talked with China about issues like the war in Ukraine, Taiwan, and the Middle East.

Germany and China have a close relationship, especially because German car companies sell many cars in China. Merz wants Germany to be less dependent on China but also wants to avoid big arguments.
