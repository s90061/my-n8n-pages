            <h1>Constant Rain in Changhua: Fenyuan Courtyard Backyard Collapses, Yuanlin House Foundation Washes Away</h1>
            <p>Changhua has been getting a lot of rain. In Fenyuan Township, a large part of the backyard of a traditional courtyard house has collapsed. Even though they covered it with a tarp, soil is still washing away. In Yuanlin City, the ground under a house washed away, and the falling soil turned into a mudslide. The local government quickly used large bags of soil to make a temporary wall to stop the disaster from getting worse.</p>
            <p>Due to the southwest air current, Changhua has had continuous heavy rain for several days. This has caused small disasters like floods and mudslides in areas such as Fenyuan Township, Changhua City, Yuanlin City, and Ershui Township in Changhua County. For example, in Tong'an Village, Fenyuan Township, Changhua, a traditional courtyard house on the Bagua Mountain Range had its slope soil wash away. The residents found that the backyard of their house had become a hole about 10 meters deep.</p>
            <p>Lin Zi-Long, the head of Tong'an Village, received the report and quickly helped the family living in the courtyard house to leave. At the same time, he covered the collapsed area with a tarp. However, because of the heavy rain, the collapsed area kept getting bigger. Lin Zi-Long told reporters today that a new 3-meter-long crack appeared next to the collapsed area yesterday. If the rain does not stop, the collapse will become more serious, and the residents might lose their homes.</p>
            <p>Besides the collapsed backyard in Fenyuan Township, a house foundation in Yuanlin City also washed away yesterday. The washed-away soil, mixed with rainwater, flowed down and became a mudslide. Workers from the Yuanlin City government helped the residents leave and also quickly brought large bags filled with soil to use as a temporary wall. This was to protect the houses below the hill from being affected.</p>
