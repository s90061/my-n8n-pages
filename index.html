            <h1>Next Week: Warm, Sunny to Cloudy, with Local Heavy Rain in Central and Southern Mountains in the Afternoon</h1>
            <p>The Weather Bureau said today that it will be warm for the next week. It will be sunny to cloudy in most places. In the afternoons, there will be short thunderstorms. There will be heavy rain in some mountain areas in central and southern Taiwan. On October 3rd and 4th, there will be more moisture, so it will rain lightly at times in Hualien, Taitung, and Hengchun Peninsula. The weather forecast says people might be able to see the moon during the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
            <p>Weather forecaster Chang Chun-yao from the Central Weather Bureau said that the Pacific High Pressure system will mostly affect Taiwan next week. The weather will be stable. From tomorrow until October 2nd, it will be mostly sunny to cloudy in all areas. In the afternoons, there will be short thunderstorms in southern Taiwan and other mountain areas. There might be heavy rain in some mountain areas in central and southern Taiwan in the afternoons. Tomorrow morning, there will be a few short showers in western Taiwan because of sea and land winds meeting.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao said that on October 3rd and 4th, southern clouds will bring some short showers or thunderstorms to Hualien, Taitung, and Hengchun Peninsula. The current information does not show that the rain will be very strong. Other areas will be sunny to cloudy, with short thunderstorms in southern Taiwan and other mountain areas in the afternoons.</p>
            <p>On October 5th and 6th, there will be less moisture. It will be mostly cloudy to sunny in all areas. Only the Hengchun Peninsula will have some short showers. In the afternoons, there will be short thunderstorms in central and southern Taiwan and other mountain areas.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao said that it will still be warm during the day next week, with temperatures around 31 to 34 degrees Celsius. In some parts of Greater Taipei, central, and southern Taiwan, temperatures could be over 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Chang Chun-yao said that current information shows cold air is in the north, but the Pacific High Pressure system is strong. So, the cold air has not reached south of 34 degrees North latitude yet. There is a low chance it will affect Taiwan next week. It might slowly move south after the Mid-Autumn Festival or around mid-October. It is possible it will affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>However, Chang Chun-yao mentioned that there is still a tropical system forming in a large low-pressure area east of the Philippines. On October 3rd and 4th, a tropical disturbance might pass through the Philippines. This will indirectly cause southern clouds to move north and affect Taiwan. Another tropical system might develop around the Mid-Autumn Festival. Forecasters from different countries have different ideas about whether the northern cold air or the tropical systems east of the Philippines will affect Taiwan first. We need to watch it more closely.</p>

            <h1>Hualien Flood Disaster: Nearly 2000 Homes Filled with Mud; County Government to Provide NT$50,000 Relief Fund per Household, Fastest by October 3rd</h1>
            <p>A flood caused by a landslide dam on Mata'an Stream severely damaged Guangfu Township. Nearly 2,000 homes were filled with mud. The Hualien County Government said today that each household could receive a relief fund of NT$50,000 as early as October 3rd. This money will help the affected people get back to normal life.</p>
            <p>Hualien County Commissioner Hsu Chen-wei spoke at the forward command center today. She said the county government is planning how to get the money. They expect to give each affected household NT$50,000 (NT$10,000 for comfort and NT$40,000 for aid). Depending on the official process, the money could be given out as early as October 3rd. This will help the people buy things they need and restart their lives.</p>
            <p>It has been 7 days since the disaster. Hsu Chen-wei said that removing the mud and restoring homes is the most important job right now. They are now clearing ditches by the roads and getting water and electricity back. She thanked the cleaning teams, special search and rescue teams, heavy machinery, and all supporting staff from different cities and counties again. She especially thanked the kind volunteers who helped with rescue work during the three-day holiday.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chen-wei said that based on the current situation of street cleaning and power/water restoration, they will announce when people in Guangfu Township can go back to work and school once it is safe.</p>

            <h1>After Finishing Japan Visit and Returning to Taiwan, Han Kuo-yu Hopes Hualien Residents Can Get Back on Their Feet</h1>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu, the head of the Legislative Yuan, led a group to Japan for a visit and came back to Taiwan today. He said that friends and overseas Chinese in Japan cared about the disaster in Hualien. He told the people of Hualien, "You are not alone," and hoped they could quickly recover from the typhoon disaster.</p>
            <p>On September 25th, Han Kuo-yu led a group of lawmakers from different political parties to Japan for a parliamentary visit. They visited the "Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council" and looked at the "2025 Osaka World Expo." The group finished their visit today and flew back to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu spoke at Taoyuan International Airport. He said there were a few things that touched him during this trip to Japan. First, Japanese friends and overseas Chinese all asked about Hualien first. They showed their sadness and care for the Hualien disaster. The visiting group and all friends in Taiwan and overseas want to tell the people of Hualien, "You are not alone. Everyone in Taiwan and overseas cares about you." He hopes the people of Hualien can quickly recover from this typhoon disaster.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu also used the word "amazing" to describe the Taiwan Pavilion at the Osaka World Expo. He said that Taiwan had three small exhibition areas, and visitors could only stay for 6 minutes. Each time, 40 people could enter. But many people were willing to wait outside for 4 hours. This is because the Taiwan Pavilion deeply impressed all visitors. It showed not only the strong beauty of Taiwan's semiconductors but also the gentle beauty of Taiwan's butterflies, orchids, and old trees. More importantly, it showed Taiwan's value in the world's supply chain.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu pointed out that the exhibition skillfully showed Taiwan as the "Kingdom of Semiconductors" and "Kingdom of Wafers," and how it affects people all over the world. Many people do not know that Taiwan's semiconductor supply makes life much easier, including for mobile phones, refrigerators, TVs, motorcycles, MRT, high-speed rail, and airplanes. Every person, every day, in every part of the world, lives with the convenience provided by semiconductors and wafers made in Taiwan. After visiting the Taiwan Pavilion, people would be very impressed.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that the lawmakers from the three political parties in the visiting group also met with leaders from different Japanese political parties. This included four leaders from opposition parties and two former prime ministers. He said they learned a lot. The "Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council" has nearly 300 members out of 700 Japanese lawmakers. The visiting group also made the strong friendship between this Council and Taiwan's Legislative Yuan even stronger. This showed that parliaments from both sides care about each other.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said, "Trees grow tall, but their leaves return to their roots." From Kanto to Kansai, Tokyo to Osaka, the visiting group again felt the warmth and kindness of the overseas Chinese. Everyone wanted to treat them to meals, talk about Hualien, and said they would join the Republic of China's National Day celebration on October 10th. He said, "Overseas Chinese are like a beautiful kite. No matter how beautifully and high they fly in the sky, the string is always in Taiwan." The visiting group is very grateful to the overseas Chinese.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu also used four phrases to describe this trip: "Waking up earlier than chickens, running faster than horses, eating less than cats, and getting more tired than dogs." He said that even though it was hard, everyone was very happy. The visiting group represented Taiwan's Legislative Yuan to help the country and its people in diplomacy, to get out of the problem of being alone in the world. Lawmakers from the three parties felt they had an important job. He also asked the people of Taiwan to be good friends with the whole world. This is a responsibility that the three party lawmakers have given themselves. He hopes everyone will keep working for Taiwan's future and help Taiwan shine brightly around the world.</p>
            <p>The "Japan Parliamentary Diplomatic Visit Group" had 12 members. They included Han Kuo-yu, Deputy Chairmen of the "Taiwan-Japan Exchange Friendship Association" Hung Meng-kai (KMT) and Huang Shan-shan (TPP), as well as KMT lawmakers Hsu Yu-chen, Wang Hung-wei, Weng Hsiao-ling, Lin Chien-chi; DPP lawmakers Ho Hsin-chun, Wang Mei-hui, Kuo Yu-ching, Chuang Ruei-hsiung, and Chen Ying.</p>
