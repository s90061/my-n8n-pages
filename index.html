            <h1>Continuous Heavy Rains Flood Farms; Taitung Agricultural Center Asks Farmers to Quickly Harvest Valuable Vegetables</h1>
            <p>For several days, it has been raining a lot in Taitung. Many areas have received hundreds of millimeters of rain. Water has collected in farm fields, sometimes up to people's knees. The Taitung Agricultural Research and Extension Station is asking farmers to quickly harvest useful vegetables while the rain has stopped today. They also ask farmers to drain the water from the fields as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>The Taitung Agricultural Research and Extension Station, part of the Ministry of Agriculture, said today that heavy rain from Typhoon Wipha's outer parts caused this. From July 18 to 21, Taitung got over 300 millimeters of rain. Some towns got more than 500 millimeters. They are telling farmers to take steps to help their farms recover after the heavy rain. Farmers should quickly remove standing water, clear broken branches and fallen fruits from the fields, trim branches a little, and work to prevent plant diseases. This will stop germs from entering and causing more damage.</p>
            <p>The Taitung Agricultural Research and Extension Station gave advice on how to help important crops grow again. For fruit trees, if water is standing in the orchard, farmers should drain or pump it out right away. They should also clean the orchard well. It is important to prevent diseases, especially anthracnose and fruit rot in custard apples. For citrus fruits and pomelos, after the strong winds and rain, farmers should check for and prevent bacterial canker disease.</p>
            <p>For rice fields, if the field edges and ditches are damaged, farmers should fix them immediately. This will help manage how water flows in and out. Farmers should pay attention to announcements from the Agricultural and Rural Water Resources Agency. If the water inlet for irrigation is broken, they should keep some water in the fields. This will help with preparing the land.</p>
            <p>For various grains and special crops, farmers should remove standing water from the fields quickly. For pigeon pea and roselle, farmers can add some fertilizer to help them grow. If plants have fallen over, farmers should not straighten them right away. They can add soil around the base of the plants and lightly trim broken branches. For pigeon pea, farmers should prevent anthracnose and blight. For roselle, farmers should prevent blight. For vegetables, after heavy rain, farmers should work to remove standing water from the fields. They should quickly harvest leaves and fruits that are still good to sell. This will help reduce losses from the disaster.</p>

            <h1>Offensive Birthday Letter Causes Problems; White House Stops Wall Street Journal from Going with Trump to Scotland</h1>
            <p>(Washington, July 21, Central News Agency) U.S. President Trump is going to visit Scotland soon. Today, the White House said the Wall Street Journal cannot go with him to report. This is because the newspaper reported earlier that Trump sent an offensive birthday letter to an old friend, Jeffrey Epstein, who is a rich person who committed sex crimes.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Trump said this report was not true. On July 18, he sued the Wall Street Journal and media owner Rupert Murdoch. He is asking for at least 10 billion U.S. dollars (about 295.8 billion New Taiwan Dollars) because of the false report.</p>
            <p>This punishment for the Wall Street Journal is the second time Trump's government has stopped a major news organization from joining reporters on a trip because of what they reported. Since February, Trump's government has often stopped Associated Press reporters from going to important events.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said: "As the appeals court has said, the Wall Street Journal or any other news organization is not promised special permission to enter the President's Oval Office, Air Force One, and the President's private places for interviews."</p>
            <p>Leavitt added: "Because of the Wall Street Journal's false report and spreading untrue things, they will not be on the list of 13 news organizations allowed to travel on Air Force One, the President's special plane."</p>
            <p>This weekend, Trump will go to Scotland to meet with the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer. Trump owns two golf resorts there.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal previously showed that Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, collected birthday letters that Jeffrey Epstein received for his 50th birthday in 2003. This collection included an offensive letter signed by Trump. It had some words typed on it. Outside these words, there was a rough outline of a naked woman, which looked like it was drawn by hand.</p>
