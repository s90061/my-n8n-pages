Waking up can be hard. But new smart home gadgets can make it easier! Imagine your coffee machine starting automatically before you even get out of bed. Or your lights slowly turning on to wake you gently. Smart thermostats can also warm up your house before you start your day. These tools can save you time and make your mornings more relaxed. They might cost a bit of money, but many people think they are worth it for a better start to the day.

**Work: Flexible Hours Becoming More Popular**

More and more companies are offering flexible working hours. This means you can start and finish work at different times, as long as you work the required number of hours. For example, you might start at 7 am and finish at 3 pm, or start at 10 am and finish at 6 pm. This can help people balance work with their personal lives. It can also make people feel happier and more productive at work. Many companies are finding that flexible hours help them keep their employees.

**Travel: Sustainable Tourism on the Rise**

More travellers are thinking about the environment. Sustainable tourism is about travelling in a way that helps protect the places you visit. This means choosing hotels that are eco-friendly and supporting local businesses. It also means being careful about waste and using less plastic. Some popular sustainable tourism activities include hiking, cycling, and visiting national parks. When you travel sustainably, you can enjoy your trip and help protect the planet at the same time.
