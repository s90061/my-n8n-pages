            <h1>US Stocks Reach New Highs, TSMC Gives Good News; Experts Say It Will Help Taiwan Stocks</h1>
            <p>On July 17th, the S&P and Nasdaq stock markets in the US reached new high points. Experts say that even though there are worries about talks on US tariffs, TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) shared good news. This good news can make people feel more confident and help the Taiwan stock market grow.</p>
            <p>On July 17th, TSMC held a meeting and announced their profit for the second quarter was NT$398.273 billion. This is a new record. The chairman, C.C. Wei, also said that the company's income in US dollars this year could grow by up to 30%. This news made the market feel much better.</p>
            <p>On July 17th, the US stock market performed well. People were more interested in good sales numbers and company profits, rather than President Trump's tariff policies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 229.71 points (0.52%) to 44484.49 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 33.66 points (0.54%) to 6297.36 points. The Nasdaq index, which is mostly for technology companies, went up by 153.78 points (0.74%) to 20884.27 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 41.43 points (0.73%) to 5737.64 points.</p>
            <p>On July 17th, the Taiwan stock market went up by 70.38 points, closing at 23113.28 points. The total value of trades was NT$329.027 billion. Three major types of investors bought a total of NT$9.815 billion more than they sold. Among them, self-operating brokers bought NT$10.312 billion more, investment trusts sold NT$0.804 billion more, and foreign investors bought NT$0.307 billion more.</p>
            <p>For individual stocks, foreign investors bought the most of these three on July 17th: China Airlines (20,660 shares), Innolux (14,717 shares), and Synnex (13,645 shares). It is also important to know that Formosa Plastics, Nan Ya Plastics, and Formosa Chemicals were the 4th, 5th, and 6th most bought by foreign investors.</p>
            <p>Foreign investors sold the most of these three: Yuanta Taiwan 50 ETF (52,353 shares), Yuanta Taiwan 50 Inverse 1 ETF (17,314 shares), and SinoPac Financial Holdings (15,650 shares).</p>
            <p>KGI Securities said that the Taiwan stock market's price went up on July 17th, but with less trading. During the day, it stayed above its 5-day average line. The market gap from July 16th is still open, which means the market is still strong. Also, the lowest point was not lower than the day before, but the highest point was higher. Trading volume stayed close to the 5-day and 10-day averages. The KD indicator is still going up, and short-term average lines show a positive trend. This means the index might keep rising, following the 5-day average line. For now, the short-term support level is around 22871 points, which is the lowest point of the gap and the 5-day average line.</p>

            <h1>Trump's Tariffs Could Make UK's Jaguar Land Rover Cut 500 Management Jobs</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chen Yun-yu, London, July 17th) Jaguar Land Rover, a British car company, announced today that it will offer a "voluntary leaving" plan in the UK. This plan is mainly for people in management jobs. In June, Jaguar warned that even a 10% tax on cars sent to the US by President Trump would hurt their profits.</p>
            <p>Jaguar has over 30,000 employees in the UK. The company expects to reduce its staff by no more than 1.5%, which means no more than 500 people will lose their jobs.</p>
            <p>In April, Donald Trump announced "matching tariffs" that apply to different countries. He also kept an older tax rate of 25% for all imported cars.</p>
            <p>Later, the UK was the first country to make a deal with the US. British car makers will be able to send 100,000 cars to the US each year without paying more than a 10% tax. This new tax rate started on June 30th. Last year, the UK sent about 100,000 cars to the US.</p>
            <p>However, the special 10% tax rate only applies to cars made in the UK. It does not apply to cars made in the Slovakia factory.</p>
            <p>Jaguar recently showed its sales numbers from early April to late June. These numbers show that sales in stores went down by 15.1% compared to the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Besides Trump's tax policy, sales also got worse because the company stopped sending cars to the US for one month in April and May. This was to see how the new taxes would affect the market and to plan for the long term.</p>
            <p>Jaguar is now a brand of Tata Motors from India. Today, the company tried to make the job cuts seem less serious. They said it's a "normal" offer for "eligible employees" to leave their jobs by choice. They also said that the trade deal between the UK and the US gives the company confidence to invest Â£3.5 billion (about NT$140 billion) each year.</p>
            <p>Jaguar said that by reducing management jobs, the company is trying to make sure its managers fit the current and future needs of the business.</p>
            <p>Before Trump announced the "matching tariffs" in April, Jaguar's yearly financial report up to the end of March this year showed a profit of Â£2.5 billion. This was their best result in almost 10 years.</p>

            <h1>Trump Starts Trade Investigation Against Brazil, Affecting Chinese Business Area in SÃ£o Paulo</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Tang Ya-ling, SÃ£o Paulo, July 17th) "March 25th Street" in the center of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, is the biggest Chinese business area in Latin America. Recently, it became the target of a trade investigation ordered by US President Donald Trump. The reason given was that the area sells fake products and does not protect intellectual property rights well.</p>
            <p>"March 25th Street" (Rua 25 de MarÃ§o), also known as "25th Street," is famous because many Chinese-owned shops and wholesale centers are there. These shops mainly sell electronics, accessories, and fashion items.</p>
            <p>On July 15th, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced that, as ordered by Trump, the US has started a Section 301 investigation into Brazil.</p>
            <p>The Brazilian news website g1 reported that Trump called 25th Street "one of the largest fake product markets in the world." He ordered the US government to investigate Brazil's "unfair" trade practices.</p>
            <p>Before this, Trump had already threatened to put a 50% tax on goods coming from Brazil. Starting this investigation will give a legal reason for new tax rules.</p>
            <p>The report said that many business owners and shoppers on 25th Street think Trump's action is "wrong interference." They believe Trump should not tell Brazil's consumer market what to do.</p>
            <p>Some people admitted that there are fake products, but they said only a few shops sell them. Most products they sell come from China. Even though they are made in China, they have their own brand names and are not related to the US. Trump's policy of protecting his own country's businesses and his tax rules also received criticism.</p>
            <p>Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative, recently said that they will decide if Brazil's actions in digital trade and special taxes are "unfair or discriminatory." They will also see if these actions "cause problems or limits for American businesses."</p>
            <p>The USTR will also look into why Brazil has not stopped corruption, failed to protect intellectual property, increased taxes on ethanol from the US, and failed to stop illegal logging.</p>
            <p>The 25th Street Merchants Association (Univinco25) said that there are over 3,000 legal shops in the 25th Street area. The association admitted that there is some illegal trade, but they said that most shops do business in a legal and clear way.</p>
