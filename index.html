            <h1>Abbas at UN Says Hamas Will Not Govern Gaza After War</h1>
            <p>Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas spoke to the United Nations General Assembly by video today. He said that Palestinians do not support the attack on Israel by the armed group Hamas in 2023. He promised that Hamas will not rule the Gaza Strip after the war and must give up its weapons.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that Abbas spoke in a recorded video to the UN General Assembly. He said that Palestinians in the Gaza Strip "have faced a war from Israel that caused many deaths, damage, hunger, and people leaving their homes."</p>
            <p>Abbas stated that the Palestinian authorities "are against" the actions of the Palestinian armed group Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. He added that Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p>Abbas also shared his idea for how the Palestinian areas should be governed after the war between Israel and Hamas ends. He said the Palestinian Authority "is ready to take full responsibility for governing and security."</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that "Hamas will not be part of the government" and must give its weapons to the Palestinian authorities.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Abbas welcomed the recent announcements from France, the UK, and Canada to recognize the state of Palestine. He asked other countries that have not yet recognized Palestine to do the same.</p>
            <p>He also said: "We announce that we are ready to work with US President Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia, France, the United Nations, and all partners to put into action the peace plan supported by the UN General Assembly."</p>
            <p>Finally, Abbas said that even though the war is very difficult, Palestinians "will not leave our homes."</p>

            <h1>Giantplus Will Buy Color Filter Equipment and Technology from Japan's Toppan</h1>
            <p>Giantplus, a company that makes small and medium-sized display panels, announced important news today. Its board of directors agreed to buy color filter equipment and the right to use special technology (intangible assets) from Toppan Inc. in Japan.</p>
            <p>Giantplus Technology said that Toppan Inc. in Japan plans to stop making color filters. Toppan wants to sell or let Giantplus use the machines and special technology related to these products. The board of directors agreed to let the general manager sign and deliver the sales contract, license agreement, and stock transfer agreement with Toppan Inc. This can happen after all evaluations are done, and if it follows laws and protects the company's interests. The general manager can also handle any other matters or changes required by law or government.</p>
            <p>Giantplus also explained that for other contracts related to this deal, the board of directors will discuss and decide on them after all documents are ready and follow relevant laws.</p>
            <p>In January, Giantplus announced for its parent company, Toppan Holdings, that Toppan Holdings' board of directors agreed to sell all its shares in Giantplus (53.1%) to Juyi Investment Company. The transfer of shares was planned in two steps and was expected to finish by late August this year. However, Toppan has not yet made any announcement about this.</p>

            <h1>China Starts Investigation on Mexico's Trade Rules, Threatens to Fight Back with Taxes</h1>
            <p>Mexico plans to raise taxes on cars and other products from China. Because of this, China's Ministry of Commerce announced tonight that it is starting an investigation into Mexico's rules that limit trade and investment related to China. China warned it will take necessary actions based on the situation.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced tonight, September 25, that it has seen early proof and information. A proposal published in Mexico's "Congressional Gazette" on September 9, 2025, suggests changing many import taxes. The Mexican government plans to raise import tax rates on products from China and other countries that do not have free trade agreements. This action will greatly hurt the trade and investment interests of Chinese companies. So, China has decided to start an investigation on Mexico's rules limiting trade with China, starting from September 25, 2025.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that the investigation will look at Mexico's plan to raise import tax rates on products from China and other countries without free trade agreements. This includes cars and car parts, textiles, clothes, plastics, steel, home appliances, aluminum, toys, furniture, shoes, leather goods, paper and cardboard, motorcycles, and glass. Also, other rules Mexico has made in recent years that limit trade and investment with China are part of this investigation.</p>
            <p>The announcement stated that this investigation will last for six months from the date of the announcement. If needed, it can be extended, but not by more than three months.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce also released a press release with questions and answers, explaining this countermeasure.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that China believes that because the US is using tariffs so much now, all countries should work together against one-sided actions and protectionism. They should not hurt other countries because of pressure from others. If Mexico's plan to raise taxes happens, it will harm the interests of trading partners, including China, even within the rules of the World Trade Organization. It will also make Mexico's business environment less certain and make companies less confident to invest in Mexico. China strongly opposes this.</p>
            <p>Finally, the spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce threatened that China will take necessary actions based on the situation to protect its fair and legal rights.</p>
            <p>On September 10, the Mexican government said it would increase tariffs on cars from China and other countries without trade agreements to 50%. This big change to import tariffs is meant to protect jobs. However, experts think this move is to please the United States.</p>
            <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on September 11 that her government does not want problems with countries, including China, that will face higher tariffs.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce quickly sent a message, asking Mexico to think carefully. It said that Mexico's one-sided action to raise taxes would be seen as giving in to one-sided bullying.</p>
            <p>Mexico is the biggest country that imports Chinese cars. Currently, there is a 20% tariff. If this is greatly raised to 50%, it will severely hurt the Chinese car industry.</p>
