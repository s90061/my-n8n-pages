            <h1>Sun Chia-Hung is Taiwan's Flag Bearer at World Games, Says It's "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>The opening ceremony for the 2025 Chengdu World Games took place today. Sun Chia-Hung, a martial arts athlete, became the first martial arts athlete to carry Taiwan's flag. He was very excited, saying this moment felt like a dream.</p>
            <p>At the last World Games in Birmingham, Taiwan won 1 gold medal, 6 silver medals, and 6 bronze medals. For this World Games in Chengdu, Taiwan sent 120 athletes. They will compete in 14 different sports. The women's tug-of-war team plans to win their sixth championship in a row in the 500 kg category, which has never happened before.</p>
            <p>At today's opening ceremony in Chengdu, Sun Chia-Hung and Huang Mei-Chien carried the flag for Taiwan. They entered the stadium at number 104, between Syria and the Czech Republic. A total of 64 athletes from Taiwan took part in the opening ceremony. These athletes compete in sports like canoe polo, korgball, orienteering, underwater sports, roller sports, water skiing, martial arts, and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-Hung won a gold medal in Tai Chi Quan and a silver medal in Tai Chi Sword at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now, he is back in Chengdu and is the first martial arts athlete to be a flag bearer. He told the media he was very emotional, saying this scene was something he had only dreamed of since he was a child. He felt that this was a result of hard work over time. Many older athletes before him had done very well, and together, they helped Taiwan's martial arts gain a good reputation and be seen more in international competitions.</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-Chien was a swimmer for Taiwan at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In recent years, she has focused more on coaching. However, she still actively competes in fin swimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fin event at the World Fin Swimming Championships. Huang Mei-Chien shared that she has been an athlete's representative for oaths and a torch bearer before. But being a flag bearer is new for her. She said she is "very excited and a little nervous" and hopes to do a good job with this task.</p>

            <h1>FSC: Cars Damaged by Water Need Extra Insurance for Coverage</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced today that current car insurance plans, like types A, B, and C, do not cover damage from typhoons or floods. If people want this protection, they must add a special extra part to their insurance. This extra part is called "Additional Clause for Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood, or Water Accumulation due to Rain." Only with this extra part will their cars be protected from these types of damage.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan, Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, spoke at a regular press conference today. He said that insurance can be divided into two main types: personal insurance and business insurance. The southern and central parts of Taiwan were heavily affected by recent heavy rains. This means not only individuals and businesses might be impacted, but also homes and cars could be damaged. For personal insurance, he explained that current home fire insurance already includes "Home Typhoon and Flood Disaster Compensation Insurance." If a home is damaged by a typhoon or flood, and the water level reaches 50 centimeters or more, this insurance provides basic coverage ranging from NT$7,000 to NT$9,000, depending on the area.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan also said that if people feel the basic insurance is not enough, they can ask their insurance company to add an "Excess Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause." This extra clause will give more compensation than the basic plan. It also provides NT$3,000 per day for temporary housing, for up to 60 days.</p>
            <p>In addition, there have been many mudslide disasters recently. Chen Ching-yuan explained that if a house is in a low-lying area or on a hillside, people can choose to add a "Land Subsidence, Landslide, or Landslide Insurance Additional Clause." This protects against losses caused by landslides, ground sinking, land movement, loose ground, or sand and soil washing away (including mudslides) that happen because of typhoons or floods.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that many cars were also damaged by floods. However, current car insurance, which includes Type A, Type B, and Type C body damage insurance, does not cover losses caused by typhoons and floods. If people live in low areas and worry about their cars being damaged by typhoons or floods, they can add the "Additional Clause for Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood, or Water Accumulation due to Rain." This will protect their vehicles from damage caused by typhoons, floods, and similar events.</p>
            <p>For business insurance, Chen Ching-yuan mentioned that the most common fire insurance for businesses is Comprehensive Commercial Fire Insurance. This covers a wide range of things, mainly buildings, machines, and movable property. It protects against losses from sudden and unexpected accidents. This means it also covers losses caused by typhoons and floods.</p>
            <p>However, Chen Ching-yuan also stated that Commercial Fire Insurance needs a clear list of what it covers. So, if it doesn't clearly state that it covers losses from typhoons or floods, businesses should add a separate "Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause." This will help them transfer the risk of natural disasters. He advises businesses to talk to their insurance company when buying insurance to make sure the coverage meets their needs.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Blames Shiodong Line Project for Damaged Line; New Taipei MRT Department to Investigate</h1>
            <p>Matsuyama Airport experienced a power outage tonight. Taipower, the power company, said that the power line was accidentally damaged by the New Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems during the Shiodong Line construction project. However, the New Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems replied that it is not yet certain if their construction caused the power outage. They will let Taipower inspect the site tomorrow morning to find out.</p>
            <p>Matsuyama Airport had a short power outage in the evening. The Civil Aeronautics Administration said the power was out for only 3 to 4 seconds, and no flights were affected. Also, many places in the Songshan area had power outages, and escalators at MRT Nanjing Fuxing Station stopped working.</p>
            <p>Taipower stated that their check showed the Shiodong Line construction project by the New Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems accidentally damaged a power transmission line. This caused a quick drop in voltage, making the power briefly flicker at places like Matsuyama Airport, Taipei MRT, and Far EasTone Telecommunications headquarters. Taipower's power supply is now back to normal.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems explained in a message that their Shiodong Line project was drilling on Tongxing Road in Xizhi District. According to the high-voltage wire map provided by Taipower, there was no 161KV high-voltage wire underground at that location. Also, the construction company dug down 2.5 meters and drilled 40 meters, and found no pipes or wires. Therefore, it is not yet certain if their work caused the power outage.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Rapid Transit Systems said that because Taipower directly stated the Shiodong Line project caused it, they will start traffic control and let Taipower come in to inspect tomorrow morning. This will help them find out the real reason for the incident.</p>
