            <h1>Israeli Army Works Faster to Clear Gaza City; More Than 65,000 Palestinians Dead in Two-Year Conflict</h1>
            <p>The Israeli army announced today that they will open another new road for 48 hours. This road is for Palestinians to leave Gaza City. Israel is also trying harder to move people out of the city and fight thousands of Hamas soldiers.</p>
            <p>News reports say that many hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are currently hiding in Gaza City. A lot of these people do not want to go south, even though Israel has told them to. This is because the trip is dangerous, life in the south is difficult, there is not enough food, and they are afraid they will never be able to return home.</p>
            <p>Ahmed, who teaches at a school there, said in a phone call, "Even if we wanted to leave Gaza City, how can we be sure we can come back? Will the war stop? This is why I would rather die in Sabra, my own neighborhood."</p>
            <p>Health authorities in Gaza reported that Israeli air attacks and shootings today killed at least 50 people in different parts of the Gaza Strip. Out of these, 39 people died in Gaza City.</p>
            <p>These officials said that with this new count, the total number of Palestinians who have died in the two-year war between Israel and Hamas is now over 65,000.</p>
            <p>Palestinian officials and rescue workers also said that the real number of dead might be even higher. Many bodies are still under the broken pieces of buildings that have fallen down.</p>
