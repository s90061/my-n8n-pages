Many people are now working from home, or in other places that are not their office. This is called remote work. It became more common because of the pandemic. Companies are finding that remote work can save money on office space. Employees also like it because they can have more control over their schedules and spend less time traveling to work. Some studies show that people are just as productive, or even more productive, when they work remotely. However, it is important to have good communication tools and a dedicated workspace to be successful. Remote work is likely to continue to be a popular option for many in the future.
