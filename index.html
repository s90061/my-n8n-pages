Taiwan Railways announced today that trains on the Western Line will start running again after 12 PM. This comes as Typhoon Danas moves away. Local express trains, along with the Liujia and Shalun lines, are already running normally.

Typhoon Danas was about 70 kilometers northwest of Taipei at 9 AM today. It was moving north-northeast and then northwest. Before noon, some trains on the Western Line were stopped, and three smaller lines were also closed because of damaged signals.

Starting at 12 PM, train services will mostly be back to normal. This includes the 271 train (departing from Qidu at 12:20 PM) and the 124 train (departing from Chaozhou at 12:05 PM). Other lines like Pingxi, Shenâ€™ao, Neiwu, and Jiji will also run as usual, but this might change depending on the weather.

The Penghu weather station reported that Typhoon Danas covered all of Penghu yesterday evening and landed in Chiayi last night. Penghu was out of the typhoon's strong winds by early morning today. For almost seven hours, there was strong wind and rain. Wangan's Dongji island had very strong winds, and Qimei had heavy rain, with 79 millimeters in one hour between 8 PM and 9 PM.

On Penghu Island, there were only minor problems like fallen trees and branches. The Penghu County Disaster Response Center received 8 reports of damage, mostly fallen trees in Magong and Huxi.

**Twin Brothers Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih Win First Gold at Canada Badminton Tournament**

Taiwanese twin brothers Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih, who are rare in the world of badminton, finally won their first BWF Super 300 title at the Canada Open today. Their coach, Li Song-yuan, said the brothers are "very different on and off the court."

Li Fang-jen and Li Fang-chih are a unique pair of twin brothers. Li Fang-jen, the older brother, was born two minutes before Li Fang-chih. They started playing badminton just for fun when they were in elementary school. They began serious training in middle school and became partners in high school.

In 2016, when they were 18, they won the BWF Sydney International tournament. Before this Canada Open, they had been runners-up twice in Super 300 events and reached the semi-finals three times, but never won a championship.

In this Canadian Open, the two changed their strategy. They played steadily and controlled the game with quick movements and rhythm, finally winning the title.
