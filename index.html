            <h1>Japanese Ruling Parties Lose in Upper House Election; Attention on Who Will Be Next Leader After Ishiba</h1>
            <p>The Japanese ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, could not win enough seats in the Upper House election. This is the first time in 70 years that the LDP will be a minority party in both houses of parliament. The LDP leader, Shigeru Ishiba, does not want to step down, but the political situation is difficult. People are now watching closely to see who will become the next leader after Ishiba.</p>
            <p>The election for Japan's Upper House happened today. News reports based on exit polls say the LDP will likely get 33 seats. This might be less than their previous lowest record of 36 seats in 1989. Komeito is expected to get 8 seats. Together, the ruling parties will have 41 seats. This is much less than half of the seats needed in the Upper House. It is also less than the 50-seat goal set by Prime Minister Ishiba, who is also the LDP leader.</p>
            <p>Japan's Upper House has 248 seats. Members serve for 6 years. Half of the seats, 124, are elected every 3 years. This election chose 74 seats from areas, 50 seats from party lists, and 1 extra seat from Tokyo. In total, 125 seats were chosen. If the LDP and Komeito did not win 50 seats in this election, they would not have more than half of the seats in the Upper House.</p>
            <p>Around 10 PM tonight, Ishiba spoke to NHK. He was asked if he would resign because his party did not get more than half the seats in the Upper House. Ishiba said that the LDP is still the "biggest party and has a duty to the country." This means he does not plan to resign.</p>
            <p>The LDP and Komeito are now in a difficult situation because they do not have more than half the seats in both houses of parliament. Ishiba will talk with Natsuo Yamaguchi, the head of Komeito, tomorrow. After that, he will hold a press conference. Whether Ishiba's government steps down or not, the political situation will be very tense.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that the biggest question in politics after the LDP's loss in this Upper House election is "if Prime Minister Ishiba will stay." Last October, Ishiba's LDP lost the Lower House election. If they lose this Upper House election again, he should usually resign.</p>
            <p>Some people in the LDP say, "Ishiba will not resign." Ishiba also said tonight that he wants to keep "being responsible for the country."</p>
            <p>Many people think that customs talks between Japan and the US are still happening. Ishiba believes this is a "national crisis" and that he must continue to lead the country. However, there is no example of an LDP leader who lost two big national elections in a row and did not resign. Some people in the LDP might try to force him to leave.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun said that Sanae Takaichi, a former Minister for Economic Security, is one person who might replace Ishiba. On July 18, she helped a candidate from the LDP's Upper House election. She said, "I have decided to help the LDP stand tall again, and I will fight." People think this means if the LDP loses this election, she will try to make Ishiba resign and take his place.</p>
            <p>A special meeting of parliament, which will decide the future of the Upper House election, will probably start on August 1. If Shigeru Ishiba resigns, the LDP will need to elect a new party leader. After choosing a new leader, that person must be chosen as prime minister by the parliament. The dates for these elections need to be decided.</p>
            <p>Before the special parliament meeting, the LDP needs to choose someone to replace Ishiba. The old groups within the party will work together and against each other.</p>
            <p>The report also looked at the chance of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida becoming prime minister again. In Nagata-cho, where the parliament is, discussions have already been happening secretly about what to do after Ishiba leaves. The first idea is for "former Prime Minister Kishida to return."</p>
            <p>Besides Sanae Takaichi, other people who might replace Ishiba include Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, former Minister for Economic Security Takayuki Kobayashi, and Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. For now, Kishida seems to have the most support. Kishida is 67 years old. If he gets help from former Prime Minister Taro Aso, who still leads a group in the LDP, it would be very good for him.</p>
            <p>Also, another important point of this Upper House election is that the ruling parties might "add more parties to their group." The LDP and Komeito lost the Lower House election and now have also lost this Upper House election. If they don't have more than half the seats, it will be hard to run the parliament. They will need support from other parties to pass new laws and budgets.</p>
            <p>Many people think the LDP and Komeito want to get support from the Japan Innovation Party and the Democratic Party for the People. However, Hirofumi Yoshimura, the leader of the Japan Innovation Party and Governor of Osaka Prefecture, has clearly said, "We are not thinking about joining the ruling group."</p>
            <p>Kazuya Shimba, the Secretary-General of the Democratic Party for the People, said tonight that "we are not thinking about joining the LDP and Komeito's government." The Democratic Party for the People wanted to get 16 seats in this election. If they add their old seats, they will have 21 seats in total. This means they can propose laws and budgets by themselves.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri newspaper said that the LDP and Komeito could use a "secret plan." This plan is to make Yuichiro Tamaki, the leader of the Democratic Party for the People, the prime minister. Then they would form a "LDP, Komeito, Democratic Party for the People government." This has happened before in Japanese politics. In 1994, the LDP, the Social Democratic Party, and the New Party Sakigake formed a group and made Tomiichi Murayama, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, prime minister.</p>
            <p>The report said that big news reporters are watching what "key people in Nagata-cho" say or if they have secret meetings. These key people in the LDP are former Prime Minister Taro Aso, former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama. For the Democratic Party for the People, they are party leader Yuichiro Tamaki and General Secretary Motohisa Furukawa.</p>
            <p>Another news person said, "The Sanseitou (New Party for the People) is also important to watch this time. Japan's government is now facing big changes. The Constitutional Democratic Party might also propose a no-confidence vote against the government."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Team FW Wins World Championship at APL Arena of Valor Tournament</h1>
            <p>The APL Arena of Valor tournament was held in Bangkok, Thailand. Today, the Taiwanese team Flash Wolves (FW) won the championship. They came back from losing 2 games to win 4 games against the Thai team EA. They are now world champions again after 5 years.</p>
            <p>The APL Arena of Valor tournament had a total prize of 500,000 US dollars (about 14.7 million New Taiwan dollars). Flash Wolves' team leader is YuXiang (Xia Yuxiang). The team also has NaiLiu (Wang Zixiu) as the Dark Slayer Lane player, Zhan (Zhan Zherui) as the Jungler, Zhenzhe (Cai Zhengze) as the Mid Laner, and WeiZ (Lin Weizhe) as the Support player. Flash Wolves were the champions of the GCS Spring Professional League in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. This meant they went straight to the main games.</p>
            <p>Flash Wolves passed the Swiss-system stage and moved on to the knockout games. They won many games, especially beating the last year's runner-up, Thai team BRU (Buriram United Esports), in the semi-finals. This made them the first team to reach the championship game. However, Flash Wolves expected a tough fight today against EA (EArena), who were the champions of the Thai RPL Summer Professional League, in a best-of-7 match.</p>
            <p>When the game started, Flash Wolves lost the first two games and were behind 0-2. But Flash Wolves did not give up easily. They started to catch up from the third game. They slowly got better at playing and gained the advantage. In the important sixth game, Flash Wolves showed how strong they were. They broke the opponent's main tower in less than 10 minutes. They won the world championship again, just like in 2020. They also won 200,000 US dollars (about 5.9 million New Taiwan dollars) as the prize money.</p>

            <h1>Hsinchu Recall Groups Campaign with Street Sweeps and Meetings, Blue and White Parties Hold Rallies Against Recalls</h1>
            <p>Today, groups in Hsinchu who want to remove Mayor Ann Kao (who is currently suspended) from her job worked with people from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). They went around the city to ask people to vote to "agree to recall." The Kuomintang (KMT) held an event in Hsinchu. Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu and other KMT politicians spoke there. They asked people to vote "no" to the recall.</p>
            <p>The votes for recalling Hsinchu Mayor Ann Kao (who is currently suspended) and KMT Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien will be counted on July 26. Today, both sidesâ€”those who want to recall and those who do notâ€”tried to get people to vote. They did this by going around the city, holding meetings, and having evening events.</p>
            <p>Dai Chen-po, the main person leading the Hsinchu recall effort, told CNA that this morning, they went to Shibajianshan with the DPP group from the Hsinchu City Council to ask for votes. In the afternoon, they held a meeting about "Anti-Communism as the Biggest Common Ground." They invited a retired military officer, "Eagle Dad" Hsu Po-yueh, to speak. He talked about the meaning of the recall from the point of view of national security for the military.</p>
            <p>In the meeting, Hsu Po-yueh said that the KMT is too close to China and is selling out Taiwan. He said they have forgotten their original goals. He explained that this recall is not just about "true KMT members against fake KMT members." It is also a holy fight to protect the Republic of China and stop China from getting involved. He warned that this recall might affect Taiwan's future for the next hundred years.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chieh, a spokesperson for the Hsinchu recall group, said that Ann Kao was found guilty of corruption in her first trial and sentenced to 7 years and 4 months in prison. This caused the public's satisfaction with Hsinchu City government to be among the lowest for three years in a row. Cheng Cheng-chien has put forward many laws in parliament that harm the constitution and cause problems. He is also involved in breaking national security laws, anti-infiltration laws, corruption laws, and taking public money. Both of them, she said, have good reasons to be recalled.</p>
            <p>On the side against the recall, Cheng Cheng-chien and Ann Kao spoke in front of a shopping center in the afternoon. Cheng Cheng-chien said that he tried to get more money for Hsinchu City in parliament. But the recall group said they were "afraid it would cause problems for the Hsinchu City government." Ann Kao said that many people still don't know they need to vote "no to recall" to oppose it. She asked people to go out and vote.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the KMT held an event called "Against Bad Recalls, Protect Hsinchu" at the Hsinchu Ambassador Hotel. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, Nantou County Magistrate Hsu Shu-hua, and Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu were there to speak. They asked people to vote for Ann Kao and Cheng Cheng-chien on July 26.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen said she came to Hsinchu to support because she does not agree with the ruling party causing trouble by starting "recalls without good reason." Hsu Shu-hua said that the DPP has seen Hsinchu City as its own area for a long time and is using these big recalls to get rid of people who are against them.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu, the Legislative Speaker, said that Taiwan has taken 30 years to become a mature democracy. If the DPP uses the central government's resources to get rid of opposing parties, it will become a joke to other countries. He asked people to strongly support Cheng Cheng-chien to continue watching the government in parliament and get money for Hsinchu City. He also asked them to support Ann Kao so that the DPP cannot control Hsinchu City's government.</p>
