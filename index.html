            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai Says Problems with New Finance Law are in the Legislature, Will Discuss Solutions with Local Governments on September 13</h1>
            <p>The argument over how the new Financial Division Law will share money is still ongoing. Premier Cho Jung-tai plans to meet with local governments in two groups on September 13 to talk about the law. Today, Cho Jung-tai said that local governments want to "surround the central government" and "put down their knives" because of the new law. But he added that society generally agrees the changes to the law are wrong. He hopes local governments will be open to discussing solutions with the central government to fix these mistakes.</p>
            <p>The disagreement about how the central government gives money to local governments continues. Yesterday, leaders and deputy leaders from counties and cities run by the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) released a statement. They said they want the shared tax money and general grants to stay the same or increase. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said they would "surround the central government," while Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen asked the central government to "put down its knife." Meanwhile, leaders from counties and cities run by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) had asked the central government earlier to fix the Financial Division Law quickly, saying its formula was wrong.</p>
            <p>According to the Executive Yuan's plan, Premier Cho Jung-tai will meet with local governments in two separate groups on September 13 to talk about the Financial Division Law. Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said today after a cabinet meeting that Cho Jung-tai noted in the meeting that the new Financial Division Law has caused bad results, making cities and rural areas unbalanced. He also said the formula has clear errors. Because there wasn't enough time to make changes, planning next year's budget has become very difficult.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-tai explained that the Executive Yuan's document asking for a re-vote clearly showed the problems with pictures. He said that if the Legislative Yuan had fully discussed the Executive Yuan's concerns in February, this argument about money sharing would not have happened today. "Sadly, back then, the Legislative Yuan only looked at the vote numbers," he said. That is why creating the budget now is so hard.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that 15 county and city leaders held a press conference yesterday. But these leaders did not offer solutions. Instead, they talked about "surrounding the central government" and asking the central government to "put down its knife." However, the Executive Yuan's re-vote document had already pointed out the problems.</p>
            <p>Cho Jung-tai stressed that society has already decided that the changes to the law are wrong. The government does not want to blame anyone, but rather to fix the mistakes. This way, there can be fair discussions about how financial income and expenses are shared in the future. He said, "The person who tied the knot must untie it," meaning those who caused the problem should help fix it. He hopes everyone will be open to discussing this together.</p>

            <h1>Rubio Talks with Wang Yi, Seeks "Constructive" Interaction Between US and China</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. â€“ As the United States pressures China over its purchase of Russian oil, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi today. Rubio said he hopes for a helpful discussion with China.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. State Department said that during the call, Rubio "stressed how important it is to keep communication open and helpful on many different topics for both countries." However, the details were not made clear.</p>
            <p>Rubio's call with Wang Yi happened a few days after Chinese President Xi Jinping led a big military parade to remember the end of World War II. Leaders from many countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, were there.</p>
            <p>U.S. President Trump has said that these three leaders are secretly working against the United States.</p>
            <p>According to Xinhua News Agency, Wang Yi said his talk with Rubio was useful. But he also warned that "America's recent negative words and actions have hurt China's fair rights."</p>
            <p>Wang Yi also told the U.S. to be careful when dealing with issues important to China, especially the Taiwan issue.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi pointed out, "China and the U.S. fought together in World War II against militarism and fascism. In this new time, both sides should work together to make the world peaceful and prosperous, deal with global problems, and act responsibly as big countries should."</p>
            <p>When Rubio was a federal senator, he was known for his strong opinions against China. During his confirmation hearing, he even warned that a full global competition was needed to stop China from becoming the world's top power before the U.S.</p>
            <p>However, when Rubio met with Wang Yi in Malaysia in July this year, the atmosphere was friendly. President Trump has also spoken highly of his relationship with Xi Jinping and said he hopes to visit China this year.</p>
            <p>But Trump recently hinted that he might raise tariffs on Chinese goods, similar to what he did with India. He said this is because these countries continue to buy Russian oil, even though Russia has not listened to the U.S. request for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war.</p>

            <h1>China Eastern Airlines Starts New Route, Argentine Media Mistakenly Shows China Airlines Images</h1>
            <p>Buenos Aires â€“ On September 10, Argentine news channel A24 reported that China Eastern Airlines will start a new route in December. It will fly from Shanghai to Buenos Aires, with a stop in Auckland. This route is called the "Southern Corridor" because it connects three continents. However, the news report mistakenly showed pictures of Taiwan's China Airlines, which caused confusion for viewers.</p>
            <p>The news broadcast started with one photo of China Eastern Airlines and a screenshot of a social media post from the Chinese Embassy in Argentina. But then, a four-and-a-half-minute video explaining the route mostly used a promotional video from China Airlines called "With You, Blooming in the Sky." In the video, the plum blossom logo on the tail of the China Airlines plane was clearly visible. For viewers who did not know about the two airlines, they might have thought the Taiwanese airline was a Chinese state-owned company.</p>
            <p>Argentine media called this route "the longest flight route in the world." It will take about 29 hours and cover a distance of 19,681 kilometers. The plane will stop in Auckland, New Zealand, but passengers will not get off. This route is seen as a "Southern Corridor" that connects Asia, Oceania, and South America. There will be four flights each week. It is believed to be one of the ways to improve trade and cultural exchange between China and Argentina.</p>
            <p>The opening of this route is also closely related to policies of China, New Zealand, and Argentina. In May 2025, after the "China-CELAC Forum" was held in Beijing, China announced a 30-day visa-free policy for citizens from five Latin American countries, including Argentina. In July of the same year, Argentina also announced that Chinese tourists could enter the country with a U.S. visa. These actions have helped the Southern Corridor route to open.</p>
            <p>Carrie Hurihanganui, the CEO of Auckland Airport, said that choosing Auckland as a stop is also connected to the New Zealand Electronic Travel Authority (NZeTA) policy. This policy will start in November 2025 and will allow Chinese citizens to transfer flights without needing a traditional visa.</p>
            <p>Argentine media explained that after Malaysia Airlines stopped flying to South America 10 years ago, China Eastern Airlines' direct flight is now the only international air route between Asia and Argentina. In the future, this will mean travelers and cargo will rely less on stopping in Europe or North America. It will also make travel time between East Asia and South America shorter. This also shows China's continued effort to increase its trade influence and diplomatic plans in Latin America.</p>
