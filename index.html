Taipei City's Hydraulic Engineering Office announced that Typhoon Dianmu is expected to bring heavy rain to Taipei from July 6th to July 7th. Due to the increased rainfall, upstream reservoirs might release more water, which could raise river levels. Therefore, from 8 PM tonight, floodgates and riverside ramps will be closed for entry, only allowing vehicles to exit.

The Hydraulic Engineering Office stated that if river water levels rise quickly and reach the closure standard, Taipei City will close the floodgates at any time to keep citizens inside the dike safe.

The office also reminded that the Department of Transportation opened parking on red and yellow lines (with conditions) on roads wider than 8 meters around the floodgates at 10 AM today. Vehicles parked outside the dike should move quickly to avoid being towed and fined after the "no entry" rule begins for floodgates and riverside roads.

Additionally, the Taipei City Hydraulic Engineering Office asked people and vehicles in riverside parks to leave the river areas quickly to ensure their safety and property.

**UK-France Relationship Improves, but Migrant Dispute overshadows Leaders' Summit**

After Brexit, the UK and France are getting along better. However, a record number of illegal migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats is still causing problems between the two countries.

This issue will be a main topic when French President Emmanuel Macron visits the UK on July 8th. After talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Macron is expected to announce new plans on July 10th to stop these dangerous journeys.

This year, over 21,000 migrants have crossed from northern France to southeast England in simple boats. This is a big problem for Starmer, especially with the rise of far-right groups.

It makes British politicians and some newspapers angry to see law enforcement seemingly doing nothing while overcrowded boats leave French beaches.

The Sun newspaper, referring to the "Sandhurst Treaty," said, "We pay for French police cars, 4x4s, and drones, but migrants are still sailing."

The Sandhurst Treaty, made in 2018, says that the UK will give money to France to help stop migrants until 2027.

Starmer, whose Labour Party won a big victory last year after 14 years of Conservative rule, has promised to "take back control" of the UK's borders.

However, in the first half of 2025, the number of people arriving in the UK by small boats increased by 48% compared to last year. The government blames this on the dry weather.

The yearly record of 45,774 people from 2022 might be broken this year. This would be a big problem for Starmer, as the Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, who is against the EU, is currently ahead in national polls.

**TRA Employee Sentenced to Life for Hitting Colleague with Hammer; Dismissed by Disciplinary Court**

A Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) employee named Lin was accused of hitting a colleague with a hammer, causing death, in 2023 due to work disagreements. In the criminal case, the Qiaotou District Court sentenced Lin to life in prison for murder. In the disciplinary case for public servants, the Disciplinary Court recently ordered Lin's dismissal from his job. Both decisions can be appealed.

The court ruling stated that Lin, a technical assistant at the Zuoying section of TRA's Kaohsiung Locomotive Section, was angry with a colleague named Hong because of work disputes. On June 1, 2023, Lin brought a hammer and hit Hong on the head and chest, which are vital areas. Hong died immediately. The Qiaotou District Court's citizen judge panel found Lin guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment, taking away his civil rights forever.

TRA's Kaohsiung Locomotive Section investigated the incident to find the facts and decide on administrative responsibility. They found that Lin left his post without permission during work hours on June 1, 2023, and was given a warning. Also, because Lin was held for the criminal case, TRA suspended him. The Ministry of Transportation then sent Lin's case to the Disciplinary Court.

The Disciplinary Court believed that Lin did not try to solve the conflict with Hong in a proper way. Instead, he used a deadly attack to kill Hong, which seriously damaged the reputation of public servants and the government. Therefore, the court ordered Lin's dismissal from his job. This decision can be appealed.
