            <h1>National Museum of Taiwan Literature to Hold "Literary Autumn Day Market" on October 18th for 22nd Anniversary</h1>
            <p>The National Museum of Taiwan Literature (NMTL) is celebrating its 22nd birthday. The museum announced today that a special market called "Literary Autumn Day Market" (B√ªn-haÃçk tsh√†ng-tshiu jiÃçt) will open on October 18th. It will run for two days at the NMTL. This market will offer cultural experiences for autumn, including different brands, food, and music.</p>
            <p>The NMTL explained today that the main idea of this year's "Literary Autumn Day Market" is "Literature is Dialogue." It will combine elements of local languages. It will bring together independent bookstores, art creations, international cultures, special foods, and music shows.</p>
            <p>The market will have almost 100 stalls with stylish brands, food, music, and talks. There will also be 6 special booths from the Czech Republic. In addition, there will be 3 discussion events, 1 art project where people can create together, and 9 music performances. These events will bring together different languages and creative backgrounds for cross-cultural conversations.</p>
            <p>The market is planned with five themed areas: "Book Forest Island," "Language Dwelling Island," "Literature Island," "Well-Read Island," and "Wind Sound Island." These islands will be both inside and outside the museum. Together, they will form an "Autumn Literary Island." This allows visitors to have their own literary dialogues in different parts of the museum.</p>
            <p>This year is also the 100th birthday of the writer Yeh Shih-Tao. The Yeh Shih-Tao Literary Memorial Museum will set up a temporary post office. It will offer a special limited-edition postmark. Visitors are welcome to "write a letter to Elder Yeh."</p>

            <h1>Hou Chin-ying, Daughter of Hou Yu-li, Trained Many Talents, Known as a Driving Force for Taiwan's Financial Leaders</h1>
            <p>Hou Chin-ying, the chairman of Far Eastern International Bank, passed away on October 3rd at the age of 95. She taught at National Chengchi University for over 30 years. Many important people in finance, like Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long and former Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Huang Tien-mu, either attended her classes or were her students. Because she taught so many talented people, Hou Chin-ying was known as the "Godmother of Taiwan's Finance." She saw Taiwan's financial system change from reforms to becoming more open, and now to a time with many different companies. She dedicated her life to helping finance grow and left behind a great example of a banker.</p>
            <p>Hou Chin-ying's father, Hou Yu-li, was a very important person in the "Tainan Gang" group of businesses. He started by selling fabric. Even though Hou Chin-ying came from a rich family, she worked hard to create her own path. She became the first woman to get a master's degree from National Taiwan University's Economics Institute. During her studies, she met her husband, Liang Kuo-shu, who later became the Central Bank Governor. They both went abroad to study more.</p>
            <p>After returning to Taiwan, she became a teacher. She taught in the Department of Public Finance and Banking, and later became the head of the Banking Department at National Chengchi University. Former Premier Lin Chuan, Central Bank Governor Yang Chin-long, former Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Huang Tien-mu, and former Bank of Taiwan Chairman Lu Chu-cheng all either took her classes or were her students. Hou Chin-ying once said, "My only special thing is enjoying congratulations from my students who become leaders."</p>
            <p>Lu Chu-cheng remembered that when he became Minister of Finance, Hou Chin-ying gave him a small fluffy dog doll to cheer him up and wish him well. Huang Tien-mu said that the kind "Teacher Hou" once gave him a glass lion to encourage him, a gentle person, to achieve more.</p>
            <p>Even though she was happy for her students' successes, Hou Chin-ying always said humbly, "Young people need to work hard by themselves. Teachers can only help a little, we are not that great!"</p>
            <p>Besides teaching many people, Hou Chin-ying was very smart and knowledgeable. In the late 1960s, she organized new ideas in international economics and wrote a book called "Modern Monetary Theory." It was the first textbook on monetary theory written by a local scholar. She also wrote works with Liang Kuo-shu, giving advice on international trade policies. They were not only a great couple in the finance world but also the best partners for helping each other in their studies.</p>
            <p>After Liang Kuo-shu passed away in 1995, Hou Chin-ying became the chairman of the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance. She wanted to continue her husband's goal of training financial talent in Taiwan. With her strong will and hard work, she overcame problems like not enough buildings and money. She successfully changed and improved the Academy, creating Taiwan's first world-class center for financial training and exams. This laid the foundation for training financial professionals in Taiwan and became an important link for Taiwan's finance industry to connect with the world.</p>
            <p>In 2008, Hou Chin-ying moved to the business world and became the chairman of Far Eastern International Bank. She led the bank to become a specialized and excellent bank in the Greater China region, even in a very competitive financial market. Even when she was over 90 years old, she personally led shareholder meetings, looking lively and reporting the bank's performance, which was very impressive.</p>
            <p>In September this year, the Taiwan Finance and Banking Association and the Department of Finance at National Chengchi University started the "Chin-ying Lecture Series." This will continue Hou Chin-ying's ideas about education.</p>
            <p>Hou Chin-ying once said, "I just do every small thing carefully and seriously, that's all." This idea is simple, but it is hard to follow through. Hou Chin-ying spent her life working for Taiwan's finance industry, and her example as a great banker will always be remembered.</p>

            <h1>0050 Becomes the Largest Stock Fund in Taiwan, Surpassing Allianz Income and Growth Fund</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is leading the Taiwan stock market to new record highs. The value of the Yuanta Taiwan 50 (0050) ETF has also grown a lot. Today, its total value reached NT$767.3 billion. This is more than the Allianz Income and Growth Fund, which had NT$756 billion, making 0050 the largest stock fund in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Fund companies say that in the past, Taiwanese investors liked active funds from other countries that paid dividends. The Allianz Income and Growth Fund was the largest of these. But in recent years, Taiwanese investors have started to prefer passive ETFs. Among these, 0050 is the first and oldest ETF in Taiwan, and it is also the biggest. It is very important that 0050 has now become larger than the Allianz Income and Growth Fund.</p>
            <p>0050 tracks the 50 largest companies by market value listed on the Taiwan stock exchange. Recently, the Taiwan stock market has reached new highs. This growth is mainly due to big companies like TSMC. Because of this, 0050 has gotten bigger very quickly.</p>
            <p>Also, Yuanta Funds lowered the fees for 0050 at the beginning of this year. Then, they split the shares to make it easier for people to invest smaller amounts. This helped to attract many investors and was a key reason for 0050's growth.</p>
            <p>The total value of 0050 keeps reaching new milestones. In early September, it passed NT$700 billion and became the largest ETF in Taiwan. In less than a month, on October 2nd, its value passed NT$750 billion. Because of how its fees are calculated, the management fee is now less than 0.1%. Today, its value went over NT$760 billion, making it the largest fund in Taiwan, whether active or passive.</p>
