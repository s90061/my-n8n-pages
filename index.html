**Popular Tourist Spots Taking Action Against Too Many Visitors**

Some of the world's most beautiful and famous places are getting too many tourists. This problem, called "overtourism," can harm local culture and the environment. Cities like Venice in Italy are now trying new ways to manage the large numbers of visitors. For example, Venice has started charging a small fee for day-trippers to enter the city on busy days. The goal is to reduce crowds and protect these special places for the people who live there and for future travelers. This trend shows that destinations are becoming more serious about finding a balance between welcoming tourists and preserving their unique character.
