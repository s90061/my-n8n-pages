            <h1>Hsinchu City Destroys Mercury-Polluted Rice; Environmental Department Helps Farmers</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 31st (CNA) - Farmlands in Hsinchu were polluted with mercury. The city government destroyed the rice and started to clean the land. The Ministry of Environment said it will first pay for the destruction of the crops, help farmers with their living costs while they cannot farm, and pay for the land cleaning. This will help farmers earn money. If they find who caused the pollution, they will ask for money back.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu City Environmental Protection Bureau shared in a press release that they checked the mud at the bottom of irrigation canals. They found that the mud in branch 10 of the Jiujiangpu main canal had too much mercury. This could affect rice growing on three pieces of land. After checking the soil, they confirmed the mercury levels were higher than allowed. So, today they removed and destroyed the rice and rice stalks.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said that the mercury pollution might come from dirty water near and upstream of the canals. This water then flowed into the irrigation channels. They have started to find the source of the pollution. They have also marked the three pieces of land and made farmers stop growing crops there. They are now cleaning the pollution.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Management Agency of the Ministry of Environment sent out a press release tonight. It said that protecting the environment and people's food safety is the most important job. The Ministry of Environment has started to help the Hsinchu City Government. They are marking the farmlands, stopping the farming of food crops, improving the soil, and finding the source of the pollution.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment said that the costs for destroying the crops, helping farmers live during the stop-farming period, and cleaning the polluted land will be paid for by the Ministry of Environment's Soil and Groundwater Pollution Cleanup Fund for now. This is to help farmers with their lives. Once the person who caused the pollution is found, the ministry will ask them to pay back the money.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment stressed that the quality of water in farm irrigation channels, the mud at the bottom of the canals, the quality of farmland, and food safety are important. Central and local environmental and agricultural groups are working together. They will stay in touch to stop pollution, make sure the environment is good, and keep people's food safe.</p>

            <h1>China Tries Many Ways to Encourage Marriage, Number of Marriages Goes Up</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 31st (CNA) - Last year, the number of marriages in China was the lowest in 45 years. So, the government started many plans to encourage people to get married. The Ministry of Civil Affairs in China said yesterday that 3.539 million couples got married in the first half of this year. This is 109,000 more than in the same time last year.</p>
            <p>In 2024, 6.106 million couples got married in mainland China. This was a big drop of 20.5% from 2023. It was the lowest number since 1980.</p>
            <p>Chinese media reported that the government has started many plans to encourage marriage, which led to the number of marriages going up again in the first half of the year.</p>
            <p>First, they have made wedding leave longer. In China, 28 out of 31 provinces and regions have made wedding leave longer. Among these, Shanxi and Gansu have the longest leave, up to 30 days.</p>
            <p>Second, it is much easier to register for marriage. From May 10th, new rules for marriage registration started. People can now register for marriage anywhere in the country, not just in their home area. Also, young people no longer need to show their household register to get a marriage certificate. This means they do not need their parents' permission to get married, making it easier for them to decide to marry on their own.</p>
            <p>Also, many places are giving money to encourage marriage. For example, in Lyuliang City, Shanxi Province, couples who register for the first time and where the woman is 35 or younger get 1,500 Chinese Yuan (about 6,300 New Taiwan Dollars) in cash in a red envelope right away. Zhejiang Province encourages some areas to give wedding red envelopes and shopping coupons. Some other places give different kinds of gift packages.</p>
            <p>According to Nanfang Daily, since January, Nanling Village in Longgui Town, Baiyun District, Guangzhou City, has offered up to 40,000 Yuan as a reward for couples getting married for the first time. If they then have three more children, they can get up to 100,000 Yuan in total.</p>
            <p>In rural areas, there is a big problem with "sky-high bride prices." By June, 127 counties and cities in 18 provinces and regions in mainland China had set limits on bride prices. In central provinces like Henan and Anhui, the limit is usually 50,000 to 80,000 Yuan. In richer provinces like Shandong and Jiangsu, it is 80,000 to 120,000 Yuan. In western provinces like Guizhou and Yunnan, it is 30,000 to 60,000 Yuan.</p>
            <p>The "China Marriage and Family Development Report" published by the Ministry of Civil Affairs in 2024 showed that the average bride price in rural areas across the country rose quickly from 88,000 Yuan in 2015 to 187,000 Yuan in 2024. In some areas, it was even over 300,000 Yuan. This makes it hard for young people in rural areas to get married.</p>

            <h1>Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan Promote Tourism; Taiwan's Concerts Attract Visitors from Singapore and Malaysia</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City, July 31st (CNA) - The New Taipei City Government's Tourism and Travel Department said today that the tourism leaders from New Taipei, Keelung, Taipei, and Taoyuan met with travel companies in Singapore. Taiwan's "concert economy" is a big reason for people from Singapore and Malaysia to visit. They expect about 1,000 visitors from these countries to come to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei Tourism and Travel Department announced that the four cities (New Taipei, Keelung, Taipei, and Taoyuan) want more people in Singapore and Malaysia to know about them. On July 30th, they held a tourism event in Singapore called "Shiok you around," which means "making you very happy." 70 travel companies from Singapore and Malaysia and 60 travel companies from Taiwan joined the event.</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department said today, July 31st, that they visited many important tourism groups and companies in Singapore, including the well-known Chan Brothers Travel and CTC Travel. They expect to bring 1,000 visitors from Singapore and Malaysia to travel in northern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The press release also stated that today they visited Taiwan's office in Singapore, China Airlines, and the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS). They talked about ways to promote travel and develop tourism in the area. They believe these efforts will show good results by the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department said that two travel companies with a large share of the market in Singapore and Malaysia learned about what travelers from Southeast Asia like during their detailed talks. NATAS said that there are not many free big concerts in Singapore and Malaysia. So, Taiwan's "concert economy" is a main reason why travelers from Singapore and Malaysia want to visit northern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei Tourism and Travel Department added that during this trip, they also promoted places like Shifen Sky Lanterns, New Pingxi Coal Mine Museum, Laomei Green Reef, Wulai, and Jinshan Old Street. They also promoted events like the Jiufen Red Lantern Festival, New Taipei River and Ocean Music Festival concerts, and the New Taipei Christmasland "Superstar Concert." These show how diverse and appealing New Taipei is.</p>
