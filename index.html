            <p>Cheng I-Ching is ranked 13th in the world for women's singles by the World Table Tennis (WTT) association. After playing in the Grand Slam tournament in the US, she stayed there to train for almost two weeks. Then she went to Argentina for this week's competition. She is the third-seeded player in the women's singles.</p>
            <p>Today, in the round of 16, Cheng I-Ching played against Laura Watanabe, who is ranked 115th in the world. It was the first time they played each other. Cheng I-Ching was briefly behind 1-3 at the start of the first game. But then she quickly scored 6 points to 1, and she won the first game.</p>
            <p>Cheng I-Ching understood how her opponent played. From the second game, she controlled the match. She scored 3 points in a row at the start. When she was leading 6-3, she scored 4 more points to win the game point easily.</p>
            <p>In the third game, Cheng I-Ching used her strong forehand attack. She started with an 8-1 lead, which made it impossible for her opponent to respond. In the end, she won easily in three straight games.</p>
            <p>After moving on to the quarterfinals, Cheng I-Ching will play against Japan's Emika Yokoi. Emika Yokoi is 21 years old and ranked 29th in the world. It will also be the first time these two players meet. (Editor: Wu Su-jou) 1140726</p>

            <h1>Vote to Remove Cheng Cheng-chien Fails; "Yes" Votes Above Requirement but Less Than "No" Votes</h1>
            <p>(Hsinchu City, July 26, Central News Agency) The results of the vote to remove Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Cheng Cheng-chien from office were announced tonight. The "yes" votes were more than 25% of all voters, which is the required number. However, the number of "yes" votes was much lower than the "no" votes. The Central Election Commission (CEC) website announced that the removal effort failed.</p>
            <p>According to Article 90 of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, for a recall to pass, the number of valid "yes" votes must be more than the "no" votes. Also, the "yes" votes must be at least one-fourth (25%) of all eligible voters in that election area. If the "no" votes are more than the "yes" votes, or if the "yes" votes are less than 25% of all eligible voters, then the recall fails.</p>
            <p>In Hsinchu City, there are 357,063 people who can vote in the election area for lawmaker Cheng Cheng-chien. The 25% requirement for "yes" votes is 89,266 votes.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Election Commission's website, which shared the voting information for Cheng Cheng-chien's recall tonight, 210,685 people voted. This is a 59% voter turnout. There were 209,275 valid votes. Out of these, 89,970 votes were "yes" to the recall. 119,305 votes were "no" to the recall. There were 1,410 invalid votes.</p>
            <p>Even though the "yes" votes for Cheng Cheng-chien's recall were more than 25% of all voters, they were fewer than the "no" votes. So, the recall effort failed. (Editor: Lin Shu-hui) 1140726</p>

            <h1>Five KMT Lawmakers in New Taipei Survive Recall Efforts; Keeping Core Supporters Was Key</h1>
            <p>(New Taipei City, July 26, Central News Agency) Today, the recall votes for five lawmakers in New Taipei City all failed. Local experts say that the Kuomintang (KMT) party's good organization and their strategies, like working with the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), helped them keep their main supporters. These were important reasons why the lawmakers stayed in office.</p>
            <p>Among the recall votes in New Taipei City on July 26, the case of lawmaker Yeh Yuan-chih from the 7th election district (East Banqiao) got the most attention. Groups wanting to remove him, and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), focused on Yeh Yuan-chih. Su Chiao-hui, who leads the DPP in New Taipei City, even led efforts to get people to vote. In the last days before the vote, party officials worked hard to get votes in Yeh Yuan-chih's area.</p>
            <p>When Yeh Yuan-chih faced negative attacks, he chose to stay quiet. Instead, he worked hard to get support by visiting markets, temples, and standing on streets. With strong support from Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu and New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih, city council members in Banqiao helped him a lot. They held small meetings to talk with voters and make their support stronger.</p>
            <p>Local people think that the help from famous politicians like Hou Yu-ih and their visits, plus the city council members' effective organizing efforts, helped Yeh Yuan-chih keep his main supporters from the KMT. He passed the recall vote just barely.</p>
            <p>In New Taipei City's first election district, which includes Shimen, Sanzhi, Tamsui, Bali, Linkou, and Taishan, there are 405,060 people who can vote. For Hung Mong-kai's election district, the number of "yes" votes needed for a recall is 101,265. This is the highest number of "yes" votes needed among all election districts in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Especially, in the 2024 lawmaker election, Hung Mong-kai received 158,596 votes. This was more than half of the votes, 58.71%, and was the most votes any candidate got in the country. People who know New Taipei City's elections well believe that it was always very difficult to remove Hung Mong-kai based on past election results.</p>
            <p>Local people also think that even though citizen groups started this recall effort with proposals and signatures, it turned into a fight between the KMT (blue) and DPP (green) parties. When the weather is bad, DPP supporters are more willing to vote in the rain. KMT supporters might be less willing to go out and vote. Yesterday, it was windy and rainy, but today there was no wind or rain. This made more KMT supporters want to vote, and it changed the election results.</p>
            <p>In New Taipei City's 12th election district, which includes Xizhi, Jinshan, Wanli, Ruifang, Pingxi, Shuangxi, and Gongliao areas, the New Taipei City Election Commission says there are 266,243 voters. Xizhi alone has 179,536 voters, which is much more than all the other areas combined.</p>
            <p>Local experts say that in Xizhi, there are more KMT supporters than DPP supporters. Liao Hsien-hsiang's family has worked closely with the community for a long time. His father, Liao Cheng-liang, was a council member for many terms. His mother is close to women's groups. His family has many local resources and can get a lot of people to support them.</p>
            <p>Regarding the recall groups' strong attacks on the public housing project at Baipao Lake, Liao Hsien-hsiang explained that public housing must be built in the right places. He said that Baipao Lake does not have enough transportation and environmental support. Building a town there just to meet targets is not a responsible way to act. Local people believe that Liao Hsien-hsiang defended himself well and stopped the criticism effectively.</p>
            <p>When facing attacks from the recall groups, Liao Hsien-hsiang first stayed quiet. Later, he changed his method and used both online and offline strategies. For online efforts, he posted on social media every day to answer the recall groups' questions. For offline efforts, he put up signs showing his achievements and asking for "rescue" votes. He also appeared with Eric Chu, Hou Yu-ih, and Taipei Deputy Mayor Lee Sze-chuan at public speeches to encourage "no" votes against the recall.</p>
            <p>For the 8th election district (Zhonghe District), the KMT party usually has an advantage. However, online attacks from the "Shuanghe recall groups" and strong offline efforts from the DPP party officials put a lot of pressure on lawmaker Chang Chih-lun.</p>
            <p>Local people believe that the KMT and TPP parties' strategy to work together to gather support was very effective in Zhonghe District. In the 2024 lawmaker election, when the TPP also had a candidate, Chang Chih-lun received 89,808 votes. This time, the "no" votes against Chang Chih-lun's recall reached 95,319 votes. The number of "no" votes for Chang Chih-lun grew, which shows that working with the TPP increased the number of people who supported him.</p>
            <p>Yonghe, in New Taipei City's 9th election district, is usually seen as a strong KMT voting area. Lin Te-fu, a lawmaker who has been re-elected many times, has worked closely with the local community for a long time. For this big recall effort, Lin Te-fu's team said they would respond as if it were a regular lawmaker election. Most local people believe that Lin Te-fu is good at organizing and attends many events. His election results showed the KMT's strength, as expected, and he passed the recall vote. (Editor: Lin Shu-hui) 1140726</p>
