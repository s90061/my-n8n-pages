            <h1>Energy Agency: Quickly Fix Damaged Solar Power Sites, Look at Improving Designs</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 18 (CNA) â€“ Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in southern Taiwan. The Energy Agency said today that the amount of electricity made by solar power systems before and after the typhoon was almost the same. So, the rumors of big problems are not true. As extreme weather happens more often and becomes stronger, the agency will keep looking at improving how solar power systems are built and what rules they follow. They will also work harder to quickly fix any damaged sites after bad weather.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs shared a press release today. It said that Typhoon Danas was unusual because it landed in western Chiayi. Its winds were very strong for a short time, and its path was special. This caused more damage than usual.</p>
            <p>Data shows that only about 0.4% of all solar power systems in Taiwan were damaged. Before the typhoon (on July 2), solar systems made 67.75 million units of electricity. After the typhoon (on July 13), they made 66.2 million units. The total amount of electricity produced was very similar, so the rumors about major damage are not true.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency explained that strong winds broke the anchoring system for floating solar panels. This caused significant damage to the Xinwen detention pond in Chiayi. The Energy Agency has finished cleaning the solar panels outside the site. They have also gathered and sorted them, and cleared the roads. For the area inside the site, they will finish cleaning up as quickly as possible, considering safety for workers and how long it will take.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency pointed out that solar power facilities must have a design that can stand against strong winds. According to electricity laws, when a power company asks for permission to build, they must give an engineering plan. This plan must include a document with structural calculations signed by a qualified engineer. For example, at the Xinwen detention pond, the floating platforms and anchoring systems for the solar panels were designed to handle the basic wind speed in Budai, Chiayi. A civil engineering company has also provided the necessary structural calculations signed by an engineer.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency stressed that extreme weather is happening more often and getting stronger. To prepare for this, they will keep looking at engineering designs and rules. They will also improve preparations before disasters and work quickly to fix damaged sites afterward. (Editor: Pan Yi-Ching) July 18, 2025.</p>

On the second day of the All-Star Game, the "All-Around Hitting King" challenge will test how well four pitchers can hit. The home run derby will have its first rounds and final rounds on separate days.</p>
            <p>The league said that the All-Star Game will bring together famous players from all six teams. There will also be a very large cheerleading group to entertain everyone.

            <h1>Trump Suggests Ex-Delta Pilot Anderson for US Representative to ICAO</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 17 (CNA) â€“ The White House in the United States said today that President Trump has chosen Jeffrey Anderson, a former pilot for Delta Air Lines, to be the US representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, a pilots' union has already spoken against this choice.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this suggestion comes when some US senators want the Trump government to try to raise the required retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67 years old. This would happen at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal.</p>
            <p>Since July 2022, the US has not had a full-time representative at ICAO. This was after C.B. "Sully" Sullenberger left the role. Sullenberger was the pilot who safely landed an Airbus A320 plane on the Hudson River in New York in 2009 after it was hit by birds.</p>
            <p>The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents over 79,000 pilots from 42 airlines in the US and Canada, has criticized Trump's choice of Anderson. They say he is not qualified for the job.</p>
            <p>The union said in a statement: "It seems Mr. Anderson's only real qualification is that he supports raising the mandatory retirement age for pilots. This would make the United States different from other countries in aviation worldwide and would cause problems for pilots, as well as for flights both inside and outside the country."</p>
            <p>Last year, the US Congress said no to a plan that would raise the mandatory retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. According to international rules, airline pilots over 65 years old are not allowed to fly in most countries outside the US. (Translator: Lin Yi-Feng / Editor: Yen Szu-Chi) July 18, 2025.</p>
