            <h1>Taipei City Checked 118 Drinks and Ice Products, 4 Still Not Good After Fixing</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 21st, Central News Agency) Ice products are a top choice to cool down in summer. The Taipei City Department of Health said today that to keep things clean, they checked 118 drink, ice, and ingredient items in late April. These items were from places like convenience stores in Taipei. After being told to make improvements, 4 items still did not meet the standards for clean microbes. This means 3.39% of the items were not good enough.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Health held a regular press conference. They shared the results of their "Drink, Ice, and Ingredients Sampling Project" from late April.</p>
            <p>Ms. Lin Guan-zhen, a section chief from the Health Department, said that the items checked were from convenience stores, restaurants, coffee shops, bubble tea shops, ice cream and dessert shops, and food material stores in Taipei.</p>
            <p>She said that among these, there were 38 drinks, 25 ice products, 16 ice cubes, and 4 cooked ingredients. They checked these for very small living things, like Salmonella, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, to make sure they were safe to eat.</p>
            <p>They also checked 35 raw ingredients like tapioca balls, coconut jelly, tangyuan (rice balls), and taro balls. They checked these for things like preservatives, colors, and sweeteners.</p>
            <p>She said that 18 of the drink and ice items did not meet the "Hygiene Standards for Microbes in Food" when first checked. The businesses were told to fix the problems. After a second check, 4 items (2 ice products and 2 drinks) were still not good. Because of this, the businesses responsible will be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$3,000,000, according to the "Food Safety and Hygiene Management Act."</p>
            <p>Ms. Lin Guan-zhen told people to choose places that have a clean environment and clean containers. Also, choose stores that use disinfectant and have refrigerators or freezers. Workers should care about their own cleanliness, have health checks often, and wash their hands well. The source of ingredients should be checked to make sure they are made cleanly. Records and documents of where ingredients came from should be kept. Also, choose water filters and ice-making machines carefully, change filters regularly, and make sure the water is safe.

            <h1>AI Net Zero / Dayeh University Offers "Green Collar" Classes on Weekends in August, Full Support for Low-Income Families</h1>
            <p>(Changhua, July 21st, Central News Agency Reporter Zheng Wei-zhen) Dayeh University is working with the National Institute of Environmental Research. In August, they will offer weekend classes from the Ministry of Environment. These classes are for training "green collar" workers to reach "net zero" carbon. The classes will help students learn important skills like checking carbon levels and managing greenhouse gases. Students under 30 years old will get half of the class fee paid for. People from low-income families will have their full class fee paid for.</p>
            <p>The head of Dayeh University's Department of Environmental and Safety Engineering, Chou Chung-chi, said in a press release today that companies around the world are working hard to reach "net zero" carbon by 2050. Managing carbon and sustainable development are now very important skills for this new time. The Ministry of Environment's "Net Zero Green Collar Talent Training" classes combine university learning with real-world experience. They hope to fill the gap in Taiwan for people who know about carbon management and sustainable development.</p>
            <p>The classes will teach both theory and practical skills. The total time for the classes is 48 hours. They will be held every Saturday and Sunday from August 16th to September 7th. Topics will include climate change and managing greenhouse gases, how to check carbon levels, reducing greenhouse gases on your own and trading carbon credits, and checking the carbon footprint of products.</p>
            <p>Chou Chung-chi said that as carbon fees start and global rules for sustainability become active, "green collar" workers are becoming very popular. After finishing the Ministry of Environment's "Net Zero Green Collar Talent Training" classes, students will get a certificate from the National Institute of Environmental Research. This will help them when looking for a job or getting promoted.</p>
            <p>Dayeh University said the class fee is NT$12,000. The Ministry of Environment has a plan to help more young students and people in need join. University students under 30 (not including those working full-time and studying part-time) can ask for half the fee to be paid, so they only pay NT$6,000. People who are from low-income families can ask for the full fee to be paid. You can sign up at https://greencollar.moenv.gov.tw/MajorLeagueClass/Index. (Edited by Chang Ya-ching) July 21, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Recall Group Calls Tu Chuan-chi a Partner in Secret Lawmaking; Tu Chuan-chi Says He Puts Voters' Concerns First</h1>
            <p>(Taoyuan, July 21st, Central News Agency Reporter Wu Ruei-chi) The vote to remove a lawmaker will be held on July 26th. Today, the Taoyuan City Election Commission held a meeting to explain the removal case. Chen Ting-wei, the main person asking for the removal, said that Tu Chuan-chi helped make laws in secret. He said Tu Chuan-chi also helped the parliament get more power in a bad way. Tu Chuan-chi was not at the meeting, but he shared a statement saying that he puts the concerns of the voters first.</p>
            <p>The official public TV meeting to explain the case for removing Legislator Tu Chuan-chi from Taoyuan City's 2nd election area started today. Chen Ting-wei came to the meeting. However, Tu Chuan-chi did not come after his name was called three times, so he gave up his right to speak.</p>
            <p>Chen Ting-wei said that Tu Chuan-chi supported changing the Law on the Powers of the Legislative Yuan. This change gives the parliament more power to question and investigate. Chen Ting-wei said this goes too far, breaks the separation of powers (executive, legislative, judicial), and even takes away people's basic rights. Chen Ting-wei also said that Tu Chuan-chi supported changing the election law to make it harder to remove lawmakers. This silently takes away people's right to remove elected officials. Chen Ting-wei asked how a lawmaker who cannot be checked by the people can represent what the people want.</p>
            <p>Chen Ting-wei said that Tu Chuan-chi followed the orders of Kuomintang Legislator Fu Kun-chi. This made the parliament serve certain political interests. The goal, Chen Ting-wei said, was to cause problems within Taiwan and make the country weaker.</p>
            <p>Chen Ting-wei then spoke again in the second round. He said that Tu Chuan-chi's attendance in question-and-answer sessions was low and his questions were empty. He also said Tu Chuan-chi was a partner in secret lawmaking and helped the parliament get more power in a bad way. He said that for Tu Chuan-chi, democracy is not a good value; it is just a tool for fighting. Chen Ting-wei said that removing Tu Chuan-chi means protecting the system. People cannot accept a lawmaker who does nothing and only works with the party to break the system.</p>
            <p>Tu Chuan-chi put out a statement after the meeting. He said that this removal case was never based on sensible discussion from the start. Instead, it used fake information and bad talk. He said that even when he took legal action, the other side kept spreading untrue things in their flyers and on social media, without stopping at all. Instead of joining this "drama," his team chose to stick to their original plan and go to different places to talk to voters face-to-face. In the last few months, they have held over a hundred meetings in his election area, putting the voters' concerns first.</p>
            <p>Tu Chuan-chi said that his work achievements and his explanations about the removal rumors are already written clearly in a nearly 4000-word "Letter Against Removal Reasons." This letter is in the voting bulletin. He also sent out flyers to share the truth. He wants to make sure that the people in the community understand the facts and can make a smart decision.</p>
            <p>After a meeting on June 20th, the Central Election Commission announced that 24 cases to remove legislators were approved. All of these legislators are from the Kuomintang. Also, the case to remove Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is currently suspended from her job, was also approved. The "24+1" removal cases will be voted on and counted on July 26th.
