            <h1>US-Russia Leader Summit Nears, Trump: 25% Chance of Failure</h1>
            <p>Before the summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump spoke to the media. He said that if his meeting with Putin did not go well, he would not call anyone.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump spoke to Fox News Radio. He said if the meeting with Putin went well, he would call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders. But he also thought there was a 25% chance that his meeting with Putin would not go well.</p>
            <p>He also said that if the summit with Putin was successful, there would be a second meeting. This meeting would include Putin and Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Trump said that any agreement to end Russia's invasion of Ukraine would happen at the second three-way meeting with Zelenskyy. It would not happen at the summit in Alaska, USA, tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Trump stressed: "The second meeting will be very, very important because they will make an agreement then."</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump are expected to hold their summit in Alaska, USA, at 11:30 AM local time on August 15th. This is 3:30 AM Taiwan time on August 16th.</p>

            <h1>CK Hutchison: Port Sale Will Take Longer, Won't Finish in 2025</h1>
            <p>Chinese financial news reported that CK Hutchison's management spoke today at their mid-year earnings meeting. They said the deal to sell their port business is "entering a new phase." For example, they are inviting major Chinese investors to join talks. They hope to get "approval from all relevant regulators." They expect it to take longer than planned, and the deal will not finish in 2025.</p>
            <p>Daily Economic News reported that CK Hutchison's management mentioned at this meeting that selling the port business has "different things to think about for regulators in different countries."</p>
            <p>CK Hutchison's management said the company had already stated that they would not make any deal until they received approval from all relevant regulators and departments. Now, the deal is "entering a new phase." For example, they are inviting "major investors from mainland China" to join talks. They hope to get "approval from all relevant regulators."</p>
            <p>According to the report, CK Hutchison's management said they expect this process to take longer than planned. The deal will not be finished in 2025.</p>
            <p>On March 4th, CK Hutchison announced that it had made an initial agreement with a group. This group included US BlackRock and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). They planned to sell 43 port businesses overseas. These included two ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. This made China very unhappy, and CK Hutchison felt pressure because of this.</p>
            <p>After this, on July 28th, CK Hutchison announced on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that the special talk period with the group had ended. However, CK Hutchison is still talking with members of that group. They also plan to invite "major strategic investors" from China to become "important members" of the group. To get approval for the deal from all relevant regulators, the group members and the deal's structure need to change. CK Hutchison will not do any deal until all relevant regulators and departments approve it.</p>
