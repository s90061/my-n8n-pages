            <h1>20% Temporary Tariff Coming: Government Says Machine Tools, Orchids Will Be Affected</h1>
            <p>The US is expected to start charging special import taxes, called "equalization tariffs," on August 7th. For Taiwan, this temporary tax rate will be 20%. Today, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Gong Ming-hsin, said that Taiwan's tax rate dropping from 32% to 20% will cut the overall impact on businesses by more than half. However, industries like machine tools, plastics, and orchids will still face challenges from competitors. The government plans to create strong strategies to help them.</p>
            <p>Starting tomorrow, Taiwan's temporary tariff rate will be 20%. Among nearby Asian countries, Japan and South Korea have a 15% rate. Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia, and the Philippines have 19%. Taiwan has the same 20% rate as Vietnam, while India has 25%. Today, Gong Ming-hsin, spokesperson Li Hui-chih, and Deputy Representative Yan Hui-hsin from the Executive Yuan's Office of Trade Negotiations explained the tariff and industry support plans.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin stated that with Taiwan's equalization tariff rate going down from 32% to 20%, the impact will be much less. Before, without excluding items from the Section 232 investigation, it was thought that exports to the US might drop by up to 24.9%. This could also mean a 4.85% drop in production, a 3.12% drop in GDP, and over 120,000 fewer jobs in industry. Even though the new tariff reduction is not more than half, the total impact has been reduced by more than half.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin pointed out that from April until now, the equalization tariff has been 10%, and businesses have been able to adjust. But starting tomorrow, the temporary tariff will change to 20%. Different industries will face different problems. Currently, the industries expected to be affected include the machine tool and plastic industries in the manufacturing sector, and orchids and mahi-mahi in the agricultural sector.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin explained that Taiwanese orchids make up 46% of the US market. The main competitor is the Netherlands, which has 40% of the market. But the Netherlands only pays a 15% tariff to sell to the US. So, the government needs to find ways to help businesses make their products different and use different pricing strategies.</p>
            <p>Overall, Gong Ming-hsin said that the main goal is to quickly put together a special budget for resilience. This money will help businesses as soon as possible. However, because Trump might make a new announcement early tomorrow Taiwan time, the government will pay close attention to see if Taiwan's temporary 20% tariff rate changes or if there are new updates on the Section 232 investigation. Then, they will decide how to change the special budget plan and if the business support plans need to be adjusted.</p>
            <p>Gong Ming-hsin added that the special budget will still take time to be approved. Therefore, starting tomorrow, the government will use existing funds to help affected businesses right away.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Man Missing After Fishing at Xingda Port; Police, Firefighters, and Coast Guard Search Together</h1>
            <p>A man named Mr. Hsieh drove by himself to Qieding District in Kaohsiung last night to fish. Today, other fishermen found his fishing gear and car near Xingda Port, but Mr. Hsieh was nowhere to be seen. After his family confirmed he had not come home, police and firefighters started looking for him. They hope to find him quickly.</p>
            <p>Officers from the Hunei Police Station in Kaohsiung City Police Department said that they received a report at 1:11 PM today. A fisherman said that he often saw Mr. Hsieh, who is 69 years old, go fishing at the platform next to Xingda Port in the early morning. He would usually drive away around 8 AM. But today, his car and fishing gear were still there until noon, but he was gone. They thought he might be missing.</p>
            <p>Police went to check the situation and told Mr. Hsieh's 54-year-old wife, Ms. Chen, who lives in Rende District, Tainan, to come to the scene to identify the items. According to the police press release, Ms. Chen said that the fishing gear left behind really belonged to her husband. Mr. Hsieh usually drove to fish between 11 PM and 12 AM and would typically be home before 12 PM, but he has not returned yet.</p>
            <p>The police said that Mr. Hsieh's mobile phone was left by the port and has been given back to his family. Now, coast guard and fire department workers have started searching the port area. Police officers are also still helping with the investigation at the scene and contacting other departments to search a wider area to find out where Mr. Hsieh is.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Youth Unemployment Rate Not Better; Labor Department: Still Promoting Job Matching</h1>
            <p>A report from the National Audit Office shows that while the overall unemployment rate in Taipei City has gone down, the unemployment rate for young people has not improved. The report suggested that the city's Employment Service Office has not been active enough in helping. Today, the Department of Labor said that it continues to improve and promote various ways to help people find jobs.</p>
            <p>The National Audit Office's audit report on Taipei City's total budget mentioned that in the past three years, the number of unemployed people and the unemployment rate in Taipei City have both decreased. However, during the same time, the unemployment rate for young people did not get better. After looking into it, they found that the main reasons are new technologies changing how jobs work and young people's views on work.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Employment Service Office replied that it will keep making its job matching services better and promoting them. It will also invite good companies from different industries that are leaders in the market to join big job fairs. These companies will offer jobs with a minimum salary of NT$35,000 or more. This will create more chances for young people to get direct interviews, so they don't have to wait for companies to look at their resumes. This will also help raise salaries in general across industries.</p>
            <p>The Employment Service Office said it will also use websites, public employment service centers, newspapers, and social media to share job information more widely. This will help young people looking for jobs find out about them. For example, on March 22nd, they worked with the Department of Youth Affairs to hold a "Youth Career X Job Fair." 250 companies came to hire, offering many job opportunities to meet the needs of young job seekers as much as possible.</p>
            <p>The Employment Service Office also stated that to help more young people find jobs and improve the youth unemployment rate, they will continue the "Youth Good Job Program." This program helps young people who have been unemployed for six months or longer. It helps them show their strengths and improve their job skills. They can also get up to NT$30,000 as a job search and employment bonus. This helps motivate young people who have been out of work for a long time to look for jobs actively and stay employed.</p>
            <p>The Department of Youth Affairs said it will continue to work with the Department of Labor on youth employment issues. For example, they will jointly hold job fairs for youth internships and offer discounts for shared transport and public transport subsidies. All these efforts aim to help young people successfully enter the job market.</p>
