            <h1>HBL Songshan High School Aims for Consecutive Championship, Coach Asks Liu Ting-Kuan to Take More Responsibility</h1>
            <p>The 114th HBL (High School Basketball League) qualifying games will start on October 13. Songshan High School, the "Green Shield" team, is getting ready to defend its title. Coach Yeh Wei-Chiao said today that Liu Ting-Kuan must take on more responsibility this new season and lead the team forward.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Taipei Interscholastic Sport Federation held a press conference today for the start of four major high school leagues: basketball, volleyball, soccer, and softball.</p>
            <p>In the 113th HBL championship game, Songshan High School beat Nanshan High School. They won their seventh championship trophy. This year, they want to win again, but key players like Liu Cheng-En, Charlie, and Char Jet have already graduated.</p>
            <p>Coach Yeh Wei-Chiao spoke to the media today. He said, "I believe the players will not feel pressure about winning again, but they will work hard for it as a goal. This group of third-year players works very well together. They know how to play and cooperate on the court."</p>
            <p>He specifically mentioned player Liu Ting-Kuan, saying he must take on more important roles this new season. "Ting-Kuan used to have older players protecting him. Now he is in his third year and is the starting point for the team's offense. He must find ways to improve himself to help himself and his teammates."</p>
            <p>Coach Yeh Wei-Chiao also mentioned player Pan Yen-Ming, saying he will be very important as the point guard and a key person.</p>
            <p>Liu Ting-Kuan smiled and said, "Of course, there is pressure when you become a third-year student. On one hand, I need to set a good example for the younger players. On the other hand, I hope to lead the team to win again."</p>
            <p>He also said he has more things to do on the court now. "Before, I just needed to shoot the ball and play good defense. But now, I also need to connect with my teammates, make assists, and not forget to score myself. It has become harder, but it helps me improve my skills."</p>
            <p>Liu Ting-Kuan jokingly said his "brain isn't good." So, when he has free time, he watches videos of NBA point guards like Chris Paul and Rajon Rondo. He hopes to learn more passing skills.</p>

            <h1>Deputy Intelligence Chief Attends Warsaw Security Forum, Says Ukraine's Defeat Would Encourage China to Attack Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Lieutenant General Hsieh Jih-Sheng, Taiwan's Deputy Chief of Intelligence, spoke at the Warsaw Security Forum this week. He said that if Russia defeats Ukraine, it would encourage China to act against Taiwan. Taiwan truly hopes Ukraine wins.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hsieh said Taiwan is closely watching the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Hsieh, wearing his military uniform at the forum, said in English, "We hope they (Ukraine) will win."</p>
            <p>He stated, "There are many lessons we can learn from the battlefield in Ukraine. These lessons can help us improve our overall readiness. If Ukraine loses the war, it will send a signal that China can take more aggressive actions against Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Hsieh also warned about joint military exercises by China and Russia. He mentioned, "If China acts against Taiwan, and at the same time Russia increases its attacks on Ukraine, the world might face two big problems in different parts of the world."</p>
            <p>"Europe is fighting for its own safety today. With your help, we can stop the chance of war happening in the Indo-Pacific region."</p>
            <p>Taiwan has joined Western countries in punishing Russia. Taiwan also continues to study how the smaller Ukrainian army fights its powerful neighbor. From this, Taiwan learns important lessons to prepare for a possible attack from China.</p>
            <p>Hsieh stressed that Taiwan and Europe can learn from each other. He said, "We have dealt with China's 'gray zone' attacks for many years. We have a lot of experience in stopping harmful false information, which we can share with Europe."</p>

            <h1>YouBike System Down in Northern Taiwan, Taoyuan City Fines Company NT$100,000</h1>
            <p>The YouBike system in Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan had a big problem last night. The city governments of these three areas met today at the headquarters of the YouBike company, Smile Cycling. The Taoyuan City government said they have fined the company NT$100,000. They will decide to fine the company more later, based on how well the company improves, as stated in their contract.</p>
            <p>The YouBike system in Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan started having problems at 6:34 PM yesterday. This happened during the busy time when people go home from work or school. Many people could not rent bikes normally, which caused inconvenience.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Department of Transportation said today that an update to the system caused a program error, which made the system stop working. The company fixed the problem right away. All services were back to normal by 12:36 AM today. This problem affected about 40,000 bike rentals in the Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan areas.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Department of Transportation said that this morning, they and officials from Taipei and New Taipei City governments went to the Smile Cycling company's main office for a review meeting. During the meeting, they clearly told the company to continue checking and improving its services. They also asked the company to create good ways to announce and report problems, and to plan fair ways to pay back affected users. They also asked the company to provide a full review and improvement plan within one week.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Department of Transportation said that this problem seriously affected the quality of public bicycle services and the rights of citizens. Taoyuan City has already fined the company NT$100,000. They will consider giving the company a higher fine, according to the contract, depending on how well the company improves. This is to make sure public transportation services are of good quality.</p>
