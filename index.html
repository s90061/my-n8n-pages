            <h1>US and China Talks Finish; China Says Both Sides Will Continue Tariff Break</h1>
            <p>Officials from the United States and China finished two days of talks today. They were trying to solve problems with their economies and stop a trade war from getting worse. China said that both sides agreed to make their 90-day break from tariffs, which started in mid-May, longer. However, China did not say when this extension would start or how long it would last.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that no big breakthroughs were announced from these talks. But Li Chenggang, who is China's trade representative and Deputy Minister of Commerce, said that both sides agreed to try and make the 90-day tariff break, agreed in mid-May, longer. He did not say exactly when it would start or how long it would be.</p>
            <p>These talks might prepare the way for US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to meet at the end of the year. However, Trump said he did not ask for the meeting, and Chinese officials did not mention it.</p>
            <p>After many months of saying he would put high taxes on goods from other countries, Trump has made trade deals with countries like the European Union (EU) and Japan. But China is a very strong economy and controls the world's supply of rare earth materials. This makes talks between the US government and China very difficult.</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China stopped their plans to put very high tariffs on each other's goods. This helped avoid a situation where they would stop trading with each other. But if they do not make a deal, the world's supply chains and money markets might become unstable again.</p>
            <p>To show how important this is, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today increased its prediction for the world's economic growth. But it also said that tariffs could go up again, which would be a big risk.</p>
