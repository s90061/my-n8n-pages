            <h1>Tseng Wei-sheng Wins Silver in Men's Vault at Paris Gymnastics World Challenge Cup</h1>
            <p>Tseng Wei-sheng, a good male gymnast from Taiwan, won a silver medal in the vault competition today. He was competing at the Paris Gymnastics World Challenge Cup in France. His average score from two jumps was 13.916 points. This is his second silver medal in the Challenge Cup series this year.</p>
            <p>The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) has five World Challenge Cup events this year. Four events, including the Paris World Challenge Cup this week, have already finished. Tseng Wei-sheng from Taiwan has won two gold medals and two silver medals so far.</p>
            <p>According to FIG rules, gymnasts must join all five competitions. They then use their best three scores to be chosen for the year-end ranking. Coach Lin Yu-hsin proudly said, "Wei-sheng will likely be the overall champion of the Challenge Cup this year."</p>
            <p>The fifth FIG Challenge Cup event this year will start on September 26 in Hungary. The overall champion of the year will receive an award there.</p>
            <p>Tseng Wei-sheng is 26 years old. He has been performing better and more steadily in international competitions since he won a silver medal in the men's vault at the 2023 Chengdu Universiade. Lin Yu-hsin said, "For vault, your mindset and how steady you are are very important. This competition was very strong, and the best gymnasts from many countries came to compete."</p>
            <p>Today, Tseng Wei-sheng was the last of the 8 gymnasts to perform in the final. His first jump had a difficulty score of 5.200, an execution score of 8.733, and a total score of 13.933. His second jump had a difficulty score of 5.200, an execution score of 8.700, and a total score of 13.900. His average score from the two jumps was 13.916, which earned him the silver medal.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-hsin shared that in the past, if Tseng Wei-sheng was the last one to perform, he would always make big mistakes. "Now he is very steady. Even though he was the last to go today, he still pushed other people's rankings down."</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-hsin said that they will continue to practice Tseng Wei-sheng's moves and make him more steady. Their main goal is the Nagoya Asian Games next year, where he hopes to win a medal. </p>

            <h1>Tang Chia-hung Wins Bronze in Horizontal Bar at Paris Gymnastics World Challenge Cup After Landing Error</h1>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung, a Taiwanese gymnast known as "King of Asia," won a bronze medal in the horizontal bar final at the Paris Gymnastics World Challenge Cup in France. He tried a difficult move with a score of 6.700. However, he made a mistake when landing. His execution score was only 7.666, making his total score 14.366 points.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung trained in Japan for three weeks in late July. He felt good and ready before the competition. In the horizontal bar qualification round yesterday, Tang Chia-hung performed well. He got a difficulty score of 6.100, an execution score of 8.666, and a total score of 14.766 points. This put him in first place to move on to the final.</p>
            <p>In today's final, Tang Chia-hung increased the difficulty of his routine to 6.700. He did not add any new moves. But when he tried a "triple back somersault" for his landing, he lost his balance and touched the floor with his hand. This caused his execution score to be only 7.666 points.</p>
            <p>In the end, Tang Chia-hung's total score was 14.366 points. He had the same score as a French gymnast, putting them both in second place. However, after comparing their execution scores, Tang Chia-hung got the bronze medal.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung said that before he left for the competition, he wanted to use it to try different moves and harder difficulty levels. So, he made his routine much harder in the final. Even though he failed, he learned a lot from the experience.</p>
            <p>After this competition, Tang Chia-hung will return to Taiwan to prepare for the National Games in October and the World Gymnastics Championships on October 19 in Jakarta.</p>
            <p>In the men's parallel bars event, Taiwan's Hung Yuan-hsi was the last to perform in the final. He got a difficulty score of 5.700, an execution score of 7.566, and a total score of 13.266 points. He finished in 6th place and did not win a medal.</p>

            <h1>"Alphabet" Giannis Antetokounmpo Scores 30 Points, 17 Rebounds as Greece Wins Bronze at EuroBasket Against Finland</h1>
            <p>Today in Riga, Greece won against Finland with a score of 92 to 89 in the EuroBasket third-place game. Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as "Alphabet," led Greece with 30 points and 17 rebounds. This is Greece's first medal since 2009.</p>
            <p>When the game ended, Greek fans among the 11,000 people in the arena in Riga, Latvia, cheered loudly. They were celebrating their team's first EuroBasket medal in 16 years. This is the sixth medal in Greece's history, with two gold, one silver, and three bronze medals in total.</p>
            <p>Greece was ahead for most of the game. They quickly got a lead of more than 10 points at the start. By halftime, they were ahead by 14 points. With two minutes left in the game, they were still leading by 11 points. Then, Finland started to fight back, cutting the lead to only 3 points with five seconds left.</p>
            <p>Elias Valtonen, a small forward for Finland, had three free throws. He had a chance to tie the game. He made the first two shots, but he missed the third. Mikael Jantunen grabbed the rebound and tried to score again, but he missed.</p>
            <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo, the NBA Milwaukee Bucks star for Greece, then took his chance. He scored steadily with four seconds left, making sure Greece won the game.</p>
            <p>Antetokounmpo played very well in this game. He made 9 of his 11 shots and had 30 points, 17 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 blocks. This is his fourth time in this competition getting more than 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists. This is a new record for EuroBasket in the last 30 years.</p>
            <p>Greece's offense was very strong. They scored 20 points from fast breaks compared to Finland's 3 points before the fourth quarter. They also made 14 out of 30 three-point shots, showing their strong shooting from far away.</p>
            <p>This bronze medal is the first time Greece has been on the EuroBasket podium in 16 years. The coach, Vassilis Spanoulis, was also the main player when the team won a bronze medal in Poland in 2009.</p>
            <p>For Antetokounmpo, this is his first medal with his national team. He has now officially joined the list of Greek basketball heroes.</p>
            <p>For Finland, fourth place is their best result ever. Their performance has improved over the last 10 years, from 16th place in 2015, to 11th in 2017, to 7th in 2022, and now to 4th place this year.</p>
            <p>Lauri Markkanen, who plays for the NBA Utah Jazz, was the top scorer for Finland in this game with 19 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
