            <h1>US Defense Secretary Calls Hundreds of Generals; Trump Reportedly to Speak</h1>
            <p>A US official said today that President Trump is expected to go to a meeting for US military generals. This meeting will be in Quantico, Virginia, on September 30. People who know about the plan said that Trump will speak at this special meeting for high-level military leaders.</p>
            <p>This meeting is unusual because it brings together many US military leaders. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth suddenly told hundreds of generals from all over the world to come. These generals are one-star or higher and lead many soldiers. They will meet at the Marine Corps base in Quantico.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post first reported that Trump would be at this meeting, citing planning documents. The White House did not say anything about this right away.</p>
            <p>On September 27, US officials told Reuters that Hegseth plans to talk about the importance of a "warrior spirit" for all military members during the one-hour meeting. He might also talk about other topics.</p>
            <p>US military forces are in many places around the world. These include South Korea, Japan, and the Middle East. Generals or admirals with two, three, or four stars lead these forces.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that people are worried. This meeting for military leaders should be neutral, but Trump's presence might make it seem political.</p>
            <p>The Republican president has also recently used the US military in many American cities. He said this was needed to fight crime because the Democratic Party could not keep order.</p>
            <p>Right now, the US military has about 800 generals. They are in more than ten countries and time zones around the world. Many of them lead thousands of US troops.</p>

            <h1>US and Mexico Work Together to Stop Gun Smuggling; They Will Improve Investigations and Technology</h1>
            <p>The US State Department announced on September 27 that the US and Mexico have officially started a plan to work together. Their goal is to stop illegal guns from entering the border between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Washington announced this news one day after the US-Mexico Security Implementation Group had its first meeting.</p>
            <p>US Secretary of State Mark Rubio started this group earlier this month when he visited Mexico. He hopes that both countries will work more closely to stop drug and weapon smuggling.</p>
            <p>According to the US State Department, the new plan includes Mexico using US tools to track guns in all 32 of its states. These tools include the eTrace system and bullet imaging technology. Both sides will also work more closely on investigations and share more information.</p>
            <p>The plan also says that both countries will do deeper joint investigations, make legal cases faster, and increase US checks. This is to stop weapons from being smuggled into Mexico. It will also help prevent these weapons from making gang violence worse.</p>
            <p>Ronald Johnson, the US Ambassador to Mexico, said on social media: "This is the first time the US and Mexico are doing joint checks, sharing information right away, and expanding investigations at the same time. We hope to stop weapons from helping organized crime and hurting both countries. This plan is a historic partnership to protect both nations."</p>

            <h1>Taichung Real Estate Agent Accused of 1 Billion Fraud, Fled Abroad, Arrested Upon Return, Held by Prosecutors</h1>
            <p>A man named Ye, who was in charge of a real estate office in Xitun District, Taichung City, is accused of fraud and illegally getting money. Over five years, people lost up to 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Mr. Ye ran away from the country on September 20. Prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for him. This morning, Mr. Ye was caught when he came back to Taiwan. Prosecutors asked for him to be held and not allowed to see anyone.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office shared a press release today. It said that 42-year-old Mr. Ye was the boss of a real estate company in Xitun District. From September 2020 to September this year, he was involved in fraud and illegally taking money. The amount of money lost was billions of New Taiwan Dollars. Mr. Ye left the country secretly on September 20.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors in Taichung formed a special team. They talked to the victims and witnesses. They also collected evidence like receipts for cash payments, bank transfer records, and screenshots of conversations. On September 26, Mr. Ye's passport was canceled, and an arrest warrant was issued. On the morning of September 28, Mr. Ye came back to Taiwan from Thailand. Police caught him at customs at Taoyuan International Airport and brought him in.</p>
            <p>After questioning Mr. Ye, the prosecutors decided he was guilty of fraud and illegally running a banking business. These are serious crimes. The lightest punishment for these crimes is more than five years in prison. He also tried to run away, and there is a risk he might destroy evidence or talk to other criminals or witnesses. So, in the evening, prosecutors asked the Taichung District Court to hold him without letting him see anyone.</p>
