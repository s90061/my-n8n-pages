            <h1>Italy to Host Festival of Contemporary Thought, Exploring Euroscepticism and Smartphone Addiction Crisis</h1>
            <p>Global troubles are making people worried. So, a "Festival of Contemporary Thought" will be held in Piacenza, a city in northern Italy. More than 200 experts from different fields will talk there. They will openly discuss important topics like "Euroscepticism," "water shortages," and "teenagers being addicted to smartphones." They hope to show a clearer path for the future generation.</p>
            <p>Piacenza is where Giorgio Armani, a famous Italian fashion designer who recently passed away, was born. This city in northern Italy is known for art and culture. From September 11th to 14th, it will host the third "Festival of Contemporary Thought." The theme is "Uncovering Lives" (VITE SVELATE). It will have over 80 talks about philosophy, music, politics, and religion.</p>
            <p>Katia Tarasconi, the mayor of Piacenza, spoke to international media like CNA in Rome yesterday. She explained that this event is becoming more and more important. Last year, the Italian President, Sergio Mattarella, came to speak to young people himself. She said, "Young people are the most important people to talk to at this event. We hope that through different ideas and discussions, we can help young people make smart choices for their future."</p>
            <p>Roberto Gualtieri, the mayor of Rome, also came to support the event. He said that these discussions are not just political or cultural events. They also help make democracy stronger. He added that society today faces many problems, like the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because of this, we need more time to think deeply about things.</p>
            <p>Alessandro Fusacchia, who organized the event, said that this year's theme, "Uncovering Lives," was chosen because the world feels more and more complicated. People find it harder to understand themselves and what is happening around them. So, everyone needs to look inside themselves more deeply to "discover who they are."</p>
            <p>The event is organized with Tlon, a famous Italian philosophy group. Andrea Colamedici and Maura Gancitano, who started Tlon, explained that the festival will have "philosophy concerts." Famous Italian singers will talk directly with young people in the town square.</p>
            <p>All the talks at this festival are about current issues. For example, experts will discuss "water shortages" and "young people being addicted to smartphones." The event will also bravely discuss sensitive questions like "Do we still need the European Union?"</p>
            <p>Fusacchia admitted that when he was young, 20 or 30 years ago, a united Europe was a dream for many. But now, it feels like everything is falling apart. Young people feel "powerless as a group" about Europe, and this is a problem that must be faced.</p>
            <p>Media and journalism is another topic they will talk about. Many experienced Italian journalists will be there. This includes Cecilia Sala, an Italian female journalist who was held in Iran as part of a prisoner exchange. She will share her experiences of reporting from war zones.</p>
            <p>This year, the "International Contemporary Thought Award" will be given to the Chilean writer BenjamÃ­n Labatut. Important international guests are expected to attend. These include Erling Kagge, a famous Norwegian explorer, and Megi Fino, the Deputy Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of Albania. Marietje Schaake, a former Member of the European Parliament who is an expert in cybersecurity, will also be there.</p>

            <h1>UK Deputy Prime Minister Rayner Accused of Tax Evasion, Resigns, Hurting Labour Government</h1>
            <p>Angela Rayner, the Deputy Prime Minister of the UK, said today that she is resigning. This is because news reports said that she did not pay enough tax when she bought a house in May this year. This broke the rules for government ministers. This news is a big problem for the Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Rayner, who is 45 years old, recently said that she paid less tax than she should have when she bought her house. She has told the UK government's independent advisor on ethics about this.</p>
            <p>In a letter to Keir Starmer, Rayner wrote, "Because of the investigation results and how it affects my family, I have decided to resign." She also left her jobs as Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>
            <p>Rayner also said, "I am very sorry that I did not get more expert tax advice." She added that she takes "full responsibility for this mistake."</p>
            <p>Starmer replied that he was "very sad" that Rayner was leaving the government. But he also said, "You are still an important person in our party."</p>
            <p>Earlier news reports said that in May this year, when Rayner bought an apartment in southern England, she did not say she owned another property. Because of this, she paid Â£40,000 (about NT$1.64 million) less in stamp duty than she should have. Rayner admitted on September 3rd that she had paid less tax.</p>
            <p>The UK newspaper "The Guardian" reported last year that Rayner came from a poor family in Stockport, Greater Manchester. She got pregnant and left school at 16, and became a grandmother at 37.</p>
            <p>After she became a Member of Parliament in 2015, she quickly became a leading figure in politics. She became one of the most powerful women in the UK.</p>
            <p>Rayner is proud to support socialism, but she knows she must first be practical. One of her favorite sayings is, "Ideology alone cannot feed me."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Businesspeople in the Philippines Tricked by Bad Groups, Business Association to Hold Talk to Prevent It</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been reports of Taiwanese businesspeople in the Philippines being tricked and accused falsely by bad groups. To stop more Taiwanese people from being hurt, a Taiwanese business organization plans to hold a meeting. They will invite police experts from the Philippines to explain how to stay safe. A Taiwanese businessperson who has lived in the Philippines for many years suggests that people from Taiwan should live quietly so that criminals do not target them.</p>
            <p>Philippine media recently reported that a Taiwanese person doing business in Subic was tricked and falsely accused. Eleven Filipinos are accused in the case. They are facing several criminal charges. These people include a current prosecutor, a deputy prosecutor, a retired judge, and a police officer who was fired. These reports have been shared among Taiwanese people living there.</p>
            <p>The Manila Times reported on September 1st that a 39-year-old woman and her 17-year-old daughter were used by this group. They falsely accused the Taiwanese businessperson of sexual assault. The group wanted 5 million Philippine Pesos (about NT$2.69 million) to settle the case.</p>
            <p>The local Philippine newspaper, "Nueva Ecija Chronicle," broadcasted the girl's statement on August 15th. She clearly said that the Taiwanese businessperson did not sexually assault her. She accused the group of forging her mother's signature on the complaint to falsely accuse the businessperson.</p>
            <p>Subic used to be a US naval base. It is about 136 kilometers from Manila. Now, it is an important special economic zone in the Philippines. More than 1,800 companies are there, and many foreigners live in the area.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhe-jia, the head of the Subic Bay Taiwanese Business Association, told CNA that he had heard of similar incidents happening to foreign businesspeople before. Even if foreign businesspeople are wrongly accused, most of them just pay money to solve the problem. So, Taiwanese businesspeople living in Subic are very careful.</p>
            <p>Zhang Zhe-jia plans to invite a high-ranking police officer to lead a discussion at the association in late September or early October. The officer will teach how to protect oneself to prevent other Taiwanese businesspeople from becoming victims. The association will meet with the police officer tomorrow to start planning.</p>
            <p>Lin Nan-hong, who advises the Young Entrepreneurs Committee of the Taiwanese General Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines, told CNA that it is good to live a simple life in the Philippines. He advises avoiding places for entertainment, as this can prevent many unnecessary problems. He said that if foreigners live a fancy lifestyle, criminals might see them as easy targets.</p>
            <p>Lin Nan-hong, who has been in the Philippines for 10 years, said that if someone is falsely accused or has an unexpected problem, they can call the emergency help number of the Taiwan Representative Office in the Philippines. They can also ask for help from Taiwanese business organizations or join relevant Facebook groups or LINE chat groups in the Philippines to get legal help from experienced people.</p>
            <p>He said, "When you are living abroad, you should be quiet and not draw attention to yourself. It is also a good idea to connect with local business associations that are well-established and trusted."</p>
