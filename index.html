            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai: Working to Revise the Law on Local Government Finances, Hopes for Fair Power and Money Sharing</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said today that the government is working on changing the law about how money is shared between the central government and local governments. He hopes that local governments will have clear duties and enough money. If local governments get more money from shared taxes, they should also take on more local tasks. He will talk with local governments to create a full plan.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan held a meeting today to ask questions about government policies. Before the meeting, Premier Cho talked to reporters. He explained that the Executive Yuan will suggest changes to the law. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun has also met with different government parts to discuss these changes. They are deciding when to send the plan to the Legislative Yuan.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said that the Executive Yuan wants a financial law that works well for a long time. They are listening to ideas from money experts, lawmakers from different parties, and other people. However, there is a problem right now. The Executive Yuan had asked for a review of the old financial law because of some mistakes. They need to fix these mistakes.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho stated that Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun and financial departments have talked with local governments many times. They will continue these discussions. They want to talk to local governments about sharing power and money fairly. This means that local governments should get more money from shared taxes, and they should also take on more local tasks.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho added that he will work hard to finish the plan and talk with local governments within the expected time. He will also try to include good ideas from lawmakers to make the changes happen.</p>
            <p><b>About Reconsideration and Re-discussion (in Taiwanese law)</b></p>
            <p>If the Executive Yuan thinks a law, budget, or treaty passed by the Legislative Yuan is hard to put into practice, they can ask the President for approval to send it back to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The Legislative Yuan must vote again. If they don't vote in time, the original decision becomes invalid.</p>
            <p>If more than half of all lawmakers vote to keep the original decision, the Premier must accept it.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers can also ask for a re-discussion to talk about a passed idea again. The lawmaker who asks must have been present when the idea was first voted on. They must not have spoken against the original decision and must have new reasons. This request must be made after the original vote, before the next meeting ends, and with at least twenty lawmakers agreeing.</p>
            <p>After a vote on a re-discussion request, no more re-discussion requests can be made for that same idea.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also mentioned that the Legislative Yuan is currently busy asking questions about government policies. They might not have enough time to discuss the budget for next year (Year 115). But he hopes to talk with the President of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu. He also wants lawmakers from all parties to discuss it well. He hopes they will not repeat the problems from this year. He wants lawmakers to have more time to carefully review and approve the central government budget for year 115 soon.</p>

            <h1>Magazine Says Lawmaker Recruited Radio Taiwan International Employees to be Hackers; Minister Li Yuan: Investigation is Ongoing</h1>
            <p>The website of Radio Taiwan International (RTI) was hacked. An investigation found that two employees were involved. A magazine reported that these employees might have worked for Huang Kuo-chang, a lawmaker from the Taiwan People's Party. They are suspected of stealing sensitive online information. Culture Minister Li Yuan said today, "I completely don't know about this part." He added that law enforcement is currently investigating, and they will share information when there is evidence.</p>
            <p>The homepage of Radio Taiwan International's website was recently attacked, and its main image was changed on purpose. Prosecutors in northern Taiwan found that RTI employees Mr. Wu and Mr. Yueh, along with a business owner Mr. Huang, were involved. After questioning, Mr. Wu and Mr. Huang were asked to be held in custody. However, the Taipei District Court decided to release them on bail, and the prosecutors appealed this decision. Mirror Media magazine reported that the involved employees were likely recruited by Huang Kuo-chang. They allegedly broke into systems to steal sensitive online information and even hacked into household registration offices.</p>
            <p>During the morning session of the Legislative Yuan, where lawmakers questioned government policies, Minister Li Yuan spoke to reporters. He said that RTI has already made a statement about this case. He understands that the investigation by law enforcement is still happening, and he knows the same things as everyone else. But, he stressed that public media organizations, such as RTI, Central News Agency, and Public Television Service, should have employees who follow very high moral standards.</p>
            <p>Minister Li Yuan asked everyone to care more about and support public media. He said that with a lot of false information in the media today, public media should be valued more.</p>
            <p>Regarding the magazine's report, Minister Li Yuan said, "I completely don't know about this part." He repeated that law enforcement is investigating and will only speak when there is enough evidence. He also said that he learns about the case from news reports, just like everyone else.</p>

            <h1>Catering Industry's September Revenue Was Quiet; Businesses Expect Stronger Sales in Q4</h1>
            <p>For catering businesses, sales in September were mixed. Many brands saw less income compared to last year. This is because the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday was in September last year. However, brands like Wangza and Bafang Yunji still had their best third-quarter sales ever. Wang Steak also had its second-best quarter. Businesses generally believe that sales will get better in the fourth quarter, thanks to holidays in October and the busy year-end party season.</p>
            <p>Wang Steak Group's total sales in September were NT$1.75 billion, which is 2.09% less than last year. Sales in Taiwan were NT$1.44 billion, down by 1.1%. Sales in mainland China were NT$310 million, down by 6.41%. If we look at sales in Chinese Yuan, the drop was only a small 0.77%.</p>
            <p>Wang Steak also announced its estimated total sales for the third quarter, which was NT$5.839 billion. This is a 1.5% increase from last year and a 6.55% increase from the previous quarter. It was their second-highest quarter ever, just below the first quarter of this year (NT$5.95 billion). Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$17.2 billion, which is a new record for this period.</p>
            <p>Wang Steak explained that September is usually a slow month for restaurants. Last year, the Mid-Autumn Festival was in September. Also, some areas had to close this year because of a strong typhoon. This caused September sales in Taiwan to be slightly lower than last year. For the fourth quarter, they plan to open new stores. They expect good sales in October because there are three long holidays, totaling 11 days. Also, the government giving out NT$10,000 to everyone might make people want to spend more.</p>
            <p>Wowprime Group's sales in September were NT$456 million, down by 8.65% from last year. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$4.617 billion, down by 0.65%. Wowprime also said that fewer customers came in September because there were fewer holidays. They expect sales in the fourth quarter to be better than before, helping their yearly results.</p>
            <p>Wowprime also mentioned that their three main brands will open again at the end of the month when Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi reopens. This will help sales grow. Their first store in the US is expected to open for a trial run in Los Angeles in December 2025. Their global research and development center in Zhongli will start operating in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Hanshe Food's sales in September were NT$512 million, an increase of 3.59% from August but a decrease of 1.46% from last year. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$4.617 billion, an increase of 4.31% from last year. Hanshe said that even though some restaurants opened new branches or were renovated this year, and they had fewer days open, their overall sales kept growing.</p>
            <p>Hanshe Food is looking forward to the busy fourth quarter for restaurants. They expect many people to have year-end parties and gatherings in November. As of the end of September, the Kaohsiung Hanshe Hotel and Hanshe Grand Dome Banquet Hall had received bookings for almost 10,000 tables. The Nankang Hanshe Hotel Banquet Hall is almost fully booked for the end of the year. Sales from single stores during the year-end party season could go over NT$100 million. In September, their buffet brand "Daoyu" had sales of almost NT$100 million from its two stores.</p>
            <p>Wangza's total sales in September were NT$156 million, a big increase of 43.47% from last year. This was helped by five new stores. Their total sales for the third quarter were NT$517 million, an increase of 29.26% from the previous quarter and 45.88% from last year, setting a new record for a single quarter. Their total sales for the first three quarters were NT$1.281 billion, an increase of 24.69% from last year.</p>
            <p>Wangza said that this year they bought 51% of Yangxin Catering Group. They also got the right to manage the Japanese brand "Torisanwa" and its two direct stores in Taiwan. They will keep growing their business to increase sales. They expect their total yearly sales to continue to grow by more than 10%.</p>
            <p>Kanpai's estimated total sales in September were NT$360 million, a decrease of 12.43% from last year. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$3.364 billion, a decrease of 1.14% from last year.</p>
            <p>Kanpai Group explained that the drop in September sales was because the Mid-Autumn Festival was in a different month this year, and there were fewer holidays, which made the comparison to last year look higher. However, their hot pot brand "Kuromaya" grew a lot, with sales more than 50% higher than last year because they opened more stores. Their sales of products for outside use also grew by almost 20%. Kanpai said that "Kuromaya" opened in two big department stores in October: Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi and Kaohsiung Hanshin Arena. Their grilled meat brand also returned to Taichung Shin Kong Mitsukoshi at the end of September, which will help sales.</p>
            <p>Bafang Yunji, a chain restaurant group, had total sales of NT$721 million in September, a 7.36% increase from last year, setting a new record for that month. Their total sales for the third quarter were NT$2.202 billion, a 7.41% increase from last year, setting a new record for any single quarter since they went public. Their total sales for the first nine months were NT$6.488 billion, a 10.11% increase from last year, continuing to grow by more than 10%.</p>
            <p>Bafang Yunji said that their third-quarter sales were a new record because the group opened more stores and kept releasing new products with good profit margins. Also, Bafang Yunji started selling online for the first time, which will further help sales grow.</p>
