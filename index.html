            <h1>US Plans Economic Help, Argentina Stock Market Jumps</h1>
            <p>On October 15, the US government announced it is thinking about giving more financial help to Argentina. This help is to support the difficult reform plans of Argentina's President Javier Milei. After this news, the stock market in Argentina went up a lot today.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced today that his department is planning another "$20 billion plan" to help Argentina's struggling economy. Less than an hour after this news, the Merval Index, which is Argentina's stock market index, showed that some stocks increased by almost 10% on the Buenos Aires stock exchange platform.</p>
            <p>This means that the total help the US government, under President Donald Trump, plans to give to Argentina is $40 billion (about 1.2 trillion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Bessent told reporters in Washington, "We are preparing a $20 billion plan. This will work with our currency swap agreement. This money will come from private banks and wealth funds from different countries. I think this money will focus more on the bond market."</p>
            <p>Last week, Bessent said that Washington was talking with Argentina about starting a currency swap agreement. This would let Argentina use $20 billion. He also said that the US Treasury Department has started buying Argentine pesos in the world market to help Argentina's currency. (Translated by Yang Wei-ching)</p>

            <h1>ESPN: Westbrook Joins Kings for His 18th NBA Season</h1>
            <p>Sacramento, October 15 (CNA) â€” The agent for NBA star guard Russell Westbrook told the sports news channel ESPN that Westbrook has agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings. People with knowledge of the situation say he is expected to officially join the team later this week.</p>
            <p>ESPN reported that Westbrook stayed in touch with the Kings during the off-season. He waited patiently in the free agent market and finally agreed to join the Kings. This will be his 18th season in the NBA.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Westbrook has close relationships with Kings stars Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine, among others.</p>
            <p>Westbrook will turn 37 in November. He has been chosen for the NBA All-Star team 9 times. He was the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2017. He also holds the NBA record for the most triple-doubles ever, with 203.</p>
            <p>Also, Westbrook and LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers are the only two players in NBA history to have at least 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, and 8,000 assists in their careers.</p>
            <p>Westbrook has scored a total of 26,205 points in his career. If he scores 506 more points, he will pass the legendary player Oscar Robertson to become the highest-scoring point guard in NBA history.</p>
            <p>In terms of total assists in the NBA, Westbrook is ranked 8th. He needs only 75 more assists to become the 8th player in league history to reach 10,000 career assists.</p>
            <p>Westbrook is a veteran player in the NBA. In the last three seasons, he played in 216 games, starting 145 of them as a substitute. However, he was still among the top 10 players for the Sixth Man of the Year award each season.</p>
            <p>Last season, Westbrook played 75 games for the Denver Nuggets, starting in 36 of them. He averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game, with a shooting accuracy of 44.9%. In the 2024-25 season, his two-point shot accuracy was a high 52%, which is his best single season record.</p>
            <p>Westbrook joining the team will give the Kings the extra backcourt players they need. He can play both as a starter and as a substitute. Last season, the Kings' bench players scored the 28th lowest in the league, and their bench assists were 29th lowest. His experience might help the team play better.

            <h1>China Limits Rare Earth Exports, US Official Asks Allies to Unite</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 15 (CNA) â€” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent today said that China's limits on rare earth exports are "going against the world." He stated that Washington and its allies "will not be told what to do or controlled."</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Bessent told reporters today, "This should be a clear message to our allies that we must work together, and we will do so."</p>
            <p>He made these comments after global financial leaders met in Washington earlier this week for the autumn meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.</p>
            <p>Bessent also asked for countries to "work together to reduce risks and make our supply chains more diverse, and quickly reduce our reliance on China."</p>
            <p>On October 9, China's Ministry of Commerce announced rules to control the export of rare earths and rare earth technologies. They also said that some logic chips, memory chips, and artificial intelligence (AI) with possible military uses will need special approval for each case.</p>
            <p>Because of this, US President Donald Trump said on October 10 that he might put a 100% tax on Chinese goods as a response to Beijing's decision to limit rare earth mineral exports.</p>
            <p>China is the main country that produces rare earths in the world. Rare earths are important materials used to make special magnets for industries like cars, electronics, and defense.</p>
            <p>Bessent said that Washington "would prefer not" to take action against China. He expects more talks with Beijing this week.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Bessent also told the financial news channel CNBC that he is still "hopeful" about trade talks with Beijing. This is despite the recent increase in trade tension between the US and China over rare earth exports.</p>
            <p>He said that both sides also had working-level meetings during the IMF and World Bank annual meetings.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned that Trump still plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon. (Translated by Yang Wei-ching)</p>
