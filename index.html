There was an error when trying to fetch the news URLs from Taiwan. The tool did not return a response, which means I cannot get the news links to proceed with selecting, reading, and translating the articles.

I cannot fix the issue with the `news_url` tool directly. Please ensure the tool is functioning correctly. Once it is, you can try again.
