<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act" on June 23. This act instructs the U.S. to use its influence and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's admission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its participation in economic oversight, access to technical assistance, and eligibility for positions within the IMF.

Congresswoman Young Kim, who introduced the bill, stated that joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources to enhance its financial stability and effectively counter economic pressure from China. She emphasized that long-standing U.S. policy toward Taiwan supports its membership in international organizations that do not require sovereign state status. Even if full IMF membership is not possible, the U.S. must continue to advocate for Taiwan's status. The bill was co-sponsored by Representative Al Green in the House and Senators Dave McCormick and Dan Sullivan in the Senate.

Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) responded to the bill's passage on June 24, stating that it has positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will continue to monitor related developments closely.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," having passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, must now pass a matching version in the Federal Senate and be signed by the President to become law. The Federal Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a similar bill in early June, awaiting a full vote.

**Taiwan Expo Deepens AI Cooperation with Malaysia**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%BD%A2%E8%B1%A1%E5%B1%95-%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%88%87%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9Eai%E5%90%88%E4%BD%9C-213000941.html">News Link</a>

The Bureau of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held the Taiwan Expo this month at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC) in Malaysia. This marks the eighth time the expo has been held, making it the largest in scale to date, focusing on AI-driven smart manufacturing and applications. TAITRA stated that Taiwan has strong capabilities in semiconductors, information and communication technology, smart manufacturing, and system integration. Meanwhile, Malaysia aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center and accelerate its digital infrastructure development. These factors are expected to create a more extensive and complementary partnership between the two nations.

TAITRA Secretary-General Wang Hsi-meng mentioned that this year's expo focuses on five main themes: smart manufacturing, the grand health industry, green sustainability, smart living, and tourism and culture. He specifically noted that Taiwan and Malaysia have significant potential for deeper cooperation in smart manufacturing, where their combined expertise can upgrade smart systems and jointly achieve digital visions.

TAITRA added that Malaysia is striving to become Southeast Asia's largest data center, actively establishing data centers and promoting 5G digital infrastructure in recent years. This drives strong demand for high-performance computing, data analysis, and smart applications. Taiwan, on the other hand, produces over 90% of advanced AI chips, providing a crucial hardware foundation for global AI innovation. To meet Malaysia's AI demands, this year's expo highlights AI and features a new "AI Innovation Application Zone" showcasing the latest technologies in Taiwan's AI ecosystem.

Regarding green sustainability, Wang Hsi-meng stated that Malaysia has ambitious environmental policy goals, while Taiwan can offer practical solutions in enhancing energy efficiency and low-carbon technologies, assisting factories in moving towards a more sustainable and competitive future.

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pitches-1-trillion-us-053937697.html">News Link</a>

SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is reportedly looking to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to build a one-trillion-dollar industrial complex in the United States, focused on artificial intelligence. This ambitious plan, which he has also discussed with Donald Trump and his advisors, aims to create a major AI hub.

The project, named "ASI" for Artificial Super Intelligence, would involve building cutting-edge chip factories, data centers, and robotics research facilities across multiple U.S. states. The overall cost could be up to $1 trillion, with SoftBank contributing a third and the rest coming from Middle Eastern investors, U.S. debt, and other sources.

Son's vision for ASI includes manufacturing next-generation AI chips and creating humanoid robots for various tasks, from manufacturing to logistics. The initiative also seeks to bring Japanese technology companies to the U.S. to support the AI ecosystem. This massive undertaking reflects Son's belief that AI will drive significant economic growth.

TSMC, a key player in chip manufacturing, confirmed that it has received requests from various parties regarding building AI data centers and factories, and it remains open to discussions. However, the company emphasized that there are many factors to consider, including infrastructure and economic benefits, before committing to such a large-scale project.

This proposal comes as the U.S. aims to boost its domestic semiconductor production through initiatives like the CHIPS Act. Son's plan aligns with this goal by proposing a significant investment in U.S. chipmaking and AI infrastructure.
