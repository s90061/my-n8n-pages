The Public Health Professionals Act has been in effect for five years. The head of the National Health Insurance Administration, Shih Chung-liang, announced today that the agency will hire two public health professionals. This is the first time a government agency has hired public health professionals as official civil servants.

The National Health Insurance Administration is looking for two staff members for their medical review and pharmaceutical materials division. To apply, people must have passed the public health professional exam, have a public health professional license, and have worked in a related professional or technical role for at least two years. Applications are open from June 27th to July 11th.

Shih Chung-liang said that the Public Health Professionals Act was passed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. This law helps people who want to work in public health get official certifications. He explained that sometimes, people who pass the civil service exam might find the job isn't right for them. In such cases, they can be hired as healthcare or public health professionals if they pass national exams and have professional licenses. This kind of flexible hiring has been used before, but mostly for pharmacists, lab technicians, or physical therapists.

Shih Chung-liang explained that the National Health Insurance Administration needs public health professionals. They need help with planning health programs like "Family Doctor Plans" and "Home Care Plans," and connecting health insurance with long-term care. Public health professionals' skills in areas like disease study and statistics are very important for programs such as "888 Program for Three Highs Prevention" and "National Cancer Prevention Program." This is the first time a government agency has hired public health professionals as official staff, and there might be more chances in the future. The Taipei Public Health Professionals Association said on Facebook that this is an important step. It shows that public health is valued and helps public health professionals find more career paths. It also brings new professional skills to the national health system.

**China's Ministry of Commerce: US Has Lifted a Series of Restrictions on China**

China's Ministry of Commerce announced today that teams from China and the US are working hard to put the London framework into action. China is checking requests for export licenses for certain goods. The US has also removed a number of restrictions on China and told China about this.

The Ministry of Commerce in China shared a press release on July 4th about the US lifting trade restrictions. A spokesperson said that after trade talks in London, both sides recently agreed on details to follow up on the important talks between their leaders on June 5th and to strengthen the results from the Geneva trade talks. Both teams are now busy carrying out the London framework.

The spokesperson also said that China is checking export requests for controlled items according to their laws. The US has also acted by removing several restrictions on China and informed China. However, China's Ministry of Commerce did not say which specific restrictions were removed by the US. The spokesperson added that the London framework was hard to achieve and that talking and working together is the right way, not threats.

The spokesperson hopes the US understands that trade between the two countries benefits both sides. They hope the US will continue to work with China, fix any wrong actions, and follow the agreement made by their leaders. This will help the trade relationship grow steadily. News from Reuters and other sources said that before this, US agencies told companies they would lift restrictions on exporting ethane, chip design software, and civil airplane engines to China. China has also started approving rare earth exports to the US again. After the US and China agreed on a trade plan in London in early June, China's Ministry of Commerce said on June 27th that both sides confirmed the details. China will check export requests for controlled items, and the US will remove a series of restrictions on China.

**Indian Prime Minister Visits Ghana for the First Time in 30 Years to Strengthen Cooperation with Africa**

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi today shared plans to make India's ties with Africa stronger. This comes as India tries to have more economic influence in Africa, competing with China and Russia.

According to AFP, Modi spoke to Ghana's Parliament. He talked about a big railway project in Ghana that started last year, which is funded by India's Export-Import Bank. He also mentioned how India is growing its diplomatic and business presence in Africa. He said there are over 200 projects in Africa to improve connections, buildings, and industrial power. Politically, he was happy about the "Ghana-India Parliamentary Friendship Association" being formed in Ghana's Parliament.

Modi is the first Indian leader to visit Ghana in 30 years. However, China, a rival to India, is still the biggest supporter of infrastructure projects in Africa. As the US and other Western countries give less aid, China's role will become even more important.
