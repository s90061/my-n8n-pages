World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka from Belarus had a tough match today. She won against Marie Bouzkova from the Czech Republic with scores of 7-6 (7-4) and 6-4. This victory means she is now in the third round of the Wimbledon tennis tournament.

Sabalenka avoided being eliminated early. Several top players, like Coco Gauff (seed 2), Jessica Pegula (seed 3), and Zheng Qinwen (seed 5), who were seen as strong competitors for Sabalenka, have already lost in the first round of the women's singles at Wimbledon this year.

After Jasmine Paolini, last year's Wimbledon finalist and seed 4 from Italy, lost in the second round, Sabalenka (seed 1) is now the only player left from the top 5 seeds in the women's singles at Wimbledon this year.

According to the Associated Press, Manila started something called the "transparency initiative" in 2023. This involves showing videos of China's aggressive actions in the disputed waters.

Lithuanian Minister of Defense DovilÄ— Å akalienÄ— said, "I think it's very important in this situation to show the world how China bothers the Philippine navy and fishermen in Philippine waters. This will show that China is not a peaceful and friendly neighbor."
