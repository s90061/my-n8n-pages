            <h1>Oracle Stock Rises 40%, Founder Larry Ellison Becomes World's Richest Person, Passing Elon Musk</h1>
            <p>The stock price of the American software company Oracle went up by more than 40%. Because of this, Oracle's founder, Larry Ellison, became much richer. He is now the richest person in the world, passing Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla.</p>
            <p>By 10 AM Eastern Time today, Larry Ellison's total wealth was almost 400 billion US dollars. According to Bloomberg, Elon Musk's wealth is currently about 385 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>After Ellison and Musk, the richest people are Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Meta, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the co-founders of Google.</p>
            <p>Ellison's money grew quickly because he and his family have been actively working in artificial intelligence (AI), media, and politics.</p>
            <p>Oracle's stock went up a lot today. This happened because the company announced that it has over 450 billion US dollars in cloud service orders that have not been delivered yet. Also, Oracle signed deals worth billions of dollars for computing services with important AI companies like Nvidia and OpenAI, which supports ChatGPT.</p>
            <p>The Ellison family has also become more powerful. Larry's son, David, recently finished buying Paramount Global for 8 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison is a strong supporter of President Trump. He recently visited the White House. There, he announced a plan for a large data center project with Masayoshi Son, the head of Japan's SoftBank Group, and Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison, who is 81 years old, started Oracle more than 40 years ago. Today, the company's market value was almost 1 trillion US dollars during trading.</p>
