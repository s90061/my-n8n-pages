            <h1>Chinese Female Student's Sexual Behavior Linked to National Dignity, Hong Kong Media Calls It Dark Humor</h1>
            <p>The news about a Chinese female university student and a foreign man's "sexual behavior" has also been reported in Hong Kong. A Hong Kong newspaper today criticized the school for connecting this event to "national dignity," calling it "dark humor."</p>
            <p>Late last year, a female student from Dalian University of Technology had a close relationship with Ukrainian e-sports player Zeus. Zeus then put private photos online, and the student's personal information became public. Dalian University of Technology later removed the student from school, saying she had "improper interactions with a foreigner, which harmed national dignity and the school's reputation."</p>
            <p>This event caused a lot of discussion in mainland China. Many people criticized and questioned the school's actions. Over the past few days, many internet users on the mainland criticized the man as a "bad guy" and said the girl was a victim who should not be publicly shamed.</p>
            <p>The Hong Kong Economic Times wrote that even if all the rumors were true, the person involved only had a private moral fault. Today, even when police announce suspects, their names are not used. So, it is clear that a university student being publicly attacked by the university and several media outlets because of a male-female relationship goes too far beyond what is reasonable for judging personal morals.</p>
            <p>Also, the girl was a victim of her private information being shared. But the school did not protect her. Instead, they said she "damaged national dignity and the school's reputation" and removed her from school. This caused her more harm, and many internet users were angry about it.</p>
            <p>The article quoted Zhao Hong, a law professor from Peking University, who said that the school's announcement to remove the female student did not protect her basic right to education. It also did not respect her personal privacy. This might be against her right to privacy and is a "rough interference with basic personal rights and freedom."</p>
            <p>The article then said that what caused even more argument was that the school's punishment for the girl linked her relationship with a foreigner to "national dignity." This made many people wonder what "national dignity" means.</p>
            <p>The article added that Dalian University of Technology using the term "national dignity" reminds people of the "Li Shuang incident" that was very famous in China. In 1979, Li Shuang, a free artist from Beijing, fell in love with Bai Tianxiang, a diplomat from the French Embassy in China. Because she stayed in Bai Tianxiang's diplomatic apartment, the Beijing Public Security Bureau accused her of "selling national dignity" and sentenced her to two years of re-education through labor.</p>
            <p>She was not released until May 1983. At that time, French President Mitterrand visited China and asked Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping to release Li Shuang. Deng Xiaoping agreed, and Li Shuang was released and went to France.</p>
            <p>The article pointed out that China has moved from the early reform period to 2025. But a woman's sexual behavior is again being linked to "national dignity." This is really "dark humor." This not only deeply misunderstands what national dignity means but also does not fit with modern values.</p>
            <p>The article added that Dalian University of Technology has not said anything in response to the many questions. If the school cannot give a good answer, then maybe, as Zhao Hong said: what truly harms national dignity are educational institutions that use old moral rules and unfairly take away students' rights.</p>

            <h1>Chiu Chui-cheng Welcomes Guatemalan Congress Speaker's Visit, Hopes for Peace and Stability</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lu Chia-jung, Taipei, July 17) Chiu Chui-cheng, the head of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), met with a group led by Nery Abilio Ramos y Ramos, the Speaker of the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala, on the morning of July 15. Chiu Chui-cheng said that because the world is unstable now, countries that share similar ideas need to work together more closely on security. This will help them stand against threats from strong, controlling countries and keep the region peaceful and stable.</p>
            <p>According to written information provided by the MAC today, Chiu Chui-cheng first shared his sincere sympathy and care for the people in Guatemala because of recent earthquakes that caused injuries and deaths. He hopes that people can return to their normal lives soon.</p>
            <p>About the recent situation between Taiwan and mainland China, Chiu Chui-cheng said that mainland China continues to threaten Taiwan with words and military actions, putting a lot of pressure on Taiwan. This has seriously threatened peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region. Taiwan is on the front line of democratic countries and knows that a peaceful and stable situation across the Taiwan Strait is important for global peace, safety, and development.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that Taiwan, as a good and responsible member of the international community, will actively promote the "Four Pillars for Peace Action Plan" that President Lai Ching-te announced. He hopes that democratic partners will work together to create a "democratic protection umbrella" and protect their shared values.</p>
            <p>Chiu Chui-cheng also strongly said that he thanks the visiting group for showing strong support for democratic Taiwan through their actions.</p>
            <p>Nery Abilio Ramos y Ramos said in his speech that Guatemala fully understands that Taiwan is facing a difficult political situation where the peace across the Taiwan Strait is being disturbed. He is leading a group of lawmakers from different parties to visit Taiwan to show that 100% of the people in Guatemala support Taiwan. This visit shows the friendship between Guatemala and the Republic of China (Taiwan) and aims to make their relationship stronger.</p>
            <p>The visiting group was led by Ramos. Members included José Pablo Mendoza Franco, the Fifth Secretary General of the Guatemalan Congress; Fidel Reyes Lee, the chief of the BIEN Party in Congress; lawmakers César Augusto Fión Morales, Mirna Victoria Godoy Palala, and Raúl Antonio Solórzano Quevedo; and Víctor Jaroslav Alburez García, the head of the Protocol Office of the Congress. Luis Raúl Estévez López, the Guatemalan Ambassador to Taiwan, also went with them to the meeting.</p>
