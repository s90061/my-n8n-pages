            <h1>Ecuador Works with Carbon Credit Group GS to Create National Carbon Offset Plan</h1>
            <p>Ecuador has started working with Gold Standard (GS), an international organization that approves carbon credits. They have officially made GS part of their national plan to reduce greenhouse gases (PECC).</p>
            <p>The news website Carbon Herald said that Ecuador's Ministry of Environment, Water, and Ecological Transition (MAATE) signed an agreement with Gold Standard on July 17.</p>
            <p>Ecuador's national plan for greenhouse gas reduction was created in 2023. It aims to set rules for carbon offsets to help Ecuador reach its goal of zero carbon emissions.</p>
            <p>This two-year partnership will help MAATE and Gold Standard work together to make sure their plans happen.</p>
            <p>They will focus on finding problems in current ways of working, creating a system to approve carbon credits, and making local reviewers better at their jobs.</p>
            <p>They will share knowledge about how carbon markets work, how to register carbon credits, and how to approve them. This agreement is a big step in Ecuador's climate plan. It will make Ecuador's carbon market more trustworthy and effective.</p>

            <h1>Ceasefire Talks Fail; Trump Says Israel Should Remove Hamas Completely</h1>
            <p>Talks for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza have failed. Today, former US President Trump said that he thinks Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should make the war with Hamas stronger to "get rid of" Hamas completely.</p>
            <p>The US news website Axios reported that the talks for a ceasefire are in trouble. This is happening as the situation for people in Gaza is getting worse, with the UN and other groups saying that Palestinians are starving.</p>
            <p>Trump said this after talking with Netanyahu. He said, "Hamas does not truly want a deal. I think they want to die, and that is very bad. It is now time to finish it."</p>
            <p>Before going to Scotland, Trump also told reporters that Israelis need to fight and clean everything up completely. He said, "You have to take them [Hamas] out." He also said he always felt Hamas would not want to let go of the remaining hostages because they do not want to lose their "bargaining chip" and "protection."</p>
            <p>Trump said Hamas "will now be hunted."</p>
            <p>Hamas negotiators in Doha have long said that Israel does not want a ceasefire. However, in the last week, Israel agreed to a ceasefire plan suggested by Qatar and Egypt. But Hamas tried to change the deal, and Israel quickly said no.</p>
            <p>On July 24, Israel and the US called back their teams who were negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza. US special envoy Steve Witkoff also said that the Palestinian group Hamas did not act honestly during the talks.</p>
            <p>The leaders of the UK, Germany, and France had an "urgent" phone call today to talk about the situation in Gaza. In a joint statement, the three leaders said, "It is time to stop the war in Gaza. We ask all sides to agree to a ceasefire right away to end this conflict."</p>
            <p>They also said that the difficult situation for people in Gaza "must stop immediately." They asked the Israeli government to "immediately remove limits on aid entering and quickly allow the United Nations and aid groups to work, to help with the hunger crisis." They also stressed that Israel must follow international laws about helping people in war.</p>
            <p>After nearly two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the humanitarian situation inside Gaza has become much worse. Israelis are also worried about the remaining hostages. Both sides are under pressure, both inside and outside, to reach an agreement.</p>
            <p>According to health officials in Gaza, tens of people have died from hunger there in the past few weeks.</p>

            <h1>US and Europe to Discuss Trade Deal on July 27; Trump Says 50% Chance of Success</h1>
            <p>There is only one week left until the important US-EU trade talks. The head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said today that she will meet with US President Trump in Scotland this weekend. They will discuss the problem with tariffs between the two sides. Trump thinks there is only a 50% chance of reaching a deal.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump has promised to put extra taxes on goods from many countries if they do not make a deal with the US by August 1. He wants to lower the US trade deficit.</p>
            <p>Von der Leyen wrote on social media platform X: "After a good talk with the US President, we agreed to meet on the 27th in Scotland. We will talk about the trade relationship between the US and Europe and how to keep it strong."</p>
            <p>Before this high-level meeting between the US and EU, there were many signs that the European Commission and the US government were getting closer to a deal. However, Trump's words today seemed to make the future of this deal less certain.</p>
            <p>Before leaving the White House for Scotland, Trump told reporters that he believes there is only a fifty-fifty chance that the US and the EU will reach a trade agreement.</p>
            <p>Many diplomats have said that the deal being thought about now includes a basic tax of 15% on EU goods from the US. It might also have special rules for important industries.</p>
            <p>If the talks fail, EU countries support taking action against $109 billion worth of US goods. This would happen in steps starting from August 7.</p>
            <p>Since the Trump government started its tariff disputes, only five trade deals have been made. These include deals with the UK, Japan, and the Philippines.</p>
