            <h1>After Jerusalem Shooting, Israeli Army Attacks Qatar To Kill Hamas Leader</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a shooting in Jerusalem caused 6 deaths. Today, an armed group from the Palestinian organization Hamas said they were responsible. On the same day, the Israeli army announced they tried to kill a senior Hamas leader in Doha, the capital of Qatar.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades, an armed group connected to Hamas, said in a message on Telegram: "The Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades say they are responsible for the shooting that happened yesterday morning."</p>
            <p>This afternoon, several explosions were heard in Doha, Qatar. Smoke was seen rising in areas where some embassies are located. The Israeli army released a statement, confirming they attacked Hamas officials in Doha.</p>
            <p>Israel and Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, are still fighting. A Hamas source told Al Jazeera that Israel's attack today was aimed at Hamas's negotiating team. The attack happened while Hamas negotiators were meeting to discuss the newest ceasefire plan suggested by the United States.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that this attack "clearly breaks all international laws and rules. It also seriously puts the safety of Qatari citizens and residents in danger."</p>
            <p>Anna Kelly, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US White House, told Al Jazeera that the US government would not comment on Israel's attack on Doha at this time.</p>
            <p>The US Embassy in Doha was the first to give an official comment on the attack. They said they had seen "reports of missile attacks in Qatar's capital." The embassy also posted on social media that they had told embassy staff to stay in a safe place. They also advised American citizens in Qatar to do the same.</p>
            <p>Later, Qatar's Interior Ministry posted on social media that "the situation is safe now."</p>
            <p>The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel's attack today on a Hamas leader was a "completely separate" action. They said it was "started by Israel, carried out by Israel, and Israel is fully responsible."</p>
            <p>The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, spoke against Israel's attack on Qatar today. He called it a "clear violation" of Qatar's independence.</p>
            <p>Guterres said at a press conference: "We just heard about Israel's attack on Qatar. Qatar has played a very active role in helping to achieve a ceasefire and release all hostages. I speak against this clear breaking of Qatar's independence and its borders."</p>

            <h1>Belarus To Hold Joint Military Exercises With Russia, Poland Closes Border With Both</h1>
            <p>Today, Polish Prime Minister Tusk announced that Poland will close its border with Belarus. This is because Russia and Belarus will soon hold joint military exercises.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Belarus is a former Soviet country and a key friend of Russia. When Russia started a full attack on Ukraine in February 2022, it used land in Belarus to attack. The two countries will hold their joint military exercise, called "Zapad-2025," from the 12th to the 16th of this month.</p>
            <p>Donald Tusk said at a press conference: "For reasons of national security, we will close our border with Belarus, including train routes. This is because of the 'Zapad' military exercise, which starts at midnight on the 12th."</p>
            <p>He also said that to respond to these joint exercises, Poland and its allies will also hold military training inside Poland. About 30,000 soldiers are expected to take part.</p>
            <p>According to Tusk, the "Zapad" military exercise by Russia and Belarus plans to practice taking control of the "Suwalki Corridor." This is a thin piece of land along the border between Poland and Lithuania. On its other sides, it is surrounded by Belarus and the Russian area of Kaliningrad.</p>
            <p>The Suwalki Corridor is often seen as a "weak spot" for NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). If Russia attacks, this area might be the first place it targets.</p>
