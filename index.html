            <h1>Taiwan Documentaries "The Park" and "A Story of Houtong" Win Big Awards at Yamagata Film Festival</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival had its awards ceremony today, October 15th, in Yamagata City. Taiwanese documentaries did very well. "The Park," directed by Su Yu-Hsien, won a Special Jury Award in the International Competition. "A Story of Houtong," directed by Song Cheng-Ying and Hu Ching-Ya, won an Award of Excellence in the New Asian Currents section.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Cultural Center in Japan sent out a press release. The representative in Japan, Lee Yi-Yang, said that Taiwan's strong showing at the Yamagata Film Festival not only showed its creative skill but also brought more attention to Taiwanese culture around the world. Minister of Culture, Lee Yung-Te, said that documentaries truly show how society is and what people feel. They also show the wide range of views and deep culture of Taiwanese filmmakers. The Ministry of Culture will keep supporting them so that more Taiwanese stories can be seen by the world.</p>
            <p>This year, 1318 films from 129 countries competed in the "International Competition" section, but only 15 films were chosen. For the "New Asian Currents" section, 20 films were chosen from 1358 entries from 75 countries. Taiwan had "The Park" and "A Little Slice of Thai," a film made by Taiwan, Hong Kong, and France with director Hsin Hao-Yang, enter the main competition. "Some Dreams in the Roasting Room" by director Sayun Simung and "A Story of Houtong" entered the "New Asian Currents" section.</p>
            <p>In the end, "The Park" and "A Story of Houtong" won two major awards. This is a great achievement. Taiwanese documentaries have won awards at the Yamagata Film Festival again, after Hsiao Mei-Ling's "Parallel World" in 2023.</p>
            <p>"The Park" is about city parks. It looks at everyday life, like old people exercising, children playing, and foreign workers meeting. It shows how parks are like a small version of society, with many different things happening. It also makes us think about public spaces and how people connect. "A Story of Houtong" tells the story of the old mining area in Houtong, New Taipei City. Through the memories of old miners and the community, the old ruins become a place full of history and feelings. It shows how time and memories are connected. "A Story of Houtong" was also nominated for "Best Documentary Short Film" at the 62nd Golden Horse Awards.</p>
            <p>The Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival is the first film festival in Asia to focus on documentaries. For many years, it has supported "independent views, care for people, and new talent." It is considered a special place for documentary filmmakers in Asia. Taiwan's Cultural Center in Japan said that they will keep working with the festival to share more great Taiwanese documentaries and directors, so that the world can learn more about Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>High-Level Talks Between US and Brazil Begin; Trump Pressures Brazil to Drop BRICS Currency Idea</h1>
            <p>Brazil's Foreign Minister, Mauro Vieira, will meet with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on October 16th. They will discuss economic and political issues between their two countries. Brazil's Foreign Ministry sees these talks as a very important chance to restart talks about tariffs (taxes on goods) and sanctions (restrictions).</p>
            <p>According to the Brazilian news website g1, three other representatives from Brazil will join Vieira at the meeting. These are the Ambassador to the US, Maria Luiza Viotti, the chief negotiator, MaurÃ­cio Lyrio, and the diplomat for economic affairs, Philip Fox-Drummond Gough. The Foreign Ministry stressed that they will use a careful and practical approach during the talks.</p>
            <p>The report also states that on October 14th, US President Donald Trump met with Argentina's President Javier Milei at the White House. Trump announced that the US would give Argentina a currency swap agreement worth up to 20 billion US dollars to help their economy stay stable. He also said that the US does not support the BRICS countries' idea of using a new currency instead of the US dollar.</p>
            <p>The BRICS group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been working hard in recent years to "de-dollarize." This means they want to rely less on the US dollar. During the BRICS summit in South Africa in 2023, Brazil's President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva asked for a common currency to be created. This currency would be used for trade and investments among member countries. The goal was to reduce the impact of changes in the US dollar's value.</p>
            <p>Russia has suggested creating an independent financial system called "BRICS Bridge." This would be a digital payment system to replace the US dollar. This idea is still being discussed and has not yet become a single currency or a clear plan. Most experts believe that because there are big differences in the economies and political situations of the member countries, creating a common currency soon is not practical.</p>
            <p>People inside the Brazilian government have said that President Lula, with advice from his team, has stopped pushing the idea of a new currency to replace the US dollar. This is to avoid problems with the US.</p>
            <p>The report says that today, Lula confirmed that formal talks between the US and Brazil will start on the 16th. He was at a Brazilian Teacher's Day event in Rio. He remembered a phone call he had with Trump on the 6th, which lasted about 30 minutes. Lula joked, "He said we had chemistry, I said it's not chemistry, it's petrochemicals." Lula also said that they would talk informally, showing how important personal relationships are.</p>
            <p>Even though Brazil wants to focus on economic topics during the talks, the Foreign Ministry believes that the US might be more interested in preparing for a formal meeting between Trump and Lula. The US might also bring up political issues related to Latin America, such as Venezuela and Cuba.</p>
            <p>The report mentions that Marco Rubio is being more quiet than he used to be. Brazilian diplomats say that he used to comment on Brazilian politics a lot on social media, but now he is more careful.</p>

            <h1>US Media: China Is Making Trade War Worse to Get Trump's Attention</h1>
            <p>The trade war between the US and China is getting more intense before their leaders might meet in Korea. US media reports that China believes the problem started because some people in Trump's government, who are very tough on China, do not want relations between the two countries to improve. China's actions are meant to get Trump's attention. However, US experts think China might have made a mistake and reacted too strongly.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that many experts believe China's strict control over rare earth exports is not just about having more power over these important minerals worldwide. It also wants to make a big move to get US President Donald Trump's attention, because his staff are trying to stop the improving US-China relationship.</p>
            <p>China's actions have worked. Trump has shifted global focus to the US-China trade issues. But this has also made European governments and businesses worried, affecting stock markets.</p>
            <p>Trump announced that next month, the US will add a 100% tax on products coming from China. In response, China put five American companies that are part of the Korean company Hanwha Ocean on a list of targeted businesses. Trump then said he would stop buying Chinese cooking oil. Both countries are charging high fees for each other's cargo ships that enter their ports. On October 15th, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also said he would increase limits on US private industries exporting products important for national security.</p>
            <p>Chinese experts believe that on September 29th, the US Department of Commerce expanded its rules for foreign companies buying US technology. These rules now include not just companies on a banned list, but also their related businesses. This decision surprised Beijing. China thought that after four rounds of talks and phone calls between the leaders, both sides had agreed to a trade ceasefire.</p>
            <p>China's new ban on rare earth exports is like hitting Trump where it hurts most. It might also be Chinese President Xi Jinping showing his power to the Chinese people before an important Communist Party meeting.</p>
            <p>Wu Xinbo, who leads the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai, asked: If you are a country's leader who talked to Trump, and then 10 days later the US publicly criticizes you, how do you respond before an important political meeting in your own country?</p>
            <p>Experts who have spoken with Chinese officials say that the US Commerce Department's actions against thousands of Chinese businesses were done by the "China hawks" in Trump's government. Beijing believes Trump is busy with peace in Gaza and the US government shutdown, so it needs to show him the effects of these measures. Experts also think China has already given in on TikTok. Wu Xinbo said that China's strong reaction is to remind Trump that he needs to handle the relationship between the two countries himself and not let the tough-minded people ruin it.</p>
            <p>Sun Yun, who directs the China Program at the Stimson Center, a think tank in Washington, believes China made a mistake this time. Many countries were shocked by China's ban and thought it was too much.</p>
            <p>US experts say that China's Ministry of Commerce understands that it might have reacted too strongly. They explained that the new rare earth controls will not be used widely or limit everything. Beijing is too confident that Washington will take back its bans against China and that it can change how other countries see it negatively.</p>
            <p>Evan Medeiros, a professor of East Asian studies at Georgetown University, thinks that using these methods to get Trump's attention is a bad idea. He said it would be better to just wave hello instead of preparing for a fight and then promising not to use big weapons.</p>
