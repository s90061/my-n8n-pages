Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that big companies with over NT$50 billion in capital will have new rules for announcing purchases or sales of business equipment and fixed-income products. If these deals are not with related parties, the amount that needs to be announced will change. Instead of NT$1 billion for equipment and NT$300 million for fixed income, the amount must be 5% or more of the company's capital. For example, a company with NT$50 billion capital would only need to announce deals over NT$2.5 billion. These new rules will start by the end of July.

Gao Jingping, Deputy Director of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that outsiders thought the old rules were not so important for very large companies. After discussions, the FSC decided to change the rules. By April this year, there were 34 such large companies, all listed on the stock market.

The FSC expects these changes to greatly reduce the number of announcements. From 2022 to 2024, there were about 475 announcements under the old rules, but only 87 would have been needed with the new rules, a reduction of almost 82%.

**PX Mart Stores to Practice Air Raid Drills**

Taiwan will hold "Town Resilience Drills" in 22 cities and counties starting July 15. Before that, on July 10, three PX Mart supermarkets in Taipei, Taichung, and Tainan will do their own air raid and evacuation practice. The police say that in Taipei and Taichung, people will go to the basement for safety. In Tainan, because there is no basement, people will stay on the first floor inside the store.

Liu Shih-fang, the Minister of Interior, said that the police and PX Mart will practice together at 10 AM on July 10. They will sound an alarm through the store's announcement system and help customers go to safe areas and get into protective positions. They will also practice sharing information, calming customers, and simple first aid. This will help both customers and staff know what to do in an emergency.

The Ministry of Interior is also working with the government and Ministry of National Defense for the "2025 Town Resilience (Air Defense) Drill" from July 15 to 18. This drill will happen in different areas, including central, southern, northern, eastern Taiwan, and outer islands. It will include practicing alarms, evacuating people, controlling traffic, helping injured people, giving aid to victims, and dealing with disasters.

**Drone No-Fly Zones in Kaohsiung Relaxed**

Areas like Qishan and Meinong in Kaohsiung were marked as no-fly zones for drones by the military. This caused problems for farmers who use drones to spray crops. Today, legislator Chiu Yi-ying of the Democratic Progressive Party held a meeting with different groups. The Navy agreed that if someone needs to use a drone for work, they can apply once and get approval for all future uses, instead of applying every time.

Chiu Yi-ying held the meeting to talk about the drone no-fly zones in Qishan and Meinong. People from the Navy, Civil Aeronautics Administration, Kaohsiung City Government, Pingtung County Government, drone spraying associations, and universities were there.

After the meeting, Chiu Yi-ying said that they agreed on two things. First, if groups like those using agricultural drones or for training at Shih Chien University need to operate drones, they can send one application to the local government, and the Navy and Civil Aeronautics Administration will approve it for multiple uses. This will help keep flights safe and make things easier for people.
