            <h1>A 21-Day-Old Baby Got Serious RSV; Doctors Say Preventing It In Newborns Is Very Important</h1>
            <p>A 21-day-old baby in Taichung had a very bad cough and vomited. Doctors found out she had RSV, a respiratory virus. A doctor from Uray Lin Shin Hospital, Dr. Lai Yong-ching, said that babies with weak immune systems can become very sick if they get RSV. Parents must be careful.</p>
            <p>Uray Lin Shin Hospital said today that a baby girl, 21 days old, recently coughed a lot, vomited, had a blocked nose, and a lot of phlegm. She also did not want to eat. She went to the hospital quickly. Tests showed she had RSV.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lai Yong-ching, a children's doctor at the hospital, explained that RSV spreads very easily. It can spread through drops in the air or by touching things. One sick person can give it to three others. Its signs are like a common cold, so people often do not notice how serious it is. This can lead to serious lung infections. It used to happen mostly in winter, but now it can happen all year.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lai also said that RSV is the most common lung infection for children under five years old. Around 68% of babies get RSV before they are one year old. By the time they are two years old, 97% of babies have had RSV.</p>
            <p>About the signs, Dr. Lai said that most babies first have signs like a cold, such as a cough, runny nose, and fever. But it can quickly become very serious in just three to five days. For 30% to 40% of babies, the infection gets much worse and affects their lower lungs. Also, 50% to 80% of babies who go to the hospital because of lung problems also have trouble breathing and make wheezing sounds. This is very serious.</p>
            <p>For treatment, Dr. Lai said there is no special medicine that can cure RSV. Doctors mainly give care to help with the signs. Pregnant women can get an RSV vaccine. Or, babies can get a special antibody shot after they are born. This helps stop them from becoming very sick.</p>
            <p>After getting the right care from the doctors, the baby girl got better and went home after two weeks. Her mother was also resting after giving birth and had cold signs. It is possible that the mother passed the virus to the baby.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lai wants to remind everyone that some babies are at high risk for RSV. These include babies born too early, children with heart problems, and babies with weak immune systems. If these babies get RSV, they can have very serious problems. Parents must always be careful and check their own health. They should avoid spreading viruses to babies who have weak immunity.</p>

            <h1>Police Officer Who Won an Award Is Held for Money Laundering and Organized Crime, Suspended from Work</h1>
            <p>A police officer from Taitung named Huang once won a special police award. Now, he is in trouble for being part of money laundering and organized crime. Yesterday, the Taitung District Court decided that he must be held in jail and cannot see anyone. Last night, the Taitung County Police Department quickly stopped him from working.</p>
            <p>Officer Huang once got a national police award because he helped to stop a big drug smuggling case at sea. But now, he is said to be involved in organized crime and has broken money laundering laws.</p>
            <p>The head of the Taitung County Police Department's inspection team, Tsai Pei-yuan, said today that on September 3rd, the police worked with the Taitung District Prosecutors Office. They also worked with the Eastern Investigation Bureau. They searched places connected to Officer Huang from the juvenile squad. Then, they took Officer Huang for questions. On September 4th, the prosecutors asked the Taitung District Court to hold him for money laundering, and the court agreed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai said that because Officer Huang was held in jail, the police department had a meeting last night. They decided to stop him from working right away, as the law says.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai also said that they were already looking into the illegal things Officer Huang was doing. The police department will investigate any wrong actions by police officers strictly, according to the law. They promise not to hide anything, not to protect anyone, and not to be too easy on people. They will punish those who are responsible and remove them from their jobs. They will also look into the responsibility of other people who were in charge.</p>

            <h1>Man Went In and Out of Taichung Temple 8 Times, Pretending to Pray, Broke Donation Box and Stole Money, Now Charged</h1>
            <p>A man named Ni went to a temple in Taichung's West District eight times. He acted like he was praying, but then he broke a box for donations and stole money. The police were told and started to look into it. Later, prosecutors charged him with serious theft and damaging property.</p>
            <p>Today, the First Police Station of Taichung City Police Department said that on June 1st, they got a report. A temple on Section 1, Xiangshang Road, had its donation box broken, and money was taken. The police started an investigation right away.</p>
            <p>The police looked at the security cameras. They saw that Mr. Ni went into the temple's main area eight times, starting at 1:55 PM that day. He bowed and prayed many times. He kept going in and out to make people think he was a very religious person.</p>
            <p>The camera video showed that Mr. Ni acted very fast, in only five minutes. He first used a tool to try and open the donation box, but it did not work. Then, he used his bare hands to break the wooden part where people put money in. He reached in four times to take the donation money and then quickly left.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lu, who is the temple manager, told the police that he was resting in his office. When he woke up, he saw that the donation box was broken. He guessed that about NT$10,000 had been stolen.</p>
            <p>After looking into the case, the police found that Mr. Ni was the person who did it. They asked him to come in for questions. After the police finished their part, they sent the case to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutors Office. Prosecutors have now charged him with serious theft and damaging property, according to the laws of Taiwan.</p>
