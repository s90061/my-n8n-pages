            <h1>TSMC Employee Suspected of Stealing Company Secrets; Experts Say Operations Still Okay, But Image Harmed</h1>
            <p>A chip-making company called TSMC has had a problem. An employee is thought to have illegally taken important company secrets. Experts in the semiconductor business say this event will not badly affect TSMC's daily work. However, it will hurt the image of TSMC and other related people.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported that TSMC might have lost some technology secrets. Some past employees are thought to have taken 2-nanometer process technology without permission when they worked for the company. The people involved have been fired.</p>
            <p>TSMC said they found wrong actions recently during their normal checks. An inside investigation showed that trade secrets were leaked. They have strongly punished the employees who did this and started legal actions. TSMC said they cannot share more details about whether the secret was 2-nanometer technology because the case is now with the courts.</p>
            <p>People have always believed that TSMC has very strict controls. So, this event, where an employee might have illegally taken trade secrets, surprised many. Experts in the semiconductor business said they found it hard to believe this happened at TSMC. They added that even if systems are strong, it is still very hard to stop bad actions by people.</p>
            <p>Experts said that TSMC has grown a lot in recent years. They have hired many new employees. This makes it hard for the company to keep its old culture of strong rules. Even though there are not enough skilled workers in the semiconductor industry, TSMC should still be very careful when hiring people. They should also make their internal checks stronger.</p>
            <p>Experts explained that semiconductors have become much more important recently. They are now a key material for many countries. TSMC is the only company in the world with such advanced technology. Because of this, many countries want to work with TSMC. As TSMC grows its business around the world, it must also be more careful about security. This will help protect the rights of its shareholders.</p>
            <p>It is still not known if TSMC's trade secrets about its production technology have been shared outside the company. Experts said that if TSMC's rivals get these secrets, they might be able to make products faster. However, without knowing all the important details, it will still be hard for them to make good quality products. So, the experts think that the effect on TSMC's future business should not be too big.</p>
            <p>Experts mentioned that TSMC has taken legal action before. They sued a chip-making company in mainland China called SMIC for using their ideas without permission. Experts said that TSMC can also take legal action against any company that illegally uses its trade secrets this time.</p>
            <p>Experts said that this event, where an employee is thought to have illegally taken trade secrets, will certainly harm the image of TSMC and people connected to it. They believe TSMC should be careful and explain the situation to the public.</p>
            <p>TSMC said it will continue to make its internal management and checking systems stronger. Also, they will work with police and other official groups when needed. This is to make sure the company stays competitive and works well. To help employees understand how to protect secret information, TSMC will also give more training about its confidential information protection (PIP) rules.</p>

            <h1>Singer Chang Hsiu-ching to Hold Her First Concert After 45 Years; Grateful for Husband's Support</h1>
            <p>Singer Chang Hsiu-ching released her first music album when she was just 11 years old. Now, after 45 years of singing, she is finally going to have her own concert, which is a dream come true. Her husband, Wang Kuo-tsan, who is 12 years younger than her, strongly supported her. He told her, "The only thing you haven't done in your life is have your own concert, and I will pay for it." This made Chang Hsiu-ching very touched and she cried.</p>
            <p>Chang Hsiu-ching will have her "Hot Girl Arrives Concert" on the 23rd of this month at the Tainan Exhibition Center. Today, she practiced singing with special guests, the Taiwanese singer Tsai Hsiao-hu, Wang Cai-hua, and Wu Chun-hung. Chang Hsiu-ching and Wang Cai-hua have known each other for more than 30 years. At the press conference, they jokingly kissed each other. Wang Cai-hua happily said that she had finally waited for her good friend to have a concert. She felt very honored to be invited as a guest. She joked, "Chang Hsiu-ching cannot stop talking once she holds a microphone, so I will be in charge of controlling her."</p>
            <p>Tsai Hsiao-hu spoke with feeling, "We are like close brother and sister. I call her 'San Ba Qing,' which is a funny nickname. I like that she is real and not fake. She is naturally a bit silly, and she makes me happy. Our personalities are different; she is direct and I am quiet. This will make for exciting moments on stage." Tsai Hsiao-hu also joked, "Even though I am not getting much money for this, I don't mind supporting my sister!"</p>
            <p>About recent rumors that he was not feeling well, he said it bothered him a lot. He said that he exercises every day and often cooks. His life is very regular. When he heard these rumors online, Tsai Hsiao-hu directly said, "Of course, I am not happy about it. I am living well, and I am still full of energy every day!"</p>
            <p>Wu Chun-hung said, "When my god-sister decided to have a concert, I felt very honored to get the invitation right away. I am really looking forward to performing on a big stage with her. I am very excited."</p>
            <p>With only half a month left until the concert, Chang Hsiu-ching is very thankful for the support from her husband and good friends. Even the famous TV host Jacky Wu is supporting her. Chang Hsiu-ching has been working hard to get in shape for the concert. She said, "I regularly go to the gym for boxing, weightlifting, yoga, and horse riding. I also do very slow jogging at home. I drink bird's nest soup every day to protect my voice, and I sleep very well." She hopes to be very lively on stage and make sure everyone feels they got their money's worth!</p>
            <p>The "Chang Hsiu-ching Hot Girl Arrives Concert" will take place on the 23rd at the Tainan Exhibition Center. Tickets for the concert are available for sale on KKTIX and at FamilyMart convenience stores.</p>

            <h1>Starlink's Rival, Eutelsat, Reports Better-Than-Expected Earnings Thanks to Government Demand, Including from Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Eutelsat, a French company that runs satellites and owns OneWeb's low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite service, announced today that its total income for the year ending June 30 was better than they expected. This good result is because governments and businesses, including Taiwan, wanted more of their satellite internet services.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that governments in Europe are looking for their own satellite solutions. They want to rely less on American companies that provide satellite services, like Starlink, which is owned by Elon Musk. Because of this, Eutelsat has received a lot of attention this year.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat announced that its total income for the whole year from video services, internet connections, and government services reached 1.23 billion Euros. This is about 42.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This amount is 0.8% higher than last year. It is also more than the 1.21 billion Euros that financial experts expected.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat wants to get a part of the satellite internet market. Starlink is currently the biggest company in this market. Eutelsat hopes this will help make up for the money they are losing from their video services, which are earning less and less.</p>
            <p>However, Jean-FranÃ§ois Fallacher, the boss of Eutelsat, told reporters today that they "will not directly fight against Starlink or Amazon's Kuiper in the market for regular customers." Instead, they will focus on areas where they are strong. These areas include services for governments, internet on airplanes, and internet for ships at sea.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat announced that its low-Earth orbit satellite business made much more money. Its income grew by 84.1% to 187 million Euros for the whole year. Fallacher said that the increase in money from government services came from the help they gave in Ukraine. It also came from more demand from countries outside the United States, especially Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Even with the good news, Eutelsat still lost money for the whole year, about 1.1 billion Euros. This is around 38 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Part of this loss happened because the value of its satellites in geostationary orbit (GEO) went down.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat has 34 GEO satellites, which stay in one place above the Earth. It also has more than 600 low-Earth orbit satellites. The low-Earth orbit satellites are run by OneWeb, a company from the UK that Eutelsat bought in 2023.</p>
