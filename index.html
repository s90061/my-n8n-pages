**US House Unanimously Passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," Urges Trump to Back Taiwan in IMF; Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Central News Agency) - The U.S. House of Representatives on June 23 unanimously passed by voice vote the "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," a bipartisan bill. This act instructs the U.S. to use its voice and vote to strongly support Taiwan's participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its involvement in economic oversight, technical assistance, and the eligibility of Taiwanese personnel to serve in the IMF. In response, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today, June 24, that this bill has positive implications for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan, and it will closely monitor the bill's further development.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which calls for the U.S. executive branch to assist Taiwan's participation in the IMF, was introduced and passed by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in March this year, and then passed by the full House on June 23 by voice vote. The bill was co-sponsored by Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Representative Al Green.

Congresswoman Kim stated that China continues to block Taiwan's participation in international forums like the IMF because it understands that financial security is as important as military security. China might try to disrupt Taiwan's financial system through measures such as increasing tariffs, shorting stock markets, or freezing bank transfers. Joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources to strengthen its financial resilience and resist China's economic coercion.

In response, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hsiao Kuang-wei said at a regular press conference this morning that the bill has positive significance for supporting Taiwan's broader international involvement and countering China's pressure. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for unanimously passing this bill, which not only fully demonstrates the strong bipartisan support from the U.S. Congress for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and expansion of its global presence, but also further highlights the importance of strengthening Taiwan's economic resilience and global partnerships.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that it will closely monitor the bill's subsequent developments and will maintain close coordination and communication with its congressional friends and the executive branch in the U.S. to continuously build positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act, after its passage in the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, it must be passed by the U.S. Senate with identical wording and then sent to the White House for the President's signature to officially become law. The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee already passed a similar bill in early June, awaiting a full Senate vote.

**China says Taiwan president spreading 'heresy' with sovereignty speech**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility and provocation, after a speech in which he said the island is "of course" a country and there is historical evidence and legal proof to back this up.

Beijing says democratically governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had intentionally distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions," it said in a statement.

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

Responding, Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said Lai was simply stating historical facts and Beijing's belief the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly said that only Taiwan's people can decide their future, and that, as the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Taiwan has over the past five years faced stepped-up military and political pressure from China, including war games.
