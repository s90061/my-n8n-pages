            <h1>Coast Guard Strengthens Patrols Before Nuclear Plant Referendum to Prevent Illegal Entry</h1>
            <p>The day before the referendum on the third nuclear power plant, the Coast Guard performed a strong search operation to stop illegal entry from affecting the election.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration's Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch said that tomorrow is the day for the referendum on the third nuclear power plant. To make sure the referendum goes smoothly, the three island areas of Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu started a "joint land and sea special operation" today. This is to stop people from other places from secretly entering and causing problems that could affect the election and make society unstable.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch also said in a press release that this special operation will focus on ports, coastal areas, empty houses, windbreak forests, and areas where Chinese boats often cross the border. They will also check boats more carefully to find any unusual signs early and deal with them quickly.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch stated that on the day of the referendum, they will keep a close eye on activities in the sea areas they control. They will make their land and sea patrols stronger and stay at their posts. They will work hard to stop illegal activities from outside Taiwan and inside Taiwan. This will help keep the country safe and society stable.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration asks people to call the "118" Coast Guard service line right away if they see anything suspicious in the sea or on the coast. The Coast Guard will respond immediately.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs Helps Companies Speed Up Generic Drug Development to Enter Global Market</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs is helping companies make and sell generic drugs faster to take a bigger share of the global market. Generic drugs are very important for the growth of the world's drug industry. To get more business, the Industrial Development Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has started a plan called "High-Value Drug Development and New Process Technology Expansion Program." This plan helps new drugs be developed and sold faster in Taiwan. It also makes Taiwan's drug industry more valuable and helps it compete better internationally.</p>
            <p>Last year, the global market for generic drugs was about 456.1 billion US dollars. It is expected to grow to 666.5 billion US dollars by 2029, with an average yearly growth of 7.9%.</p>
            <p>Today, the Industrial Development Agency shared in a press release that this program focuses on developing better new drugs (505(b)(2) products) and using new ways to make them. This helps companies create unique and difficult-to-make drugs faster. It also helps them sell these drugs quicker and enter the market better. At the same time, the program supports changes to the National Health Insurance Administration's rules for drug payments. The first two companies to make a generic drug can get special prices. This helps companies get the first drug license and seize business chances.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Development Agency pointed out that since 2023, 11 drug companies have joined the program. These include well-known Taiwanese companies like Yung Shin, Yulon, Standard, Sinphar, and Ammed. They are developing many different products, such as treatments for cancer, mental health drugs, and drugs for hormones and metabolism. One drug has already received a license, and five are currently waiting for approval. This shows that some valuable drugs are successfully being developed in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>For example, with help from the program, Yulon Biotech quickly moved from clinical trials to getting approval. They successfully made an immune-regulating, long-lasting tablet, which makes it easier for patients to take their medicine. Ammed Bio-Medical, a company that used to sell medical devices and now develops drugs, received help from expert groups and other resources. This year, they got the first license in Taiwan for Sugammadex, a drug that reverses the effects of muscle relaxants. This is a good example of how Taiwan is working to supply its own drugs.</p>
            <p>The Industrial Development Agency said that in the future, through plans like the "High-Value Drug Development and New Process Technology Expansion Program" and the "Industrial Innovation Platform," they will continue to encourage companies to do more research. They will also help companies use the skills of expert groups and resources from different areas. This will make the drug supply chain stronger and more ready for problems. They will also help Taiwan move from making generic drugs to exporting its own drug brands. This will help Taiwan's industry improve and connect with the world.</p>

            <h1>Trump Administration Loses Case: Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" Immigrant Center Ordered to Be Taken Down</h1>
            <p>A US federal judge has stopped the Trump administration and the Florida government from sending immigrants to a place called "Alligator Alcatraz." The judge also ordered most of the equipment to be taken down, which means the center is now closed.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Federal District Court Judge Kathleen Williams made this decision because environmental groups, "Friends of the Everglades" and "Center for Biological Diversity," had sued the Trump government.</p>
            <p>The Florida government quickly said they would appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>This immigrant holding center is in Florida's Everglades wetlands, where many alligators live. The center was built in an old airport in June. It was put up very quickly in just 8 days, using large white tents, bunk beds, and cage nets.</p>
            <p>Kristi Noem, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, once said that the center was made to hold 3,000 people.</p>
            <p>In July, US President Trump, who had promised to send millions of immigrants without papers away, visited the center. He praised the tough conditions there and even joked that alligators could act as guards.</p>
            <p>The White House also gave it the name "Alligator Alcatraz." This name was used because Trump had said he wanted to reopen the Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, California.</p>
            <p>Environmentalists and people who disagreed with Trump's strict immigration policies criticized this center in Florida. They thought the center was not kind to people.</p>
            <p>Environmental groups also said that the center was a danger to the delicate natural environment of the Everglades. They also said it was built too quickly without checking how it would affect the environment, which might be against the law.</p>
