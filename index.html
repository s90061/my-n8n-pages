**Han Kuang and Urban Resilience Exercises to Combine in July: Defense Officials Call for Awakening National Defense Awareness and Preparing for a Prolonged War**

Taiwan will combine two major exercises in July: the Han Kuang Exercise and the Urban Resilience Exercise. Simply put, in a situation where Taiwan faces potential conflict and the military is occupied with fighting, civilians must "save their own hometowns" if they encounter major disasters. National security officials stated that the goal for July is to inform the public that defense resilience is not solely the military's responsibility; every civilian partner, especially those in non-military sectors, must also become active. Through the combination of the Han Kuang and Urban Resilience exercises, the military's response to enemy forces and the non-military sectors' readiness will be integrated.

**Taiwan Railways Administration's First Price Hike in 30 Years! Fares Increase by 26.8%, Taipei to Zuoying Soars to NT$975**

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) will implement a comprehensive fare adjustment, the first in 30 years, with an average increase of 26.8%. The Tze-Chiang Limited Express fare from Taipei to Xinzuoying will be raised to NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will increase by NT$153. Local train fares from Taipei to Banqiao will go from NT$15 to NT$22. Luggage and parcel fees will also see an average increase of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays: if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund without a handling fee within one year. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to manage demand by price. Although TPASS will not be affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

**Chinese Tugboat "United Hai Gong 5001" Circled Taiwan for a Week; Coast Guard Monitored and Broadcasted Warnings**

During China's "Joint Combat Readiness Patrol," the Chinese tugboat "United Hai Gong 5001" circled Taiwan for a week from June 18th to 22nd. Its motives were unclear, raising questions from various sectors. The Coast Guard Administration stated that its radar monitored the vessel throughout its journey, and Coast Guard ships broadcasted warnings to drive it away. No illegal intentions were discovered. According to Taiwan ADIZ, the tugboat departed from China's Jiulong River waters on June 18th, sailed along the Penghu waters to southern Taiwan, and then circumnavigated the eastern waters off Hualien, reaching Taiwan.
