The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) has asked Joseph Wu, who works for national security, to leave his job. They say his helper shared secret information about Taiwan's relationships with other countries. This hurt Taiwan's safety a lot.

The parliament decided to discuss this idea further. The TPP said that the ruling party has had problems with spies, and Wu's helper was even accused of working with China. They believe Wu should be responsible and resign.

However, the ruling party said that the TPP also had staff involved in similar cases and asked why they didn't criticize their own party leaders. Both sides had strong arguments about who should be blamed for national security issues.

**News Title: Tesla Robot Production Stops, Robot Company Stocks Fall**

News says that Tesla's human-like robot, Optimus, has stopped being made. This is because there are problems with its design. After this news, the prices of stocks for companies that make robot parts also went down.

Tesla's car sales were also lower this quarter. The problems with Optimus include that its arm joints get too hot, its hands cannot lift enough weight, and its moving parts do not last long. Also, the robot's battery does not last long, and engineers have to control much of it remotely.

Experts say that besides the robot's production stopping, the strong New Taiwan Dollar also affects companies that make tools. This is something to watch out for.

**News Title: Netanyahu Visits Attack Site, Promises to Bring Back Hostages**

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, visited a farm called Nir Oz today. This was the first time he visited this place since Hamas fighters attacked it 21 months ago. Many people living there were killed or taken away.

Nir Oz was one of the places where Hamas took the most people during the attack in 2023. This attack started the war between Israel and Hamas. Netanyahu said he feels it is his duty to bring back all the people taken by Hamas. He said there are 20 people still alive, and some have died, but they will bring everyone back.

Israel has increased its military actions in Gaza, which has created a big problem for people living there. More than two million people have lost their homes. Even though Hamas said they are thinking about a new plan for peace, Israeli leaders are still strong in fighting Hamas. Netanyahu will meet with US President Trump to talk about a 60-day peace plan.
