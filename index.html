Experts are worried about how much time children spend looking at screens, like phones and tablets. Too much screen time can cause several problems for young people. For example, it can make it harder for children to sleep well at night. They might also become less active physically, which is important for their health. Spending too much time online can also affect how children interact with others in real life, making social situations more difficult. Doctors and researchers suggest that parents should limit the amount of time their children use screens. It’s important for kids to have a balance, spending time outside, playing with friends, and engaging in other activities that don’t involve screens. Finding this balance helps children grow up healthy and happy.

**The Growing Popularity of the Four-Day Work Week**

Many companies around the world are now trying out a new way of working: the four-day work week. This means employees work for four days instead of five, but they still get the same pay. This trend is becoming popular because it offers many advantages. For workers, it leads to a better balance between their job and their personal life. They feel less stressed and have more time for their hobbies, family, or simply to relax. For businesses, studies have shown that a four-day week can make employees more productive. Staff are often happier and healthier, which means they take fewer sick days and are less likely to leave their jobs. While it might not work for every type of job, many companies are finding that this new work schedule helps both their employees and their business succeed.
