            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Connects Companies to Help People Repair Homes</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest have caused a lot of damage to homes in southern Taiwan. Today, the Ministry of Transportation said that there are not enough workers or materials right now. So, the ministry has asked its different departments to help connect people with companies. They hope to help residents find workers to fix their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation posted on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po held a meeting yesterday. He brought together different departments to check on the repair work in the damaged areas of Tainan and plan for future work. So far, they have visited over 100 damaged homes. They are also looking at available workers and resources to fully help people rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation explained that because there are not enough workers and materials, people cannot find repair teams. They also lack workers and tools. The government has brought together different ministries and given each one an area to help. The Ministry of Transportation is responsible for Xinying District, Yanshui District, Baihe District, and Houbi District in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people who want to fix their homes should first register with their district chief. Then, the Ministry of Transportation will help connect different companies. Residents can then talk to these companies. After they agree, they will sign a simple contract. The Ministry of Transportation's main job is to connect people with companies; they do not pay for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make the repair work faster after the disaster, the Ministry of Transportation also set some rules for action. Besides connecting companies, they will first help fix old one-story houses and homes where the roof has come off, making them impossible to live in. This is for immediate help. Also, old materials like asbestos tiles will be collected in one place. Then, the district office will help remove them.</p>
