            <p>US stock markets all went up, and the Nasdaq index reached a new record high. Shares of TSMC in the US went up by 1.55%.

            <p>Experts in finance said that future defense shows and Apple's new product launches will also help keep the stock market busy and active.</p>
            <p>All four main US stock indexes closed higher on September 8th. The market hopes that good inflation numbers in the US will make the Federal Reserve lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 114.09 points, or 0.25%, to 45514.95 points. The S&P 500 index went up a little by 13.65 points, or 0.21%, to 6495.15 points.

            <p>To meet the growing demand for low-orbit satellites, Ascenda Hitech said it will keep making its factories bigger. New equipment at its Xizhi factory in Taiwan will be ready in October. Its factory in Vietnam will start working 24 hours a day in September. By the end of the year, the production capacity of both factories is expected to be double what it is now. This will help them deliver many orders in the future.</p>
            <p>Acer, a company that makes computers, announced that its total sales for August were about NT$21.804 billion. This is 4.5% less than last year, mainly because of changes in exchange rates. If calculated in US dollars, sales went up by 2.2% from last year. For the first eight months of this year, total sales were NT$171.739 billion, which is 0.31% less than last year. If calculated in US dollars, total sales went up by 2.7%.</p>
            <p>Adimmune Corporation said that after making the seasonal flu vaccines needed by the public this year, its production lines are still running. This is because there is a lot of demand for international cooperation. The company is now testing a second sterile injection filling line for Sanofi, a big vaccine company, which plans to double its production.</p>

            <h1>High Temperatures of 33 to 35 Degrees Celsius Across Taiwan; Beware of Afternoon Thunderstorms</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's weather agency said that today, most places will be cloudy to sunny. In the afternoon, there will be some short thunderstorms in the western part of Taiwan and in the mountains in the eastern part. There is still a chance of heavy rain in some mountain areas. For temperatures, most places will be between 33 and 35 degrees Celsius. Remember to drink a lot of water if you are outside.</p>
            <p>Temperatures will generally be between 33 and 35 degrees Celsius. However, areas like Greater Taipei, central and southern Taiwan, and Hualien might see temperatures of 36 degrees Celsius or higher. Please drink plenty of water if you are active outside.</p>
            <p>For the islands, Penghu will be cloudy with short periods of rain, with temperatures from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. Kinmen will be cloudy with short periods of rain, with temperatures from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. Matsu will be sunny to cloudy, with temperatures from 27 to 33 degrees Celsius. Before noon, Matsu might experience strong winds, with average speeds of level 6 or gusts stronger than level 8.</p>
            <p>The weather agency also warned that this is a time of very high tides for the year. The sea level will be higher than usual during high tide along the coast from Changhua to Chiayi and in Hualien. This might cause seawater to flow into low-lying areas near the coast, leading to problems with drainage and some local floods. Please do not stay in coastal areas, harbors, or tidal flats.</p>
            <p>Also, Typhoon Tapah, which was the 16th typhoon of the year, weakened into a tropical depression last night at 8 PM when it was near Guangdong. It will not affect the weather in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>According to the air quality forecast from the Ministry of Environment, the wind today will be from the south to southwest. The northern part of Taiwan will be downwind, so pollutants might build up a little more easily there. The air quality in Hsinchu-Miaoli, Central Taiwan, Yunlin-Chiayi-Nantou, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Yilan, Hualien-Taitung, and on the islands of Matsu, Kinmen, and Penghu will be "Good." The air quality in northern Taiwan will be "Normal."</p>

            <h1>Heathrow Airport Terminal 4 Closed Due to Safety Concerns, Then Reopens</h1>
            <p>London (CNA) â€“ Heathrow Airport's Terminal 4 in the United Kingdom was closed on Monday night. This happened because of a "possible dangerous item incident" in the check-in area. However, the airport announced a few hours later that the terminal was "safe and open again."</p>
            <p>Heathrow Airport management said on social media that emergency services checked Terminal 4 and confirmed it was safe. It is now open again, and they are working hard to make sure all flights leave as planned today.</p>
            <p>The London Fire Brigade said that the situation was cleared about three hours after they received a report about a "possible dangerous item incident" at the terminal.</p>
            <p>The fire brigade also said that medical staff from the London Ambulance Service checked about 20 people at the location.</p>
            <p>Heathrow is the main international airport in the UK and one of the busiest in the world. Terminal 4 is mainly used for flights to other parts of Europe and for long-distance flights.</p>
            <p>The Metropolitan Police Service later said in a statement that "no trace of any dangerous items was found."</p>
            <p>Even though Terminal 4 was closed for a short time, the other terminals at Heathrow Airport continued to work normally during the incident.</p>
            <p>The airport added, "We are very sorry for any trouble this caused. The safety of our passengers and staff is our most important concern."</p>
