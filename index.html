            <h1>Han Kuo-yu Goes to Taitung to Support Huang Chien-pin; Green Party Asks People to Vote for Recall</h1>
            <p>Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu was in Taitung City today to support Kuomintang (KMT) legislator Huang Chien-pin. He asked people to vote against recalling Huang. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in Taitung County said that "recalling Huang Chien-pin means recalling Fu Kun-chi" and asked people to vote for the recall.</p>
            <p>Former Taitung Mayor and current KMT County Councilor Chang Kuo-chou held a large event against the recall in Taitung City on Fengrong Road tonight. Han Kuo-yu, KMT Secretary-General Huang Chien-ting, and Taitung County Magistrate Rao Ching-ling all spoke. They asked the public to vote against the recall.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that more than 30 KMT legislators are facing recall votes, no matter if they are good or bad. He called this "political killing" and "killing everyone." He added that if a legislator was truly involved in corruption, everyone would agree to a recall. But today, the recall attempts are happening without clear reasons, which he called "political slaughter" instead of democracy.</p>
            <p>He also said that this kind of vote is "very unfair." He believes that the people of Taitung County should decide Huang Chien-pin's future in the next election.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin said that the support and encouragement from Taitung people give him strength to continue. He also apologized to supporters who faced problems from investigators because they helped him. He asked everyone to use their "no" vote on the recall to tell the ruling party that "we have good hearts and trust in ourselves."</p>
            <p>The DPP Taitung County Party Office sent a message. It listed what KMT legislator Fu Kun-chi has done in the Legislative Yuan. They urged people that July 26 is a very important day and they must go out and vote. They repeated that "recalling Huang Chien-pin means recalling Fu Kun-chi."</p>

            <h1>Credit Guarantee Fund Holds Meetings with Local Banks; First One Starts in Taipei</h1>
            <p>The Small and Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Fund (SMEG Fund) announced today that they will hold 10 meetings with local financial organizations from July to September. The first meeting started today in Taipei. Wei Ming-ku, the chairman of the SMEG Fund, said he hopes these meetings will make their work together stronger and improve how they talk to each other. This will help them make the guarantee process better and give out loans faster.</p>
            <p>This year is the 51st year for the SMEG Fund. By the end of June this year, the fund has helped over 800,000 small and medium-sized businesses get loans from banks. The total amount of money they have guaranteed is over 21.5 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, and the total amount of loans given is over 28 trillion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Wei Ming-ku said in a press release today that to truly help businesses in different areas and make it easier for small and medium enterprises to get loans, the SMEG Fund has meetings every year where they talk face-to-face. This helps them hear good ideas directly from banks so they can improve their services.</p>
            <p>To provide better local services and meet the needs of businesses in each area, Wei Ming-ku said that the SMEG Fund has opened a branch in Kaohsiung and is planning to open one in Taichung. They also hold many kinds of meetings all over Taiwan. These meetings help them talk more with local businesses, industry groups, and banks. This helps the SMEG Fund to be more connected to the local areas. They use local help to serve local businesses, helping more small and medium enterprises learn about and use the fund's support. This also helps banks and makes local economies grow.</p>
            <p>The SMEG Fund also said they are still helping with government plans. These include the "Credit Guarantee for Diverse Development Loans for Small and Micro Enterprises" and "Extra Guarantee Measures to Encourage Small and Medium Enterprises to Pay Employees More." This makes the SMEG Fund a strong support for businesses as they grow.</p>

            <h1>US Sends 5 Violent Criminals to Eswatini, Says Their Home Countries Refused Them</h1>
            <p>The US Department of Homeland Security announced today that it has sent five immigrants from countries in Asia and the Caribbean to the African country of Eswatini.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, these immigrants were from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen. The Department of Homeland Security said that they were found guilty of violent crimes, such as child sexual assault and murder.</p>
            <p>The Department of Homeland Security posted on X (formerly Twitter): "These illegal foreign people who committed crimes were so violent that their home countries did not want to take them back."</p>
            <p>Sometimes, a person who is sent away from the US is not accepted by their home country. Because of this, President Trump's government supported the idea of sending these people to a "third country." In June, the highest court in the US said that the government could start sending immigrants without papers to countries that are not their home countries again.</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, the US had already sent eight immigrants to South Sudan, a country that often has fighting. Among these eight men, two were from Cuba, two were from Myanmar, and one each was from Vietnam, Laos, Mexico, and South Sudan. US officials said all of them were found guilty of violent crimes.</p>
            <p>Since President Trump returned to the White House in January, he has taken many steps to deport immigrants without papers more quickly.</p>
