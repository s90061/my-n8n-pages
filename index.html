**U.S. House of Representatives Unanimously Passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act", Ministry of Foreign Affairs Responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives on June 23 orally and unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act." This act instructs the U.S. to use its voice and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its involvement in economic oversight, access to technical assistance, and the eligibility of Taiwanese personnel to serve in the IMF. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) today (June 24) stated that this bill holds positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and counteracting China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will closely monitor the future developments of this bill.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which calls on the U.S. executive branch to assist Taiwan's participation in the IMF, was proposed and passed by the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in March this year, and then orally passed by the full House unanimously on June 23. The bill was jointly introduced by Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Representative Al Green.

Representative Kim stated that China continues to obstruct Taiwan's participation in international forums such as the IMF because it understands that financial security is as crucial as military security. China could potentially disrupt Taiwan's financial system by raising tariffs, short-selling stocks, or freezing bank transfers. Joining the IMF would provide Taiwan with resources to strengthen its financial resilience and resist China's economic coercion.

In response, MOFA Spokesperson Joanne Ou stated at a regular press conference this morning that this bill holds positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and counteracting China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA thanked the U.S. House of Representatives for unanimously passing this bill, which not only fully demonstrates the firm support of bipartisan U.S. congressional members for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and expansion of international space, but also further highlights the importance of strengthening Taiwan's economic resilience and global partnerships.

MOFA stated that it will closely monitor the future developments of this bill and will maintain close coordination and communication with U.S. congressional friends and the executive branch to continuously enhance and accumulate positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," after its passage by the U.S. House of Representatives on June 23, it must pass an identical version in the U.S. Senate and then be signed by the President to officially become law. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee already passed a counterpart bill in early June, awaiting a full Senate vote.

**Taiwan is 'of course' a country, president says in rebuke to China**

<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan is "of course" a country and China lacks both the historical evidence and legal proof to back up its sovereignty claims, President Lai Ching-te said on Sunday in a strong rebuke to Beijing and its stepped up political and military pressure.

China says democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to the country since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a "separatist".

Giving the first of 10 speeches in a series called "uniting the country", Lai drew on Taiwan's history, including the millennia-long connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesians, like native Hawaiians, to show what he said was Taiwan's separate and distinct development from China.

Taiwan's people have a record of opposing invasion, like uprisings against Japan's 1895-1945 colonial rule, and under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for eight years, he added.

"Of course Taiwan is a country," he said at a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, pointing also to its presidential elections. "But China says no, that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan's Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. China says the 1971 United Nations resolution, which took away Taipei's seat in the body and gave it to Beijing, is one of the legal bases of its claims.

Lai, who in March called China a "hostile foreign force", said it was "totally wrong" for Beijing to say that U.N. resolution had anything to do with Taiwan's sovereignty as it was only about which government was represented at the body.

China's threat to Taiwan is real, added Lai, pointing to its daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he said, to a round of applause.

The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.
