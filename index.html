Many companies are now using artificial intelligence (AI) to help them hire new staff. They also use it to manage their current employees. This change is making a big difference in the world of work.

AI tools can quickly read many job applications. They can find good candidates and even do early interviews. This technology aims to make hiring quicker and fairer. It tries to reduce human biases that can happen during the hiring process.

However, experts say that AI systems can sometimes have their own biases if they are not made carefully. They might also miss important human skills that data cannot easily measure. Companies are working to make sure these systems are fair and effective.

Besides hiring, companies use AI for employee training. It can create personal learning plans and check how well people are doing. This is changing daily work and how careers grow. It means employees might learn new skills faster and get more personalized feedback.

**Extreme Weather Affects Daily Life and Culture**

The world is seeing more very hot weather and strong floods. These events are making daily life hard for many people. They are also changing cultural practices around the world.

In cities, people are changing buildings and public places to stay cool or safe from water. For example, some cities are adding more green spaces or special pavements that absorb water. This helps communities deal with the new weather patterns.

Work times are also changing. Some people start work earlier to avoid the hottest parts of the day. This helps them stay safe and productive during extreme heat. It shows how daily routines are adapting to the changing Earth.

Cultural events and outdoor activities are now often moved to different times or inside. Festivals, sports events, and gatherings might need to be planned differently to protect people from the weather. People are understanding more about climate change. There is also a bigger push for communities to become stronger and help each other during these times.

**Slow Travel Trend Offers Deeper Cultural Experiences**

After years of quick tourism, a new way to travel called 'slow travel' is becoming popular. This way means spending more time in one place. The goal is to really experience local culture, help the environment, and feel better.

Instead of quickly seeing many famous places, slow travelers often stay longer in one area. They use local buses or trains, eat local food, and join in local activities. This allows them to connect more deeply with the people and traditions of the place they visit.

This change affects local businesses and the daily lives of people living there. When tourists stay longer and spend money locally, it helps the community directly. It also helps visitors have a more real cultural exchange. It's more than just being a tourist; it's about becoming a temporary part of the local daily life.`;
