            <h1>Hsinchu City Waldorf School Found Other School's Trash Buried On Site; KMT Council Members Ask for Fast Investigation</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Hsinchu City, July 24) Today, council members from the Kuomintang (KMT) in Hsinchu City said that Hsinchu City Waldorf Experimental School might have buried waste from other school building projects. The company that built these schools, Jucia Construction, did all the work. The council members are asking prosecutors to investigate quickly. The Hsinchu City Government said they have reported the company and are asking for money for the damage.</p>
            <p>Reporters called Jucia Construction, but no one answered. We did not get a reply before this news was finished.</p>
            <p>Today, the KMT group in the Hsinchu City Council held a press conference. Chen Ching-Ling, the group leader, said that they found construction waste and papers from Yuxian Junior High School under the grass at Hsinchu City Waldorf School. Jucia Construction built both schools. They think that a high-ranking city official must have allowed this to happen.</p>
            <p>Wu Hsu-Feng, a KMT council member, asked investigators to quickly find out if the past city government team did anything illegal, like giving special benefits to someone. He said they should not blame everything on the construction company.</p>
            <p>Yang Ling-Yi, a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) council member in Hsinchu City, said that KMT council members again said they "dug up a big treasure." She suggested that the city government should dig up all city structures left by the previous government. She also said they should send the soil to a US lab, not just give it to investigators.</p>
            <p>The DPP group in the Hsinchu City Council said that investigators are already looking into both the Hsinchu Baseball Stadium and the Waldorf Elementary School. They asked KMT and Taiwan People's Party council members to respect the law. The DPP's position has always been the same: if there is any corruption or wrongdoing, investigators should be fair and not let anyone escape punishment.</p>
            <p>The Hsinchu City Government's Public Works Department replied in writing. They said they are currently digging up only a part of the Waldorf site. So, they can only make judgments based on the evidence they see. If they need to dig up a larger area in the future and find more waste that shows where it came from, they will give the evidence to the right authorities for investigation.</p>
            <p>The Public Works Department said that they have reported Jucia Construction for possibly burying waste at the Waldorf site. They are also asking for money in a civil lawsuit. They hope that investigators can quickly look into this to prevent the company from destroying evidence or selling their assets. This would make it impossible to get money back and would hurt people's rights. (Editor: Fang Pei-Ching) July 24, 2025.</p>

            <h1>High Demand for AI Makes SK Hynix's Second Quarter Profit a New Record</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Seoul, July 24, from foreign reports) Today, SK Hynix, a big chip company in South Korea, announced the highest profit it has ever made in a single quarter. This happened because the demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) went up a lot.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that SK Hynix is the second-largest maker of memory chips in the world. They are the main company that makes HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) chips. They are also an important supplier to the big American company Nvidia.</p>
            <p>SK Hynix said that their operating profit in the second quarter went up by almost 70%. It reached 9.21 trillion Korean Won (about 197.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars). Their total sales were 22.23 trillion Korean Won. Both these numbers are the highest they have ever been.</p>
            <p>Before this news, TSMC, a big chip company in Taiwan, announced last week that its net profit in the second quarter rose quickly. This was more than what experts expected. This happened mainly because of the strong demand for AI technology, even though there is a risk of the US putting tariffs (extra taxes) on important chip parts.</p>
            <p>SK Hynix also said that their net profit increased by almost 70% compared to the same time last year. It reached 6.99 trillion Korean Won.</p>
            <p>The company's profits went up because they sold more DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and NAND flash memory chips than they thought they would.</p>
            <p>South Korea sends a lot of goods to the US. Its two main industries, chips and cars, might face big problems if US President Trump puts a 25% tax on them, as he has threatened to do.</p>
            <p>A top manager at SK Hynix said that because the US keeps threatening to limit chip sales to China, customers are buying chips earlier to "avoid outside risks." This has actually created "a better situation than first expected."</p>
            <p>SK Hynix said that even though there are tense political situations between countries, their production has "not changed." (Translator: Chen Yu-ting / Editor: Lee Pei-shan) July 24, 2025.</p>

            <h1>The Taiwan Food Exhibition's Agriculture Hall Has 6 Main Sections; "Chopstick Style" Invites You to Travel Through Flavors</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 24) The "2025 Taiwan Food Exhibition" will start on August 1st at Taipei World Trade Center Hall 1. The Ministry of Agriculture has planned the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall." Its theme is "Travel with Flavors â€“ Eating in Farm, Mountain, and Fishing Villages with Chopstick Style." At the event, you can taste delicious food and also buy good products from farms all over Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Agriculture held a press conference. They introduced the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall," which is at the Taiwan Food Exhibition for the 10th year. It has 6 main areas: "Flavor Legacy," "Fine Taste Gifts," "Smart Farming Beauty," "Trendy Getaway," "Chopstick Style," and "Food Shine."</p>
            <p>Huang Chao-Chin, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, said that since 2016 (year 105 in the Republic of China calendar), the Ministry of Agriculture has set up the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall" at the Taiwan Food Exhibition every year. This is to show farm products from all over Taiwan to buyers. They also teach people about food, from where it is grown to the dining table. This year, they have brought together traditional dishes from "Tian Mama" (Field Mother) chefs all over Taiwan, products from young farmers, seafood and meat products, and food and farm tours. There are also over one hundred local foods and gifts from rural areas. People can taste the flavors of Taiwan, learn about its land and culture, and understand Taiwan's farming and local life through this food journey.</p>
            <p>"Tian Mama" dishes are the main highlight of this year's "Taiwan Agriculture Hall." Among them, "Tian Mama Chang-Ying Seafood House" was listed in the Michelin Bib Gourmand for three years in a row, from 2022 to 2024. This restaurant will show how to make its famous dish, "Milkfish Fillet."</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chia-Hsin is the fourth generation of "Chang-Ying Seafood House." Since she was little, she watched her family raise and sell fish in Beimen, Tainan. She also cooked in the restaurant kitchen. So, she studied tourism and food service in college. After graduating, she came back home to help with the family business. She said that after joining "Tian Mama" 12 years ago, she learned better how to show the special qualities of their products. She learned to connect food with stories about where it came from. Now, they also offer tours that teach about food and farming.</p>
            <p>Among other "Tian Mama" products at the exhibition, "Natural Tea Farm" from New Taipei received a three-star rating for its traceable restaurant for five years in a row, from 2020 to 2024. It also won the "British Food Award." There is also "Fuli Farmers' Association â€“ Fuli He-Feng," which was chosen as one of Taiwan's 12 most popular rice brands in 2023. And "Original Dream Tourist Farm" won a bronze medal at the Taiwan International Culinary and Food Challenge.</p>
            <p>Su Mao-Hsiang, the acting head of the Ministry of Agriculture's Rural Development and Soil and Water Conservation Agency, said that the Ministry of Agriculture started the "Tian Mama" brand in 2001, when it was still the Council of Agriculture. This brand helps women in farming villages make special dishes using local foods and local culture. Right now, there are 104 "Tian Mama" shops across Taiwan. Their sales grow every year, and last year, they reached 720 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Su Mao-Hsiang also said that this year, the "Taiwan Agriculture Hall" will give a NT$50 food coupon for every NT$500 spent. The biggest prize is a farm tour coupon for four people worth NT$16,000. Other prizes include special stay coupons worth NT$6,000, one-day food and farm tours, and "Tian Mama" meal coupons. The total value of all prizes is NT$500,000. (Editor: Chen Ren-Hua) July 24, 2025.</p>
