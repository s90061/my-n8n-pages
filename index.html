            <h1>US Conservative Internet Star Kirk Shot Dead; Suspect Arrested, Family Explains Why</h1>
            <p>A conservative internet star from the US, Charlie Kirk, was recently shot and killed. This shocked people across America. Authorities confirmed today that the person who shot him has been caught. They also showed a photo of the suspect's arrest. The suspect is a 22-year-old man from Utah named Tyler Robinson. His family said he became "more political" in recent years.</p>
            <p>Kirk was giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Utah when he was shot in the neck. He was 31 years old. A video from the event showed him speaking to a crowd. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and he fell into his chair. The camera quickly moved away, and the people watching became very scared.</p>
            <p>Kirk was a big supporter of Donald Trump. He was also a well-known person on the internet and a leader for young conservatives. He had millions of followers on social media. People liked him because he made clever videos and was good at handling people who tried to stop his speeches or argued against his ideas.</p>
            <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced today in a press conference that they had caught Tyler Robinson, the suspect who allegedly shot Kirk.</p>
            <p>News organizations like CNN and NBC News reported that police said Robinson is 22 years old and lives in Utah.</p>
            <p>Cox explained, "On the evening of September 11, a family member of Robinson got in touch with a family friend. This friend then told the Washington County Sheriff's Office that Robinson had told them or hinted that he was the person involved."</p>
            <p>He also said that Robinson's family told police that Robinson had become "more political" recently. A family member remembered that at a dinner, Robinson had talked about Kirk coming to Utah Valley University and why he did not like Kirk and his ideas.</p>
            <p>Robinson reportedly told his family that he believed "Kirk was full of hate and spread hate."</p>
            <p>CNN reported that police officers said Robinson's father recognized his son from the photos the police shared. He called a young pastor for help, and this pastor later contacted marshals, who then arrested the suspect.</p>

            <h1>To Punish Russian Oil Buyers: US Wants G7 Allies to Tax China and India 100%</h1>
            <p>The United States will ask its allies in the Group of Seven (G7) to put a very high tax, up to 100%, on Russian oil bought by China and India. This is an effort to make Russia's President Vladimir Putin stop the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News saw the US's plan. The US will also suggest that G7 allies find legal ways to take Russia's money that has been frozen. They are thinking about using this money to pay for Ukraine's defense.</p>
            <p>Russia has about 300 billion US dollars (about 9.1 trillion New Taiwan dollars) in frozen money. Most of this money is in Europe.</p>
            <p>Canada, which is currently leading the G7 group, will hold a meeting for finance ministers today. They will talk about doing more to put pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>According to the US plan, America wants to make China and India pay a secondary tax of 50% to 100%. It also wants to limit trade to stop Russia from selling energy and getting technology that can be used for both military and non-military purposes.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately reply to Bloomberg's request for comments.</p>

            <h1>US and UK Warships Sail Through Taiwan Strait; Chinese Military Calls It Harassment</h1>
            <p>China's Eastern Theater Command announced tonight that the US destroyer USS Higgins and the UK frigate HMS Richmond sailed through the Taiwan Strait today. China's military called this "harassment and provocation."</p>
            <p>Colonel Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command, said that their naval and air forces watched the ships very closely the entire time they passed through. He added that they handled the situation well.</p>
            <p>Shi Yi also said that the actions of the US and UK sent a wrong message and harmed the peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He stated that the Eastern Theater Command's troops are always highly ready to protect China's right to rule and to keep peace and stability in the area.</p>
            <p>Before this, on September 6, the Canadian navy warship HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec and the Australian missile destroyer HMAS Brisbane also sailed through the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this showed that these two countries are serious about keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>On August 13, the USS Higgins went into the Scarborough Shoal area in the South China Sea. This happened after Chinese and Philippine ships had a serious standoff there on August 11.</p>
            <p>In September 2021, the HMS Richmond also sailed through the Taiwan Strait to show its right to sail freely in international waters.</p>
