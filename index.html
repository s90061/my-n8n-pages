            <h1>Super Typhoon Koinu Nears Luzon, Philippines Closes Work and Schools</h1>
            <p>Super Typhoon Koinu is bringing strong winds and heavy rain. The Philippines is the first country to be affected. Schools and offices are closed in Metro Manila and many provinces. The typhoon is slowly moving northwest. It will later reach southern China. Hong Kong authorities are thinking about closing the airport for a short time.</p>
            <p>Based on reports, the Philippine weather agency said that Koinu is now moving northwest and getting stronger. It is expected to hit the less populated Batanes or Babuyan islands by this afternoon at the earliest. Its path will go through the Luzon Strait.</p>
            <p>The Philippine weather agency stated that as of 11 PM yesterday, the strongest continuous wind speed at the center of Koinu was 205 kilometers per hour. Gusts reached up to 250 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The Philippine government closed offices and schools today in Metro Manila and 29 provinces. Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla said that local officials must quickly move people away from dangerous areas.</p>
            <p>Weather forecasters warn that there will be big power outages as the outer part of the typhoon hits northern Luzon. There will also be landslides and dangerous sea conditions. More than 10 domestic flights in the Philippines have been canceled, mostly flights to Luzon. Ferry services at ports have also stopped.</p>
            <p>The Hong Kong Observatory said yesterday that Hong Kong's weather will "get worse slowly" starting tomorrow. The strong winds and big waves will be similar to those of Super Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018.</p>
            <p>Koinu continues to move towards the southern coast of China and is expected to hit Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government has asked people to get ready. They are also thinking about closing the airport for 36 hours. This is expected to be one of the strongest typhoons to hit Hong Kong in many years.</p>

            <h1>Household Electricity Price Increase: Lu Shiow-yen Says It Should Be Carefully Considered to Avoid Making Things Worse for People</h1>
            <p>Regarding the coming increase in household electricity prices, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that prices are very high now, and industries are also facing great difficulties. She believes that public companies should be careful when raising their prices. She worries that this will make things even harder for people.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs held its second electricity price review meeting for 2025 on September 19. After thinking about the effects of tariffs, what people can afford, and how to make the electricity price system better, the average electricity price was increased by 0.71%. The price per kilowatt-hour went up from 3.7556 NTD to 3.7823 NTD.</p>
            <p>For industrial electricity, the price will not change. It will stay at 4.27 NTD per kilowatt-hour. The government will also continue to help industries that are struggling by lowering or not changing their prices. However, for household electricity, the price for each level will be slightly adjusted, with an average increase of 3.12%.</p>
            <p>After an event this morning, Lu Shiow-yen spoke to reporters about the electricity price increase. She said that electricity prices have been raised many times in the last two or three years. Even though each increase was small, when you add them all up, the total amount is very big.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen said that prices in Taiwan are very high right now, and trade rules between countries are changing. Raising prices at this time, she worries, will feel like "adding frost to snow" for people. In this situation, she thinks the government should consider how to help different businesses and people get through these hard times.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen believes that when prices are high and industries are in great trouble, public companies should be very careful about raising their rates. She said that raising prices during normal times is fine, but when the economy is difficult and prices are already going up, making adjustments then will make people feel that things are much worse. She stated that this period is very hard for both households and businesses.</p>
