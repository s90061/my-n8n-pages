            <h1>Asian Stock Markets Have Mixed Results as People Watch US Company Reports and Trade Talks</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, July 22 (Central News Agency) - Asian stock markets had mixed results today. Traders are looking at the financial reports from US companies this week. They are also following the progress of trade talks in the US, as a pause in tariffs will end next week.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, most major US stock indexes closed higher yesterday. The S&P 500 index went over 6300 points for the first time, and the Nasdaq Composite index reached a new high. After this, investors became more careful.</p>
            <p>Stock prices kept going up because people in the market expect that major US trade partners will reach an agreement with Washington. This is to avoid high tariffs that President Trump put in place before the tariff pause ends on August 1st.</p>
            <p>Trump first shocked global markets with high, equal tariffs on April 2nd. But he later extended the deadline for these tariffs two times. Because of this, the market reacted less strongly to Trump's later threats. Investors think he will eventually give in again.</p>
            <p>This week, the market will also focus on the financial reports of some big global companies. These include Tesla, Alphabet (Google's parent company), General Motors (GM), Intel, and Coca-Cola.</p>
            <p>In Asian stock markets, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, and Manila stock markets closed higher. But Tokyo, Seoul, Wellington, Taipei, and Jakarta stock markets closed lower. (Translator: Chen Cheng-chien/Editor: Liu Shu-chin) 1140722</p>

            <h1>Taipower Worker Li Yuan-han Dies After Electric Shock, Prosecutors Say It Was an Accident</h1>
            <p>Chiayi City, July 22 (Central News Agency) - Li Yuan-han, a worker from Taipower who was shocked by electricity, was saved for many days. His family decided to take him off life support and donate his organs this morning. The Chiayi District Prosecutors Office checked his body and decided that he died because of a high-voltage electric shock accident. He had many high-voltage electrical injuries on his body, and finally died because his brain lacked oxygen. This was an accidental death.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused power outages in many areas in southern Taiwan. Li Yuan-han was fixing the power and got an electric shock. He was in critical condition. After many days of trying to save him, he did not get better. So, his family decided today to let Li Yuan-han go and donate his organs.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi District Prosecutors Office checked his body this afternoon. They decided that Li Yuan-han died because of a high-voltage electric shock. This caused many high-voltage electrical injuries, burns on both upper arms and the front of his chest, rhabdomyolysis, and serious kidney failure. He finally died from a brain injury caused by lack of oxygen. The way he died was an accident.</p>
            <p>Hundreds of Taipower workers gathered at the Chiayi Power Distribution Center today. They cried as they said goodbye to Li Yuan-han and shouted, "Yuan-han, your work is done. Go in peace."</p>
            <p>Chiayi Mayor Huang Min-hui felt sad about Li Yuan-han's death. She said she remembered going to the hospital to support Li Yuan-han that day. His father showed photos of Li Yuan-han at work. She saw him smiling brightly, with eyes full of passion. This showed his love for his job and his deep care for his family.</p>
            <p>Huang Min-hui said that Li Yuan-han's father said at that time, "A soldier cannot choose his battlefield." So, Li Yuan-han worked many days on the front lines, fixing things, only to protect this land.</p>
            <p>Huang Min-hui stated that many people are sad about Li Yuan-han leaving. And his decision to donate organs shows that love continues. "Thank you, Yuan-han. We will always remember your hard work and your help in protecting this land." (Editor: Lin Shu-hui) 1140722</p>
