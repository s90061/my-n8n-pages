            <h1>StreetPay Financial Technology: We Did Nothing Wrong; Will Sue if Taisun Continues to Harm Without Talking</h1>
            <p>Taisun company sued StreetPay Financial Technology for 3.6 billion New Taiwan dollars in investment money. The first court decision said Taisun won. The second court meeting is on July 28. StreetPay Financial Technology said today through its lawyer that it used the money correctly and did nothing wrong. It also said that setting up StreetPay Online Finance has nothing to do with the first court decision.</p>
            <p>StreetPay Financial Technology said it wants to talk to Taisun but has not received a reply. StreetPay e-Payment, a company under StreetPay Financial Technology, is about to start making money. But Taisun chose to attack them through the media, which greatly hurts StreetPay e-Payment. If Taisun still refuses to talk and keeps harming StreetPay Financial Technology, StreetPay Financial Technology might sue Taisun for financial losses.</p>
            <p>StreetPay Financial Technology's lawyer made these points today:</p>
            <p>1. The agreement between StreetPay Financial Technology and Taisun company was an "investment contract." So, StreetPay Financial Technology used the investment money for the whole StreetPay group's development. Everything was done legally.</p>
            <p>2. In August 2023, Taisun company sued StreetPay Financial Technology, asking for the investment money back. Because of this lawsuit, the stock exchange thought StreetPay Financial Technology's ownership was unclear and refused its plan to be listed on the stock market. To meet the shareholders' hope for a stock market listing, StreetPay Online Financial Technology Co., Ltd. (StreetPay Online Finance) was created. This new company plans to be the main company for the listing, with StreetPay Financial Technology as its biggest owner. This plan has been ongoing and reported to the stock exchange. It has no connection to the first court decision between StreetPay Financial Technology and Taisun company.</p>
            <p>3. StreetPay Financial Technology has always been open to talking with Taisun company to fix the problem, but Taisun company has never replied. Now, Taisun company still doesn't want to talk and keeps using the media to spread false information that hurts StreetPay Financial Technology and its companies. StreetPay Financial Technology cannot understand why Taisun is doing this. Taisun company's actions are not normal for a business and do not help all Taisun company shareholders. StreetPay Financial Technology still hopes to solve the problem and offered a solution to Taisun company on July 17, 2025, but has not heard back from Taisun company yet.</p>
            <p>4. StreetPay e-Payment, a company under StreetPay Financial Technology, has been doing well for a long time and remains the top e-payment company. In the first half of this year, it only lost 19 million New Taiwan dollars, meaning it is almost making a profit. Its future looks good. Taisun company chose to attack them through the media instead of talking, which has seriously hurt StreetPay e-Payment. If Taisun company still refuses to talk and keeps harming StreetPay Financial Technology, StreetPay Financial Technology might sue Taisun company for financial losses.</p>
            <p>5. About the lawsuit between StreetPay Financial Technology and Taisun company, StreetPay Financial Technology repeats that it did nothing wrong and does not agree with the reasons for the first court decision. These reasons do not help solve the problem. The second court meeting will start on July 28. StreetPay Financial Technology hopes that the court will be fair to it, as it has worked hard and done nothing wrong. (Edited by Chang Liang-chih) 20250724</p>

            <h1>Education Minister Condemns "Savage Bandits" After China Snaps Congratulatory Message from Taekwondo Team at World University Games</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Taekwondo team won a silver medal at the World University Games, but two Chinese people tried to take away a congratulatory message from the Education Minister. Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao said today that China often bothers Taiwanese athletes. He called their actions "savage" and like "bandits." He said such things should not happen in a modern, democratic country.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Taekwondo team won a silver medal today at the World University Games in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. After they won, two Chinese people tried to take away the congratulatory message from the Education Minister that the athletes had. They also argued with Taiwanese reporters.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao was at an event today for high school principals. Before the event, he spoke to reporters about this matter and strongly criticized China's actions.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao said that China has often acted badly at international sports events, always making the "Olympic model" rules too strict. Taiwan rented a place in Germany from a private group to give athletes physical therapy and help them relax. China still protested about this. Later, Taiwan's representative in Germany, Hsieh Chih-wei, talked to the mayor of the host city, and the mayor said sorry.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked how Cheng Ying-yao felt when he heard about the message being taken. After thinking for a while, he said his first feeling was anger. He called the action "savage" and like "bandits." He asked how such a thing could happen in a modern, democratic country.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao also mentioned that during the World University Games, students and Taiwanese people living abroad cheered "Go Taiwan!" This also caused a bad reaction from Chinese staff. He said that at a sports event with athletes from all over the world, people should applaud and honor the athletes. Sports fields should not be places for political fights. He said this must be strongly condemned, and he hopes the event organizers will punish China in some way.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao said that Premier Cho Jung-tai praised the Sports Administration for how they handled the situation in a meeting this morning. Cheng Ying-yao also thanked the Taiwanese reporters who helped stop the Chinese people when the incident happened. (Edited by Lee Shu-hua) 20250724</p>

            <h1>Some Recall Polling Stations Changed on July 26; Election Commission Suggests 3 Ways to Check Location</h1>
            <p>The recall vote on July 26 is coming soon. There are rumors online that some voting places in Taichung have been moved to far-away areas. Today, the Central Election Commission said that there are 5,947 voting places in 9 counties and cities across the country. Some voting places have indeed changed. People can check the location in three ways: by looking at their voting notice, checking online, or asking their local office. They should confirm the location before going to vote.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission announced today in a press release that the recall votes for 24 Kuomintang lawmakers and Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is suspended from her duties, will take place on July 26. Voting will be from 8 AM to 4 PM. People should bring their national ID card, personal seal, and voting notice. They should go to the voting place listed on their voting notice.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission also said that people can find a "voting place lookup service" on its official website. People can check the location, full address, and Google map of their voting place online, or they can ask their local township, city, or district office about the voting place.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission said that on July 26, 5,947 voting places will be set up in 9 counties and cities across the country. Most of these places are the same as those used for the 2024 presidential, vice presidential, and legislative elections. However, voting places are borrowed temporarily, and their locations change slightly each time. If the usual place cannot be used, the local township, city, or district office will find a suitable place nearby, considering what is easy for people and what they are used to.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission pointed out that because it is summer, some school buildings are being repaired or used for activities during this time. This is why some voting place locations have changed slightly.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission stated that for voting places that are not in the same location as the last election, it has asked city and county election committees to work with local offices. They should use community broadcasts, social media, and local TV scrolling messages to tell people about the changes. The day before the vote, they must put up signs at the old voting place or nearby to show the new location. On voting day, a special person must be at the old voting place to tell or guide voters to the new location. (Edited by Zhai Ssu-chia) 20250724</p>
