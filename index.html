            <h1>US Tennessee Explosives Factory Explosion Reported: Multiple Deaths and Missing</h1>
            <p>A dangerous explosion happened today at a factory in Tennessee, USA, where explosives are made. Emergency workers went to the site to help. Officials told people to stay away from the area. Reports say that many people have died and some are missing.</p>
            <p>The sheriff's office in Hickman County, Tennessee, wrote on Facebook, "We can confirm that there was an explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems, an explosives factory in the Bucksnort area."</p>
            <p>The sheriff's office also said, "Emergency workers are now at the scene. Please avoid this area so that rescue workers can do their jobs well."</p>
            <p>The Hickman County mayor's office told AFP that they could not quickly say if anyone had died or what caused the explosion.</p>
            <p>However, US media reported that Sheriff Chris Davis of Humphreys County said the explosion caused "several deaths" and that many other people are missing.</p>
            <p>NBC News quoted Davis saying, "Several people are still not found. We are trying our best to consider the feelings of their families. We can confirm that some people have indeed died."</p>
            <p>Accurate Energetic Systems is a company that makes explosives. It started in 1980. The company has not yet answered AFP's questions for comments.</p>

            <h1>US Government Shutdown Crisis Worsens: White House Announces Mass Layoffs of Federal Employees</h1>
            <p>To end the US government shutdown, President Donald Trump is putting more pressure on the Democratic Party. Today, the White House announced that it has started letting go of many federal workers.</p>
            <p>The problem with the US federal government running out of money is now entering its third week, and there are no signs of it getting better. Russ Vought, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), confirmed on social media that the government has indeed started to lay off some of the 750,000 public workers who were forced to take unpaid leave.</p>
            <p>The OMB told AFP that a "significant" number of people would be laid off. However, they did not give an exact number or say which departments would be most affected.</p>
            <p>Trump has often said that he sees these layoffs as a way to put more pressure on the Democrats. A few days ago, Trump said he would meet with Vought to decide which government parts "he suggested should be cut" and to discuss if these "cuts would be temporary or permanent."</p>
            <p>Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Democratic minority in the Senate, and Hakeem Jeffries, the leader of the Democrats in the House of Representatives, both said that Trump's threat of layoffs is a scare tactic. They also said that large-scale layoffs would not stand up in court.</p>
            <p>For public workers who still have their jobs, the problem of unpaid leave will continue as long as the federal government shutdown continues. This money problem is expected to last until at least the middle of next week.</p>
            <p>To make things worse, about 1.3 million active US military members are expected to not get paid for the first time on October 15. This has never happened before in modern US history during a government shutdown.</p>
            <p>The two main parties in the US Congress could not agree on Trump's budget plan before midnight on September 30. This caused many non-essential parts of the federal government to close down from 12:00 AM on October 1.</p>
            <p>The main issue is that the Republican Party refused to include rules in the bill for medical aid that is ending soon. This aid helps 24 million Americans afford health care.</p>
            <p>With the shutdown possibly lasting longer, some lawmakers have asked Trump to help solve the problem. However, Trump has mostly focused on the Gaza ceasefire agreement and sending federal troops to cities like Chicago and Portland, which are run by Democrats, to carry out many evictions.</p>
            <p>House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said, "Trump has time to play golf, but he doesn't have time to negotiate a deal between parties to reopen the government... and House Republicans are still on a three-week break."</p>

            <h1>Switzerland Hopes to Sign New Free Trade Agreement with China Early Next Year to Expand Tax-Exempt Scope</h1>
            <p>After talking with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi today, Switzerland's Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said that Switzerland wants to sign an updated free trade agreement with China by early 2026.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that China is Switzerland's third-biggest trading partner, after the United States and the European Union. The current free trade agreement started in 2014. In August, the US put high taxes on Swiss products, which made it even more important for Switzerland and China to update their free trade agreement.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Cassis told reporters in Bellinzona, "We are happy to see good progress in talks to update the free trade agreement. Both sides want to finish this work quickly."</p>
            <p>He added, "Even though we probably won't reach an agreement by the end of this year as we hoped, we now aim to create a more open, fair trade environment that follows international free trade rules by early next year."</p>
            <p>China and Switzerland signed a free trade agreement in 2013. However, some Swiss products, like watches and medicines, still face high taxes in China. China also wants to get more investments from Switzerland. The original agreement also had limited rules for opening up the service industry.</p>
            <p>In the past, talks to update the free trade agreement stopped for a while because people were worried about China's human rights record.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Switzerland has been working to get closer to other trade partners. This helps them spread out risks and find new places to sell their goods.</p>
            <p>In July this year, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein, signed a free trade agreement with countries in South America's MERCOSUR group. This agreement covers 95% of Switzerland's exports. Last year, EFTA also signed a deal with India to lower export taxes on products like medicines, machines, watches, and optical instruments.</p>
