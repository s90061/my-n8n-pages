            <h1>U.S. Ambassador to Panama: China's Influence in Canal Area Weakens but Threat Remains Big</h1>
            <p>On July 16, Kevin Cabrera, the U.S. Ambassador to Panama, said that China's influence in the Panama Canal area has become smaller. This happened because the United States and Panama worked together. However, he also warned that China still has a "bad influence" and creates strategic risks in the area.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Cabrera started his job in Panama in April this year. At that time, there was a political problem in Panama. This was because U.S. President Trump spoke strongly about the Panama Canal's control, even saying he would send soldiers to take it back.</p>
            <p>Three months after starting his role, Ambassador Cabrera spoke to a Panama newspaper called "LA PRENSA." He said that the U.S. and Panama are working every day to remove China's influence from the Panama Canal area. He added that China reducing its work on ports and buildings there is a chance for the U.S. and Panama to make their friendship stronger.</p>
            <p>However, Cabrera also pointed out that Panama still faces problems from China's government. These problems are not just about trade. They are also about China's plan to gain power in Central America.</p>
            <p>The U.S. put a lot of pressure on China. Because of this, in March, a company owned by Hong Kong's richest person, Li Ka-shing, decided to sell 43 of its ports outside of China. These included Balboa Port and Cristobal Port, which are at each end of the Panama Canal. At the same time, the Panama government started checking if the company running these two ports was doing anything illegal.</p>
            <p>Cabrera said that a first report from Panama's audit office showed that the "Panama Ports Company" owed the government more than 600 million U.S. dollars for many years. He said this money could have been used to build schools, fix roads, or build clinics. Cabrera also said it's not just a money problem. He mentioned that the Chinese government has recently been accused of cyberattacks in countries like Paraguay, Costa Rica, and the Czech Republic. This shows that China is not a friend, but a bad threat and influence.</p>
            <p>The problem with the Panama Canal caused leaders from the U.S. and Panama to argue, making their relationship tense. When asked if U.S. President Trump might talk with Panama's President Jose Raul Mulino, Cabrera said it is "very likely they will get along well."</p>
            <p>Even though Trump often said he would take back the Panama Canal by force, which made Panama's government unhappy, the U.S. Southern Special Operations Command (SOCSOUTH) signed an agreement with Panama's Ministry of Security in March. This was to work together against China's threat. The U.S. sent special forces to train with Panama's military and police. They also continue to do military exercises to protect the canal.</p>
            <p>From July 13 to 18, the U.S. Southern Special Operations Command and Panama's military also had a joint exercise called "PANAMAX-Alpha." This exercise was to help protect the Panama Canal and other important buildings from security threats. In the first part, they used two UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and one CH-47 helicopter. The exercises took place at three military bases in Panama. They included special forces practicing searching ships, quickly rappelling down ropes, rescuing people with lifts, and communicating from sea platforms.</p>
            <p>Panama's National Naval Air Service (SENAN) also said that these exercises will help Panama's forces and other countries in the area get ready. This is to deal with any threats to the canal's safety and defense.</p>

            <h1>Alcatraz Prison Reopening Possible? U.S. Justice and Interior Secretaries Inspect Island</h1>
            <p>On July 17, U.S. President Trump suggested reopening "Alcatraz" federal prison. The U.S. government is now checking if this is possible. This morning, Justice Secretary Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum visited the island to look at it. Later, Burgum wrote on X that their visit was to start repairs and reopen the prison. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said this idea is the most foolish one yet.</p>
            <p>Early in the morning, before many tourists arrived, Justice Secretary Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum went to Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay. This island is also known as "Alcatraz," the federal prison. They did not speak to the public while there. Only a reporter from Fox News was with them.</p>
            <p>Two months ago, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would tell the government to reopen the Alcatraz federal prison.</p>
            <p>Later, Burgum wrote on X, a social media site, that their visit was to begin fixing and reopening the place. The goal is to hold the most dangerous criminals and people who entered the country illegally. The government is working hard to bring back safety, justice, and order to the streets.</p>
            <p>Bondi also posted on X, saying that under President Trump's leadership, "we are making America safe again."</p>
            <p>Fox News reported that the two secretaries visited the most famous parts of the federal prison and some areas not open to the public. They learned that the prison does not get electricity or water from the mainland and that the buildings are old. But this did not seem to change the government's plans.</p>
            <p>Bondi said in an interview that Alcatraz is an excellent facility. She said it needs a lot of repairs, but in the past, no one successfully escaped from Alcatraz and survived. Burgum added that they visited the island to see if it's possible to use Alcatraz as a prison again.</p>
            <p>In 1962, three prisoners dug through the soft concrete walls with spoons to escape. They were never found. After that, the prison was closed.</p>
            <p>Recently, Trump has faced new problems because of his past connection with a rich man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was involved in a sex scandal and has died. People who criticize Trump think that the two secretaries visiting Alcatraz now is a way to make people focus on something else. Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said on X that reopening Alcatraz is "the most foolish idea from the Trump government so far."</p>
            <p>Bondi responded by saying that Pelosi should instead worry about violent crimes in California and attacks on immigration officers.</p>
            <p>John Martini, a historian who knows a lot about Alcatraz, once said that the buildings there "do not work at all" anymore.</p>
            <p>Reopening Alcatraz would be a very big job. Since it closed as a prison in 1963, for many years it has been a museum and a place for tourists to visit. The National Park Service takes care of it now, and more than 1 million tourists visit every year. If the government wants to change it from a national park, the U.S. Congress would need to vote and agree. Also, fixing and rebuilding it would cost a lot of money.</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said today at a press meeting that if Alcatraz is reopened, the Federal Bureau of Prisons will manage it.</p>

            <h1>Trump to Visit Scotland in Late July, Will Meet UK Prime Minister to Discuss Trade Deal</h1>
            <p>On July 17, the White House announced that U.S. President Donald Trump will visit Scotland at the end of July. While there, he will meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer. They will work on making a big trade deal between the U.S. and the UK even better. Also, Trump plans to visit the UK for a second official state visit in September.</p>
            <p>Last week, British news said that Donald Trump would visit his golf club in Scotland later this month.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said at a press conference that Trump will visit Scotland from July 25 to 29. During his trip, he will go to Turnberry and Aberdeen.</p>
            <p>She said that during this trip, Trump will also meet with Prime Minister Starmer again. This is to make the important trade agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom even better.</p>
            <p>Trump announced in May that the U.S. and the UK had made a plan for a trade deal. In this plan, the UK will allow more American products, like beef and ethanol, to enter its markets. It will also reduce rules that make it harder for U.S. products to be sold there. The U.S. will still put a 10% tax on goods from the UK. However, the agreement says that British car makers can send up to 100,000 cars to the U.S. each year with a 10% "equal tax." If they send more than that, the tax will go up to 25%.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported earlier that Trump and Starmer signed a trade agreement in June during the G7 summit. This agreement greatly lowered the taxes the U.S. put on cars and aerospace products from the UK. Taxes on steel and aluminum are still being discussed.</p>
            <p>Also, Leavitt announced today that Trump and the First Lady, Melania Trump, plan to visit the UK from September 17 to 19. This will be Trump's second official state visit to the UK. She said he feels very honored by this and looks forward to meeting the King of England at Windsor Castle.</p>
            <p>When Prime Minister Starmer visited Washington in February, he gave Trump an invitation from King Charles III of the UK.</p>
            <p>During his first term in 2019, Trump made a state visit to the UK. He met with Queen Elizabeth II, who was King Charles III's mother and passed away in 2022.</p>
