            <h1>US Lowers Car Import Tax for EU to 15%, Starts August 1st</h1>
            <p>The United States announced today that it will lower the import tax on cars from the European Union (EU) to 15%. This change started on August 1st. This is to follow the rules of a trade agreement that both sides announced before.</p>
            <p>According to documents from the US Department of Commerce and the Trade Representative's Office, the tax on EU cars will go down from 27.5% to 15%.</p>
            <p>US President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made a deal in July. This deal said that most EU products sent to the US would have a 15% tax. The US would only lower taxes on cars and car parts if the EU made laws to lower taxes on US industrial goods and some farm products that are not sensitive.</p>
            <p>The EU acted in August to make it possible for the Trump government to change the car taxes from an earlier date. This was done to protect Europe's car industry, which is very important.</p>
            <p>The documents also say that from September 1st, some goods will not have to pay tax. These include airplanes, airplane parts, common medicines (generic drugs) and their materials, and some metals and minerals.</p>
            <p>The US said in its announcement that the list of goods might change.</p>

            <h1>Trump Wants to Change Foreign Aid to 'America First' Focus: Against China, Immigration, and Anti-US Governments</h1>
            <p>The US government sent documents to Congress. These documents show that the Trump government plans to use 1.8 billion US dollars in foreign aid for "America First" projects. These projects include investing in Greenland, fighting "anti-US governments" in Latin America, stopping illegal immigration, and limiting China's power.</p>
            <p>Reuters looked at a Congress notice from the Trump government today, dated September 12th. The notice said that the US needs to use foreign aid money to deal with new problems. This is to protect the country's safety and make the US safer, stronger, and richer.</p>
            <p>In this document, the Trump government said that the 1.8 billion US dollars (about 56.7 billion New Taiwan Dollars) will be used to "make US global leadership stronger." This will focus on several main areas of the Trump government's policies.</p>
            <p>These projects include making the supply chains for important minerals more varied, helping to invest in and build important infrastructure, stopping China's influence, and "dealing with the immigration crisis."</p>
            <p>The document also mentioned that 400 million US dollars will go to projects related to Europe. This includes plans for energy and important minerals in Ukraine, and work for economic growth and environmental protection in Greenland.</p>
            <p>Trump had said before that he wanted to control Greenland, which is a half-independent area of Denmark. This island is a very important place and has a lot of oil, natural gas, and minerals needed for many high-tech industries.</p>
            <p>The document also talked about the Western Hemisphere. It said that 400 million US dollars will be used to stop illegal immigrants from entering the US. It will also limit China's power in important minerals and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Also, it will "fight against the Marxist anti-US governments in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua."</p>
            <p>Since Trump came back to the White House in January this year, the US government has continued to make big changes to foreign aid. This new way of thinking is different from the old idea that food, healthcare, and money help are important "soft power" parts of the US's global influence.</p>

            <h1>2026 Health Insurance Budget Talks Agree on 5.5% Increase; Doctors Hope for More Money for Chronic Disease Prevention</h1>
            <p>For the 2026 National Health Insurance budget talks, doctors and people who pay for insurance surprisingly agreed on a 5.5% increase. Doctors from basic Western medicine clinics said that the plan to prevent metabolic syndrome is a key part of "Healthy Taiwan." But this plan was not supported in the talks. They hope the National Health Agency will use public money to add the missing funds.</p>
            <p>The National Health Insurance global budget is a set amount of money. Every September, the National Health Insurance Committee holds meetings to decide the budget for the next year. They talk about the budgets for hospitals, basic Western medicine clinics, Chinese medicine, dentists, and dialysis clinics. In past years, it was often hard for those who pay and the doctors to agree on how much the budget should grow. So, they often sent two different plans to the Ministry of Health and Welfare for approval.</p>
            <p>The 2026 National Health Insurance budget meeting happened on September 24th. Wang Hong-yu, who is the head of the Kaohsiung County Medical Association and works in a clinic, told the Central News Agency early this morning that the meeting started at 9:30 AM. They discussed the budgets for hospitals, dialysis, basic Western medicine, Chinese medicine, and dentists. The discussions for hospitals and dialysis went well, but the basic Western medicine budget was hard to agree on at first.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-yu shared that after the hospital and dental budgets were successfully agreed upon, it was already 8:50 PM. They then talked about the basic Western medicine budget again. Chen Xiang-guo, the new head of the National Federation of Medical Associations, asked all the people in the talks for their opinions. After giving up a few hundred million dollars from the budget, they had a final talk with the National Health Insurance Committee members. The meeting finished around 9:30 PM, and they finally reached an agreement.</p>
            <p>For 2026, everyone agreed on the budgets for hospitals, dialysis, basic Western medicine, Chinese medicine, and dentists. They agreed on a 5.5% increase, which means the total budget next year will be about 988.31 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This is the first time since 2002 that everyone has agreed on all budgets. Wang Hong-yu said it was very rare to agree on everything at once. He believes that both the payers and the doctors saw the honest effort from Health Minister Shih Chung-liang and National Health Insurance Administration Director Chen Liang-yu, which made both sides willing to "be patient for the country."</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-yu mentioned that he felt a bit sad about the basic Western medicine budget talks. He said that local clinics are very important for preventing chronic diseases. This includes getting rid of stomach cancer, slowing down kidney disease in patients needing dialysis, and stopping high blood pressure, high blood sugar, and high cholesterol from causing strokes or heart attacks. The plan to prevent metabolic syndrome is the most important part of President Lai Ching-te's "Healthy Taiwan" plan, but it was not supported in these budget talks.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-yu explained that basic Western medicine clinics planned for 1.2 billion for stomach cancer treatment, but only got 300 million this time. For reducing strokes and heart attacks, they estimated 1.5 billion, but got 700 million. For slowing down kidney disease for dialysis patients, they estimated 500 to 700 million, but only got 353 million. The costs for the metabolic syndrome prevention plan were 887 million, but the result of the budget talks for this was 0.</p>
            <p>Wang Hong-yu asked the National Health Agency to set aside public money for things like signing up patients, checking on them, and yearly reviews. He also asked them to include the costs for next year so that basic Western medicine clinics can work without worry. This would help everyone reach President Lai Ching-te's "Healthy Taiwan 888" goal. He also found that the main members of the National Health Insurance Committee were not very familiar with "Healthy Taiwan." He suggested that they should be allowed to join the "Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee" in the future to understand its goals.</p>
