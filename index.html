The US Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, said that the US will announce some trade agreements very soon. This will happen before July 9. On that day, a special period for tariffs ends.

President Trump will send letters to about 100 countries that do not trade much with the US. These letters will tell them that they might have to pay higher taxes on their goods from August 1. This will happen if they do not quickly make new trade agreements.

Mr. Bessent explained that Trump put a 10% tax on many goods on April 2. Some countries had to pay even more, up to 50%. But these extra taxes were put on hold for 90 days. This gave countries time to talk and make deals.

**Taipei City Changes Parking Rules Because of Typhoon Danas**

Taipei City's transport department said that because of Typhoon Danas, they will let people park longer in some areas. These areas are near evacuation gates and usually have red or yellow lines where parking is not allowed.

This change affects parts of Zhongshan, Songshan, Shilin, Wanhua, and Datong districts. People must move their cars by 12 PM on July 7. If cars are not moved, they will be towed, and people will get a fine. Also, normal parking fees will start again.

The weather office says that on July 7, the wind and rain in Taipei will not be strong enough to close schools or offices. So, schools and offices will be open as usual. The gates that let cars leave but not enter were opened again at 11 PM on July 6. The parking extension gives people more time to move their vehicles.

**Typhoon Danas Lands in Chiayi Late at Night**

Typhoon Danas arrived in Budai, Chiayi County, very late on July 6, around 11:40 PM. This is important because it's the first time a medium-strength typhoon has landed in central Taiwan since 1986.

Early on July 7, the typhoon was about 30 kilometers southwest of Chiayi. It was moving towards the northeast and then north-northeast.

The weather office also shared information about other typhoons that hit this part of Taiwan in the past. For example, in 1986, Typhoon Wayne caused a lot of damage in central and southern Taiwan. In 1990, Typhoon Marian brought problems to the south. Later, in 1998, Typhoon Nicole caused heavy rain in central and southern areas. And in 2002, Typhoon Narkri also brought heavy rain to different parts of the island.
