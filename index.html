            <h1>Israel Minister Prays at Al-Aqsa Mosque, Turkey Strongly Disapproves</h1>
            <p>Turkey strongly criticized Israel today. This happened because Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, prayed in the Al-Aqsa Mosque area in East Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>According to French news, Ben Gvir publicly performed a Jewish prayer in the Al-Aqsa Mosque area today. This act is very controversial.</p>
            <p>The Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third most important holy place for Islam. It is also the Temple Mount, which is the holiest place for Jewish people.</p>
            <p>Turkey's Foreign Ministry said in a statement: "We strongly disapprove of some Israeli ministers going into the Al-Aqsa Mosque. They were protected by Israeli police and joined by Israeli settler groups."</p>
            <p>The statement added: "Keeping Al-Aqsa Mosque safe and protecting Jerusalem's holy status is important not only for the region but also for everyone in the world."</p>
            <p>There is a long-standing agreement between Israel and Jordan, who manages the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This agreement says that Jewish ceremonies are not allowed in the Al-Aqsa Mosque area.</p>
            <p>But in recent years, Jewish visitors, including members of Israel's parliament, have often broken this agreement. This agreement is known as "maintaining the status quo."</p>

            <h1>Boat with African Migrants Sinks Off Yemen, 68 Dead, 74 Missing</h1>
            <p>An official from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Yemen said that a boat carrying 154 African migrants sank near Yemen. This caused 68 deaths, and 74 people are still missing.</p>
            <p>According to news reports, this is the newest sad event in a series of boat accidents near Yemen. These accidents have caused hundreds of African migrants to die. These migrants hope to reach rich countries in the Persian Gulf to find work.</p>
            <p>Abdusattor Esoev, who leads the IOM mission in Yemen, told the news that the boat carried 154 migrants from Ethiopia. It sank early today near Abyan province in southern Yemen.</p>
            <p>He said that 54 bodies were found on the shore in Khanfar. Another 14 bodies were taken to a hospital morgue in Zinjibar, the main city of Abyan province.</p>
            <p>Esoev said that only 12 people were saved. The other missing people are believed to have died.</p>
            <p>According to news reports, the IOM said that many unofficial migrants from Africa continue to come into Yemen.</p>
            <p>Every year, migrants use simple boats to cross the Bab al-Mandab strait between Yemen, Djibouti, and Eritrea. They hope to reach Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries to find work.</p>
            <p>The IOM said that the route from the Horn of Africa to Yemen is "one of the most dangerous but busiest mixed migration routes in the world." Last year, the IOM recorded more than 60,000 migrants arriving in Yemen.</p>
            <p>"Mixed migration" means people move for many reasons. This includes children without parents, people moving because of the environment, victims of human trafficking, trapped migrants, people asking for safety, and refugees.</p>

            <h1>Canadian Official Says Trump and Carney May Talk Soon</h1>
            <p>A Canadian official said today that US President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will likely talk "in the next few days." This news comes after the US said it would increase taxes to 35% on all Canadian goods not covered by the "US-Mexico-Canada Agreement."</p>
            <p>According to news reports, Dominic LeBlanc, the Canadian minister in charge of US-Canada trade, also told a US TV show that he felt positive about recent talks. He believes that reaching an agreement to lower these taxes is still possible.</p>
            <p>LeBlanc said: "We are positive about our talks with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. But we need to make an agreement that is best for both our economies, and we haven't done that yet."</p>
            <p>He said that Carney and Trump are expected to talk "in the next few days."</p>
            <p>LeBlanc said: "We think it's possible to reach an agreement to lower some taxes and make investing more certain."</p>
            <p>When Washington announced the new taxes on Canada, one reason given was that Canada had not stopped the smuggling of fentanyl, a strong pain medicine.</p>
