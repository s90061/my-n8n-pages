            <h1>Guyana's President Says He Won Re-election, Will Focus on Sharing Oil Money</h1>
            <p>Today, Irfaan Ali, the President of Guyana in South America, announced that he has won re-election. He will start his second term. His main goals are to use the recently found oil to make the country rich and to deal with problems with neighboring Venezuela.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that the People's Progressive Party (PPP), which is the current ruling party in Guyana, won more than twice as many votes as its closest rival in the national election. This means President Ali will stay in power and his party will have most seats in the parliament.</p>
            <p>The election committee said that the PPP got a total of 242,451 votes in yesterday's election. They won most votes in 8 out of the 10 election areas in the country. The committee has not yet confirmed how many seats each party will have in the parliament.</p>
            <p>Ali, who is 45 years old, said, "The numbers are very clear... We have a very big majority, and we are ready to lead the country forward."</p>
            <p>In this election, people voted for 65 members of parliament and a new government. The main topic during the election was how to share the large amount of money the country gets from oil.</p>
            <p>Since the end of 2019, when ExxonMobil started taking oil from the sea, Guyana has made about 7.5 billion US dollars from selling oil and getting payments. This country of 800,000 people is now one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>

            <h1>Fubon Life Issues US$650 Million in Bonds Abroad for the First Time to Make its Capital Stronger</h1>
            <p>Fubon Life announced today that it has completed pricing for its first international bond issue. This was done through its fully-owned company in Singapore, Fubon Life Singapore Pte. Ltd. On September 3, they sold junior corporate bonds worth 650 million US dollars (about 20 billion New Taiwan dollars). This helps them get more money and prepare for the new TW-ICS financial rules in 2026.</p>
            <p>After Cathay Life, Nanshan Life, and Shin Kong Life, Fubon Life's board decided in April this year to set up a special company (SPV) in Singapore. Fubon Life will own 100% of this company. The idea is that this company can sell bonds to get money and make Fubon Life's capital stronger. The initial money for setting up this company is expected to be 40 million US dollars. People see this as a new trend for life insurance companies to get money from overseas.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life shared a press release today. They said this is their first time to set the price for a 650 million US dollar junior corporate bond in the international market. The bond will last for 10.25 years and includes a three-month option to buy back the bond early. The price was set at 120 basis points above the US 10-year government bond interest rate. The bond's return rate is 5.469%, and its interest rate is 5.45%.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life Singapore Pte. Ltd. is the company that issued these bonds. Fubon Life acts as the guarantor. This means Fubon Life promises to pay back all the money and interest for the bonds when they are due, without any conditions. This is the first US dollar bond from a Taiwanese insurance company in the international market that has a "par call" option. This option lets the company buy back the bonds within three months before they are due. If they refinance early, it can help them save money on interest.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life explained that selling bonds overseas helps them find more ways to get money. The money from these bonds will be used to make Fubon Life's financial situation stronger, increase its own capital, and improve its capital adequacy ratio (a measure of financial strength).</p>
            <p>With low inflation numbers making people think the US central bank might lower interest rates, and stable international stock and bond markets, Fubon Life had meetings with investors in Singapore and Hong Kong for two days starting September 1. They successfully set the price on September 3. In the end, investors wanted to buy more than 1.9 billion US dollars worth of bonds, which is almost three times more than what was offered.</p>
            <p>Looking at where the investors are from, 86% are from the Asia-Pacific region, and 14% are from other places. Looking at the types of investors, 82% are funds or asset management companies, 11% are insurance or pension funds, and 7% are banks, private banks, and others.</p>
