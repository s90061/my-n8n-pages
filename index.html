            <h1>Private Company Donates Tarps, Helping 70 Affected Households in Taibao Create Temporary Shelters</h1>
            <p>A typhoon called Damrey blew off many roofs in Taibao City, Chiayi County. Because of this, Fuxiong Engineering Company gave over a hundred tarps to the Taibao City Office. This helps people who were affected by the storm, especially those who are more vulnerable. The tarps protect them from wind and rain. So far, almost 70 homes have put up these temporary covers.</p>
            <p>The Taibao City Office said today in a press release that Mr. Liu Yi-liang, who is the chairman of Fuxiong Engineering Company, donated over a hundred large tarps for disaster relief. This happened with the help of Huang Rong-li, a Chiayi County Council member from the Democratic Progressive Party, and Wu Hong-zhe, a Taibao City representative.</p>
            <p>Mayor Zheng Shu-fen said that when Liu Yi-liang learned what the affected people needed, he immediately found tarps from his company's warehouse. He gave over a hundred large tarps for free and sent dozens of his employees to help after the disaster. They are putting up the tarps for elderly people living alone and special families in Taibao City. This helps to protect these vulnerable people from the wind and rain.</p>
            <p>Mayor Zheng Shu-fen also said that almost 70 affected homes in Taibao City have received tarps and now have temporary covers. She greatly praised and thanked the employees of Fuxiong Company for their kind actions.</p>

            <h1>US General Says Han Kuang Should Become US-Taiwan Joint Exercise, Include Integrated Training [Interview]</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 18 (CNA) The yearly Han Kuang military exercise in Taiwan has finished. Retired US Navy Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery said today in an interview with Central News Agency that Taiwan needs to find a good balance between its active soldiers and reserve forces. He thinks that having many reserve soldiers join this year's exercise is a good start. He also said that the Han Kuang exercise should slowly become a joint exercise with the US military to include combined training.</p>
            <p>The "Han Kuang No. 41" live-fire exercise ended on July 18. Soldiers from Taiwan's military trained hard for 10 days and 9 nights. They practiced using new weapons and building a deep defense system. This year's exercise was the longest ever. It also included training for how to react to China's "gray zone" attacks on Taiwan. Also, 22,000 reserve soldiers took part in the live exercise, including the entire Army Infantry Brigade 206.</p>
            <p>Mark Montgomery, who is now a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, told the Central News Agency that it was a "great" exercise. He stressed that it is very important for Taiwan's military to do realistic training.</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that for Taiwan, using reserve soldiers more effectively is a very important issue. Taiwan must balance its active and reserve forces. He said that having over 20,000 reserve soldiers in the Han Kuang exercise "is a very good start."</p>
            <p>However, Montgomery still has some worries. He said that even though US observers were there, Han Kuang is still only a Taiwanese exercise. Both Taiwan and the US do not want a war with China. But if a war does happen, it would need two or more countries working together. Taiwan would not fight against the Chinese Communist Party alone.</p>
            <p>Therefore, he suggested that the Han Kuang exercise should slowly become a joint exercise. It should include US Navy, Air Force, and Army personnel for combined training. The US Congress already passed the "Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act" in 2023. This law tells the US Department of Defense to do more joint training with Taiwan's military. He believes the Han Kuang exercise is good for this kind of training.</p>
            <p>Montgomery said that the US and Taiwan should not stop because they are worried about making China angry. Instead, they should try their best to improve "interoperability" between Taiwan and the US. He added, "The sooner we do this, the sooner we can stop the Chinese Communist Party from doing anything foolish."</p>
            <p>At the same time, he believes that under the Trump government, if the Chinese Communist Party tries to force Taiwan to unite or give up its independence or sovereignty, the US will get involved. In his opinion, the Trump government understands that Taiwan is important for US national security. If Taiwan loses its independence, it will hurt the economic security and national security of the US for a long time.</p>
            <p>Regarding Taiwan's defense budget, Montgomery said that increasing it to 3% this year is enough. He thinks that 5% would be a good goal by the end of President Lai's term.</p>
            <p>Montgomery, who often visits Taiwan to learn about its defense, plans to visit Taiwan again at the end of July. During his visit, he will work with the "Center for Technology, Democracy, and Society" to do a war game. This war game will simulate an economic war based on energy and cyberattacks. They will look at how easily Taiwan's power grid can be attacked and how to help Taiwan stop the PLA (People's Liberation Army) or Chinese Coast Guard from stopping goods from entering Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He explained that the most dangerous situation for Taiwan is if the Chinese Communist Party invades across the Taiwan Strait or creates a large blockade. But the most likely situation is that China will continue to put more pressure on Taiwan. This includes pressure on finance, energy, and communication. It also includes more cyberattacks, false information, and influence operations. All these methods are meant to weaken the will of the Taiwanese people.</p>
