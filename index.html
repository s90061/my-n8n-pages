Amazon has started delivering packages by drone in two US states, Texas and California, as part of its Prime Air service. This marks a significant step forward in the company's long-held ambition to offer rapid drone delivery to its customers.

The service is currently available to a limited number of customers who live near Amazon's delivery centers in College Station, Texas, and Lockeford, California. These customers can order thousands of everyday items, ranging from household goods to electronics, weighing up to five pounds.

Once an order is placed, Amazonâ€™s system checks if the delivery location is safe and suitable for drone delivery. If it is, the package is loaded onto a drone, which then autonomously flies to the customer's yard, descends, and releases the package. Amazon claims the delivery process takes less than an hour.

The company plans to expand its drone delivery service to more locations in the coming months, pending regulatory approval. Amazon believes drone delivery has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce, offering faster and more convenient delivery options for customers. However, challenges remain, including regulatory hurdles, safety concerns, and public acceptance.

**Title: Amsterdam's Museumplein Transforms into a 'Forest' to Highlight Climate Change**

Amsterdam's Museumplein, a large public square surrounded by famous museums, was recently transformed into a temporary "forest" to raise awareness about climate change. The project, called "The Forest," involved planting hundreds of trees on the square, creating a green oasis in the heart of the city.

The initiative aimed to show people the importance of trees in absorbing carbon dioxide, reducing urban heat, and improving air quality. Visitors could walk through the temporary forest, learn about the benefits of trees, and participate in workshops on sustainable living.

Organizers hoped the project would inspire people to take action on climate change and support initiatives that protect and expand forests. The trees were later replanted in different locations around Amsterdam, contributing to the city's green infrastructure.

The temporary forest attracted a lot of attention and sparked discussions about urban greening and the need for more sustainable practices. It served as a reminder that even small actions, like planting trees, can make a difference in the fight against climate change.

**Title: Italy's Cinque Terre Introduces New Rules to Combat Overtourism**

The Cinque Terre, a group of five colorful villages along the Italian Riviera, are implementing new rules to manage the increasing number of tourists. The area has become increasingly popular in recent years, leading to overcrowding and environmental damage.

The new regulations include limiting access to certain trails, introducing a ticketing system for popular attractions, and increasing fines for littering and other offenses. Authorities are also encouraging visitors to explore the area during off-peak seasons and to use public transportation instead of private cars.

These measures aim to protect the Cinque Terre's natural beauty and cultural heritage, while also ensuring a more enjoyable experience for visitors. Local residents have expressed concerns about the impact of overtourism on their daily lives, and the new rules are intended to address these concerns.

The Cinque Terre's authorities hope the new regulations will help create a more sustainable tourism model, balancing the needs of visitors, residents, and the environment. They believe that by managing tourism responsibly, they can preserve the Cinque Terre for future generations to enjoy.
