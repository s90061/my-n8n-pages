            <h1>Brothers Win with a 3-Run Lead After Almost Losing a 7-Run Advantage; Pitcher Huang Boduo Still Has Much to Learn</h1>
            <p>The CTBC Brothers baseball team had a big lead of 7 runs today. However, in the last part of the game, the 9th inning, the Wei Chuan Dragons scored 4 runs. The Brothers had to use four different pitchers in that inning to stop the other team. They finally won the game 10 to 7.</p>
            <p>The coach for the Brothers, Ping-Yeh Hui-Yi, said after the game that they must avoid situations like this. He also said that the starting pitcher, Humberto Castellanos (also called Huang Boduo), still has many things to improve. Castellanos pitched for 6.1 innings, which means he played for most of the game. He allowed 12 hits and 3 runs, but he also struck out 3 batters and walked 1. This win was his 10th victory this season, which is considered a good performance.</p>
            <p>Coach Ping-Yeh Hui-Yi explained that because they had a 7-run lead in the 9th inning, he chose to send Chen Bo-Jun to pitch first. He hoped Chen Bo-Jun would do well. He added that if the lead were smaller, there would be more pressure. He wants Chen Bo-Jun to do better next time. Regarding another pitcher, Hsieh Rong-Hao, who only pitched to one batter before leaving, the coach said all decisions were made to help the team win.</p>
            <p>The coach also mentioned that he always tells the batters that even if they are winning, they should keep trying to score more runs. This way, if they face a tough situation like in the 9th inning, they will have more room to make changes to win the game. He also said that the team must avoid situations where a large lead forces them to use their best relief pitchers (called the "victory bullpen") to hold onto the win.</p>
            <p>Coach Ping-Yeh Hui-Yi believes that "Huang Boduo still has many, many things to work on." He thinks that the pitcher should be able to play for at least 7 innings. He hopes Huang Boduo will not be satisfied with his current performance because there will be more important games in September. He reminded everyone not to forget that the Brothers almost missed winning the first half of the season by just a few games.</p>

            <h1>New Health Insurance Drug Helps Emily When Her Hormone-Positive Breast Cancer Returns as Triple-Negative</h1>
            <p>Emily, a woman in her 40s, was diagnosed with a type of breast cancer called Stage 2 hormone-positive breast cancer two years ago. This happened during a regular health check. She bravely received treatment, and her condition was stable for a while. However, this year, doctors found that the cancer had spread and changed into a more serious type called triple-negative breast cancer. After two treatments with a new medicine covered by national health insurance, her tumor got smaller, and she started to feel happy again.</p>
            <p>Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in Taiwan. According to information from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, more than ten thousand women get breast cancer every year.</p>
            <p>Many breast cancer patients worry that their cancer might come back. This fear is a common stress for them. Dr. Yang Ya-Wen, a general surgeon at National Taiwan University Hospital, often tells her patients, "After you leave the clinic, you are normal people." She says this to help breast cancer patients return to their normal lives.</p>
            <p>Today, Dr. Yang Ya-Wen reminded patients through a news release that "You have gone through a lot of difficult treatments, and you know how to value life more than others. You also have more valuable life experiences." She said that breast cancer patients who have finished treatment do not need to worry too much. They should see returning to a normal daily life as a main goal of their treatment. Doctors are always finding better ways to treat cancer. So, even if the cancer unfortunately comes back, patients can control it by taking their medicine regularly and going for check-ups.</p>
            <p>Emily is a good example. She always took care of her health and had regular check-ups. Two years ago, she found out she had Stage 2 hormone-positive breast cancer. She was a great patient in the eyes of the medical team. When the disease came, she bravely had surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone medicine. She also went to her follow-up appointments on time and followed her doctors' orders. But this year, doctors found that her cancer cells had spread, and the cancer type had changed to triple-negative breast cancer.</p>
            <p>Further tests showed that Emily's cancer cells were HER2 weak positive. After her doctor thought about it, she was given a new type of medicine called an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), which is covered by health insurance. After two treatments, her tumor got smaller. The fluid in her left lung area also improved, and she could breathe more easily. Now, her condition is stable. She is slowly overcoming her sadness and feeling confident again in fighting the disease.</p>
            <p>Unlike countries in Europe and America, Taiwanese women with breast cancer often have two periods when they are most likely to get it: between 45 and 49 years old, and between 60 and 64 years old. Dr. Yang Ya-Wen said that this might be related to genes. It also has to do with eating Western food and changes in how people live, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, not exercising enough, stress, and changes in hormones. In its early stages, breast cancer usually does not cause much pain, so getting regular check-ups is very important.</p>
            <p>This year, the National Health Administration expanded free breast cancer screening. It used to be for women aged 45 to 69, but now it is for women aged 40 to 74. Dr. Yang Mu-Jun, an oncologist (cancer doctor) at Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital, encourages all women to get regular breast cancer screenings. This helps find the cancer early and treat it quickly. If breast cancer is found early, the chances of getting better are usually very good. Even if things are difficult, he says not to give up, because medical treatments have improved a lot.</p>
            <p>Dr. Yang Mu-Jun explained that breast cancer treatments are getting better very quickly. The ADC medicine, which the National Health Insurance started covering this year, is one of these new treatments. It combines features of targeted therapy and chemotherapy to specifically attack cancer cells. It also has a "bystander effect" that kills nearby cancer cells, helping to overcome the problem of tumors having different types of cells. This treatment is a big step forward because it works for HER2 weak positive cases, which make up half of all breast cancers. This will help doctors provide more personalized and exact treatments for each patient.</p>

            <h1>Five People Die in a House Fire in Zhongli, Taoyuan; Prosecutors Say All Victims Died from Suffocation</h1>
            <p>Five people died in a house fire this morning in Zhongli District, Taoyuan City. The police are still looking into what caused the fire. After examining the bodies, the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office said that all five people died because they could not breathe and suffocated.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Fire Department said they received a call at about 5:31 AM about a house fire on Longan Street in Zhongli District. They quickly sent fire trucks and people to help. However, the accident led to the deaths of five people: a 35-year-old woman named Huang, her 10-year-old daughter, her 9-year-old son, and two children of a friendâ€”a 10-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. Fire investigators are still working to find the exact reason for the fire.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office sent out a press release this evening. They said that Head Prosecutor Li Chia-Hao and Prosecutor Lai Ying-Yu went to the fire scene to check it and told the police and fire departments to keep gathering evidence.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutor's Office stated that the prosecutors, along with a medical examiner, looked at the bodies this afternoon. They determined that all five people died from not being able to breathe (suffocation and respiratory failure). They immediately gave death certificates to the families so they could arrange the funerals. In addition, the Prosecutor's Office quickly told the Taoyuan Branch of the Victims Protection Association to go to the scene to help and gave each family NT$5,000 as a condolence payment, showing the caring side of the legal system.</p>
            <p>The Prosecutor's Office said they will continue to work with the police and fire departments to find out what caused the fire and who is responsible. If the families need a place to stay or legal help later, the Taoyuan Branch of the Victims Protection Association will keep offering support.</p>
            <p>The Social Welfare Bureau said that Mr. Chen Bao-Min, the head of the bureau, went to the site this morning to offer comfort to the families. He also shared that Taoyuan Mayor Chang San-Cheng was concerned and caring. The Social Welfare Bureau also started its disaster relief plan. Social workers went to help the families right away, offering emotional support, connecting them with resources, and providing necessary services. They are also working with the Education Bureau and district offices to help the families, make sure they are stable, and support them through this difficult time.</p>
