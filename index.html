            <h1>Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che Visits Brisbane, Australia, to Start Working Together</h1>
            <p>Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che recently went to Brisbane City Hall in Queensland, Australia. He talked with Sandy Landers, the President of the Brisbane City Council, and others. They discussed how to manage a city, exchange students, and share ideas about sports. This visit is the start of friendship and working together between the two cities.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Government said today that Mayor Huang Wei-che visited Brisbane City Hall on September 5th. Sandy Landers, the City Council President, and Steven Huang, the Deputy President, welcomed him. This was Mayor Huang Wei-che's first time visiting Australia.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Wei-che mentioned that people in Australia like wine and beef from Taiwan. Tainan is a main area in Taiwan for farming and fishing. It produces a lot of mangoes, pineapples, and milkfish. He hopes to show Tainan's good farm and fish products at the "2025 Sydney Food Show" and sell more to Australia.</p>
            <p>Mayor Huang Wei-che also said that Tainan is the first city in Taiwan. It has a long history and many modern technology companies. The TSMC factory in Tainan helps build the semiconductor industry. He hopes Tainan and Brisbane can work together more in new technology, student exchange, and sports in the future.</p>
            <p>Ms. Landers welcomed Mayor Huang Wei-che to Brisbane, which is called the "Sunshine City." She said Brisbane is one of the best cities to live in Australia, and the "Brisbane Festival" is happening now. She hopes the people visiting have a good time. Mr. Steven Huang also hopes the two cities can work more on watching for disasters in the future.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Government explained that Brisbane is the main city of Queensland, Australia. About 2.6 million people live there. It is the third-biggest city area in Australia, after Sydney and Melbourne. Brisbane Port is an important way for Australia to trade with other countries, especially in Asia. Lately, Brisbane has been working hard to develop smart cities and new businesses, like computer technology, medical science, new energy, and environmental protection.</p>

            <h1>Study Says Companies That Care More About the Environment Have Less Cybersecurity Risk</h1>
            <p>A team from National Central University found something interesting: companies that have a bigger "ecological footprint" actually have fewer problems with cyber attacks. This means that if a company tries harder to be good for the environment, its computer security might also be better. This discovery is very important for how companies work and for making new rules. The study was printed in a well-known international magazine.</p>
            <p>National Central University announced today that Professor Wang Zhi-wei and his team from the Finance department studied companies in the United States. They looked at companies from 2007 to 2018 that are on the stock market. They read the "risk factors" in the companies' yearly reports to find out how much risk they had for cyber attacks. First, the team found out which companies had been attacked by hackers. Then, they looked for similar words in other companies' reports to find out if those companies also had high risks.</p>
            <p>The study showed that companies that are more environmentally friendly have less risk of cyber attacks. There are two main reasons for this: "new ideas and inventions" and "having more money." Companies with a bigger ecological footprint often have to follow stricter environmental rules. This makes them invest more in green technology and digital systems, which helps make their computer security better. These companies also tend to keep more money. This helps them deal with new rules or possible legal problems. So, they have enough money to spend on keeping their computer systems safe.</p>
            <p>The researchers think that if companies want to stop harming the environment, they also need to care about digital safety. They should not just fix one problem at a time. They suggest that companies should connect their environmental plans with their digital security plans. If different parts of the company work together, they can become stronger. The government could also give prizes to companies that care about both the environment and computer security. This would help the country become strong in both long-term development and cyber safety.</p>
            <p>The results of this study were published in a global science magazine called "Energy Economics."</p>

            <h1>Trump Says "Dark Moment for America" After Friend Is Shot Dead</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of the United States, Donald Trump, felt very sad and angry. His friend, Charlie Kirk, who was a leader for young conservative people, was shot and killed. This happened when Kirk was giving a speech at a university in Utah. Trump called this event "a dark moment for America."</p>
            <p>The news channel CNN reported that Trump spoke in a four-minute video. He made the video in his office at the White House. He said, "I am both sad and angry about the terrible killing of Kirk at a university in Utah. Kirk helped millions of people feel inspired. Everyone who knew and liked him is very shocked and hurting tonight."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "This is a dark moment for America." He said that Kirk traveled all over the country to have "kind and honest talks" with people.</p>
            <p>Trump stated that Kirk "died for truth and freedom." He sent his prayers and comfort to Kirk's family.</p>
            <p>The President also talked about other times when people were shot. He spoke against "extreme and political violence." He mentioned when someone tried to kill him in Pennsylvania last July. He also talked about when a boss of a health company was shot in New York last December. And he remembered when Steve Scalise, a leader in Congress, was shot during a baseball game practice in 2017.</p>
            <p>He said that people in America and the news must "understand that if you speak badly about people who think differently, it will only lead to sad violence and killings."</p>
            <p>Trump promised that he would keep working to stop this. He also said he would share a bigger plan to fight political violence.</p>
            <p>He said, "My government will find everyone who took part in this violent act and other political violence. This includes groups that give money and support to these actions. It also includes those who target our judges, police officers, and everyone who keeps our country safe."</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP reported that Kirk was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University. He had helped get more young people to support Trump.</p>
            <p>The person who shot him has not been caught yet.</p>
            <p>Videos from the event showed Kirk speaking to many people. Suddenly, a gunshot was heard, and he fell into his chair. The camera quickly turned away, and the people there were very scared.</p>
            <p>Investigators said they believe one bullet was fired from a person in black clothes on the roof of the university. They think it was a planned attack by a sniper.</p>
