            <h1>Cheng Li-wen Takes Charge of KMT Headquarters, Affecting Lu Shiow-yen's Plans for 2028</h1>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen, a former lawmaker, has won the election to be the new leader of the KMT party. Her main goal is for the party to win the local elections in 2026. Also, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, whose term ends next year, might plan for the 2028 elections. People in the party think that Cheng and Lu have the same goals. They talk to each other easily and have a good relationship. So, they expect to share many ideas when making decisions.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen won the KMT party leader election and will take office on November 1st. Everyone is watching to see how she will lead the KMT in the Parliament and in different cities and counties. Someone who helped Cheng Li-wen in her campaign said that she will make the KMT a platform to help the Parliament and the cities and counties governed by the KMT. She will give full support.</p>
            <p>How will Cheng Li-wen work with Lu Shiow-yen, who many in the party think will run for president in 2028? A KMT helper said that Cheng Li-wen won the election with more than half of the votes, so her position as party leader is strong. People hope she can lead the KMT to win the 2026 local elections. Lu Shiow-yen's term as Taichung Mayor ends next year, and she wants to hand over her power smoothly. Because of this, both Lu and Cheng have the same goals and pressures for the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>This KMT helper also said that Cheng Li-wen is very flexible. Since they both have the same goals and can talk to each other easily in private, he believes they will communicate and share many ideas about future decisions and election plans.</p>
            <p>People in the party say that Cheng Li-wen is brave and speaks sharply. She will show the "strong" side of the party. Lu Shiow-yen, known as the "Mom Mayor," shows the "gentle" side. It will be important to see how the KMT combines these strong and gentle qualities and works together in both national and local government.</p>
            <p>However, some local people worry that Cheng Li-wen's political power and her ideas about cross-strait relations might cause concern among local voters for next year's local elections. If the KMT moves away from the middle ground, and this affects the elections, Lu Shiow-yen, who did not run for party leader, might also be blamed.</p>
            <p>This person said that how to bring together different strengths and decide on a clear direction will be a challenge for Lu Shiow-yen.</p>

            <h1>Tseng Wan-ting Wins First Golden Bell Award After 27 Years, Thanks Director Chen Hui-ling with Tears: "You Saw Me First"</h1>
            <p>Tseng Wan-ting has been an actress for 27 years. She won the Golden Bell Award for Best Supporting Actress in a TV drama for her role in "The Queen." She cried and said that these 27 years were very difficult. She even thought about leaving the entertainment business. Now that she has won an award, Tseng Wan-ting wants to say, "I know I am not perfect, but I never stopped trying to be better."</p>
            <p>In recent years, Tseng Wan-ting has often challenged herself and changed how people see her in her acting roles. She has shown great passion and strength for acting. This time, she won the Best Supporting Actress award for "The Queen." Tseng Wan-ting thanked Director Yen Yi-wen. She said, "Thank you, Director Yi-wen, for telling me to connect with my character and to enjoy acting. Half of this award belongs to you." Besides Director Yen Yi-wen, Tseng Wan-ting also thanked the late Director Chen Hui-ling. She said, "It's sad that you cannot see this, but I believe you are here. You saw my talent first. I am the gem you found. Thank you for telling me that actors in 8 PM drama shows are not bad, they just need a better stage."</p>
            <p>Finally, Tseng Wan-ting remembered her father, who is in heaven. She said, "I finally did it. I know I am not perfect, but I never gave up on becoming a better person." Tseng Wan-ting wants to encourage everyone who is chasing their dreams: "Keep going, and one day you will also be noticed."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Tseng Wan-ting said she wanted to joke with Hsieh Chiung-hsuan on stage. She laughed and said that when she was on stage, her mind went blank, and she forgot about it. Now that she has bravely won the Best Supporting Actress award, Tseng Wan-ting made a heart shape with her hands to Hsieh Chiung-hsuan from backstage. She openly showed her love, saying, "Sister Chiung-hsuan, I love you."</p>
