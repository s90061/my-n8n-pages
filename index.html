[https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240502-how-to-stop-doomscrolling-and-the-effects-of-bad-news-on-your-wellbeing](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20240502-how-to-stop-doomscrolling-and-the-effects-of-bad-news-on-your-wellbeing)

Many people often find themselves spending a lot of time scrolling through bad news online, a habit known as "doomscrolling." This can happen without us even realizing it, and it often leads to feelings of anxiety, sadness, and anger. Experts say that looking at too much negative information can harm our mental well-being and make us feel helpless. When we constantly read about wars, disasters, or other sad events, our brains can become overwhelmed.

One reason people doomscroll is a natural human desire to stay informed and understand threats. However, the endless stream of news on social media makes it hard to stop. It's important to be aware of this behavior and try to manage it. To avoid doomscrolling, experts suggest setting limits on news consumption, such as checking news only at specific times of the day. Itâ€™s also helpful to follow sources that provide positive or balanced news, and to make sure you get enough sleep and exercise. If you find yourself feeling worse after checking the news, it might be a good time to take a break. Taking control of your news habits can significantly improve your mood and overall mental health.

**AI's Impact on Jobs: More Than Just Losses**

[https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-impact-jobs-isnt-what-most-people-expect-goldman-sachs-says-2024-05-09/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-impact-jobs-isnt-what-most-people-expect-goldman-sachs-says-2024-05-09/)

Many people worry that artificial intelligence (AI) will cause millions of job losses, but a new report from Goldman Sachs suggests a more complex future. The report indicates that while some jobs might disappear, AI will also create new ones and change how many existing jobs are done. Instead of a large wave of unemployment, AI is likely to transform the workplace, making some tasks easier and allowing workers to focus on more creative or strategic parts of their roles.

The report predicts that AI will affect a significant number of jobs, but not necessarily by replacing humans entirely. For example, AI tools can help doctors with diagnoses, lawyers with legal research, and software developers with writing code. This means many jobs will become "augmented," where humans work alongside AI. It's thought that AI could boost global productivity, leading to economic growth and new opportunities in various sectors. To prepare for these changes, workers may need to learn new skills, especially those related to using AI tools effectively. Businesses will also need to adapt by investing in AI technologies and training their staff. This shift could lead to a more efficient and innovative global economy.

**How Tourist Hotspots Are Managing Too Many Visitors**

[https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/jun/05/overtourism-destinations-crackdown-tourists](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/article/2024/jun/05/overtourism-destinations-crackdown-tourists)

Popular tourist destinations worldwide are facing a growing problem: too many visitors. This issue, often called "overtourism," can harm local environments, disturb residents, and reduce the quality of the visitor experience. Places like Venice, Amsterdam, and Santorini have seen their infrastructure strained and their unique character threatened by the sheer number of tourists. As a result, many of these places are starting to introduce new rules and strategies to manage the flow of visitors.

For instance, some cities are limiting the number of cruise ships or day-trippers. Others are increasing tourist taxes, which helps fund local services and discourages very short visits. Venice has even introduced a trial entry fee for day visitors during busy periods. Amsterdam is trying to discourage certain types of tourism, focusing instead on cultural visitors. The aim is not to stop tourism completely, but to encourage more sustainable and respectful travel. This includes promoting off-season visits, encouraging tourists to explore less crowded areas, and educating visitors about local customs. These measures hope to protect popular sites, improve the lives of residents, and ensure that these beautiful places remain enjoyable for future generations of travelers.`;
