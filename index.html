        const text = `**Wall Street Journal: Xi Jinping's Cold War Against the US Has Begun, Ultimate Goal is to Surpass the US**

The Wall Street Journal says that Chinese President Xi Jinping has a long-term plan to deal with the United States. He is fighting a quiet "cold war" to gain time for China to become stronger than the U.S. Xi learned from the fall of the Soviet Union that he should avoid a direct fight and instead try to make the pressure from the U.S. easier to handle.

Xi's plan has a few main parts. First, he wants China's economy to be strong in many different areas, not just heavy industry, so it can handle trade problems. Second, he wants to avoid being alone like the Soviet Union was. China tries to work with many countries instead of choosing sides. Third, China is making its military stronger but carefully, to avoid a costly arms race with the U.S. Finally, and most importantly, Xi is making the Communist Party's control over everything in China even stronger.

The article explains that Trump's trade war in 2018 made Xi think more about how to win a cold war with the U.S. Then, in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Xi started his "dual circulation" plan to protect China from outside problems, especially from the U.S. Experts say that China is getting ready for a long competition with the U.S.

**Foreign Investors Sell NT$5.7 Billion, Ending 4 Consecutive Days of Buying; Reduce Holdings in 0050 and Shipping Stocks**

Taiwan's stock market went down today by 118.78 points, closing at 22428.72 points. Foreign investors, who had been buying stocks for four days in a row, sold NT$5.788 billion worth of shares. They mainly sold shares of Yuanta Taiwan 50 (0050) and shipping companies.

The stock market dropped more than 250 points at one point. Big company stocks were not doing well, but money moved to military and financial stocks. In the end, the market closed with a 0.53% drop. Only local investors bought stocks, while investment trusts and foreign investors sold.

Experts say that new taxes are the biggest worry for Taiwan's stock market. However, they also think that the market is strong and will not fall too much even if the new taxes are higher than expected. The New Taiwan dollar has also become weaker for two days in a row, but experts believe it will become stronger later in the year if inflation stays low.
