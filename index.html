            <h1>Standard Chartered Forms Partnerships to Offer New Overseas Credit Product</h1>
            <p>Standard Chartered Bank announced today that it will work with Prudential Life, First Gold Investment Trust, and Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions. They will introduce the first "offshore private credit strategy product" that is not a regular securities investment fund. This is part of Taiwan's plan to become an asset management center in Asia.</p>
            <p>Standard Chartered Bank held a press conference today. Samir Subberwal, who is in charge of wealth solutions, deposits, and mortgages for Standard Chartered Group around the world, came to Taiwan. This shows that Standard Chartered cares a lot about the Taiwanese market.</p>
            <p>Samir Subberwal said that Standard Chartered Bank is slowly growing its services for wealthy clients in Taiwan. In July this year, they opened an office in Kaohsiung as part of the Asia Asset Management Center. In August, they worked with Prudential Life to be the first foreign bank to offer "premium financing." This shows a new way for financial companies to work together, and it is because they see that wealth management will continue to grow around the world.</p>
            <p>Samir Subberwal also said that Standard Chartered connects to over 50 markets and 4 wealth centers globally. With its strong local presence, it offers many wealth management options for wealthy clients. The group aims for double-digit growth in wealth management in 5 years, and Taiwan has great potential for this growth.</p>
            <p>Samrat Khosla, head of wealth management at Standard Chartered Bank, said that wealthy clients want more complete and different ways to manage their money. They also want expert advice and to invest globally to get more financial opportunities. Standard Chartered Bank will continue to make its wealth management better and work with partners. This way, they will keep offering clients wealth management services that are at the same level as international services.</p>
            <p>Standard Chartered Bank said that they are not only working closely with Prudential Life but also with First Gold Investment Trust and Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions. For wealthy clients in the Kaohsiung asset zone, they will offer the first "offshore private credit strategy product" that is not a regular securities investment fund. This product invests in things that are not traditional stocks, bonds, or cash. These include private credit, private equity, and real assets. This aims to make investment risks lower, increase chances for returns, and help protect against inflation for wealthy clients.</p>

            <h1>Sri Lankan Parliament Votes to Make Three Former Presidents Leave Government Homes</h1>
            <p>Today, Sri Lanka's Parliament voted for former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and two other former leaders to move out of their government-owned houses. This is part of new money-saving actions by the new left-wing government.</p>
            <p>The political party led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake voted together to pass a law. This law gets rid of a 1986 law that gave former national leaders special rights to fancy houses and secretarial help.</p>
            <p>Only one member of the opposition party voted against it. The new law passed with a two-thirds majority, meaning 150 out of 225 votes.</p>
            <p>Justice Minister Harshana Nanayakkara told Parliament, "We are ending the 1986 law to save taxpayers' money." He said that the former leaders used their power wrongly to give themselves expensive government houses.</p>
            <p>However, opposition member Dayasiri Jayasekara said the government was acting with bad intentions against political rivals. He stated, "You brought this law because you could not force President Rajapaksa to leave just by threatening him. Now you are acting out of hate."</p>
            <p>The day before the law was passed, the Supreme Court decided that taking away these special rights from former national leaders was not against the country's main law.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did not want to leave a luxury house in the capital city. The government asked him many times, but he did not listen.</p>
            <p>The other two former presidents, Chandrika Kumaratunga and Maithripala Sirisena, are currently living in government houses in the diplomatic area of Colombo. They have not said anything about the decision yet.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's 13 Financial Groups Made NT$57.8 Billion in August, Over 70% More Than Last Year</h1>
            <p>In August, the New Taiwan Dollar became weaker against the US Dollar by more than 2%. Also, the stock market grew stronger. Because of these reasons, financial companies made good profits. The 13 financial holding companies had a total net profit of NT$57.832 billion after tax in August. This is 78.54% more than they made in the same month last year.</p>
            <p>According to public information, these 13 financial groups made NT$363.829 billion in total for the first eight months of the year. Among them, Fubon Financial Holding was the top performer in August for monthly profit, total profit for the year, and earnings per share (EPS). However, looking at the first eight months of this year, only five companies earned more than they did in the same period last year. These were Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding, E.SUN Financial Holding, E.SUN Financial Holding, First Financial Holding, and Hua Nan Financial Holding. Most of these companies focus mainly on banking.</p>
            <p>Fubon Financial Holding reported an after-tax profit of NT$11.1 billion in August. For the first eight months, their after-tax profit was NT$73.48 billion, and their EPS was NT$5.11. Fubon Financial said that Fubon Life Insurance made NT$5.81 billion in August. Taipei Fubon Bank made NT$3.26 billion after tax in August. For the first eight months, Taipei Fubon Bank made NT$25.74 billion after tax.

Cathay Financial said that Cathay Life Insurance made NT$5.33 billion after tax in August. Cathay United Bank made NT$3.69 billion in August and NT$31.28 billion for the first eight months. This was because loans increased and they managed their money costs well, so their net interest income grew by more than 10%. Overall, Cathay United Bank, Cathay Century Insurance, and Cathay Securities Investment Trust all made their highest ever after-tax profits for the first eight months. Cathay Securities' total after-tax profit for the same period was the second highest ever.</p>

            <p>Taishin Shin Kong Financial Holding's monthly profit for August includes both Taishin Financial Holding's original profit and Shin Kong's profit after the merger.
