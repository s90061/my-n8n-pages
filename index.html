            <h1>Scam Groups Pretend to Be Others; NCC Suggests Blocking Calls with Unknown Numbers</h1>
            <p>Recently, some people have received calls with hidden numbers. The person on the phone said they were an officer from the National Communications Commission (NCC). They lied and said the person's phone number had problems. They used this trick to steal one million New Taiwan dollars. Today, the NCC explained that they do not call people directly. They also do not use hidden numbers to contact people. These kinds of calls are scams.</p>
            <p>The "165 Anti-Fraud Dashboard" of the Ministry of Interior's National Police Agency recently shared a story. A person got a call with a hidden number. The caller said they were an NCC officer. They lied that the person's phone number was used illegally, or that someone else was using their identity. Then, they connected the person to fake lawyers and police. They asked the person to pay "evidence fees" and "deposit money." They tricked the person and stole one million dollars.</p>
            <p>The NCC posted on Facebook that they do not call people directly. If you get a call from someone who says they are from the NCC and their number is hidden, it is a scam call.</p>
            <p>The NCC also reminded people to be very careful when they see any call with a hidden number. If you are not sure, please call the "165 Anti-Fraud Hotline" to check.</p>
            <p>The NCC said that recently, there are still scams where people pretend to be government workers and call from hidden numbers. To lower the risk of being scammed, the NCC suggests that people set their phones to reject calls with hidden numbers. For landline phones, people can ask Chunghwa Telecom for their "Call Filtering" service. This service will automatically reject calls that do not show a number or send them to voicemail.</p>
            <p>If you have an iOS phone, you can use the "Silence Unknown Callers" function. This will automatically silence calls from people not in your contacts or who you have not talked to before (including calls with hidden numbers). To do this, go to "Settings," then click on "Phone," and turn on "Silence Unknown Callers."</p>
            <p>If you have an Android phone, most models have a "Block unknown numbers" setting. This will directly reject calls with hidden numbers. To do this, open the "Phone" app, go to "Settings," find "Blocked numbers," and turn on "Block callers who are not shown" or "Block unknown numbers."</p>
            <p>The NCC suggests that if older family members do not know how to set this up, friends or family can help them. Or, they can take their phone to a nearby telecom service center and ask the staff for help.</p>

            <h1>Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi Dies at 101; His "Murayama Statement" Apologized for Colonial Rule and Aggression 50 Years After the War</h1>
            <p>Former Japanese Prime Minister Murayama Tomiichi died today in a hospital in Oita City. He was 101 years old. He passed away due to old age. Fifty years after World War II, Murayama made a statement called the "Murayama Statement." In it, he admitted that Japan had colonized and attacked other countries. He said that Japan wanted to face its history, admit its wrong actions, deeply reflect, and apologize. This was a very important moment in Japan's history of government.</p>
            <p>Oita TV reported that Murayama was born in Oita City on March 3, 1924. He was the sixth child out of eleven siblings.</p>
            <p>In June 1994, Murayama was chosen to be the 81st Prime Minister. This happened when the Liberal Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the New Party Sakigake formed a combined government. He was the first Prime Minister born in Oita Prefecture. In 1995, which was 50 years after World War II ended, he gave his "Murayama Statement."</p>
            <p>The "Murayama Statement" was approved by the cabinet and released on August 15, 1995. People had very different opinions about it. However, later Prime Ministers, Koizumi Junichiro and Abe Shinzo, used words like "deep reflection" from the "Murayama Statement" in their own speeches given 60 and 70 years after the war.</p>
            <p>But some people in Japan thought that the "Murayama Statement" unfairly blamed Japan for its past. They believed it hurt Japan's good name and national interests.</p>
            <p>This year, Murayama said in an interview that "admitting past mistakes, apologizing, and taking a stand as a peaceful country helps build trust with other Asian countries. This is also important for Japan's future." He also said, "I am very happy that later governments have continued (to use the statement) as a base for diplomatic relationships with Asian countries."</p>
            <p>Murayama said he would step down in January 1996. He was Prime Minister for 561 days. After he left office, he became the first leader of the "Social Democratic Party," which was the new name for the "Socialist Party." In 2000, he stopped taking part in elections for the House of Representatives and left politics. After that, he lived a quiet life at home with his family.</p>
            <p>When he turned 100 in 2024, Murayama said, "I don't especially feel like I'm 100 years old. I just live naturally and don't try to force things. I feel very happy to spend time with my family every day."</p>
            <p>Murayama lived to be 101 years old. Among all former Japanese Prime Ministers, only Higashikuni Naruhiko lived longer, to 102 years old.</p>

            <h1>LÃ¼ Jin-kai Found Not Guilty in 30-Year-Old Murder Case After New Trial; High Prosecutors Office Appeals</h1>
            <p>LÃ¼ Jin-kai, a baker, was involved in the murder of a female university student from National Chung Hsing University in 1993. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and this decision was final. After LÃ¼ Jin-kai asked for a new trial, the High Court agreed to it. In late September this year, the High Court decided he was not guilty. The High Prosecutors Office believes that the first trial did not have enough reasons for its decision. So, today they have asked for another appeal.</p>
            <p>In 1993, a female student from National Chung Hsing University was arranged by a tutoring center to go to an apartment on the third floor in Zhonghe City, Taipei County (now Zhonghe District, New Taipei City) for an interview. She died there. Police and prosecutors investigated. They believed that LÃ¼ Jin-kai, the baker who lived in the apartment, and his friend Chen Hsi-ching, who was staying with him, were strongly involved. Both men were arrested in early 1994.</p>
            <p>Police and prosecutors said that Chen Hsi-ching, who had a record of public indecency, was released on parole on December 17, 1993. He then went to stay with LÃ¼ Jin-kai, whom he had met in prison. On December 22 of the same month, Chen Hsi-ching pretended to look for a tutor. The tutoring center sent the female university student for an interview. Chen Hsi-ching and LÃ¼ Jin-kai worked together to overpower the student and sexually assault her. They also tied a knot around her neck with underwear, which caused her to die from not being able to breathe.</p>
            <p>In the first trial, Chen Hsi-ching and LÃ¼ Jin-kai were sentenced to death. The Supreme Court sent the case back many times. In the sixth retrial, the Taiwan High Court decided that LÃ¼ Jin-kai had tied underwear around the student's neck, but it did not kill her. It was Chen Hsi-ching who later decided to tie a fatal knot, which caused the student's death. Because of this, LÃ¼ Jin-kai was sentenced to 20 years in prison for using violence to sexually assault a woman and for attempted murder. Chen Hsi-ching was sentenced to death.</p>
            <p>After the sixth retrial, LÃ¼ Jin-kai decided not to appeal, and his sentence became final. Chen Hsi-ching continued to appeal. The Supreme Court sentenced Chen Hsi-ching to death in 2009, and this was final. LÃ¼ Jin-kai was released on parole in 2012. He asked for a new trial. The Taiwan High Court allowed a new trial. The prosecutor appealed this decision, and the Supreme Court canceled it and sent it back. In April this year, the High Court again decided to allow a new trial. After looking at the case, on September 25, they decided LÃ¼ Jin-kai was not guilty because there was not enough evidence.</p>
