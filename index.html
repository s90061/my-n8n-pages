            <h1>Canadian News: Canadian and Australian Warships Sail Through Taiwan Strait, Chinese Military Calls it a Challenge and Follows Closely</h1>
            <p>Many news outlets in Canada reported that Canadian and Australian warships went through the Taiwan Strait on the morning of September 6th, Taiwan time. Chinese navy and air force ships followed them closely. China said this action by Canada and Australia was "troubling and challenging." They also said it "sends wrong messages and makes safety risks higher." Even though China often protests, Western armies keep saying they have the right to pass through these waters.</p>
            <p>CTV and the Globe & Mail, two Canadian news channels, reported this news over the last two days. The Globe & Mail also said that Canada's military usually doesn't talk about these actions. But the warships going through the Taiwan Strait on the 6th seems to be the first time since February this year. It's also the first time since Mark Carney became the Prime Minister of Canada. Since he started his job, Carney has been trying to make the relationship between Ottawa and Beijing better.</p>
            <p>Early on September 6th, Taiwan time, the Canadian Navy frigate "HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec" and the Australian missile destroyer "HMAS Brisbane" entered the Taiwan Strait. Shi Yi, a spokesperson for China's People's Liberation Army Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement that evening that Chinese naval and air forces "watched and guarded" the Canadian and Australian warships the whole time. He added that they were "very careful and strongly protected national safety and peace in the area."</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense said that on the 6th, their military saw 21 Chinese planes (including drones) and 6 warships in the Taiwan Strait. They are "watching the situation closely." The Ministry of Defense also said that their military has "sent suitable navy and air forces to make sure the waterway is safe and stable."</p>
            <p>The Globe & Mail pointed out that most Western countries, like Canada, and the Taiwan government see the Taiwan Strait as international waters. In recent years, the United States and its allied armies have said they have the right to do "freedom of navigation" exercises in the Taiwan Strait. This has made China angry. China has also put more military forces in these important waters to put pressure on Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Halifax-class frigate "HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec" has been in the Western Pacific area since April this year. Canada says this deployment is "a big military action by the Canadian Armed Forces to help peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific area, supporting the international system based on international law."</p>
            <p>When Steve Boivin, the head of Canada's Joint Operations Command, announced this deployment, he said: "This deployment shows again that the Canadian Armed Forces are dedicated to international peace and safety efforts with their excellent military skills. Our ability to work easily with our allies makes us a very helpful partner for keeping the world stable."</p>
            <p>Before the Canadian and Australian warships went through the Taiwan Strait together, China was unhappy. This is because they took part in a joint exercise near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea with the Philippines, Canada, Australia, and the United States. This exercise happened on September 3rd, at the same time China was having a large military parade in Beijing.</p>
            <p>CTV reported that Wyatt Shorter, a spokesperson for Canada's Joint Operations Command, said earlier this week that the "HMCS Ville de QuÃ©bec" frigate was doing "Operation HORIZON." Shorter did not want to say if the Canadian frigate would go into the Taiwan Strait then. He only said that "talking about the detailed travel plans of ships being used goes against rules for military safety."</p>

            <h1>Chen Pei-chi: Ko Wen-je Hopes to Return to Hsinchu to See His Mother Immediately After Being Released on Bail on the 8th</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court decided to let Ko Wen-je, the former leader of the Taiwan People's Party, out on bail. Ko Wen-je's wife, Chen Pei-chi, said today that his lawyer told her Ko Wen-je's first wish is to go back to Hsinchu right away to see his mother. He also wants to "see where his father's ashes are kept. This is something he has always thought about."</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing the Jinghua City case. Ko Wen-je, who used to be the mayor of Taipei, asked to be released on bail earlier. On the 5th, the court agreed to release him on NT$70 million bail. But after talking to his lawyer, Ko Wen-je said he needed more time to think. The Taiwan People's Party said they are waiting for Ko Wen-je to tell his lawyer on the 8th that he agrees. Then, they will quickly finish the bail process at the court to welcome Ko Wen-je home.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi went to the Tucheng Detention Center tonight to encourage supporters. When she was on a live broadcast, she said thank you to "little grass" (supporters) for always supporting Ko Wen-je and never leaving him. Tomorrow, she hopes to pay Ko Wen-je's bail money at the Taipei District Court. After that, she hopes to go home with Ko Wen-je safely and smoothly.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that his lawyer told her Ko Wen-je's first wish is to go back to Hsinchu right away to see his mother. So, the plan for tomorrow, after he is released on bail, is to first go back to Hsinchu to see his mother. He also wants to "see where his father's ashes are kept. This is something he has always thought about."</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that on March 10th, the day of Ko Wen-je's father's funeral, Ko Wen-je tried hard to wait until his father was cremated and properly honored. But his request was not accepted. Not being able to be with his father was Ko Wen-je's biggest regret. So, "tomorrow he will visit his mother-in-law in Hsinchu and see where his father is." After that, he might need to seriously study how to deal with his court case.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi also said that the lawyer told her Ko Wen-je hopes to have a normal desk, chair, and lamp. This is because there are no tables or chairs in the Taipei Detention Center. He can only kneel or lie down to read things. Also, the lights are dim. Because of this, Ko Wen-je has almost hurt his eyes over the past year.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that tomorrow, a short meeting with everyone is also planned in front of the Taipei District Court. If there is enough time, Ko Wen-je will travel all over Taiwan, from north to south. He will "thank every person and group who gave him support and encouragement."</p>

            <h1>OPEC+ Main Oil Countries Decide to Produce Over 130,000 More Barrels of Oil Each Day Starting in October</h1>
            <p>Today, eight main member countries of OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) said they have agreed to produce more oil again. They plan to make 137,000 more barrels of oil each day starting in October.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that these eight countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman.</p>
            <p>The energy leaders of these countries said in a statement that they have decided to increase daily oil production by 137,000 barrels starting next month.</p>
            <p>To keep oil prices strong, OPEC+ agreed many times to produce less oil in recent years. But since April this year, these eight countries have changed their plan. They now want to get back more of the market share. So, they have agreed to increase oil production many times. Right now, world oil prices are around 60 US dollars per barrel, which is a relatively low price.</p>
