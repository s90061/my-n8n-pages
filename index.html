            <h1>Nobel Peace Prize News Might Have Been Leaked; Association Thinks It Was Spying</h1>
            <p>The Norwegian Nobel Association told Norwegian media today that the news about Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize might have been leaked early. The association thinks it was "very likely" an act of spying.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, on the betting website Polymarket, the chances of Machado winning the Peace Prize suddenly increased from 3.75% to almost 73% between the evening of October 9th and the early morning of October 10th. A few hours later, the winner of the Peace Prize was officially announced.</p>
            <p>However, at that time, no experts or media had named Machado as a likely winner.</p>
            <p>Kristian Berg Harpviken, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Institute and secretary of the Nobel Committee, told the Norwegian TV2 channel, "It is very likely an act of espionage."</p>
            <p>The day before, Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told the Norwegian News Agency (NTB) that he did not believe Machado's name had been leaked. He said, "I don't think there has ever been a leak in the history of the Peace Prize, and I find it hard to imagine this happening."</p>
            <p>Even so, Harpviken said the association will investigate further. He added that they would "strengthen security measures if needed."</p>
            <p>Harpviken explained that an act of spying "would make people think someone inside purposefully leaked information, but this is actually unlikely." He also said, "We cannot be 100% sure yet, but it's no secret that the Nobel Association is a target for spies."</p>
            <p>"Clearly, this association has always made certain people interested in getting information. These people could be countries or other groups, and their reasons could be political or financial."</p>
            <p>He said, "This kind of activity has been happening for decades."</p>
            <p>Harpviken did not reply to Agence France-Presse's request for comment.</p>
            <p>Only a very small number of people know the name of the winner chosen by the five members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee beforehand.</p>
            <p>In the past, Norwegian media had sometimes revealed unexpected winners early, which made people question if there were leaks. However, this has not happened in recent years.</p>
            <p>Machado is an opposition leader in Venezuela. The government stopped her from running in the 2024 election. The committee gave her the Peace Prize because she "worked hard to promote democratic rights in Venezuela and to help the country change peacefully from a dictatorship to a democracy."</p>

            <h1>Biden Is Getting Treatment for Aggressive Prostate Cancer</h1>
            <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden is getting radiation treatment and hormone therapy. This is to fight prostate cancer, which doctors found in May this year.</p>
            <p>Biden's spokesperson said that "President Biden is currently receiving radiation therapy and hormone therapy as part of his prostate cancer treatment plan." This was reported by Agence France-Presse.</p>
            <p>Biden's office announced in May this year that the 82-year-old former president went to the doctor because of problems with his urinary system. Doctors found a lump in his prostate. They then found out he had aggressive prostate cancer, and the cancer cells had moved to his bones.</p>
            <p>At that time, Biden wrote on social media platform X, "Cancer affects all of us. Like many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in our broken places. Thank you for your love and support."</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society says that prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, especially older men. Studies guess that about 80% of men over 80 years old have cancer cells in their prostate.</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society also said that if doctors find prostate cancer early, it can often be cured. However, it is still the second biggest cause of cancer death in men.</p>
            <p>Hormone therapy is a common way to treat it. It can make tumors smaller and slow down how fast the cancer grows, but it cannot cure it completely.</p>

            <h1>Man in Taichung Arrested for Drugged Driving, Causing One Death and One Injury at a Tea Shop</h1>
            <p>On October 9th, a man named Liu drove his car into a tea shop in West District, Taichung City, very early in the morning. This caused one mother and her child in the shop to die and another to be hurt. Tests showed that Liu had drugs in his urine. After he left the hospital today, he was sent to the authorities. He is accused of causing death by accident and endangering public safety. The Taichung District Court decided to keep him in prison and not let him see anyone.</p>
            <p>At 3:21 AM on October 9th, a car crashed at high speed into a tea shop at the crossroads of Wuquan West Road and Wuquan Road in Taichung City's West District. A mother died and her child was injured inside the shop. The 43-year-old driver, Mr. Liu, had drugs in his urine. After Mr. Liu was released from the hospital today, the police took him to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the prosecutor decided that Mr. Liu had committed serious crimes. These include driving under the influence of drugs, which caused someone's death, and using and having Class 2 drugs, which is against the law for preventing drug harm. In the future, he will face at least 3 years in prison for these crimes. He will also have to pay a lot of money in damages. The prosecutor believes he might try to run away. Also, because they still need to find out where the drugs came from, and there is a chance he might talk to other people involved, the prosecutor asked the Taichung District Court to keep him in prison and not let him see anyone. The Taichung District Court agreed.</p>
