A 21-year-old man, Zhou Zijun, went to a dental clinic in Taipei last month. He hit the female dentist, Ms. Shen, because he said the teeth cleaning hurt too much. Police found out that Chen Zhongyi, the head of Global Village, asked Xia Weiteng, a main member of the Zhulian Gang Jing'an Association, to handle a debt of ten million dollars. Yesterday, six people were arrested. The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office decided to keep Xia Weiteng and his helper Zhou Wenhan in custody because they thought they might do it again. So far, three people, including Zhou Zijun, are in custody.

Xia Weiteng, also known as "Xia An," said that Chen Zhongyi did ask him to deal with the debt. But he said he never scared the dentist. He said he only talked to her calmly about how to give back the mortgage papers. He also said he didn't know Zhou Zijun and didn't tell him to hit the dentist. He didn't know why she was hit.

Ms. Shen, the dentist, said she lent Chen Zhongyi 15 million dollars. But he didn't pay her back. After she won in court, he still tried to get his mortgage papers back by asking gang members for help. She said he just wanted to take her money.

Police found that Chen Zhongyi borrowed 15 million dollars from Ms. Shen and another man named Liu. Chen used house papers as a guarantee and gave them to Ms. Shen. In April this year, Chen asked Xia Weiteng to "deal with" getting the mortgage papers back. Liu was also threatened because of this.

The police found that Xia Weiteng, Yan Daozhi, and Zhou Wenhan went to Ms. Shen's dental clinic to talk. They used their gang's name, which made her afraid. Because they couldn't agree, they are thought to have told Zhou Zijun to pretend to get a teeth cleaning and then hurt Ms. Shen.

On the day Ms. Shen was hit, her clinic's air conditioning needed fixing, so she didn't have appointments in the morning. But Zhou Zijun came in and insisted on seeing her. He saw a camera in front of the dental chair and kept asking to change seats. Luckily, Ms. Shen didn't change seats, so the violent event was recorded. Because Ms. Shen was almost badly hurt, the prosecutor had already approved keeping Zhou Zijun in custody. Today, the court decided to keep Xia Weiteng and Zhou Wenhan in custody too. So now, three people are in custody for the whole case.

**May 2025 Was Second Hottest Ever, High Chance for 2025 to Be Among Top 5 Hottest Years**

Taiwan's Central Weather Administration said today that May 2025 was the second hottest May ever recorded. This information comes from the newest global climate reports by the European Copernicus Climate Change Service and the U.S. National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). The average temperature around the world was 1.4 degrees Celsius higher than before the industrial age. The NCEI also said that 2025 will very likely be one of the five hottest years in history, with more than a 99% chance.

In May, many places around the world had very high temperatures. On May 24, the United Arab Emirates had its hottest May day ever at 51.6 degrees Celsius. Iceland had its worst May heatwave ever, with over 90% of its weather stations recording new high temperatures for May. France also had a bad heatwave in May. The country's highest temperature reached 30.5 degrees Celsius on May 30, making it the hottest May ever for France. This was only the second time since 1947 that the temperature went above 30 degrees Celsius in May.

The Central Weather Administration also noted that the ice in the Arctic Ocean has been at its lowest level for this time of year since the beginning of 2025. Although it went up a little in April, May still had the lowest amount of sea ice in the last five years. The ice is melting faster than usual. The situation for sea ice in the Antarctic is also serious, with some areas having almost no ice at all.

The weather agency also said that the world's oceans are having "marine heatwaves," meaning they are unusually warm. This is greatly affecting ocean life and the environment and economy along the coasts. It could also make climate change worse.

The weather agency pointed out that global warming continues to affect all areas. The average global temperature from January to May 2025 was the second highest ever recorded. The NCEI also believes that 2025 has a very high chance (over 99%) of being one of the five hottest years on record.

**Guangzhou Jinan University Removed from Taiwan's List of Recognized Chinese Universities for First Time in 10 Years**

Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved universities and higher education schools in mainland China. The list now has 154 universities and 191 special colleges. Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. This is the first time the list has changed in almost ten years. After removing Jinan University, the list still has 154 universities and 191 special colleges.

Education Minister Cheng Ying-yao said earlier this year at a meeting of university presidents that schools linked to China's United Front Work Department have a special purpose and are not just for academics. He said it is necessary to stop working with them, and the Ministry of Education will no longer recognize degrees from these schools in the future.

The Ministry of Education recently updated its list and officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University. The Ministry said that since 2019, Jinan University in mainland China has been controlled by the United Front Work Department. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment, the Ministry decided to remove Guangzhou Jinan University from the list because student learning places should not have specific political goals.

The Ministry of Education also said again that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, organized, fair, respectful, and beneficial to both sides. Schools that plan exchange activities for students in China should follow Taiwan's policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of the activity, the organizers, the travel plans, and any promotional materials. These activities should not have political goals or content. Schools should also avoid getting free trips from China or helping with China's policies and political messages.

Additionally, the Ministry of Education said that if schools have questions about the organizers or plans of an activity, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. Taiwan still hopes to encourage young students from both sides to learn together and understand each other better. However, when exchanging, students should be aware of possible risks and check the background of the organizers and if there are any specific political goals.
