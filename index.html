            <h1>Trump Asks Thailand and Cambodia to Stop Fighting, or No Trade Deals</h1>
            <p>On July 26, the fight between Thailand and Cambodia reached its third day. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, said today that he talked to both the Prime Minister of Cambodia, Hun Manet, and the acting Prime Minister of Thailand. He asked them to stop fighting. He also said that the U.S. is talking to both countries about trade. If they continue to fight, the U.S. will not make any trade deals with either country.</p>
            <p>News from outside the country said that the long-running border problem between Thailand and Cambodia got much worse on July 24. Both sides used fighter planes, big guns, tanks, and soldiers on the ground. This has been the worst fight between them in many years, and at least 33 people have died. Many others were hurt.</p>
            <p>Trump is in Scotland right now. Today, he wrote on his social media page, "Truth Social," that he talked to Hun Manet, the Cambodian Prime Minister. They talked about ending the "war" with Thailand. After that, he also talked to Phumtham Wechayachai, the acting Prime Minister of Thailand. He asked him to stop the "war" as well.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the U.S. is currently talking to Thailand and Cambodia about trade. But if the two countries keep fighting, the U.S. will not agree to any deals with either of them.</p>
            <p>After he talked to the acting Prime Minister of Thailand, Trump wrote again. He said they had a "good talk." Both Thailand and Cambodia want to stop fighting and have peace right away. Then, he sent this message to Cambodia.</p>
            <p>Trump said he is "trying to make this difficult situation simpler." This fight has caused many people to be hurt or die. He said it reminded him of a past fight between Pakistan and India.</p>
            <p>Trump had said before that with help from the U.S., India and Pakistan agreed to stop fighting completely.</p>

            <h1>Gaza Civil Defense: Israeli Attacks in Many Areas Kill 11 People</h1>
            <p>On July 26, in Gaza City, the Civil Defense in the Gaza Strip said that Israel's military actions there today caused 11 deaths in total. This area of Palestine has been affected by war for more than 21 months.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for the Civil Defense in the Gaza Strip, told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that four of the dead Palestinians were killed in an air attack in the Rimal area of northern Gaza City.</p>
            <p>The Gaza Civil Defense also said that one person was shot dead in the northwest of Gaza City. At that time, "Israeli soldiers shot at groups of people waiting for help." People who saw this told AFP that thousands of people were gathered there, waiting for supplies.</p>
            <p>Also, the Gaza Civil Defense said that another man died near Khan Yunis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip, from a drone attack. And one person died in the Al-Bureij refugee camp in the middle of the Gaza Strip because of gunfire.</p>
            <p>When AFP asked the Israeli military about these events, they said they would look into them.</p>
            <p>The Israeli military also put out a statement. They said they are continuing their military actions in the Gaza Strip. They killed several members of a "terrorist group" who had placed a bomb to attack Israeli soldiers.</p>

            <h1>All Recall Cases Failed: Tong Zixian Says He Is Calm</h1>
            <p>On July 26, in Taipei, the first group of recall votes all failed. Tong Zixian, the chairman of Pegatron, who had openly supported the recalls, said tonight that "this is a win for Taiwan's democracy." He also shared that he has felt very calm since last night, and he was not worried about the voting.</p>
            <p>Today, people voted on whether to remove 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and the suspended Hsinchu City Mayor, Kao Hung-An, from their positions. All the recall efforts did not pass. KMT lawmaker Fu Kun-Chi announced around 5:46 PM that his recall effort had failed.</p>
            <p>Tong Zixian, from Ruisui Township in Hualien, recently said he supported removing Fu Kun-Chi. He also claimed that the Hualien County government stopped donations for earthquake relief. This caused County Commissioner Hsu Chen-Wei and Fu Kun-Chi to strongly deny it and sue for defamation. Both sides argued about where the donations went and who was responsible.</p>
            <p>About the recall results not passing, Tong Zixian only said, "Congratulations, this is a victory for Taiwan's democratic system. Through this vote, our society has become more grown-up."</p>
            <p>Tong Zixian said that he has felt very calm from last night until today. He watched baseball and listened to music and was not worried about the vote at all.</p>
