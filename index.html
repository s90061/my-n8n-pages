            <h1>AI Outlook Good, Wins Monopoly Case; Alphabet's Value Reaches US$3 Trillion</h1>
            <p>Mountain View, California, September 15 (Reuters) â€“ Google's parent company, Alphabet, reached a market value of US$3 trillion for the first time today. This happened because people are feeling more positive about artificial intelligence (AI), and a judge made a good decision for the company in an antitrust case.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Alphabet's Class A shares went up by 3.6% to US$249.1. Its Class C shares went up by 3.4% to US$249.5. Both types of shares reached their highest prices ever.</p>
            <p>Including today's increase, Alphabet's stock price has gone up by more than 32% this year. This is the best performance among the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks in the US. Its growth is better than the S&P 500 index, which increased by 12.5%.</p>
            <p>Alphabet has joined big tech companies like Apple and Microsoft, which also have a market value of US$3 trillion. Nvidia, the world's most valuable AI chip maker, has a market value of US$4.25 trillion.</p>
            <p>The newest good news for Alphabet came from a US court decision. It allows Alphabet to keep control of its Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system. This decision is very important for Alphabet because its strong position in search and mobile systems has been looked at carefully for a long time.</p>
            <p>The court said that even though sharing data would help Google's advertising rivals, Google does not need to split up Chrome or Android. This removes a big worry for investors, who see these two businesses as key parts of Google's overall work.</p>
            <p>Alphabet's cloud computing part saw its income grow by almost 32% in the second quarter. This was more than what experts expected. This happened because the company's investments in its own chips and the Gemini AI model started to work well, making investors even more confident. (Edited by: Chang Hsiao-wen) 1140916</p>

            <p>London, September 15 (Reuters) â€“ Most major European stock markets finished higher today. This happened as investors got ready for the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to possibly cut interest rates later this week.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London dropped slightly by 6.26 points, or 0.07%, closing at 9277.03 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went up by 50.71 points, or 0.21%, closing at 23748.86 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris rose by 71.69 points, or 0.92%, closing at 7896.93 points. (Edited by: Chen Yen-chun) 1140916</p>

            <h1>Swedish Pole Vaulter Duplantis Wins Gold and Breaks World Record Again at World Athletics Championships</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, September 15 (Reuters) â€“ The World Athletics Championships are in their third day today in Tokyo, Japan. Armand Duplantis, the Swedish "pole vault king," won a gold medal in the men's pole vault final by clearing 6.30 meters. He also set a new world record.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters and other news, Duplantis had already won the gold medal after jumping over 6.15 meters. But he decided to raise the bar by another 15 centimeters. On his third try, he successfully jumped over 6.30 meters. This broke his own world record of 6.29 meters, which he set last month in Budapest.</p>
            <p>Duplantis not only won the men's pole vault gold medal at the World Athletics Championships again, making it his third win in a row, but he also broke the world record for the 14th time in his career. He had also won gold medals in pole vault at the Paris and Tokyo Olympics.</p>
            <p>Emmanouil Karalis from Greece won the silver medal with a jump of 6 meters. Kurtis Marschall from Australia won the bronze medal with a jump of 5.95 meters. (Edited by: Chen Cheng-chien) 1140915</p>
