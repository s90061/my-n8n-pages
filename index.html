            <h1>Israeli Minister Prays at Al-Aqsa Mosque; Turkey Strongly Criticizes</h1>
            <p>Today, Turkey strongly criticized Israel's far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir. He prayed in the area of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Ben Gvir publicly performed a Jewish prayer in the Al-Aqsa Mosque area today. This action caused much argument.</p>
            <p>The Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest place for Muslims. It is also where the Temple Mount, the holiest place for Jewish people, is located.</p>
            <p>The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement: "We strongly condemn some Israeli ministers for entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque. They were with Israeli police and Israeli settler groups."</p>
            <p>The statement added: "Keeping Al-Aqsa Mosque safe and protecting Jerusalem's holy status is important not just for the region. It is also a shared duty for all people."</p>
            <p>For a long time, there has been an agreement between Israel and Jordan, which manages the Al-Aqsa Mosque. This agreement does not allow Jewish ceremonies in the mosque area.</p>
            <p>But in recent years, Jewish visitors, including Israeli lawmakers, have often broken this agreement. This agreement is known as "keeping the current situation."</p>

            <h1>African Migrant Boat Sinks Off Yemen, 68 Dead, 74 Missing</h1>
            <p>An official from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Yemen said that a boat with 154 African migrants sank off the coast of Yemen. 68 people died, and 74 people are still missing.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that this sad event is the latest in many boat accidents off Yemen. These accidents have killed hundreds of African migrants. These migrants hope to find work in rich Gulf countries.</p>
            <p>Abdusattor Esoev, head of the IOM mission in Yemen, told the Associated Press that the boat carried 154 migrants from Ethiopia. It sank early today near Abyan province in southern Yemen.</p>
            <p>He said that 54 bodies washed ashore in Khanfar district. Another 14 bodies were taken to a hospital morgue in Zinjibar, the main city of Abyan province.</p>
            <p>Esoev stated that only 12 people survived and were rescued. The other missing people are believed to be dead.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that IOM said many unofficial migrants from Africa continue to arrive in Yemen.</p>
            <p>Every year, migrants use simple boats to travel from Yemen across the Bab al-Mandab Strait, between Djibouti and Eritrea. They hope to reach Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries to find work.</p>
            <p>IOM calls the route from the Horn of Africa to Yemen "one of the most dangerous and busiest mixed migration routes in the world." Last year, IOM recorded over 60,000 migrants arriving in Yemen.</p>
            <p>"Mixed migration" means people move for different reasons. This includes children without adults, people moving because of the environment, victims of human trafficking, stuck migrants, people seeking safety, and refugees.</p>

            <h1>Canadian Official: Trump and Carney Might Talk Soon</h1>
            <p>Today, a Canadian official said that U.S. President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Carney will likely talk "in the next few days." This comes after the U.S. announced higher taxes, 35%, on all Canadian goods not covered by the "U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Dominic LeBlanc, the Canadian minister in charge of U.S.-Canada trade, also told CBS News' "Face the Nation" show that he felt "encouraged" by recent talks. He believes an agreement to lower these taxes is still possible.</p>
            <p>LeBlanc said: "We are encouraged by our talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. But we still need to reach an agreement that is best for both economies, and that has not happened yet."</p>
            <p>He said that he expects Carney and Trump to talk "in the coming days."</p>
            <p>LeBlanc said: "We believe that an agreement to lower some taxes and make investing more certain is an option."</p>
            <p>When Washington recently announced the taxes on Canada, one reason given was that Canada failed to stop the illegal trade of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller.</p>
