            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Wins Against Lu Guangzu from China, Reaches BWF Arctic Open Semifinals</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's top badminton player, Chou Tien-chen, played for 80 minutes in the men's singles quarterfinals at the BWF Super 500 Arctic Open in Finland today. He came back from behind to beat China's Lu Guangzu with scores of 15-21, 21-17, and 21-18. This win not only puts him in the semifinals but also marks his third straight victory against Lu.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen, who is ranked 5th in the world by the Badminton World Federation (BWF), is trying to win the men's singles title again at the Arctic Open. Today, in the quarterfinals, he played against Lu Guangzu, who is ranked 15th in the world. Before this match, Chou had won 7 out of 9 games against Lu.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first game, both players were trying to see how the other would play. When the score was 4-4, Lu Guangzu started to play faster and attacked more. He slowly got more points and won the first game.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the second game, Chou Tien-chen was still having a hard time. After playing for 7 times, he was behind by 9-14 at one point. But then he scored 6 points in a row and took the lead. After they tied 3 more times, Chou Tien-chen scored 5 points in a row when the score was 16-17. This helped him win the second game.</p>
            <p>In the third and final game, both players fought hard. They kept scoring one point after another. In the middle of the game, they tied 10 times. Chou Tien-chen got a small lead of 14-12, but then Lu Guangzu scored 5 points in a row and went ahead.</p>
            <p>But Chou Tien-chen did not give up. He played very well by hitting the shuttlecock to all four corners of the court. He also used openings to attack successfully. He won the game by scoring 7 points to 1, taking the victory. Chou Tien-chen also pumped his fist many times on the court, showing he did not want to lose.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen has played all 3 games in every match since the first round of 32. In the semifinals, he will play against Arnaud Merkle from France, who is ranked 45th in the world. They have played only once before, which was in the first round of last year's Arctic Open, where Chou Tien-chen won in 2 straight games.</p>

            <h1>Trump: No Reason to Meet Xi Jinping Anymore, Plans to Raise Tariffs on China Greatly</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 11 (AFP) - Today, former US President Donald Trump said that he no longer thinks it's necessary to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping this month. He also criticized China for its unfriendly trade actions and threatened to put "massive" tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Trump wrote a long message on his social media platform, "Truth Social." He said, "Some very strange things are happening in China! They have become very hostile." He also criticized China for controlling the export of rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>In his post, he said, "I was planning to meet President Xi at the APEC meeting in Korea in two weeks, but now it seems there is no reason to do so." Trump posted this message while he was going to a military hospital near Washington D.C. for a health check-up.</p>
            <p>Trump pointed out that China has sent letters to many countries around the world. These letters explain that China will control the export of "every production element related to rare earths, and almost all products they can think of, even if they are not made in China."</p>
            <p>He wrote, "China must not be allowed to 'hold the world hostage' with this, but it seems that this has been their plan all along." He also said that even though the US and China have had a good relationship for the past six months, China has clearly been "waiting for a chance in secret."</p>
            <p>Trump stated, "One of the plans we are thinking about right now is to greatly increase the tariffs on Chinese goods coming into the United States." He added that the US is also looking into "many other ways to respond."</p>
            <p>Trump noted that other countries have also contacted the US. They have complained about China's "extreme trade hostility," saying that this hostility "appeared without any warning."</p>
            <p>He also said that he has not talked to Xi Jinping about this matter yet.</p>
            <p>Trump described China's actions as "creating a monopoly in magnets and other elements." He believes this is "to say the least, a very sneaky and unfriendly action."</p>
