The United States is increasing its control over chip technology in China by planning to cancel existing permissions. These permissions currently allow foreign chipmakers like Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC to use American technology in their factories in China. These special permissions were given after the US first put strict export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022, offering some flexibility to important allies. China is still the world's biggest market for semiconductors, and having production in China is crucial for South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies financially. The decision to end these technology permissions for allied companies in China is a very important moment for US tech policy.

**SATS Climbs Fortune Southeast Asia 500 List Due to Air Travel Recovery and Acquisition**

SATS, a company based in Singapore that offers various aviation services like food preparation, air cargo handling, and passenger services, has significantly improved its position in the Fortune Southeast Asia 500 list. Its revenue tripled in 2024, moving the company up 134 places to No. 93. This success is mainly due to the strong recovery of air travel and SATS's important acquisition of Worldwide Flight Services (WFS). The company's most recent financial report for the quarter ending March 2025 showed a 13% increase in revenue year-on-year, reaching 5.8 billion Singapore dollars, driven by increased business volume and contributions from its expanded network. SATS aims to achieve 8 billion Singapore dollars in revenue by the end of its 2029 fiscal year, supported by its larger network, growing passenger numbers in Asia-Pacific, and Singapore's role as an aviation hub.
