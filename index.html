            <h1>Medical Centers Face Shortage of Pathology Doctors; Hospitals Offer Better Pay and Workplaces to Attract Staff</h1>
            <p>Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou is offering a high monthly salary of NT$650,000 for a pathology doctor. This has caught people's attention. Chen Chien-chung, the head of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, said today that work in big hospitals is often complex. Some doctors prefer simpler medical jobs. So, the hospital is trying to attract doctors by offering better pay and improving the work environment.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Society of Pathology recently posted an announcement on its website. The title was "Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital is looking for a doctor for its Anatomic Pathology department." The announcement mentioned "a guaranteed monthly salary of NT$650,000 for the first year. This is good pay and shows the value of your skills." It also said doctors would get 28 days of special leave each year. The hospital also promised fair work distribution and reasonable work hours.</p>
            <p>This news caused a discussion among medical staff online. Chen Chien-chung, the head of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, confirmed today in a phone interview with CNA that they are indeed looking for a pathology doctor. There are not many training spots for pathology doctors in Taiwan. Also, many pathology doctors from the hospital have left to work in smaller clinics that deal with pathology.</p>
            <p>He said that many hospitals are looking for staff, not just for pathology. Doctors in emergency rooms, nurses, and pharmacists also face this problem. This is because work in big hospitals is more complicated. It includes teaching and evaluations. Some people prefer simpler medical work, and hospitals must respect their career choices.</p>
            <p>Chen Chien-chung also said that besides better pay, the hospital is working to improve the work environment to attract staff. For example, in the pathology department, they are slowly using AI tools to help diagnose diseases. They also hope to make young doctors interested in research so they find working at a big hospital interesting.</p>
            <p>Cheng Yung-ming, the head of the Taiwan Society of Pathology, said that the society does not like it when hospitals try to steal doctors from each other by offering high salaries. This is because they want to keep the quality of pathology reports high. He said there is a temporary shortage now because new doctors are still in training. But because working in pathology has good benefits, like a better life quality, he expects the situation to get better in a few years.</p>

            <h1>Stopping Help for School Electricity Bills Causes Debate; Ministry of Education Says It's Returning to Normal Financial Rules</h1>
            <p>Taipei and New Taipei cities said that the central government will stop helping pay for electricity for public and private schools next year. The Ministry of Education said today that for the year 2025, the central government will pay all the extra electricity costs. This is a temporary plan. From 2026 onwards, the old way of handling money will be used again. The Ministry of Education also said that education policies should not be used for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the New Taipei City government announced that the central government will stop helping schools with electricity bills from next year. This will affect almost 400,000 students in New Taipei City. So, the mayor of New Taipei City, Hou Yu-ih, said that the city government will pay the yearly electricity cost of about NT$710 million. Taipei City Mayor Chiang Wan-an also said today that they should not let children suffer. He asked the central government to stop this plan. He also said that Taipei City will set aside more than NT$660 million to pay for the electricity for now.</p>
            <p>In response, Cabinet spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said today that because of the new "Financial Equalization Law," local governments will get NT$416.5 billion more in shared taxes next year. This means local governments will have enough money to pay for education and other things. So, the help for schools' electricity and water bills should be handled by the local city and county governments again.</p>
            <p>This evening, the Ministry of Education added in a press release that the Cabinet had already decided in meetings on March 27 and July 8, 2024. They decided that the special electricity prices for schools up to high school and the money for frozen electricity price differences should be paid by local governments from their own budgets.</p>
            <p>Some news said that the plan for 2026 is like "cutting off all help at once." The Ministry of Education said this is not true. They explained that for 2025, because there was little time to plan budgets, the central government will pay all the extra costs. This is to make sure local governments have enough time to adjust and school operations are not affected. The Ministry of Education set aside NT$5.9 billion to keep all schools running without problems. This is a temporary step.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education pointed out that for 2025, the central government has already paid all the extra electricity costs for schools, so local governments do not have to pay extra. From 2026, it will go back to the normal financial system, based on existing rules. It is not taking away help completely.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education stressed that it always cares about students' right to learn and their study environment. For 2025, it took on all the extra electricity costs, showing the central government's strong support for education. If this policy is wrongly called an immediate stop to help, it is not true. It could also make people misunderstand and worry. Education policies are important for children's learning and should not be used for political reasons.</p>

            <h1>Yu Darvish's 6 Strong Innings Help Padres Beat Dodgers; Both Teams Now Tied for First Place in Division</h1>
            <p>San Diego, August 22 (CNA) â€“ In Major League Baseball (MLB) today, the San Diego Padres played against the Los Angeles Dodgers at home. Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish pitched for 6 innings and gave up only 1 run. This helped the Padres win the game 2 to 1. Now, both teams are tied for first place in the National League West division.</p>
            <p>Yu Darvish pitched for 6 innings and allowed only one solo home run, which means he gave up 1 run. He also struck out 5 batters and walked 1. He got the win for the game. His record for the season is now 3 wins and 3 losses, and his ERA (a measure of how many runs a pitcher allows) is now 5.36.</p>
            <p>After Yu Darvish left the game, three Padres relief pitchers came in: Jason Adam, Mason Miller, and Robert Suarez. They pitched for 3 innings together and did not give up any runs. Robert Suarez got his 34th "save" of the season. This makes him the top reliever in Major League Baseball for now.</p>
            <p>Blake Snell, a left-handed pitcher for the Dodgers, also played well. He pitched for 7 innings, allowed 6 hits, and gave up 2 runs. He struck out 5 batters and walked 2. However, his teammates did not score enough runs to help him win. So, he got his second loss of the season.</p>
            <p>Shohei Ohtani, the Japanese star player for the Dodgers who can both pitch and hit, did not hit well today. He had 3 chances to hit but did not get any hits. He only got 1 "walk" (when a pitcher throws four balls outside the strike zone, and the batter gets to go to first base). His batting average went down to .283. So far this season, he has hit 44 home runs and brought in 83 runs for his team.</p>
            <p>After the Padres beat the Dodgers, both teams now have a record of 73 wins and 56 losses in the regular season. Their winning percentage is .566. They are now tied for first place in the National League West division.</p>
