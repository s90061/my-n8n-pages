            <h1>Israel's Army: Fighting in Gaza Will Not Stop Until Hostages Are Free</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Jerusalem, August 1st) The head of Israel's army, Sami, said today that if talks with Hamas do not quickly lead to the release of the people they took, the fighting in Gaza will not stop.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Sami (Eyal Zamir) spoke to Israeli officers in Gaza. He said, "I think in the next few days we will know if we can agree to free our hostages. If not, the fighting will continue and not stop." This statement was in a press release from the Israeli army.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army also released a video showing Sami watching soldiers in a command center.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that Hamas attacked Israel on October 7th, 2023. They took 251 people. 49 of these people are still in Gaza, which Hamas controls. 27 of them have died.</p>
            <p>This week, some Palestinian armed groups shared two videos. In these videos, some of the people taken looked thin and weak.</p>
            <p>Israel and Hamas talked about a ceasefire and freeing the people. The United States, Egypt, and Qatar helped with these talks. But the talks ended in July. After that, some Israelis wanted stronger military action.</p>
            <p>However, Israel is also facing more pressure from other countries and from people in Israel. They want Israel to try again to agree on a ceasefire with Hamas. Many families of the people taken are asking for this.</p>
            <p>At the same time, groups that give help to people said that people in Gaza are facing a big problem with not enough food. This is because Israel has limited the help that can come in. (Translator: Chang Cheng-chien / Editor: Ho Hung-ju) 1140802</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Brings Floods and Landslides to Thailand, Killing 6 and Affecting Over 230,000 People</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Bangkok, August 2nd) The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation in Thailand said today that since July 21st, floods and landslides caused by Typhoon Wipha have killed 6 people across Thailand. More than 230,000 people have been affected.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that heavy rain from Wipha caused floods in 12 provinces in Thailand. Most of these areas are in the north or middle of the country, according to information from the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation.</p>
            <p>Videos shared online show dirty floodwaters, sandbags piled outside houses, and people using rubber boats to move through flooded streets.</p>
            <p>Luckily, the Thai weather office thinks the rain will become less in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Thailand has monsoon rains every year from May to October. But scientists say that human-caused climate change is making weather more extreme. This makes it more likely for very strong floods to happen.</p>
            <p>In 2011, Thailand had a very big flood. Over 500 people died, and millions of homes were damaged. (Translator: Lin Yi-feng / Editor: Chang Cheng-chien) 1140802</p>

            <h1>Hawks Beat Dragons Because of Rain; Foreign Pitcher Hagens Gets 10th Win This Season</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Reporter Chen Jung-chen, Taipei, August 2nd) Today, the TSG Hawks played the Wei Chuan Dragons at home. The Hawks won 5 to 1 because of the rain. Their foreign pitcher, Hagens, pitched well for 5 innings and only allowed 1 run. Hagens is the first pitcher this season to win 10 games. He has also won 20 games in a row over two seasons.</p>
            <p>The Hawks are playing well in the second half of the season. In the first inning against the Dragons, Wang Bo-hsuan hit a single. The Dragons' foreign pitcher, Aaron Leasher, was not throwing accurately. Because of this, Steven Moya, Chang Chao-yuan, and Wang Po-jung all walked. Kuo Fu-lin was hit by a pitch, and Tseng Yu-chin also walked. This helped the Hawks score 3 runs in one inning.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 4th inning, the Hawks scored again. Wu Nien-ting hit a double to left field. Then, Yen Yu-hsuan, who came in to bat, hit a single to center field. This added another safe run for the team. In the top of the 5th inning, the Dragons scored 1 run back. But in the bottom of the 5th inning, "The Great King" Wang Po-jung hit a home run to right field. The game stopped early because of rain, and the Hawks won by 4 runs at home.</p>
            <p>In this game, the Hawks' foreign pitcher Bradin Hagens started the game. He pitched for 5 innings and allowed 5 hits, but only 1 run. He also struck out 2 batters. He is the first pitcher in the Chinese Professional Baseball League this season to reach 10 wins. He has also won 20 games in a row over two seasons. He has not lost a game since he joined the Hawks, and he has not lost in almost 2 years.</p>
            <p>The Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions, who won the first half of the season, played against the Fubon Guardians today. Their foreign pitcher, Felix Pena, pitched for 7 innings and only allowed 1 run. Also, their catcher Chen Chung-yu and Chen Sheng-ping hit home runs one after another in the top of the 7th inning. The Lions won 5 to 3 and have now won 3 games in a row. (Editor: Lung Po-an) 1140802</p>
