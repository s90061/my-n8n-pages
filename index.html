            <h1>Very Heavy Rain Warning for Taichung, Pingtung, Taitung; 9 Other Areas Should Watch for Heavy Rain</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's weather office updated its warning this evening. Some parts of Taitung, Pingtung's Hengchun Peninsula, and Taichung's mountains will have heavy or very heavy rain. Nine other areas, including Yilan and Hualien, should prepare for heavy rain. People should be careful of lightning, strong winds, and rising river levels. Low areas should watch out for floods. Also, because it has been raining for many days, mountain areas should be aware of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau continues to update the heavy rain warning. Clouds from a typhoon and a low-pressure system are causing short periods of strong rain. Today, Taitung County, Hengchun Peninsula, and Taichung City's mountain areas might have heavy or very heavy rain. There is also a chance of heavy rain in areas from Taoyuan to Taichung, Hualien, Green Island, Orchid Island, Yilan, central Taiwan, and Pingtung's mountains.</p>

            <h1>Possible Phone Battery Fire on Tokyo Train Stops Service Briefly</h1>
            <p>This evening, a train on the JR Yamanote Line, a main transportation line in Tokyo, Japan, was traveling between Shinjuku Station and Shin-Okubo Station. There was a suspected phone battery fire, and smoke filled the train. The train stopped suddenly, but the fire was quickly put out. No one was hurt.</p>
            <p>Japanese media, including NHK, reported that the police department received a call around 4 PM today (3 PM Taiwan time). Someone reported a "phone battery fire on the JR Yamanote Line." Luckily, people quickly put out the fire with an extinguisher, and no one was injured. Twenty-four emergency vehicles, including fire trucks and ambulances, were waiting outside Shinjuku Station.</p>
            <p>JR East company said that the phone battery fire happened inside a train on the JR Yamanote Line's inner loop (going counter-clockwise) while it was moving between Shinjuku Station and Shin-Okubo Station.</p>
            <p>To check if everything was safe, trains on both the inner loop and outer loop (going clockwise) of the JR Yamanote Line stopped at about 4:10 PM. They started running again around 5 PM.</p>
            <p>When the event happened, the train car was full of smoke. Some passengers got off and walked next to the tracks. Station staff guided these passengers to Shin-Okubo Station, which was nearby.</p>
            <p>Other train lines, like the Chuo Line and Saikyo Line, also stopped for a short time because of this. But after making sure it was safe, these trains also started running again one by one. The police department and the Tokyo Fire Department are carefully looking into why this happened.</p>
