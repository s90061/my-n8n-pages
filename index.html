            <h1>Ministry of Defense Says Reports on Military Changes Are Not True</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30 (CNA) Some news reports said that Lieutenant General Lin Wen-hsiang, head of the Armaments Bureau, will become the head of the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST). They also said that Lieutenant General Li Shih-chiang, the current NCSIST head, will become the permanent deputy minister of defense. The Ministry of National Defense said that these reports are not true. It asked the media to check their facts carefully so they do not give wrong information.</p>
            <p>Mirror Media reported last night that Mr. Lin Wen-hsiang would become the head of NCSIST because there have been many problems with buying military equipment. The report also said that Lieutenant General Chao Ya-ping, director of the Ministry of National Defense's Procurement Office, would become the head of the Armaments Bureau. It also stated that Lieutenant General Wan Wen-cho, deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, would change his job. So, Lieutenant General Huang Yu-min, the permanent deputy minister of defense, would move to become the deputy secretary-general of the National Security Council, and Lieutenant General Li Shih-chiang, the NCSIST head, would become the permanent deputy minister of defense.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense released a statement today. It said that the news reports about "important military job changes" are just guesses. The Ministry of National Defense explained that all military job changes follow rules like the "Act for the Appointment of Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force." They choose the best person for a job by looking at the job's type, what tasks need to be done, and the person's experience. They follow a process to choose and recommend people.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense said that these guessed reports are not true. It asked everyone to check facts carefully to avoid giving wrong information.</p>

            <h1>Prosecutor in Ko Case Promoted, Minister of Justice Says It Followed Law</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30 (CNA) On July 28, the Ministry of Justice announced changes to prosecutor jobs. Lin Chun-yen, a prosecutor from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, was promoted to chief prosecutor. People outside the government questioned if this was because he worked on cases related to Ko Wen-je, the former Taipei mayor. Justice Minister Cheng Ming-chien said today that he chose Lin according to the law.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chien went to the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee this morning to give a special report and answer questions. He made these comments before the meeting.</p>
            <p>On July 28, the Ministry of Justice announced that Prosecutor Lin Chun-yen from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office would become the chief prosecutor for the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office. The Taiwan People's Party posted on Facebook, saying, "Half of this honor belongs to Ko Wen-je. Without him, there would be no Chief Prosecutor Lin today."</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chien explained that a chief prosecutor is chosen through a vote by prosecutors, a review and recommendation by the Prosecutors' Review Committee. He then officially selects the person following the law.</p>
            <p>Kuomintang lawmaker Wu Tsung-hsien said in an interview that not many prosecutors nationwide are promoted to chief prosecutor. Taipei District Prosecutors Office alone appointed six. He asked if prosecutors in central and southern Taiwan are not working hard. He wanted to ask the Justice Minister why the number of promotions for Taipei District Prosecutors Office prosecutors has been increasing each year. He questioned if it was because the Taipei office "listened more."</p>

            <h1>UK to Recognize Palestine in September Unless Israel Agrees to Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>London, July 29 (CNA) British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced today that the UK will officially recognize the state of Palestine in September. This will only change if Israel takes "real steps," like agreeing to a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that this important step is part of Starmer's "lasting peace" plan. The British leader had called an urgent meeting with his ministers earlier about the worsening situation in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Besides the UK, France also announced recently that it will recognize the state of Palestine in September. These two European allies will be the first G7 countries to do this.</p>
            <p>After a cabinet meeting, Starmer spoke on TV from Downing Street. He said that the UK would recognize the state of Palestine if Israel does not take the actions requested by the United Nations General Assembly when it meets in September.</p>
            <p>He also said that Israel must "end the bad situation in Gaza, agree to a ceasefire, promise long-term stable peace, and restart the idea of a two-state solution."</p>
            <p>Starmer said, "I have always stated that when the two-state solution is most at risk, we will recognize the state of Palestine to help the peace process. Because this solution is now in danger, it is time to act."</p>
            <p>Israel immediately "rejected" the UK's move. They said it "rewards Hamas (a Palestinian armed group) and harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza."</p>
            <p>Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize the state of Palestine on September 23, during the United Nations General Assembly meeting.</p>
            <p>Over 140 countries already recognize the state of Palestine. However, none of these countries are as important as the UK and France. The UK and France are allies of Israel, have nuclear weapons, and are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
