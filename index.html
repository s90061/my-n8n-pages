            <h1>Taiwan's Defense Ministry: We will store more supplies to fight if China blocks us</h1>
            <p>The Executive Yuan recently approved a special budget for resilience. This budget will increase Taiwan's war supplies from 30 days to 120 days. Huang Wen-chi, who is in charge of war plans at the Ministry of National Defense, said today that China's ability to block the sea is getting stronger. So, Taiwan must have more war supplies of all kinds to keep fighting if the enemy attacks.</p>
            <p>On September 11, the Executive Yuan approved the special budget for resilience. This budget includes NT$113.2 billion for the Ministry of National Defense. This money will be used to make command and communication stronger (NT$67.3 billion), update facilities for war readiness (NT$42.9 billion), and protect Taiwan's waters and people (NT$3 billion).</p>
            <p>Minister of National Defense, Gu Lixiong, said at that time that Taiwan must be aware of China's threats. This special budget will help Taiwan increase its war supplies from 30 days to 120 days. It will also make Taiwan's reserve forces, including one-year conscripts, stronger. The money will also be used to fix training areas and store different types of ammunition. This is to make sure Taiwan can keep fighting.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense held a press conference this morning about the "New Version of the National Defense Handbook." Lieutenant General Huang Wen-chi, head of the War Planning Department, said that because China's ability to block the sea is getting better, Taiwan must increase its war supplies of all goods. Among these, getting supplies quickly is the most important.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-chi explained that the budget will first cover oil and drinking water. For other items like spare parts, ammunition, and food, special storage is needed. So, the budget includes money to repair ammunition depots, food storage areas, and parts warehouses. Later, these needs will be met as the repairs are done and supplies are bought.</p>
            <p>Huang Wen-chi also said that the Ministry will keep looking at plans for possible blockades by the enemy. This is to make sure Taiwan can keep fighting if the enemy attacks.</p>
            <p>War supplies are military goods stored according to battle plans. They are needed to support the entire operation. Safety stock, also called the safety supply level, is the amount of military goods needed to keep supplies coming if normal supply is stopped or if more is needed in a war.</p>

            <p>The first Taiwan International Children's and Youth Book Fair will begin in Taichung on September 18. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that Taichung has been ranked first in reading for four years in a row. Because of this, the Ministry of Culture chose Taichung to host the first children's and youth book fair. She welcomes everyone to join.</p>
            <p>The first Taiwan International Children's and Youth Book Fair is planned by the Ministry of Culture and the Taichung City Government. It will be held from September 18 to 21 at the Taichung International Exhibition Center. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen talked about it at a city meeting today and invited everyone to visit.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that the city government has increased its budget for buying books every year. It has doubled from NT$50 million to NT$100 million. Also, five big libraries, including the Green Art Museum, will open soon. The Ministry of Education has also ranked Taichung first in reading scores for four years in a row. So, the Ministry of Culture specially chose Taichung to hold the first international children's and youth book fair. There will also be talks by famous writers and new book launches at the fair. She welcomes everyone to come.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture explained that the first children's and youth book fair will have the Taichung City Government as the main city. It will also have a special Taichung City Pavilion. New areas like the Taiwan Comics Pavilion and the Picture Book Story Pavilion will be added. The Italian Guest of Honor Pavilion and the Children's Book Pavilion from the Taipei International Book Exhibition will also move there. There will be combined book areas from local publishers and children's book areas. Famous writers from Taiwan and other countries will give talks. The fair will combine exhibitions, sales, and events to encourage reading. It will be a reading celebration for people in central Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Cultural Affairs Bureau said that the Taichung City Pavilion will show the many sides of Taichung. This includes its mountains, rivers, people, history, nature, and water. They hope the book fair will show how Taichung helps people read. They also hope it will help more children enjoy books and help build a city that loves reading.</p>
            <p>One of the groups joining the exhibition is the Hsin-Yi Foundation. They said they were inspired by the popular book "Sushi on a Trip" to create a "Reading Forest" that is 3.5 meters tall. They also made three sushi-person standees that are as tall as children and prepared sushi costumes. They invite families to the broccoli forest to enjoy a unique, funny, and creative experience.</p>
            <p>The Hsin-Yi Foundation also invited the "Talented Children's Story Writer" Lin Che-chang to give a talk on September 21. His talk is called "Let's Go to the Pet Kung Fu School to Learn Martial Arts." He asks children to come and play and learn martial arts on the holiday. On September 20, the Hsin-Yi story sisters will share classic stories like "Guji Guji the Duckling" and the newest popular story "The Rule-Followers are the Winners." Readers are welcome to sign up online.</p>
