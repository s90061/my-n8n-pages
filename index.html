            <h1>British Media: Housing Market and Trade Pressure Slow Down China's Economy, Causing Worry</h1>
            <p>The Financial Times in the UK reported that China's economy is slowing down. This is due to problems inside the country and with international trade. On August 15, China's government announced economic numbers for July. These numbers, like how much people bought in shops, how much factories produced, and house prices in 70 big cities, either grew less than ever this year or kept going down. This makes people worried about China's economic future.</p>
            <p>On August 15, China's National Bureau of Statistics also said how much homes cost in 70 big cities in July. New homes in big cities (tier one, two, and three) were 0.2% to 0.4% cheaper on average than in June. Compared to last year, prices for new homes in tier-one cities went down by 1.1%. This has been happening for 20 months in a row since December 2023. The report says this makes people less hopeful that China's housing market will get better quickly.</p>
            <p>The report also says that these "sad" numbers, along with the trade war started by US President Donald Trump, have made China's economy worse. This comes after the Chinese housing market has been slowing down for four years.</p>
            <p>Besides the housing market, how much people bought and how much factories produced in China in July were also not good. The same day, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that total sales in shops only grew by 3.7% compared to last year. This is 1.1% less than in June. Also, factory production only grew by 5.7% compared to last year, which is also 1.1% less than in June and the lowest this year.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the Chinese government, led by Xi Jinping, is trying to fix problems like prices falling and too many goods being made by factories. Earlier, official numbers showed that the price of goods for consumers (CPI) in China in July was the same as last year. But the price of goods for producers (PPI) went down a lot, by 3.6%, compared to last year.</p>
            <p>Yuhan Zhang, the main economist at the China Center of the Conference Board, said that people are buying less in China as the middle of the year approaches. This is because demand is lower after long holidays, people's incomes are not growing much, and consumers are not feeling confident.</p>
            <p>Lu Ting, the main economist for China at Nomura Securities, thinks that the weak housing market is the main reason for falling prices in China. He also believes that the government's recent efforts to stop "involution" (a term that means too much effort for too little result) might not be enough to improve the economy by themselves.</p>
            <p>The report points out that the housing market is a very important part of China's economy and how much money families have. However, the efforts by Chinese authorities to make people feel better about the housing market, like lowering loan interest rates, turning empty homes into affordable housing, and removing limits on buying homes, have not worked. Many numbers related to the housing market have clearly gone down.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Yuhan Zhang said that even though most numbers are slowing down, some manufacturing areas are still growing fast. This is especially true for cars, railways, shipbuilding, aerospace, and other transport equipment industries. This shows that high-tech and important industries that the government supports, which Chinese leaders call "high-quality productivity," are still getting a lot of money.</p>
            <p>Huang Zichun, a China economics expert at Capital Economics, thinks that for the rest of this year, it is not likely that China's economy will get better. This is because Chinese goods sent directly to the US or sent to the US through other countries face high taxes. So, China's exports might continue to have problems growing.</p>

            <h1>Man's Body Found at Hualien Huaren Seawall, Suspected to be Killed Over Drug Deal; Suspect Detained</h1>
            <p>On August 11, a man's body was found at the Huaren Seawall in Ji'an, Hualien. The police found out the man was a 61-year-old Mr. You. After looking into it, they think he was killed because of a money problem during a drug deal. He argued with a man named Mr. Lu after they had been drinking, and Mr. Lu hit him. Today, the police sent Mr. Lu to the prosecutor for crimes like murder and causing serious injury leading to death. The prosecutor asked the court to hold Mr. Lu, and the court agreed.</p>
            <p>Around 1 AM on August 11, someone found a man who was clearly dead on the Huaren Seawall in Ji'an Township. The Ji'an Police Station of the Hualien County Police Bureau arrived after getting the report. They called the police forensics team to take fingerprints to identify the person. They confirmed the dead person was 61-year-old Mr. You, who lived in Chongde Village, Xiulin Township.</p>
            <p>The police saw that Mr. You had signs of being beaten. They thought his death was not simple. After checking his body, they found his ribs were broken and he had internal bleeding. This showed he was beaten to death. Because there were no cameras at the place where the body was found, the police went around asking people and looked at more camera recordings from nearby. They then identified Mr. Lu, 45, as the suspect.</p>
            <p>The police investigation found that on the evening of August 10, Mr. You and Mr. Lu were having a barbecue and drinking near the Huaren Seawall in Ji'an. It seems they argued about money from a drug deal. Then, Mr. Lu used his keys like "brass knuckles" to hit Mr. You. After Mr. You fell to the ground, Mr. Lu left. When he got home, he kept thinking about it and felt something was wrong. He went back to the place and found Mr. You was no longer breathing. So, he went to tell Mr. You's family. He told them that Mr. You suddenly fell down while they were drinking.</p>
            <p>The police asked the Hualien District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. After gathering evidence, the police used an arrest warrant to bring Mr. Lu in. Mr. Lu finally admitted that he hit the man. After questioning, he was sent to the Hualien District Prosecutors Office for investigation on charges of murder and causing injury resulting in death. The prosecutor asked the court to detain him, and the court approved it.</p>
