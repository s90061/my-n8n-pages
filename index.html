            <h1>Hezbollah told to disarm by year-end, vows to refuse</h1>
            <p>The Lebanese government met yesterday. They decided to ask the army to make a plan. This plan is to disarm Hezbollah, a group supported by Iran, by the end of the year. Today, Hezbollah said they will not follow this decision. They also said that the government's decision hurts Lebanon's power.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Lebanese government made this difficult decision after a nearly six-hour meeting. President Joseph Aoun led the meeting. The United States put a lot of pressure on them.</p>
            <p>This decision will also help to follow the ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel from November last year. That agreement was meant to stop more than a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. This fighting included two months of full war. After the war, Hezbollah's power became much weaker. Their weapons were badly damaged, and many of their important leaders were killed.</p>
            <p>Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam announced at a press conference yesterday after the meeting that the government has asked the army to present a plan by the end of the month. The government will discuss and approve this plan. The goal is that by the end of the year, only the national army and other state forces will be allowed to have weapons.</p>
            <p>However, Lebanon's Information Minister, Paul Morcos, said that two ministers left the meeting because they did not agree with the government's decision. These were Rakan Nassereldine, the Health Minister, who is connected to Hezbollah, and Tamara Elzein, the Environment Minister, who is connected to Amal Movement, an ally of Hezbollah.</p>
            <p>Hezbollah is the only group that kept its weapons after Lebanon's civil war from 1975 to 1990. They said they kept weapons to fight Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>
            <p>During yesterday's government meeting, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem spoke on TV. He said that they will not disarm as long as Israel's attacks continue.</p>
            <p>Today, Hezbollah released another statement. They said they will ignore the government's decision. They also said that "the Salam government's decision to disarm Lebanon against its Israeli enemies is a serious mistake. This hurts Lebanon's power and lets Israel do whatever it wants regarding safety, land, politics, and its future."</p>
            <p>Hezbollah has long been the most powerful political group in Lebanon. People who do not support them say that Hezbollah uses its weapons to force its ideas on the country's internal matters. But after the recent fighting with Israel, Hezbollah's influence has become weaker.</p>

            <h1>Marcos Jr.: Philippines cannot stay out if Taiwan Strait conflict erupts</h1>
            <p>The situation in the Taiwan Strait is becoming more tense. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. spoke to Indian media. He said that if a fight happens between China and Taiwan, the Philippines "cannot stay out of it." He also said that countries need to form groups to deal with dangers in the Indo-Pacific area.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. arrived in India on August 4th for a five-day visit. He spoke with India's "Firstpost" newspaper. He said it is very important to make strong partnerships with countries like India that share the same ideas. This is to make sure the region is safe.</p>
            <p>Marcos Jr. said, "If a big war starts, we will definitely be involved. We will have to go into Taiwan to bring our people home." He also said that many Filipinos live in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>When asked if the Philippines would let the United States use its military bases if something happens in Taiwan, Marcos Jr. answered, "Why should we say no to a friend who is facing threats from China? We are not a puppet country. It is our job to protect our country."</p>
            <p>Without directly naming China, Marcos Jr. also said it is important to create a global group of countries. This group should respect international law and be against changing borders on one's own. He said, "No country can protect these ideas alone. We need a group."</p>
            <p>Regarding the idea of an "Asian NATO" (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), Marcos Jr. said that the current ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) might not be enough to handle all the problems in the region.</p>
            <p>He said, "One country cannot solve global problems alone." The Philippines is happy to see India becoming more important in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

            <h1>White House official says Apple to promise US$100 billion in US manufacturing</h1>
            <p>An official from the White House said that Apple company will announce today that it will spend 100 billion US dollars on manufacturing in the United States. This move aims to bring more production back to the US.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the official, who did not want to be named, said this is an extra promise from Apple Inc., on top of what they have already promised.</p>
            <p>In February, Apple announced that it would invest 500 billion US dollars in the US over the next four years. This includes building a very large factory in Texas for putting together artificial intelligence (AI) servers. They will also create 20,000 new jobs in research and development across the country.</p>
            <p>Apple did not immediately reply when asked for comments.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, also said that Apple would likely announce an investment today.</p>
            <p>Hassett said in an interview with Fox Business Network, "They are moving here in large numbers. These are promises of trillions and trillions of dollars to build factories here. In fact, you will probably see Apple announce something today."</p>
