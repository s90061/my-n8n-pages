Uber has agreed to pay a hefty $290 million to resolve a lawsuit alleging that it overcharged passengers with disabilities. The US Department of Justice brought the case, arguing that Uber's "wait time" fees discriminated against riders who took longer to enter vehicles due to their disabilities.

The lawsuit highlighted that Uber charged these riders extra fees when their boarding took longer than the standard two-minute grace period. The Justice Department contended this violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination based on disability in public accommodations.

As part of the settlement, Uber will not only pay out the substantial sum but also overhaul its policies. They will offer waivers for wait time fees to disabled riders and implement a new system for handling complaints related to disability discrimination. Furthermore, Uber will train its staff on ADA compliance to prevent future incidents.

**Apple's New AI Tool Can Summarize Your Day From Photos and Messages**

Apple is reportedly developing a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that can summarize your day based on information gleaned from your photos, messages, and other data on your device. This feature, internally known as "Project Memories," is expected to be a key component of the next iOS update.

Sources familiar with the project suggest that the AI will analyze various data points, such as location data from photos, text messages, and calendar events, to create a cohesive summary of the user's day. The goal is to provide a quick and easily digestible overview of the user's activities, highlights, and key moments.

The feature aims to be proactive, offering insights and reminders without requiring users to manually input information. While concerns about privacy are inevitable, Apple is expected to prioritize on-device processing to minimize data sharing and ensure user control over their personal information. This AI tool reflects Apple's ongoing investment in AI and its commitment to enhancing user experience through intelligent features.

**Venice to Trial Entry Fee for Day Trippers**

Venice is preparing to launch a trial program imposing an entry fee on day trippers in an attempt to manage overcrowding and protect the fragile ecosystem of the historic city. The initiative is scheduled to begin in spring 2024 and will target tourists who do not stay overnight.

The fee, initially set at â‚¬5, will be implemented on select peak days, particularly weekends and public holidays. The aim is to discourage casual visitors during the busiest times, allowing more space and a better experience for those who choose to stay longer.

Local authorities hope the measure will help reduce the strain on public services, such as waste disposal and transportation, which are heavily burdened by the massive influx of tourists. Revenue generated from the entry fee will be used to fund these services and maintain Venice's cultural heritage. While the plan has faced some criticism, city officials argue it is necessary to preserve the city's unique character and ensure its long-term sustainability.
