            <h1>Brazil Protests US Tariffs at WTO Without Naming Trump</h1>
            <p>The US government announced that it will put a 50% tax on products from Brazil starting August 1. Brazil strongly criticized these new taxes at the World Trade Organization (WTO). They said the taxes were "unfair and disorganized" but did not directly mention US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>According to the Brazilian news website g1, Philip Gough, the head of Economic and Financial Affairs at Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, spoke at the WTO today. He said Brazil is very worried about countries using trade rules to get involved in other countries' internal matters. Forty countries, including the 27 countries of the European Union, supported Brazil's statement.</p>
            <p>Gough stressed that these taxes "are causing problems for global supply chains and could lead the world economy into a period of high prices and no growth." He also said that such one-sided actions "clearly go against the basic rules of the WTO, which are very important for international trade."</p>
            <p>The report said that the Brazilian government is thinking about making a formal complaint to the WTO. However, diplomats believe that the WTO's ability to solve problems is not working well. Even if the WTO makes a decision, it might not be able to make countries follow it. So, if Brazil makes a formal complaint, it might just be a political act and will not lead to a helpful decision.</p>
            <p>In this situation, it is possible that Brazil could join with other countries affected by the tariffs to make a combined complaint.</p>
            <p>Gough stated that Brazil always supports working together within the global trade system. But if talks do not work, Brazil's President, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, is also thinking about using an "economic equality law." This law would allow Brazil to put similar taxes on US goods. The Brazilian government believes that Trump's actions are trying to interfere with Brazil's independence. The economic equality law would allow Brazil to react to countries or economic groups that create trade, legal, or political barriers against Brazil.</p>
            <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is being investigated for trying to overthrow the government. US President Trump announced the 50% tariffs on Brazil because, he said, Brazil was "witch-hunting" his ally Bolsonaro.</p>

            <h1>Fan Yun in US Congress: China's Pressure on Taiwan Officials</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 23 (CNA) â€“ The US Congress held a meeting today about China's political actions. Taiwan lawmaker Fan Yun joined the meeting online. She started by talking about a baseball game that Americans would also understand. She shared how Taiwan is often silenced. She also mentioned that before Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim started her job, Chinese staff followed her during her visit to the Czech Republic. Fan Yun said this is a clear example of how China pressures Taiwan's officials in other countries.</p>
            <p>The US Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC) held a meeting this morning called "Standing with Taiwan: Countering China's Political Warfare and Transnational Repression." Lawmaker Fan Yun from Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party took part online.</p>
            <p>In her speech, she gave an example of Taiwan winning the 2024 Premier12 baseball tournament. She said that the players were not allowed to wear jerseys with Taiwan's name on them. After hitting a key three-run home run, they could not openly say the country's name. The team captain pointed to the empty space on his jersey where "Taiwan" should have been.</p>
            <p>"This is what our lives are like, constantly being silenced by China," she said.</p>
            <p>She also pointed out that China is increasing its efforts to influence Taiwan. According to Taiwan's National Security Bureau, the number of spy cases charged in 2024 was four times higher than in 2021. These cases targeted the military, the parliament, political parties, and civic groups. China even recruited gangs to create a network of armed support across Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Fan Yun also talked about the current situation in Taiwan's parliament. She said that after last year's election, the two main opposition parties became the majority in the parliament. The leader of the biggest opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT) parliamentary group, led 17 lawmakers to visit China and meet with Chinese officials. After that, they pushed for several laws that go against Taiwan's constitution. They also stopped or cut military spending without good reasons.</p>
            <p>"China also pays Taiwanese internet personalities to create content that supports its political messages," Fan Yun said. She explained that China's political actions have two goals: first, to make the conflict between Taiwan and China seem like an internal Chinese matter to isolate Taiwan. Second, to make Taiwanese people trust the US less. A recent survey showed that people in Taiwan who use TikTok are more likely to have positive feelings about China and believe that a pro-US government will cause a war.</p>
            <p>Regarding pressure across countries, Fan Yun said that China is putting pressure on military and government officials overseas. This includes their actions against Taiwan's Vice President-elect in the Czech Republic. The purpose is to scare Taiwanese people and make them understand that if they resist China, there will be consequences.</p>
            <p>Besides listing the ways the Taiwanese government is responding, Fan Yun also mentioned that Taiwan has a strong civil society, which was shaped by past movements like the Wild Lily and Sunflower student movements. The people have a strong desire to protect their democracy.</p>
            <p>"Even as I speak, Taiwan is experiencing a large-scale movement to recall lawmakers, started by citizen volunteer groups. The vote will happen this Saturday."</p>
            <p>Fan Yun said that as Taiwanese people, "we know that freedom does not come easily." Generations of Taiwanese people have fought and sacrificed for democracy, and they are now working hard to stop a war from happening.</p>
            <p>She stressed that Taiwan alone is not strong enough to stop China's aggression. She added that Taiwan's safety is important not only for peace in the region but also for the global economy. She hopes that the US will stand with Taiwan and protect the same values.</p>

            <h1>Switzerland: Low Birth Rate and Worker Shortage Cause Economic Worries</h1>
            <p>Zurich, July 23 (CNA) â€“ Switzerland's Federal Statistical Office shared new population numbers in June. In 2024, the average Swiss family had 1.3 children. This shows that the birth rate continues to fall. The Swiss Central Bank's new report this week says that as the "baby boomer" generation starts to retire, there could be a shortage of up to 400,000 workers in the next 10 years. This will cause the country's economic growth to slow down in the long run.</p>
            <p>Statistics from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office show that families with four people make up about 42% of all families, which is the most common. However, the number of families with only one child is increasing each year and is catching up. The Swiss Central Bank points out that Switzerland's population is getting older, and fewer babies are being born at the same time. This will put pressure on the number of workers available. The report predicts that if this trend continues, the yearly increase in jobs might only be half of what it has been in the past. Economic growth could also slow down.</p>
            <p>Michael Siegenthaler, a researcher of the labor market at ETH Zurich, told Swiss Radio and Television (SRF) that Switzerland's economy grew a lot in the past because of its young and large working population. But now, the "baby boomer" generation is about to fully retire, so slower economic growth is expected. He said that Swiss companies have recently relied on hiring talented people from other countries to fill job openings. In the future, they might continue to attract skilled foreign workers by offering high salaries.</p>
            <p>Katja Rost, a professor of sociology at the University of Zurich, explained in the SRF report that women wanting fewer children is the main reason for the falling birth rate. Most women now want to achieve their personal goals first. Also, the high cost of raising children in Switzerland makes it hard for families to grow. She stressed that even if Switzerland improves its family policies right away, it will not greatly increase the birth rate in the short term. This is because even Nordic countries, which have good social benefits, are also seeing their birth rates fall.</p>
            <p>Other experts think that new AI technology could take over some jobs, reducing the need for human workers. But the Swiss Central Bank's report clearly stated that an aging population has become a big challenge for managing money in the country. Since 2010, the number of people retiring has been more than the number of young people joining the workforce. The government and businesses should deal with this carefully to keep the job market stable and ensure the economy grows in the long term.</p>
