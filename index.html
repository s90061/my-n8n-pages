            <h1>US Envoy: Plans Being Made to End Gaza War</h1>
            <p>On August 2nd, the US President's special envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, told families of Israeli hostages that he is working with the Israeli government. They are making a plan that will effectively end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Witkoff is visiting Israel while there is growing pressure on the Israeli government. This is because the situation for people in the Gaza Strip is getting worse.</p>
            <p>According to a recording of the meeting heard by Reuters, Witkoff said, "We are working with the Israeli government and its Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to create a very, very good plan. This plan is to rebuild Gaza, and it truly means ending the war."</p>
            <p>Witkoff also said that Hamas is ready to disarm to end the war. However, Hamas has stated many times that it does not intend to put down its weapons.</p>
            <p>The White House has not yet responded to requests for comments about what Witkoff said. The news was reported on August 3rd, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Hamas: No Disarming Without Independent Palestine</h1>
            <p>On August 2nd, the Palestinian group Hamas said that it will not give up its weapons unless an independent Palestinian state is created. This means Hamas has again refused a main demand from Israel to end the war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that talks between Hamas and Israel stopped last week. These talks aimed to achieve a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza and an agreement to release hostages.</p>
            <p>Qatar and Egypt, who are helping with the talks, supported a statement from France and Saudi Arabia on July 29th. This statement explained steps for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It included Hamas giving its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, which is supported by Western countries.</p>
            <p>However, Hamas released a statement saying that it will not give up its right to "armed resistance" unless an "independent Palestinian state with full control and Jerusalem as its capital" is formed.</p>
            <p>Israel believes that Hamas giving up its weapons is a very important condition for any agreement to end the conflict. But Hamas has repeatedly said it has no intention of putting down its weapons. The news was reported on August 3rd, 2025.</p>

            <h1>India Will Keep Buying Russian Oil Despite Trump's Threats</h1>
            <p>Two Indian government sources who did not want to be named said that India will continue to buy oil from Russia. This is despite US President Donald Trump saying he would punish India.</p>
            <p>One of the sources said, "These are oil agreements for a long time. It's not easy to stop buying overnight."</p>
            <p>Last month, Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that India would get more punishment for buying Russian weapons and oil.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Trump told reporters that he heard India would no longer buy oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>The New York Times today quoted two senior Indian officials, who also did not want to be named. They said that the Indian government has not changed its policy. One official said that the government has not told oil companies to buy less oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported this week that Indian state-owned oil companies stopped buying Russian oil in the past week. This happened because the price reductions for Russian oil became smaller in July.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson for India's Foreign Ministry, Randhir Jaiswal, spoke at a press conference yesterday. He said, "About our needs for buying energy... we will think about what is available in the market, what choices we have, and also consider the current world situation or environment."</p>
            <p>Jaiswal also added that India and Russia have a "strong and long-standing partnership." He said that India's relationships with all countries are important on their own and should not be seen from the point of view of a third country. The news was reported on August 3rd, 2025.</p>
