            <h1>Motorcycle Rider Falls into Valley After Crash on Alishan Highway</h1>
            <p>Yesterday night, there was a big motorcycle accident on Alishan Highway (Taiwan Provincial Highway 18) at the 35.8-kilometer mark in Chiayi County. A 46-year-old man named Zheng was riding a yellow-plated heavy motorcycle down the road. It seems he lost control and hit a concrete barrier on the same side of the road.</p>
            <p>After hitting the barrier, the rider fell about 50 meters down the side of the road into a valley. Firefighters were called at 10:49 PM. They quickly set up ropes and rescued him. He had many scrapes and bruises, but he was awake and not in danger of losing his life. He was taken to the hospital for treatment. His motorcycle slid across the road and into a ditch on the other side.</p>
            <p>The Zhongpu Police Station in Chiayi County said that the man had no alcohol in his blood. They are still checking to find out exactly why the accident happened. The police ask drivers to drive slowly on the many winding roads in the Alishan mountains to avoid accidents.</p>

            <h1>Hsu Chia-ching Visits Brazil: Taiwanese Community Celebrates 70 Years of Immigration, From Dreams to Roots</h1>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching, who leads the Overseas Community Affairs Council, arrived in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, on August 23rd. She will stay for six days. Her first stop was to join a celebration for 70 years of Taiwanese people moving to Brazil. Hundreds of Taiwanese people living abroad came together. They looked back at the difficult journey and great success of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil over 70 years.</p>
            <p>Many groups worked together to plan this celebration for 70 years of Taiwanese immigration to Brazil. It showed how strong the Taiwanese community is and how well they have kept their culture. Liao Chih-hsien, the representative to Brazil, and Chu Yi-ching, the director of the SÃ£o Paulo office, were there for the whole event. This showed that the government cares a lot about the overseas Taiwanese community.</p>
            <p>The event had many different parts. These included an exhibition of immigrant artifacts, an art exhibition by students of Zhang Daqian, a Taiwanese food fair, and a big celebration. The artifact show used pictures and words to tell the story of how hard the first Taiwanese immigrants worked when they came to Brazil. It also showed the great things their children and grandchildren have done in education, culture, and business. The food fair had popular Taiwanese snacks like shaved ice, mushroom and minced pork rice, pig intestine vermicelli, and bubble tea to attract people. This truly showed the charm of Taiwan's many food cultures.</p>
            <p>The celebration ceremony was grand and warm. Nearly a thousand overseas Taiwanese and Brazilian friends came. There was beautiful music, dancing, and art performances. Guests gave gifts and cut a cake together. This showed the strong roots of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil and their hopes for the future. Kenji Ito, a city council member from SÃ£o Paulo, gave awards and medals on behalf of the city council. This was to honor the Taiwanese community's good work and influence on the local society.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching gave a speech. She said that the history of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil is a journey full of hard work and hope. The first group of immigrants laid the foundation. The second and third groups have continued to pass on culture and education. This shows that the Taiwanese community is united and keeps doing good for others.</p>
            <p>She asked the younger generations of overseas Taiwanese to study in Taiwan to make their connection with Taiwan stronger. She also said that the Overseas Community Affairs Council will continue to help overseas Taiwanese get more help with their businesses, keeping their culture, and training young people. This will help the Taiwanese community shine even brighter in the local society.</p>
            <p>Representative Liao Chih-hsien spoke and said that 70 years of Taiwanese immigration to Brazil is an important moment in history. He noted that the art exhibition by Zhang Daqian's students crossed borders and showed the deep influence of Taiwanese culture. He praised Taiwanese immigrants for being kind and helpful and for being active in society. They show a good influence on the world stage.</p>
            <p>Director Chu Yi-ching also said that Taiwanese immigrants have worked hard, overcome many problems, and achieved great things in Brazil. They have become a bridge and a great example of friendship between Taiwan and Brazil. She also said that SÃ£o Paulo has talented people and warm hearts, making it an important place for cultural exchange between Taiwan and Brazil.</p>
            <p>Liu Hsueh-lin, the head of the event planning committee, also spoke at the meeting. He introduced a book called 'History of Taiwanese Immigration in Brazil - Roots.' This book won first prize in the social science category of the 2024 Overseas Chinese Cultural and Educational Foundation's Chinese Writing Award. It is a valuable part of Taiwanese immigrant history. They also showed an animated film called 'Dreams and Roots.' It encouraged the children of immigrants to bravely follow their dreams and remember where they came from to create a better future for themselves and society.</p>
            <p>During her trip, Hsu Chia-ching will also visit important Taiwanese communities and schools in SÃ£o Paulo, including the Mu Yi Church, Mu Dao Church, Chinese Association, Sheng Ru Chinese School, and Brazil Hakka Yuan Lou.

            <h1>Number of Students from New Southbound Countries Reaches Record High of 82,000, More Than Doubles in 11 Years</h1>
            <p>The newest numbers from the Ministry of Education show that in the 2024 to 2025 school year, 123,188 students from other countries studied in colleges and universities in Taiwan. About 82,000 of these students were from countries in the New Southbound Policy. This is the highest number ever, more than double what it was 11 years ago. For the last five years, most of these students have come from Vietnam.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education recently shared its newest numbers. In the 2014 to 2015 school year, there were 93,645 international students in Taiwan's colleges and universities. After that, the number grew each year, reaching its highest point of 129,207 students in the 2018 to 2019 school year. In the 2020 to 2021 school year (when COVID-19 started), the number went down to 90,895. Since then, it has gone up each year, and in 2024 to 2025, it is back to 123,188 students.</p>
            <p>Looking at students from New Southbound countries, the Ministry of Education's numbers show that there were 25,289 such students in the 2014 to 2015 school year. This was 27% of all international students. After that, the number grew each year, and in the 2024 to 2025 school year, it reached 82,622. This is the highest number ever and makes up 67% of all international students. The number of students from New Southbound countries has more than doubled in 11 years.</p>
            <p>When we look closer at students from New Southbound countries, which include Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and India, the Ministry of Education found something interesting. Before the 2019 school year, more students from New Southbound countries came from Malaysia. But since the 2020 school year, Vietnam has been the top country, with 17,534 students. After that, it stayed number one. By the 2024 school year, this number reached 39,695 students, which is more than double in five years.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education explained that to get more students from New Southbound countries to study in Taiwan, they have started several programs. These include the "New Southbound Industry-Academia Cooperation International Program," the "Program to Get More Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macau, and Foreign Students in Important Industries," and the "Program to Help International Students Come and Stay in Taiwan." These programs give schools more choices for finding international students.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Education offers many scholarships and help. They continue to make student support and advice services better for international students. They are making all support services better to make it more attractive for good students from New Southbound countries to study in Taiwan. Every year, they also go to New Southbound countries to join or hold higher education fairs and events. There, they tell students and parents about studying in Taiwan.</p>
