(Central News Agency reporter Huang Qiaowen, Taipei, July 15) A scholar has pointed out that older drivers (75 years and older) cause pedestrian deaths 2.44 times more often than drivers aged 41 to 64. They are asking for support measures when improving how older drivers are managed. The Ministry of Transportation said it is working on four ways to improve. This includes giving TPASS subsidies to older people who voluntarily give back their driver's licenses.

On May 19 this year, a serious car accident happened outside Beida Elementary School in Sanxia District, New Taipei City. The driver, Mr. Yu, was 78 years old. This brought attention to the issue of older drivers. The Health and Welfare Policy Research Center at Taipei Medical University held a seminar today called "Is the Policy for Managing Older Drivers Working? Balancing Traffic Injury Prevention and Mobility Rights for Seniors."

Zhang Yaohui, deputy head of the Motor Vehicle Supervision Division of the Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau, said that Taiwan will become a super-aged society. The number of people over 70 with driver's licenses is expected to grow from 1.826 million to 2.72 million in 10 years.

In May, the Ministry of Transportation announced that it is planning to lower the age for older drivers to renew their licenses from 75 to 70. Minister Chen Shih-kai had said that detailed plans would be ready within three months. He hopes the new rules for older driver's license renewal can start next year. Zhang Yaohui noted that to talk with older people, the Ministry of Transportation has held more than 20 talks in temples across Taiwan. The goal is not to take away older people's licenses but to help them drive safely and to start caring for older drivers at age 70.

Professor Pai Chih-wei from the Institute of Injury Prevention and Control at Taipei Medical University said his research team looked at car accident data from the National Police Agency from 2011 to 2023, which included over 426,000 car accidents. The data showed that older drivers (75 years and older) caused the highest rate of pedestrian deaths among all age groups. It was 2.44 times higher than for drivers aged 41 to 64. Also, as drivers get older, the risk of causing pedestrian deaths and injuries gets higher.

However, Pai Chih-wei pointed out that the Ministry of Transportation started a system in 2017 to manage older drivers' license renewals. The main goal was to keep older drivers safe and to protect the safety of all road users. But when looking at the data, the results were not very good. There was no clear decrease in accidents caused by drivers aged 65 to 74 and those 75 and older.

As society gets older, Pai Chih-wei believes that older drivers' eyesight, reaction time, and thinking skills all get worse. This also affects their judgment. Even though the current system for managing older drivers has not shown clear results, he thinks the direction is correct and necessary.

Pai Chih-wei suggested that the government should make road environments better, for example, by adding left-turn signals at intersections and building traffic islands. At the same time, public transport should be more common to make it easier for older people to travel. This would make older people less reliant on their own vehicles.

Regarding Pai Chih-wei's call for the government to include support measures when thinking about how to improve older driver management, Zhang Yaohui said that to help older people drive safely, they plan to improve things in four ways. These include looking at the health check and cognitive function tests, completing traffic safety courses before renewing licenses, requiring drivers who have caused accidents or committed violations to complete practical training, and encouraging older people to voluntarily give back their driver's licenses by giving them TPASS subsidies.

Zhang Yaohui said that in addition to the existing "Happy Bus" and "Happy Taxi" services, encouraging older drivers to return their licenses and providing TPASS subsidies means they can use various public transport options, including taxis. (Edited by Li Shuhua) 1140715

***Central Taiwan Town Resilience Exercise: Premier Cho Jung-tai Says to Strengthen People's Self-Defense Awareness***

(Central News Agency reporter Chao Li-jen, Taichung, July 15) The central Taiwan region held a town resilience air defense exercise today. Premier Cho Jung-tai hopes that the 12,000 people who took part will become like seeds that spread out. Through the exercise, he wants to awaken and strengthen people's awareness of self-defense. He said that society's ability to recover is everyone's job, and no one can stay out of it.

Premier Cho Jung-tai attended the "2025 Town Resilience Exercise" in Taichung today. He checked the practice drills at the first aid station and relief station. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen led the exercise planning team there. Cho Jung-tai said that this town resilience exercise combined the Min An, Wan An, and Han Kuang exercises. It was the first time it was so big, real, and without a script. It tested everyone's ability to react to different unexpected situations.

Premier Cho Jung-tai praised the careful planning of the event and how realistic the drills were, which made him feel emotional. He said that the exercise is not only about gaining personal experience but also a deeper national responsibility. The government will do everything it can to make sure the people of Taiwan are not harmed or challenged. He also said that if natural disasters or challenges come, being prepared can make people safer.

Cho Jung-tai mentioned that the world situation is changing quickly. Being in the first line of defense in geopolitics, it is hard to be unaffected by the various changes in the world. And Taiwan is an important place and player for safety, peace, and stability in the whole world. So, it must start by becoming strong on its own.

He said that when something happens, everyone knows where it is safe and where they can get proper care. Government workers, volunteers, and the military have important duties. When something happens, they must know where to stand to carry out their national mission and protect the people. This is the most important spirit that should be shown in the exercise.

Cho Jung-tai hopes that these 12,000 civilian volunteers will become seeds that spread out. He also said that more technology will be used to improve the response capabilities of the exercise, strengthen coordination between different government departments, and promote cybersecurity. All of these will be gradually improved after the exercise.

He said that reducing and stopping disasters is a shared duty of both the central and local governments. Making the whole society stronger and safer is everyone's shared duty, and no one can stay out of it. Everyone must help each other and make themselves stronger. Under the President's leadership, the central and local governments will work together fully to protect our safety.

Lu Shiow-yen mentioned that Taiwan might face the risk of war. Also, because of extreme weather, there might be many disasters. She said that central and local governments should work with the public to prepare beforehand and combine public and private efforts to strengthen exercises. This way, when war comes, they can protect families and people. The Taichung City Government will fully cooperate with the central government's policies and requirements to protect our homes and our country. (Edited by Hsieh Ya-chu) 1140715

Lin Chia-lung also thanked President Pe침a for first mentioning Taiwan as an allied country in his inauguration speech in August 2023, which showed the important meaning of the Taiwan-Paraguay friendship. During this visit to Paraguay, in addition to celebrating the 68th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries, he also invited representatives from semiconductor, information and communication technology, construction, smart agriculture, high-tech fabric, green energy, furniture, and food processing companies that have strong potential for cooperation with Paraguay.
