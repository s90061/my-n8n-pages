            <h1>North Korea Will Not Give Up Nuclear Weapons</h1>
            <p>Today, North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Son Gyong spoke at the United Nations General Assembly. He said that North Korea will never give up its nuclear weapons. However, he also said that they are still willing to solve problems through talking with other countries.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, Kim Son Gyong stated, "Forcing 'denuclearization' on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea means asking us to give up our right to be a country and our right to live. This goes against our laws."</p>
            <p>He also added, "We will never give up our nuclear weapons. This is part of our country's laws, our plans, and our right to be a country. It is also our right to live. We will not change this position under any circumstances."</p>
            <p>North Korea's state news agency, KCNA, reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said last week that he is willing to talk with the United States if North Korea can keep its nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>North Korea did its first nuclear test in 2006. Since then, the United Nations Security Council has put more and more strict rules on North Korea. These rules are meant to stop North Korea from making nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.</p>
            <p>Last week at the United Nations, South Korean President Lee Jae-myung said he would try to stop the bad cycle of tension with North Korea.</p>

            <h1>Madagascar President Removes Government After Deadly Protests</h1>
            <p>Madagascar had several deadly protests because of ongoing water and power cuts. Today, President Andry Rajoelina announced that he has removed the government. The United Nations said that at least 22 people died and more than 100 people were hurt in the protests.</p>
            <p>Reuters and AFP news agencies reported that President Rajoelina said in a speech on national TV, "I have decided to remove the Prime Minister and the government from their positions. The current officials will work as temporary ministers until a new government is formed."</p>
            <p>Madagascar is an island country in the Indian Ocean, southeast of Africa. The protests there have been happening for 3 days. They were inspired by protests from young people, called Gen Z, in Kenya and Nepal. Gen Z includes people born from 1997 to the early 2010s.</p>
            <p>These protests are the biggest in Madagascar in recent years. They are also the biggest challenge for President Rajoelina since he was re-elected in 2023.</p>
            <p>In his speech, President Rajoelina also said, "If government members did not do their jobs well, we admit it and say sorry."</p>
            <p>The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that those who died or were hurt included protesters and people just passing by who were shot by security forces. Also, some people were killed by gangs or other people not involved in the protests during the widespread violence and stealing that followed.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Bualoi Causes 13 Deaths and Much Damage in Vietnam</h1>
            <p>The government of Vietnam has announced that Typhoon Bualoi has caused more deaths and injuries in the country. Now, 13 people have died and 46 people are hurt. The typhoon brought strong winds and heavy rain, which damaged over 40,000 homes. There were also power cuts and flooded roads.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Vietnam's national weather office said Typhoon Bualoi landed in Vietnam earlier today. It moved along the central and northern coast, causing huge waves up to 8 meters high. After that, Bualoi became weaker and turned into a tropical depression, moving towards Laos.</p>
            <p>Before the typhoon arrived, the Vietnamese government moved over 28,500 people to safer places. Many flights were delayed or cancelled because several airports in the central areas were closed.</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese government stated that Bualoi damaged 44,000 homes and flooded 6,000 hectares of farmland. It also blocked roads in many areas, making it hard to travel.</p>
            <p>Some factories belonging to companies like Hon Hai, Formosa Plastics, Luxshare, and Vietnamese car maker Vinfast were in or near the typhoon's path. However, the Vietnamese government reported that these industrial places did not have serious damage.</p>
