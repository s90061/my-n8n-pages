            <h1>Two People Confirmed Dead in Southern Cross-Island Highway Car Accident, Three Still Missing</h1>
            <p>A car with five family members fell into a valley on the Southern Cross-Island Highway (Taiwan Provincial Highway 20). Police and rescue workers searched for nearly half a month and found the bodies of a man named Li and his wife's daughter, surnamed Pan. Today, the Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office said that they have given the autopsy reports to the families. They have also arranged for the families to pick up the bodies. For the other three missing family members, the office will ask the court to declare them dead.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office stated at noon that on August 1st, they received a report from the Liugui Police Station in Kaohsiung City about the death of Ms. Pan. Investigations showed that at 9:28 PM on July 30th, Mr. Li was driving his car. His wife, Ms. Wu, their son, their daughter, and Ms. Pan's daughter were also in the car. As they drove past the 81.1-kilometer mark of Taiwan Provincial Highway 20 in Taoyuan District, heavy rain caused the road to collapse. This led to the car falling into the valley.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, prosecutor Hsu Ya-wen worked with a forensic doctor at the Kaohsiung City Mortuary. They examined some of the bodies and collected DNA. The DNA tests confirmed that the bodies were Mr. Li and Ms. Pan. Today, August 26th, they gave the autopsy certificates to the families at the mortuary. They also arranged with the Kaohsiung City Mortuary for the families to take the bodies home on the same day. This helps the families avoid more trouble.</p>
            <p>The prosecution added that the Kaohsiung City Fire Department ended the search on August 12th. The bodies of the other three missing people have not been found yet. The prosecution has received permission from the families and gathered all necessary evidence. They will quickly ask the Qiaotou District Court to declare the three missing people dead. This follows the rules of the Disaster Prevention and Relief Act and will help the process go smoothly.</p>

            <h1>Smoking Both Cigarettes and E-cigarettes Increases Lung Cancer Risk by 4 Times</h1>
            <p>Quitting smoking is like a long race. Doctors have noticed three main reasons why people fail to quit. These include smoking becoming a habit or ritual, not having enough motivation, and not being able to deal with withdrawal symptoms. Some people even try to use e-cigarettes to stop smoking regular cigarettes. However, those who use both have a four times higher risk of getting lung cancer compared to people who don't smoke at all.</p>
            <p>Everyone knows that smoking is bad for your health. Now, besides traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes are also a big danger. According to statistics from the National Development Council (2024) and the National Health Agency (2025), about 200,000 people over 18 in Taiwan use e-cigarettes. This is a serious problem.</p>
            <p>It is not easy to quit smoking just by wanting to. Yan Qi-hua, who is the head of Family and Community Medicine at Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, spoke at a health education press conference today. He pointed out three common reasons why people fail to quit. First, "smoking has become a habit or a part of daily life." Second, "they don't have strong enough reasons to quit, so their will is not firm." Third, "they cannot overcome the difficult feelings when they stop smoking."</p>
            <p>Some people even try to quit smoking by using "e-cigarettes." But this actually doubles their risk of getting lung cancer. Yan Qi-hua said that e-cigarettes are just as dangerous as regular cigarettes. They release many substances that can cause cancer. Studies from other countries also show that people who use both traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes have a 4.36 times higher risk of lung cancer than non-smokers. Also, people who use both have a 1.47 times higher risk of lung diseases than those who only smoke traditional cigarettes. So, don't think that e-cigarettes can help you quit traditional cigarettes, as they might cause even more harm to your health.</p>
            <p>Yan Qi-hua stressed that addiction to smoking can be treated. Whether you smoke traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or heated tobacco products, you should quit in the right way. He suggests getting help from professional smoking cessation education and medicine. Using nicotine replacement therapy can greatly increase the chance of successfully quitting.</p>

            <h1>Yin Li Announces Candidacy for Kaohsiung City Councilor in Zuoying and Nanzih Districts: "Continuing Citizen Power"</h1>
            <p>Yin Li, who used to be the director of Kaohsiung City's Cultural Affairs Bureau and was one of the people who started the "Recall Han" movement, announced today that he will run for city councilor in Kaohsiung's Zuoying and Nanzih districts. Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Li Bo-yi from Kaohsiung was with him. Yin Li said he decided to enter local politics to continue citizen power, protect Kaohsiung, and keep Taiwan safe.</p>
            <p>Yin Li announced his plan to run for city councilor in Kaohsiung's Zuoying and Nanzih districts. He took a photo with Li Bo-yi in front of his campaign poster. This showed Li Bo-yi's support for his campaign. Yin Li said that even though the recent recall vote did not have the perfect outcome, he saw the hard work of many volunteers. This citizen power made him firm in his decision to join local politics.</p>
            <p>He said that successfully recalling former Kaohsiung Mayor Han Kuo-yu created a special moment in Taiwan's democracy. However, after changes to the election and recall laws, it will be harder to start recall movements in the future. So, after thinking carefully, he hopes to join the council to continue citizen power, protect Kaohsiung, and keep Taiwan safe. He wants to stick to his ideals and serve the people.</p>
            <p>Yin Li stated that he will use his many years of experience in cultural management and city planning to create real local projects and policies for people's lives. At the same time, he will be a protector of democracy in the council, stopping any forces friendly to China from harming Taiwan.</p>
            <p>For the future of local development, Yin Li also introduced eight main strategies. These include making smart transportation and daily life better, preserving culture and making art new, improving tourism, growing the economy and new technologies, training talent and helping young people, protecting the environment and making cities carbon-neutral, providing social care for all ages, and making cities stronger and building communities.</p>
            <p>Li Bo-yi said that if there had not been the "Recall Han" groups at that time, TSMC in Zuoying and Nanzih districts might still be a horse racing track today. After the "Recall Han" movement, Yin Li did not ask for a government job. He went back to working at a school. This year, during the nationwide recall movement, he also stood with citizen groups. Now, Yin Li has left his school job to run for city councilor, and Li Bo-yi gives him his full support.</p>
            <p>The Zuoying and Nanzih districts of Kaohsiung originally had 9 council seats. After Li Bo-yi successfully became a legislator, there are now 8 seats. The Kuomintang (KMT) holds 5 seats, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has 2 seats, and one seat is held by an independent. Besides the current DPP councilors running again, other people trying to get nominated include Huang Chen-lin, who is the executive director of former legislator Liu Shih-fang's office, and Chang Yi-li, who used to be the director of Kaohsiung City's Youth Bureau.</p>
