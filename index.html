            <h1>Trump Says He Has a Trade Deal with Indonesia, Gives No Details</h1>
            <p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, announced today on social media that he has reached a trade deal with Indonesia. However, he did not share any specific details about the agreement. He did not say what the deal covers, what its rules are, or when it will start.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social": "Just made a great deal with Indonesia that will be good for everyone. I talked directly with their respected President. More details will come later."</p>
            <p>Trump had recently posted that Indonesia would face a 32% tax on goods. This matches the 32% tax rate he announced for Indonesia in April on "Liberation Day."</p>

            <h1>Chen Chin's Game-Winning Hit and Chen Guan-Yu's Win Help Monkeys Beat Brothers, Chen Chin Gets MVP</h1>
            <p>(Taoyuan, July 15, CNA reporter Hsieh Ching-wen) Chen Chin from the Rakuten Monkeys baseball team hit a game-winning double in the bottom of the 9th inning today. This helped his team beat the CTBC Brothers 6 to 5, and Chen Chin won the MVP award. He said that his team was behind in the first half of the game. In the 6th inning, when the other team changed pitchers, they decided to play as if it was the first inning again and tried hard to catch up. He also noted that by chance, all three of his game-winning hits in his career have been when Chen Guan-yu was the winning pitcher.</p>
            <p>On June 7, Chen Chin, a field player for the Monkeys, hit a game-winning single against the TSG Hawks. But the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award for that game went to Chen Chen-wei, who hit a triple to tie the score. At that time, Chen Chen-wei joked after the game that the MVP should have gone to Chen Chin. Today, in the game between the Monkeys and the CTBC Brothers, Chen Chin hit a game-winning single in the bottom of the 9th. This helped his team win 6 to 5. He had 3 hits and 1 RBI in the game and was chosen as the MVP.</p>
            <p>After the game, Chen Chin said that he thinks this is the first time he has won MVP at home this season, and it has been a while. Before the 5th inning of today's game, his team was behind by 5 runs. When the innings changed in the 5th, the head coach and pitching coach told them to treat the 6th inning like the 1st inning. They said that a new pitcher was a chance. Chen Chin also did well in getting on base and helping his team score. He got a hit in the 6th inning and kept the offense going.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin said that being able to score 5 runs all at once in the 6th inning was part of their plan to get on base and put pressure on the other team. As the score got closer, it put more pressure on the other team's pitcher and also gave the Monkeys chances to come back.</p>
            <p>For his important turn at bat in the 9th inning, Chen Chin said that he knows he usually doesn't hit too aggressively. His hitting coach gave him advice on what to do. When he went to bat, he stayed calm and stuck to his plan. He was able to hit the first pitch well, which the other team's pitcher wanted to throw for a strike. He hit it well, and it had a good result.</p>
            <p>Chen Chin hit his third game-winning single of his career. By chance, all three times, Chen Guan-yu was the winning pitcher. He laughed and said, "Brother Guan-yu remembers it better than I do."</p>

            <h1>Lee Hong-yuan Questions Typhoon Response; Ministry of Interior Says Disaster System Is Not Broken and Asks for Support</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 15, CNA reporter Kao Hua-chien) Lee Hong-yuan, a former Minister of Interior, said that the government did not do enough to respond to Typhoon Danas. The Ministry of Interior said that the country's disaster prevention system has improved over many years and is not broken. They also said that Lee Hong-yuan did not experience such strong winds when he was the Minister of Interior. The Ministry hopes that the disaster prevention system will get more money and support. They wish Lee Hong-yuan and past Ministers of Interior would support this idea.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in southern Taiwan. Lee Hong-yuan said on an online show that "checking the damage became just a show, and water experts and government workers were all gone." He also said, "Water gates failed, and drainage systems did not work." He added that there was "no scientific proof or system support for any warnings, decisions, or responses at the scene."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said today in a press release that its system and actions for preventing and dealing with disasters have been built up over many years. Many government workers who served under Lee Hong-yuan still work there. For the past 15 years, Taiwan's disaster prevention system has sent information about disasters faster and more completely. Now, the central disaster response center connects with local city and county governments. It also gathers information daily about the people and resources needed for disaster prevention and plans how to use them.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior pointed out that all levels of government and private groups have created closer and more effective ways to work together. They also understand disasters in more detail. For example, for Typhoon Danas, on July 6, the central disaster response center connected with 6 local government disaster response centers to confirm what was needed. On July 8, the typhoon moved out to sea, but it still caused a lot of rain. The central and local governments checked and confirmed what machines and people were needed for help. This is all the result of government workers working hard together for many years.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior said that Typhoon Danas was the first typhoon in 100 years to land in Chiayi. Lee Hong-yuan also did not face such strong winds when he was in office. The weather around the world is becoming more extreme. Record-breaking strong winds and heavy rain will be more than what local areas have experienced before. The government will improve training to deal with this. But in the past 20 years, the damage from typhoons and floods in Taiwan has been kept under control. This shows that the government's plans to control water has been successful.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior stated that during this typhoon, they worked with other government groups right away to help local areas with rescue efforts. By July 14, over 6,911 people had helped with rescue work, and engineering machines were sent to damaged areas. The government also started a plan for rebuilding after the disaster. They asked local governments to report the costs for repairs and rebuilding. The central government will quickly check and approve these requests to help people rebuild their homes sooner.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior noted that to deal with natural disasters caused by climate change and risks related to international politics, they hope the disaster prevention system will continue to receive more money. This is to build strong disaster defenses for everything. They hope Lee Hong-yuan and all past Ministers of Interior will support this idea. They also hope they can help convince the opposition parties to support the money needed for this.</p>
