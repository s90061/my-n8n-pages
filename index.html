            <h1>Female Lawyer in Tainan Arrested for Being Part of a Scam Group</h1>
            <p>A female lawyer from Tainan, Ms. Ho, is involved in a fraud case. She is seen as a partner in a scam group. The Tainan District Prosecutors Office questioned her today and asked to keep her in custody. The Tainan District Court decided tonight to keep her in custody and said she cannot see or talk to anyone.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Court stated tonight that Ms. Ho is suspected of breaking several laws. These include laws about organized crime, fraud, money laundering, and sharing secret information. The court believes she is very likely guilty of these crimes.</p>
            <p>Also, Ms. Ho was both a member of the scam group and a lawyer for the people who reported the crime. She used her time helping clients during police questioning to learn secret information and then shared it. This helped the scam group. Her actions were serious. She did not answer questions directly. The court fears she might destroy evidence, or talk to other people involved in the crime and witnesses.</p>

            <h1>Taipower: Hard Work of Employees Fixing Typhoon Damage Should Not Be Called Staged Photos</h1>
            <p>Taipower, Taiwan's main power company, said that their workers' hard work fixing things after the typhoon should not be called "staged photos." They said that the photos taken at the repair sites are real and not staged. Taipower also added that the Taiwan Power Company Union has almost 29,000 members, which is over 99% of their workers. This union truly represents most workers. The other group, the "Power Industry Union," only has about a hundred members.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in southern Taiwan. The Power Industry Union said today in a statement that low-level workers worked extra hours to fix things after the typhoon. They were even asked to pose for photos while eating. The union said that high-level government officials used these photos to promote the idea of giving Taipower hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
            <p>Taipower said in a press release tonight that all the repair photos they shared were real. They were taken by workers at the scene as they were doing their jobs. No one asked them to stage the photos. Only sometimes, when news reporters were at the scene, they asked workers to pose a little for their stories.</p>
            <p>Taipower understands and respects that its workers care about their working conditions. This typhoon caused damage to power systems in the Chiayi-Tainan area that has never happened before. Almost 3,500 electricity poles fell down. More than 10,000 people have worked to fix the damage, and they are still working now.</p>
            <p>Taipower said the company greatly respects and thanks every worker for their hard work. They will also continue to make workers' benefits better. This includes bonuses, extra days off, and danger pay. They hope the public will continue to support the workers who are on the front lines.</p>

            <h1>Israel Bombs Syrian Military Headquarters, Warns Against Disturbing Druze People</h1>
            <p>Israel bombed the Syrian military headquarters in Damascus today. This happened after Israel warned the Syrian government, which is led by Islamic groups. Israel told them not to bother the Druze minority group in their main area, Sweida province.</p>
            <p>An organization that watches conflicts said that nearly 250 people have died in fights between different groups in Sweida province, which is in southern Syria.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, more than 100 people have died in fights between the Druze people and local Bedouin tribes. Yesterday, Syrian government soldiers entered Sweida city, where most people are Druze. They said they were there to watch over a peace agreement made with Druze leaders.</p>
            <p>However, people who saw what happened said that the government soldiers and Bedouin people attacked Druze fighters and regular citizens together. They caused a lot of killing in the city.</p>
            <p>Between April and May, government soldiers and Druze fighters also fought in Sweida province and near Damascus. More than 100 people died then. This new conflict is the most serious fighting since that time.</p>
            <p>Since last December, when former President Bashar al-Assad was removed, the Syrian government, led by Islamic groups, has had problems with religious and ethnic minority groups.</p>
            <p>Israel's Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, asked the government in Damascus "not to interfere with the Druze people in Sweida province."</p>
            <p>He asked the Syrian army to leave. He promised that Israeli forces would continue their attacks until the Syrian army left. Katz said that "if this message is not understood," Israel would "increase its response against the Syrian government."</p>
            <p>Soon after this, the Israeli army stated that they had attacked the Syrian military headquarters.</p>
