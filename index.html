            <h1>Tonya Helene Paulsson Wins Bronze in Universiade Artistic Gymnastics Women's All-Around â€“ First for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Tonya Helene Paulsson, a 21-year-old mixed-race gymnast who moved from Sweden to Taiwan, won a bronze medal today. She competed in the artistic gymnastics women's all-around final at the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade, scoring 52.065 points. She is the first female gymnast from Taiwan to win a medal in artistic gymnastics at the Universiade. This is a new record for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Paulsson (Tonya Helene Paulsson) is 21 years old. Her father is Swedish, and her mother is Taiwanese.

            <h1>Taiwan Water Corporation to Work with Companies on Special Water Supply, Aims to Start by Year-End to Earn More Money</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Water Corporation (Taiwan Water) wants to earn more money, not just from water fees. So, they will work with companies that make water purification equipment. They will use a program called "TWC Select" (which means they will put their name on other companies' products). They will offer "special water supply services." These services will be made to fit the different needs of homes, restaurant chains, and technology factories. They will start choosing companies soon and hope to begin offering these services by the end of the year. Taiwan Water also hopes this will help more Taiwanese companies become strong in the water purification equipment industry.</p>
            <p>In the future, if a user in Taiwan needs water with special qualities, they can contact Taiwan Water. Taiwan Water will send a person to test the water quality, give advice, and then install the water purification equipment. Most of the time, users will pay a one-time fee. Taiwan Water will also give reports that show the water quality has been tested by professional groups, and they will check the water regularly.</p>
            <p>The price of water in Taiwan has not changed for 31 years. For every one cubic meter of water it sells, Taiwan Water loses more than 2 New Taiwan Dollars. Changing water prices affects how much people pay for everyday things. Because of this, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has told Taiwan Water to first see if it can save money or offer new services to earn more. For example, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, suggested earlier this year that people could pay different prices based on the water quality.</p>
            <p>It is known that Taiwan Water is planning to offer "special water supply services." They will work with companies that sell water purification equipment for homes or businesses. They will use the "TWC Select" method. This means they will provide water quality that is made for the user's needs. The people they want to help include regular families, restaurant chains, food processing companies, semiconductor factories, medical places, construction companies, and other groups of businesses.</p>
            <p>Some people involved said that the water Taiwan Water provides already meets the rules for drinking water sources and drinking water quality. Also, Taiwan's water quality rules are even better than those from the World Health Organization (WHO). But some users need water with special qualities. For example, some people think the normal water is too hard. They can add water purification equipment to make it softer. Also, advanced technology factories need very clean water. These are all possible customers for the new service.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Water will soon openly choose one or two companies to work with. For how they will share the work, Taiwan Water will mainly be in charge of checking the filter parts, water quality rules, and giving technical support. The companies will be in charge of making and installing the equipment, giving special advice, and taking care of it after it is sold. Taiwan Water will then get money from these technical services. They guess they will earn about 30 million to 50 million New Taiwan Dollars in six years.</p>
            <p>People in the industry said that smaller companies also hope that working with a government-owned company will make them more famous and help them save money on advertising. This can also help them compete better in other countries. Taiwan Water also wants to help more companies become strong enough to compete worldwide.</p>
            <p>Experts in the field say that about 40% of homes in Taiwan have water purifiers. This means almost 60% of homes do not have one. The good thing about Taiwan Water offering this service is that Taiwan Water has tools and skills to test water quality. This can make sure the water quality is good after people add a purifier. Otherwise, it is hard for regular families to know how much the water quality has truly improved after they install a purifier themselves.</p>
            <p>An officer from the Ministry of Economic Affairs said that "special water supply services" are what Taiwan Water believes is most possible to do. Taiwan Water had looked at other projects before, but they all had problems. For example, getting water from deep in the ocean needs a lot of money to start. And selling water with very small molecules has legal rules that make it difficult.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Water Corporation Continues to Lose Money in First Half of Year; Over 70 Billion New Taiwan Dollars for Leak Reduction Plan Adds Financial Pressure</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Water Corporation (Taiwan Water) has been borrowing money for water projects in recent years. This has caused its financial losses to get bigger each year, mainly because of interest payments and the cost of equipment losing value. It is expected to lose another 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars this year. According to Taiwan Water's financial report, it has already lost about 2.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars in the first six months. Also, there is a plan to reduce water leaks that needs over 70 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which Taiwan Water must pay for itself. This adds a lot of financial pressure on the company.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Water keeps working on different water supply projects. The company has now borrowed more than 100 billion New Taiwan Dollars. The amount of interest it pays each year is very large. It has lost money for two years in a row, and the amount of loss is getting bigger. This year, it expects to lose about 5.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars again. By June of this year, the company had lost 2.432 billion New Taiwan Dollars before taxes, and its debt compared to its assets was 47.71%.</p>
            <p>Because the business situation is becoming more difficult, Taiwan Water will start an 8-year plan this year called the "Leakage Reduction Plan." This plan will cost a total of 80.77 billion New Taiwan Dollars. For the first four years, the government will provide 2 billion New Taiwan Dollars each year, which totals 8 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Taiwan Water must find the remaining 72.774 billion New Taiwan Dollars itself. When they buy new assets for this plan, the cost of these assets losing value will also add to their expenses. As the average interest rate on their loans goes up, and their operating costs keep getting higher, the financial pressure on the company is very clear.</p>
            <p>The 8-year plan to reduce leaks will use smart ways to manage and fix water leaks. It will use large amounts of data to find areas where many leaks happen, check for leaks, and replace old pipes. It will also focus on taking good care of the whole pipe system. After the plan is finished, the amount of water lost from leaks can go down from 11.99% at the end of 2024 to 9.77% at the end of 2032. This means that about 59.1 million cubic meters of water can be saved each year. This is almost the same amount of water as 1.17 times the useful water stored in the Lushan Reservoir.</p>
            <p>Besides working on reducing leaks, Taiwan Water also recently looked at how to make its response to water outages better after Typhoon Danas. One important job is to create a clear set of steps for pumping stations that do not have their own power generators. They have also put plans in place for areas where the ground is weak. Specific actions include moving portable power generators ahead of time and renting generators based on contracts with companies. This is to make sure the power supply does not stop. For some pumping stations that are on the side of the road and do not have much space, water trucks and water buckets will be used instead.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan Water will work with Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) to get electricity back first for important locations. This will help reduce problems with water supply for people's daily lives. Taiwan Water will also follow the advice of Lai Chien-hsin, the Vice Minister of Economic Affairs. They plan to learn from Taipower's experience in organizing and directing during disasters. They will consider using similar methods to greatly improve how Taiwan Water responds to disasters.</p>
