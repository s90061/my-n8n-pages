            <h1>Illegal Mining in Meinong's "Grand Canyon" Area: Mayor Chen Chi-mai Promises Strong Action Across Departments</h1>
            <p>In the Meinong District of Kaohsiung City, farmland has been illegally dug up for soil and rocks, and then filled with waste. Mayor Chen Chi-mai said today that all these cases will be investigated and dealt with strictly by law. He will take responsibility and work hard. The city will start a big operation to stop these crimes, using joint checks by different government departments.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Information Bureau released a statement. It said Mayor Chen clearly stated at a city meeting today that the city government will not avoid this problem. They will take full responsibility and do their best to stop all criminal activities and bring the criminals to justice.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen ordered the relevant departments to enforce laws strictly. All cases will be thoroughly investigated and handled by law. The process of catching criminals should be simpler and bigger. They will work together across different departments to start a large-scale clean-up. If any case is found, the strongest punishment will be given, and the prosecutors will be told immediately.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen also said that during the investigation, they found some cases where landowners bought land, then quickly sold it to others who then illegally dug up soil and filled the land with waste. He noted that the current "Soil and Rock Exploitation Act" mainly gives administrative fines, which are not strong enough to stop such crimes.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen asked the central government to change the law to add criminal penalties. He also asked for a review of the "Waste Disposal Act" and the "Regional Planning Act" to make punishments tougher and stop these crimes.</p>
            <p>Mayor Chen stressed that these new types of crimes involve large groups of criminals. The city government will ask the relevant units to continue large-scale operations to completely break up these illegal groups. This shows the city government's strong will to fight against illegal activities.</p>

            <h1>Not Qualified for Party Chairman? Fu Kun-chi Says: "I Haven't Even Decided to Run Yet"</h1>
            <p>There are rumors that Fu Kun-chi, the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) group in the Legislative Yuan, wants to run for party chairman. This has caused a discussion within the party about whether he is allowed to run. Today, Fu Kun-chi said that people are asking if he can run, but he thinks this is not important. He said he has not even decided if he wants to run yet. He thanked everyone for their interest and support.</p>
            <p>It is rumored that Fu Kun-chi wants to run for KMT chairman, but his right to run has caused debate within the party. Media reports say that Fu Kun-chi was expelled from the KMT in the past because he ran for Hualien County mayor without the party's approval. This means he might not meet the rules of the "Party Chairman Election Regulations" and cannot run. However, some party members say that the changes to the election rules came later. So, based on legal principles, they should not apply to past actions.</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi spoke to reporters at the Legislative Yuan today. He said that his work at the Legislative Yuan is very busy, and he will think about it carefully in the coming days. He added that people are interested in whether he is qualified to run, but for him, it's not important because he hasn't even thought about running yet. He thanked everyone for their concern and encouragement.</p>
            <p>Fu Kun-chi also said that it is good that people are willing to take on responsibility. The KMT is in a very difficult situation and has little money. He believes that KMT Chairman Chu Li-luan has spent all his savings. He wishes good luck to anyone who wants to take on the responsibility. He hopes the KMT chairman election will be a healthy competition. He believes that only by working together can they face the strong Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether he will run for party chairman, Fu Kun-chi did not give a clear answer. He only said, "Let the bullets fly," meaning let's wait and see. He pointed out that many good party members have come forward, including Luo Chih-chiang, a very good secretary-general of the KMT group, and former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-pin, who has a lot of experience. He also mentioned Chang Ya-chung, the head of Sun Wen School, who has excellent ideas about Sun Yat-sen's thoughts. Fu Kun-chi said, "As long as it can be successful, success does not have to be mine."</p>
