        const text = `**Iran's Nuclear Sites: Why One Was Not Hit by Bunker-Buster Bombs, US General Explains**

The highest general in the U.S. military, Dan Caine, told senators on June 26 that the U.S. did not use bunker-buster bombs on Isfahan, one of Iran's largest nuclear sites. This is because the facility is very deep underground, and the bombs would likely not work there.

According to CNN, this is the first time the U.S. military has explained why they did not use huge bunker-buster bombs on the Isfahan nuclear site. U.S. officials believe that nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium, which is key for making nuclear weapons, is stored in underground buildings in Isfahan, central Iran. However, while U.S. B2 bombers dropped many bunker-buster bombs on two other sites, Fordo and Natanz, Isfahan was only attacked by Tomahawk missiles fired from submarines.

General Caine's spokesperson did not want to comment on his secret talk with Congress. One U.S. official said that CIA Director Ratcliffe had stated that U.S. intelligence believed most of Iran's enriched nuclear material was hidden in Isfahan and Fordo. Caine and Defense Secretary Hedges said that the military action against Fordo went as planned. They did not mention the effects on Isfahan and Natanz. On June 27, President Trump again said that no materials were moved from Iran's three sites before the U.S. military acted.

Officials from the Trump government avoided questions about where Iran's enriched uranium was during their talk with Congress. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, told CNN after the meeting that some of Iran's nuclear ability is "deep underground, where we can never reach. This means they can move a lot of their stored nuclear material to places where U.S. bombs cannot reach."

Professor Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey told CNN that satellite photos show Iran has been using underground tunnels at Isfahan. Lewis pointed out that on June 26, there were some vehicles at Isfahan, and at least one tunnel entrance was clear by the morning of June 27. He said, "If Iran's stored highly enriched uranium was in the tunnels when they blocked the entrances, it might now be moved to other places." According to Lewis, new satellite photos from Planet Labs on June 27 showed the tunnel entrance was still open.

Earlier, CNN also reported that new satellite images from Maxar Technologies on June 27 showed bulldozers and digging machines at Iran's Fordo nuclear site.

**Fake Video of Han Kuo-yu Circulates, KMT Lawmakers Say It's AI-Generated and Threaten Lawsuits**

Is AI joining the big recall vote? The first part of the big recall vote is set for July 26, and both sides are getting ready. However, fake videos, images, and even voices of Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers, made with AI, are now appearing online. For example, simple changes include turning KMT lawmakers' "anti-recall" messages into "pro-recall" ones. More advanced fakes use "Deepfake" AI technology to create videos where KMT lawmakers appear to support the recall. KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao confirmed he knows about this and warned all KMT lawmakers to sue if they find such fakes. He noted that laws against deepfakes are now very strict.

Recently, on the social media site "Threads," a video of Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu telling voters not to oppose the recall vote appeared. This video was actually from when Han was the mayor of Kaohsiung and faced a recall himself, where he made a warm appeal. Unknown people edited this old video and added his title as Legislative Speaker, making it seem like he was speaking to voters during the current heated recall vote.

Also, some KMT lawmakers' faces have been put into different "pro-recall" videos using "Deepfake" technology, with their original voices recreated by AI. These videos look and sound so real that it seems like the KMT lawmakers are supporting the recall, which could confuse KMT voters, especially older ones.

Lai Shyh-bao stated that he had heard about these AI-made fakes. He urged every KMT lawmaker to be careful and sue immediately if they find such content. He added that laws against deepfakes are very strict, and the Criminal Investigation Bureau's Ninth Division is good at finding the creators quickly by tracing video links and IP addresses.

Lai specifically advised KMT lawmakers to carefully check recent videos for any fakes and sue if found. He admitted he worries that KMT voters might be affected by these videos. He believes all KMT lawmakers share this worry, calling it "cognitive warfare" and a very bad act that uses AI and Deepfake technology.

KMT lawmaker Ko Ru-chun said that elections and recalls should be done in a democratic, legal, and good way. Otherwise, it is a bad example of misusing democracy. He hopes people do not use technology for wrong reasons. He believes the Central Election Commission, the government, and all political parties should tell their supporters not to misuse technology to spread false information that affects elections.

Ko also said he is still waiting for the government to create an "AI Basic Law." He has been waiting for the Executive Yuan to propose this law since the current Legislative Yuan began. People might wonder if the government is secretly helping these deepfake technologies to remain unregulated. He stated that the government needs a higher law for "generative AI" because it can harm human rights and guide its development. He criticized the government for being very passive on this issue.

Ko pointed out that if individuals, groups, or organizations use AI to create false information to affect elections, they could be charged under Article 146 of the Criminal Code for "hindering voting accuracy," which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison. Article 104 of the Election and Recall Act also bans using deepfake technology to spread false information. He regretted that the Central Election Commission has not fairly guided the recent recall events.

**Deadly Heat Dome Covers Europe: Spain Reaches 47Â°C, Italian Roads Melt, Fatal Storms in France and Germany**

As summer begins, a "heat dome" is covering Europe, bringing record high temperatures, wildfires, and dangerous storms. This weekend, temperatures in Spain could reach 47 degrees Celsius. Roads in Italy are melting due to the heat, and heavy rain in France and Germany has caused deaths.

The Daily Mail reported that a tourist recently died from heatstroke on Mallorca, Spain. Weather expert Gernot Schutz said that a heatwave from Africa will make temperatures even higher, possibly reaching 46 to 47 degrees in some areas. Spanish authorities have told people to stay indoors and avoid strong outdoor activities. Medical teams are ready for a possible rise in heatstroke cases, especially for children, older people, and those with long-term illnesses.

Neighboring Portugal's national weather service said the heatwave will start this weekend across the country. Temperatures in the south and central-north river valleys will go over 40 degrees. Sunday will be even hotter, with two-thirds of the country under an orange heat warning. Lisbon is expected to reach 42 degrees.

France is having its 50th national heatwave since 1947. Four southern regions have an orange warning, with temperatures possibly reaching 39 degrees. The French weather agency said that warm sea surface temperatures in the Mediterranean are making nights even hotter. Nine more regions will also be under an orange warning from noon on June 28.

After the heat, heavy rainstorms arrived. On June 26, France was hit by deadly storms. Paris streets quickly flooded, and strong winds knocked down trees, causing two deaths and 17 injuries. A 12-year-old child died from a falling tree in the south, and a man died in the north after hitting a fallen tree with his quad bike. About 110,000 homes lost electricity.

At the National Assembly in Paris, the roof started leaking during the Prime Minister's speech. The Vice President of the Assembly had to stop the debate so firefighters could check the roof. When the meeting started again, workers used absorbent mats to temporarily stop the leaks.

Germany also had strong summer storms. Transport in Berlin was greatly affected, and suburban trains stopped completely on the evening of June 26. Official announcements stated that services were stopped due to "weather conditions (fallen trees)." In Germany, one person died and another was badly injured due to falling trees caused by the storm.

In Italy, roads in the north melted because of the high temperatures and had to be closed. The health ministry issued red heat warnings for 21 cities, including Rome, Milan, and Venice. People were advised to avoid going outside from 11 AM to 6 PM and to go to air-conditioned public places to cool down. Florence is expected to be 37 degrees on June 28, and Rome, Milan, and Naples will reach 36 degrees on June 29.

In Venice, the temperature on June 28 was 32 degrees Celsius, but it felt like 36 degrees. This even forced billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's pre-wedding party to end early. On the evening of June 26, a sudden heavy rainstorm stopped their pre-wedding celebration. Strong winds and heavy rain soaked the guests, who quickly rushed to water taxis. The event ended about 45 minutes earlier than its planned midnight finish.

A "heat dome" happens when a high-pressure system traps a thick layer of warm air over an area, like a lid on a pot. This often causes long periods of high temperatures. Climate scientists warn that the intense heat in the Mediterranean region, from the Iberian Peninsula to the Balkans and Greece, shows the effects of human-caused climate change. They predict that future heatwaves will be longer and more severe, and extreme weather events will happen more often.
