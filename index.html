European stocks mostly increased today. This happened because investors believed that countries would make a deal with the United States. This deal would help avoid high taxes on imported goods.

US President Trump said that from August 1st, there would be a 50% tax on imported copper. This news made mining company stocks go up a lot. It also helped the London stock market reach a new high.

The FTSE 100 index in London went up by 108.64 points, or 1.23%, ending at 8975.66 points. The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 92.75 points, or 0.38%, closing at 24456.81 points. The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 23.79 points, or 0.30%, ending at 7902.25 points.

**New York Times: Chinese Research Ships Often Near Taiwan's East Coast and Guam**

The New York Times reported that Chinese research ships used to be active mostly near Taiwan's east coast. But since last year, many of them have been seen near Guam. Experts believe that the information these ships collect about the seafloor could be for military use. They say this because the ships sail in very precise, close, and parallel lines.

Three years ago, Chinese research ships mainly stayed near China's coast. Now, they are often in the western Pacific near Guam. The information they gather might be useful if there is a conflict with Taiwan and the United States. Data from a company called Starboard Maritime Intelligence shows that Chinese ocean research ships are studying areas near Taiwan's east coast and about 250 miles (402 kilometers) east and west of Guam. The Chinese military sees these three areas as very important for their strategies.

Starboard's data shows that China's Xiangyanghong 6 and six other ships, which have sonar and equipment to take samples from the seafloor, sailed along Taiwan's east coast 25 times in parallel lines last year. At the same time, these research ships also worked near Guam. Some ships got close to Taiwan's 12-nautical-mile territorial waters but did not cross the border.

**US Secretary of State: Southeast Asian Countries May Get Better Tariff Rates**

Today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Southeast Asian countries might get "better" tariff rates compared to other parts of the world. The trade war from Washington D.C. was a main topic at the meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) he attended.

Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that President Trump this week warned over 20 countries. If they don't reach a deal with Washington by August 1st, they will face extra taxes on their goods.

Rubio was in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, for the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' meeting. He told reporters there, "I want to say that, in the end, many Southeast Asian countries' tariff rates will actually be better than those in other parts of the world." He added, "However, these talks are still ongoing. Next week, we will talk with Japan, and also with almost every country present here."
