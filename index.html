            <h1>US Threat to Close TikTok Led China to Make a Deal, Says Bessent</h1>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Bessent said that the United States threatened to close TikTok. This made Chinese negotiators stop asking for changes in tariffs (taxes on goods) if they sold TikTok. Because of this threat, both sides reached a general agreement in Madrid today.</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent explained that this agreement will protect America's national security. It will also keep TikTok's "Chinese characteristics." He added that the next talks between the US and China might happen before November 10. This is when the current break in tariff disagreements ends. This break might also be extended for another 90 days.</p>
            <p>Bessent spoke to Reuters and Bloomberg News in Madrid today. He shared that Chinese negotiators came to the talks with many demands for "compensation" for a TikTok agreement. These demands included removing new tariffs added by Trump, old tariffs, and US rules on technology exports.</p>
            <p>Bessent said about the Chinese group in Madrid, "They did not want TikTok to close. They did not truly understand that the President was ready to shut down TikTok." He also said, "I think we changed their minds."</p>
            <p>He mentioned that President Trump gave him and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer a lot of power to negotiate. They also "made the Chinese side understand that we would not give in a lot."</p>
            <p>Bessent said that the US did not agree to remove current tariffs or trade rules. Instead, the US agreed not to do certain things in the future. He stated, "So, they basically got a promise that some things would not happen in the future, rather than removing current actions."</p>
            <p>He did not want to say exactly what the US gave up about TikTok. He only said that some "process-related" requests from China were met.</p>
            <p>Someone who knew about the Madrid talks said that another reason China agreed was a message from the US team. The message was that if a TikTok agreement was not made in Madrid, a possible meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this autumn would not happen.</p>
            <p>Bessent did not want to talk about the business parts of the agreement or what would happen to TikTok's main computer code. But he said the US was "very happy" with the national security parts of the agreement.</p>
