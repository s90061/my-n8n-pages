            <h1>China's A-Shares Keep Rising, Shanghai Index Returns Above 3700 Points, Reaching a 10-Year High</h1>
            <p>On August 18, 2025, the three main stock indexes in China's A-share market all started the day with gains. The Shanghai Composite Index (Shanghai Index) went back above 3700 points. It passed its previous high of 3731.69 points from February 18, 2021, and reached a new high not seen since August 20, 2015.</p>
            <p>China had a stock market crash in 2015. On June 12 of that year, the Shanghai Index reached its highest point ever at 5178.19 points. After that, it fell sharply and stayed around 3000 points for many years.</p>
            <p>According toÊæéÊπÉÊñ∞ËÅû, the Shanghai Index has gone up by 22.72% since it reached its lowest point of 3040.69 points on April 7, 2025. It's important to note that during the same time, the Shenzhen Component Index went up almost 30%, and the ChiNext Index went up 47%.</p>
            <p>China Industrial Securities believes that the current market increase is not because people expect the economy to get much better. Instead, it's mainly because new factors are continuously appearing under government support. This has made people more confident in the market and brought in more money. The market needs a short break after continuous gains, and recent policies from China and other countries just provided a good chance for this.</p>
            <p>Guotai Haitong Securities thinks that the A-share indexes might reach even higher points. People usually believe that company performance, risk-free interest rates, and how much risk people are willing to take affect stock values. However, they often forget about changes in rules and systems, which are very important. This factor is more important in the Chinese market than in other markets and can even decide things at certain times.</p>

            <h1>Bolivian Presidential Election: Two Right-Wing Candidates Will Go to a Second Round</h1>
            <p>La Paz, Bolivia ‚Äì August 17, 2025 ‚Äì Bolivia held its presidential election today. Early predictions show that two right-wing candidates won the first round of the election. This means that nearly 20 years of left-wing government in the country will end. The election will now go to a second round.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Ipsos Group and Captura polling companies made predictions based on some of the results. They showed that Rodrigo Paz, a senator from the center-right, surprisingly got the most votes in the first round, with over 31% of the votes.</p>
            <p>The numbers show that the former right-wing president, Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga, was second, with about 27% of the votes.</p>
            <p>Samuel Doria Medina, a well-known businessman who was expected to do well, finished third with 19.5% to 20.2% of the votes. Andronico Rodriguez, the main left-wing candidate and leader of the Senate, was much further behind in fourth place.</p>
            <p>Bolivia's weak economy was the most important issue for voters. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in a generation. Because of this, many voters decided not to support the ruling Movement for Socialism party.</p>

            <h1>National Academy for Educational Research Works with Yilan County Government to Build a Regional Experimental Education Area</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 18, 2025 ‚Äì The National Academy for Educational Research (NAER) and the Yilan County Government signed an agreement today for academic cooperation. This starts a two-year partnership. They will combine their resources to create a "regional experimental education area." The goal is to set an example for new ideas in education that include both special needs education and using digital technology.</p>
            <p>The NAER said in a press release today that Yilan County has been working hard on outdoor education, special needs education, and learning social and emotional skills for a long time. This new cooperation will focus on designing lessons and new ways of teaching. They will use Yilan's natural environment and community resources to build the regional experimental area. They will work together on many things, from planning lessons and setting up the experimental area, to training teachers and pushing for new education policies.</p>
            <p>The NAER also said that building a regional experimental education area means that ideas won't just stay on paper. They will go into classrooms and outdoors, becoming real experiences and learning for students. "Digital development" is a very important part of this plan. They will also pay attention to the learning rights of students with special needs and create outdoor lessons for special needs education, making sure everyone has an equal chance to learn.</p>
            <p>Also, the NAER recently signed an agreement for academic exchange and cooperation with National Yilan University. In the future, the NAER will work with National Yilan University and the Yilan County Government in a three-way partnership. The "experimental area" will be the main focus. They will create a model base in Yilan and share it across the country. This will combine research, management, and expert resources. They will use Yilan's natural environment to build a learning platform that covers different subjects. This will help with lesson design, teacher training, and adding local special features to education.</p>
            <p>The NAER hopes that this academic cooperation will create an education model that has local characteristics, new ideas, and a good system for getting feedback. This will bring new energy to Taiwan's education as it uses digital technology and becomes fairer, opening up new ways to grow.</p>
