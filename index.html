            <h1>Japanese Traveler's Bag Missing from Locker, MRT Police Investigation Reveals False Alarm</h1>
            <p>A Japanese man traveling recently put his bag in a locker at Nangang Exhibition Center MRT station. But when he came back, the bag was gone. The MRT police were told about it and looked into what happened. They found out that the man did not lock the locker correctly, so his bag was moved to another locker. Luckily, the bag was found safely, and it was just a false alarm.</p>
            <p>Today, the MRT Police Department of Taipei City Police shared this news. Officers Zhang Wen-yi and Ye Jun-chang from the third MRT police team were working when they heard about a Japanese man's bag missing at Nangang Exhibition Center MRT station. They quickly helped.</p>
            <p>After checking, they learned that the Japanese man was visiting Taiwan. He put his bag in locker number 9 at Nangang Exhibition Center station. But later, when he returned to get his bag, the locker would not open.</p>
            <p>The MRT police checked the security cameras. They saw that the Japanese man did not know how to use the locker well. After putting his bag in and paying, he thought the locker door would lock by itself. So, he left. But the locker was not locked. Later, another traveler wanted to use the same locker. They saw a bag inside, so they took it out and put it on the floor.</p>
            <p>Then, a worker who checks the lockers saw the bag on the floor. The worker moved it to another empty locker.</p>
            <p>The Japanese man did not know this. When he came back to get his bag, he was surprised that the locker would not open. But the MRT police checked many places and confirmed it was a false alarm. They found the man's bag in another locker. They checked the contents, and everything was there. They helped the Japanese man get his bag back.</p>
            <p>The Japanese man was very happy with how fast the MRT police helped him find his lost item. He felt safe to continue his trip in Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Care Disputes Happen Often, Nursing Home Groups Ask to Loosen Qualification for Responsible Person</h1>
            <p>The person in charge of a nursing home should be a nurse. But many times, there are legal problems with care. Many nurses who are in charge did not put money into the nursing home. But they have to take all the legal risks by themselves. Groups that support nursing homes are asking to change the rule so that any adult citizen can be in charge.</p>
            <p>The former head of the Taiwan Nursing Home Association, Chou Shih-ling, told the media today that many nurses who lead nursing homes are not the owners. But they are the only ones who have to take legal responsibility. In places like Taoyuan, Nantou, and New Taipei, there have been many care disputes in nursing homes recently. Most nurses in charge were found innocent, but the long legal cases caused a lot of stress. Some even quit their jobs, which affected the quality of care.</p>
            <p>Chou Shih-ling said that changing the law would not stop nurses from starting their own businesses. It would just stop hired nurses from having to take risks they should not have. Last year, they talked with other groups about changing the law and agreed on some points. Three political parties and 17 lawmakers in the Legislative Yuan supported the proposed change. But before it went to the Legislative Yuan, the Taiwan Union of Nurses Association and the Ministry of Health and Welfare did not agree with it. If the government keeps ignoring this issue, they might protest.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare's Department of Nursing and Health Care replied that the Taiwan Nursing Home Association suggested changing the "Nursing Personnel Act." This change would allow any adult citizen, not just nurses, to be in charge of a nursing home. They had a meeting about this on August 8 last year. They asked the association to provide a new plan and to get other nursing groups to agree. However, on September 11 of the same year, the association sent a letter saying they would not follow the meeting's decision. This was like going back on their word.</p>
            <p>The Department of Nursing and Health Care said that there are often civil and criminal lawsuits because of disagreements between investors and nursing home leaders about hiring, inheritance, and contracts. They suggest making rules for contracts, like those used in clinics or other private medical places, to help solve these problems. To help with worries about legal risks, the Ministry of Health and Welfare will work with nursing groups. They will help nurses improve their skills in running nursing homes, and teach them more about laws and business.</p>
            <p>Nursing homes mainly care for sick people who need nursing care. They are set up according to the Nursing Personnel Act. They are special medical places for nursing professionals. Because they deal with the quality of professional care and people's rights, the laws and rules for nursing homes are the same as for all other medical places in the country. The person in charge of the organization must be a professional with skills in that specific field.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Union of Nurses Association released a statement today. They said they understand the problems with the nursing home system. But nurses, like doctors and other medical staff, can be in charge of an organization by law. This is an important rule that protects their professional status and fairness. If the law is changed too quickly, it could cause confusion about who is responsible.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Union of Nurses Association suggests that the government quickly create rules for how nursing organizations are managed. This includes nursing foundations and associations. These rules should clearly separate the responsibilities of the owners and the professional managers. They should also bring in fair competition rules to stop monopolies and bad competition. At the same time, they reminded nurses not to lend their licenses or names easily, so they do not become scapegoats.</p>

            <h1>Additional Budget Added Back for Baipao Lake Social Housing; National Land Management Agency: To Achieve Housing Justice</h1>
            <p>The government recently suggested adding more money to the budget because the original budget was cut. News reports say that the Ministry of the Interior has fully put back the money for the Baipao Lake social housing project in Xizhi District, New Taipei City. This project had lost all its money, which was over 120 million New Taiwan dollars. The National Land Management Agency said this was done legally to make housing fair and help young people in New Taipei.</p>
            <p>On August 14, the Executive Yuan approved the plan to add more money to the central government's budget for the year 2025. A total of over 87.84 billion New Taiwan dollars was added. This money will come from the extra funds left over from this year's original budget.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that this year, the central government's spending was cut by more than 200 billion New Taiwan dollars. Also, the Executive Yuan itself had to cut another 63.6 billion New Taiwan dollars. This was a very large amount. At first, they had to lower the money given to local governments. But because local governments need money to do their work, and central government departments still need money even after saving, they decided to add more to the budget. The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee is expected to check this plan on August 28.</p>
            <p>News reports state that the Legislative Yuan's Budget Center checked the new budget plan. After cuts, over 13.2 billion New Taiwan dollars were put back into the budget. The Ministry of the Interior had the highest percentage of money put back, at 95.4%. For example, the "Baipao Lake Sports, Recreation, and Ecology Park and Social Housing Project" had 124 million New Taiwan dollars completely removed. Now, this new budget puts 100% of that money back.</p>
            <p>Today, the National Land Management Agency of the Ministry of the Interior said in a press release that they put the money back for the original project according to the law. This is to make housing fair and to help young people in the New Taipei area. It will also give young families and students a diverse sports center.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency pointed out that it is hard to find land for social housing in Xizhi District, New Taipei City. The original project, with help from different government departments, was planned as a complete development. It was going to provide thousands of social housing units, long-term care, welfare facilities, a 3.4-hectare sports center, and outdoor sports facilities. These would meet the needs of people of all ages for living and fun. The New Taipei City government is also helping by building roads and public pipes around the area.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency said that because the original budget was greatly cut, the whole project was stopped for a time. This also affected other public construction projects in Xizhi District and the rights of its residents.</p>
            <p>The National Land Management Agency stated that the money added back to the budget for 2025 will help the New Taipei City government pay for the planning and design of the Baipao Lake Ecology Park and for buying land. It will also allow the National Housing and Urban Regeneration Center to plan social housing as a new community. They are asking all political parties in the Legislative Yuan to support the future development of Xizhi.</p>
