https://www.bbc.com/news/business-69165688
Many families around the world are still finding it hard to manage their money as the cost of living remains high. Prices for everyday things like food, fuel, and housing have increased a lot in the last couple of years. This means that people's salaries don't buy as much as they used to. Some families are cutting back on non-essential spending, like eating out or going on holidays, to make sure they can pay for the basic necessities. Governments and banks are working to control rising prices, but for now, many households are carefully watching every penny they spend. This situation is affecting people's financial plans and their daily quality of life, especially for those with lower incomes.

**Work: The Shift Towards More Office Days**

After a period of widespread remote work, many large companies are now asking their employees to come back to the office more often. Businesses like Amazon and Google have been encouraging or even requiring staff to spend at least three days a week in the office. The main reasons given for this change are to improve teamwork and company culture. Leaders believe that working together in person helps people share ideas more easily and build stronger relationships. While some employees prefer the flexibility of working from home, companies are stressing the benefits of face-to-face interaction for creativity and group projects. This shift means that the hybrid work model, mixing home and office work, is becoming more common than full-time remote work.

**Travel: European Cities Tackle Overtourism with New Rules**
https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2024/apr/25/venice-tourist-fee-first-city-charge-entry-visitors-day-trippers
Popular European cities are introducing new rules to deal with overtourism, which is when too many visitors go to one place at the same time. Venice, Italy, for example, recently started charging day-trippers an entry fee during busy periods. This trial aims to reduce crowds and make the city more enjoyable for both tourists and local residents. Other destinations, like Amsterdam and Barcelona, are also exploring ways to manage visitor numbers, such as limiting short-term rentals or discouraging large groups. The goal is to find a balance between welcoming tourists, who bring money to the local economy, and protecting the environment and quality of life for people who live there. These measures reflect a growing effort to promote more sustainable and responsible tourism.`;
