            <h1>Loan Interest Subsidies to Boost Spending: China's Ministry of Finance May Extend Policy</h1>
            <p>China's economy is not growing fast enough in terms of people buying things. So, the government has started a new policy. It will give money back for interest paid on personal loans and loans for businesses in the service industry. China's Ministry of Finance said this is the first time the central government is doing this. The goal is to make people spend more money. They will decide later if they need to continue the policy for a longer time.</p>
            <p>On the morning of August 13, China's State Council Information Office held a press conference. They talked about the policies for personal consumption loan interest subsidies and service industry business loan interest subsidies.</p>
            <p>Liao Min, the Vice Minister of Finance, said that giving money back for interest on personal loans and business loans is the first time the central government is doing it. It's like another "government subsidy" for spending. This policy aims to make spending stronger and make the market more active. This shows that the government really cares about increasing spending.</p>
            <p>Liao Min said that these two policies want to encourage more money to go into spending. This will help boost spending and make the economy flow better. After the policy ends, they will check how well it worked. Depending on the results, they might extend the policy time, offer it to more types of businesses, or change which banks offer the loans.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank of China, and the Financial Regulatory Administration released a plan for "Personal Consumption Loan Financial Interest Subsidy Policy." The plan says that from September 1 this year to August 31, 2026, people can get an interest subsidy if they use personal loans from certain banks for approved spending.</p>
            <p>The subsidy will be 1% of the yearly interest rate. The central government will pay 90% of the subsidy, and the provincial governments will pay 10%.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Finance gave an example. If a person takes out a 200,000 RMB (about 834,000 NT dollars) personal loan to renovate their home or buy furniture and appliances, and the yearly interest rate is 3%, they would normally pay 6,000 RMB in interest. With the 1% interest subsidy, they will pay 2,000 RMB less in interest.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and seven other departments released a plan called "Service Industry Business Loan Interest Subsidy Policy."</p>
            <p>Businesses in 8 service areas can get interest subsidies. These areas are food and lodging, health, elderly care, childcare, household services, culture and entertainment, tourism, and sports. To get the subsidy, they must take out loans between March 16 this year (when the "Special Action Plan to Boost Consumption" was released) and December 31 this year. The money must be used to improve their facilities or services.</p>
            <p>The subsidy period is no more than 1 year, and the yearly subsidy rate is 1%. The central government pays 90% of the subsidy, and the provincial governments pay 10%. The maximum subsidy for one business can be up to 1 million RMB. For example, if a restaurant gets a 900,000 RMB loan for 1 year on October 1 this year to buy new equipment or expand its space, it can receive a 9,000 RMB interest subsidy.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rains in Kyushu: 3 Dead, Over 700 Buildings Flooded; Recovery Faces Hot Weather</h1>
            <p>Earlier this month, many areas in Japan's Kyushu region had record-breaking heavy rains. So far, 3 people have died, several people are missing, and 732 buildings are flooded. As people work to clean up their homes, the weather today is expected to be very hot, more than 35 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>NHK, a Japanese news channel, reported today that many places in Kyushu, like Kagoshima and Kumamoto prefectures, had "linear rainbands" from August 8. These are lines of rain clouds that can be 50 to 300 kilometers long. This brought record heavy rains to many areas.</p>
            <p>The heavy rains caused damage in many places. In Kamou-cho, Aira City, Kagoshima Prefecture, a house was completely destroyed by a mudslide. A woman living in that house was found dead on August 11.</p>
            <p>Also, on August 12, in Kosa Town, Kumamoto Prefecture, a man died after being caught in a mudslide while trying to evacuate. In Yatsushiro City in the same prefecture, a car fell into an industrial water channel, and a woman in her 70s inside the car died.</p>
            <p>In Fukutsu City, Fukuoka Prefecture, it is thought that a man and a woman, both in their 60s, were washed into a river. They are still missing.</p>
            <p>The Kumamoto Prefectural Government first said 3 people were missing. But they could not confirm the report of one person being washed away by the river. Last night, they changed the number of missing people to 2.</p>
            <p>Regarding damage, in Kagoshima, Kumamoto, and Fukuoka prefectures, 3 buildings were completely destroyed, 3 buildings were partly damaged, and 732 buildings were flooded.</p>
            <p>Japanese police and local governments are still gathering information about the damage from these heavy rains.</p>
            <p>FNN, another Japanese news channel, reported that 2 people are missing in Fukuoka Prefecture and 2 in Kumamoto Prefecture.</p>
            <p>A welfare center in Tamana City, Kumamoto Prefecture, was also damaged by the heavy rains. Workers are cleaning furniture with water to help with recovery. However, some people said, "Some air conditioners are not working, and air conditioner repair companies seem to be very busy now. We don't know what to do."</p>
            <p>Japan is currently under a high-pressure system. Many areas, including Kyushu, are expected to have very hot weather today. The highest temperatures in some places could be 37 degrees Celsius in Hita City, Oita Prefecture, 36 degrees in Kumamoto City, and 35 degrees in Fukuoka City.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu Approaches: Yunlin Vegetable Farmers Rush to Harvest, Pomelo Farmers Protect Trees</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu is getting closer to Taiwan. Vegetable farmers in Yunlin took advantage of the lighter wind and rain this morning to quickly harvest their crops. Meanwhile, in Douliu, where pomelos will be ready to pick in about one week, pomelo farmers are checking their farms' drainage systems. They are worried that strong winds will cause fruit to fall, or that water staying in the fields will harm the trees. This could lead to big losses.</p>
            <p>The Erlun Township Farmers' Association usually moves about 60 tons of vegetables every day. But since Typhoon Danas, Yunlin County has had many days of rain, and vegetables in the fields have rotted. Now, only about 20 tons of vegetables are being moved. Last week, the weather in Yunlin County cleared up, and farmers quickly replanted. But now with Typhoon Yangliu coming, farmers are rushing to harvest the vegetables they already have in their fields.</p>
            <p>A vegetable farmer said that before July, they lost money on almost all short-term leafy vegetables. Because of typhoons and southwest winds, many vegetables were damaged. This meant there were fewer vegetables available, and prices went up quickly. For example, they were planning to harvest a field of rapeseed tomorrow, but the vegetable seller asked them to harvest it this morning while there was no wind or rain. They were worried about more damage after the typhoon passed.</p>
            <p>Douliu pomelos will start to be harvested next week. Today, Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Li-shan visited the Douliu pomelo growing area with agriculture director Wei Sheng-de and Douliu City Farmers' Association head Chang Chiao-fu to check on typhoon protection measures.</p>
            <p>Chang Li-shan said that because of the typhoon, Yunlin County will have average winds of 6 to 7 on the Beaufort scale from this afternoon, with sudden strong winds possibly reaching 9 to 10. Douliu fruit farmers have already prepared. For example, the drainage systems in their orchards are very good, so water will not stay and rot the tree roots when it rains.</p>
            <p>Pomelo farmer Cheng Yen-fu said that pomelos are most afraid of being in water. If the roots near the surface die from being in water, the fruit tree will die. So, a good drainage system for the orchard is very important. Also, the Douliu pomelos are expected to be harvested in about one week, and the fruit is very heavy now. Even slightly strong winds could make the fruit fall or damage its skin. He just hopes that the weather will be kind and the wind and rain will not be too strong.</p>
