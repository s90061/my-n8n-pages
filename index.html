Many shoppers in the UK are still finding it hard to afford things, even though prices are not rising as fast as before. A recent report from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) shows that people are buying less, especially things for their homes and clothing. Food prices are going up more slowly, but people are still careful about what they spend on groceries. This is because interest rates are high, which means loans and mortgages cost more. As a result, many families have less money to spend on other goods. Shops are hoping that prices will become more stable soon, which could help people feel better about spending. For now, most people are focused on saving money where they can.

**Artificial Intelligence Changing the Job Market**

New studies show that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will change many jobs, not just factory work or simple office tasks. Surprisingly, jobs that need university degrees or involve creativity might also be affected. Experts say that jobs requiring communication, planning, and design could see big changes because AI can now do some of these tasks. For example, AI can write text, create images, and even help with legal documents. However, this doesn't mean all these jobs will disappear. Instead, people will need to learn how to work with AI. The future of work will likely involve humans and AI working together, with people focusing on the parts that need human skills like empathy, complex problem-solving, and managing relationships. Training and new skills will be important for everyone.

**Finding Quiet Places to Travel as Tourism Grows**

Many popular travel spots are now very crowded, making it hard for tourists to enjoy them fully and for locals to live comfortably. This problem, called "overtourism," is getting worse as more people travel. Famous cities like Venice and Amsterdam are trying new rules to manage the crowds, such as limiting daily visitors or increasing tourist taxes. As a result, travelers are starting to look for less-known places or to visit popular spots during the quieter times of the year. Some people are choosing to explore their own countries more, or to visit small towns and natural areas instead of big cities. The goal for many travelers now is to find authentic experiences and avoid the crowds, which also helps local communities and the environment.
