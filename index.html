            <h1>French Drug Company's Chikungunya Vaccine Has Serious Side Effects, US Suspends Approval</h1>
            <p>A French drug company named Valneva said today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has stopped the approval for their Chikungunya vaccine, Ixchiq. This happened because people reported "serious problems" after taking the vaccine.</p>
            <p>The Ixchiq vaccine was approved in the US in 2023. But reports of side effects have caused officials to look into it, especially for older patients. The European Medicines Agency also took action this year.</p>
            <p>Valneva said that on August 22nd, the US FDA immediately stopped the vaccine's approval. The FDA mentioned 4 new cases of serious side effects. Three of these cases were in patients who were between 70 and 82 years old.</p>
            <p>Thomas Lingelbach, the CEO of Valneva, said in a statement, "The threat of Chikungunya is still growing around the world. So, Valneva will continue to work hard to make sure our vaccine is available to help global health. We will do this before we decide our next steps."</p>
            <p>Experts in public health say that Chikungunya could cause a widespread illness in the future. This is because climate change is causing mosquitoes that carry the disease to spread to new areas. Chikungunya rarely causes death, but the risk of dying is higher for babies and older people.</p>
            <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) warned in July that there is a risk of a large Chikungunya outbreak. They asked for quick action to deal with it.</p>

            <h1>South Korea's Strong Shipbuilding Industry Can Help US and Be Used in Talks with Washington</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of South Korea, Lee Jae-myung, will meet with US President Trump for the first time. South Korea plans to use its excellent shipbuilding skills as a way to negotiate with the US government. This help could revive the US shipbuilding industry.</p>
            <p>The Korea Herald newspaper said that South Korea's shipbuilding industry is a special point for talks about tariffs between South Korea and the US. South Korea's top shipbuilding skills can help President Trump's goal to make the US shipbuilding industry strong again.</p>
            <p>Many unnamed sources said that Kim Jung-kwan, South Korea's Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy, met with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in New York on July 25th. Kim suggested a plan called "Make American Shipbuilding Great Again (MASGA)" and a plan for South Korea and the US to work together on shipbuilding.</p>
            <p>Two of South Korea's biggest shipbuilding companies, HD Hyundai and Hanwha Group, are investing more in the US. They are also working more closely with US shipbuilders.</p>
            <p>HD Hyundai is working with an American shipyard called Edison Chouest Offshore. Together, they plan to build medium-sized container ships in this US shipyard by the year 2028.</p>
            <p>Last year, Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Group bought Hanwha Philly Shipyard for 100 million US dollars (about 3 billion Taiwan dollars). This shipyard also got a contract to build the first ship in nearly 50 years that can carry liquefied natural gas (LNG) for sale to other countries, and which was ordered by the US.</p>
            <p>A report from a Washington think tank, CSIS, in June this year showed that in 2024, South Korea was second in the world for new ship orders, with 17% of the market. China was first with 71%.</p>
            <p>South Korea has big shipyards that can build more than 220 ships each year. They have been very successful in making both ships for regular trade and special-purpose ships.</p>
            <p>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries, one of South Korea's main shipbuilders, can make 50 ships every year. It has given over 80 warships, like destroyers and frigates, to the South Korean navy. It also provides support ships to countries like the Philippines and New Zealand.</p>
            <p>Another big shipyard, Hanwha Ocean, also provides warships like destroyers, frigates, and light frigates to the South Korean navy. Out of 24 warships the South Korean navy bought, 17 were from Hanwha Ocean. Recently, Hanwha Ocean signed a contract with the US Seventh Fleet to fix and maintain support ships and fuel supply ships.</p>
            <p>Additionally, South Korea continues to use advanced technology. This includes technology that can be easily shared with the US. For example, HD Hyundai Heavy Industries is working with a US technology company called Palantir to create smart shipyards.</p>
            <p>This new plan uses "Digital Twins" technology in every step of shipbuilding, from design to making the ships. This is expected to help the US shipbuilding industry become strong again.</p>
            <p>Simply put, Digital Twins technology creates virtual copies of real products. It uses special data from shipyards to make ship design and testing better. This includes making models, trying out ideas on computers, and creating early versions.</p>
            <p>For making ships, digital twin shipyards help by using resources better and making the building process simpler. This makes production more efficient. It can even help shipyards control their machines and work more precisely.</p>
            <p>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries has signed an agreement with Huntington Ingalls Industries, which is the biggest US military shipyard. They will work together to use automation, robots, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology. This will help digital shipyards and improve how advanced technology is used.</p>
