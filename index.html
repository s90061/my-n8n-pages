**Taiwan's First Certified Cow Breed, "Yuanxing Cattle," Now Sold in Many Places**

"Yuanxing Cattle" is the first cow breed in Taiwan to get official approval from the government in November last year. Now, you can buy "Yuanxing Cattle" meat in many shops and restaurants. Some places even offer a 10% discount for military, police, and firefighters.

This special cow breed was developed by former President Lee Teng-hui. He started a company to raise "Tajima cows" from Japan, hoping to create a special Taiwanese beef. In 2022, they succeeded and named it "Yuanxing Cattle" after Lee's old home. The meat is known for being sweet, milky, and juicy even when fully cooked.

You can find "Yuanxing Cattle" burgers at Knock Knock Heaven restaurants in Zhouzi and Neihu. For hot pot, you can try it at Daan No. 9 restaurant. You can also buy frozen "Yuanxing Cattle" meat at Yuanxing Beef Shop in Taipei, Wuqiong Premium Yuanxing Cattle Online Store, First Beef, EasyGo Supermarket, Tianhe Fresh, and Anyong Fresh stores across Taiwan. The company plans to sell in more places so more people can try "Yuanxing Cattle."

**Diplomatic Problems Get Worse: US and Colombia Call Back Diplomats**

The United States has called back its top diplomat from Colombia because of strong comments made by high-ranking Colombian officials. After this, Colombia also called back its ambassador from the US.

The US State Department said they called back diplomat John McNamara for urgent talks because of "untrue and wrong comments" from Colombian government leaders. The US also said they will take other steps to show their concern about the relationship between the two countries.

The US State Department did not say exactly what comments they did not like. After the US called back its diplomat, Colombian President Gustavo Petro also called back Colombia's ambassador to the US. Petro said the ambassador should return to discuss plans between the two countries, like working together on climate change, fighting drugs, and immigration.
