            <h1>Pegula Wins Easily, Reaches US Open Semifinals</h1>
            <p>Jessica Pegula, an American tennis player and the number 4 seed, won her quarterfinal match at the US Open today. She beat Barbora Krejcikova from the Czech Republic, who has won two Grand Slam titles, with scores of 6-3, 6-3. Pegula will now play in the semifinals. This is the second year in a row that Pegula has reached the US Open semifinals.</p>
            <p>Last year, Pegula made it to the US Open final but lost. This year, she has not lost a single set in the tournament so far. Today, she played against Krejcikova, who is ranked 62nd in the world, and showed strong playing, winning steadily.</p>
            <p>After the match, Pegula said in an interview, "I felt I played very well today, and I felt very comfortable."</p>
            <p>In the semifinals, Pegula will play against either Aryna Sabalenka, the world's top player and defending champion, or Marketa Vondrousova from the Czech Republic, who won Wimbledon in 2023. This match will decide who goes to the final.</p>
            <p>Krejcikova returned to play after being away for six months because of a back injury. In her match before this one, against Taylor Townsend from the US, she saved eight match points and won in a surprising way. However, in today's match, she could not keep up her strong performance and did not win.</p>
            <p>Pegula said, "Everyone saw her performance in the last match, so I am very happy that I could finish the match."</p>

            <h1>Protests Continue in Indonesia, President Prabowo Will Still Visit China for Parade</h1>
            <p>Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto had planned to cancel his visit to China because of recent protests in his country. However, Indonesian officials said today that President Prabowo will still go to Beijing on September 3rd. He will attend the parade for the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the war against Japan.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Indonesia is experiencing problems because of many protests, which have caused at least eight deaths. The protests started because people were angry that members of parliament received many good benefits. As the protests continued, President Prabowo said he would cut some of the benefits and payments for parliament members to calm the public's anger.</p>
            <p>Prasetyo Hadi, Indonesia's State Secretary, said that President Prabowo left for China tonight and is expected to return home one day later.</p>
            <p>He said, "Today, the President continued to follow the latest situation and received reports from all relevant government departments that society is slowly returning to normal."</p>
            <p>Prasetyo Hadi also mentioned that during his trip, President Prabowo plans to talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Reports say that after the benefits for Indonesian parliament members were cut and the army was sent to the capital city, Jakarta, on September 1st, the protests became smaller.</p>
            <p>Indonesia has always followed a policy of being neutral in foreign relations, keeping good relationships with both the United States and China. However, President Prabowo has promised to make diplomatic and defense cooperation with China stronger.</p>

            <h1>Tunisian Man Stabs 5 People in Marseille, French Police Kill Suspect</h1>
            <p>The public prosecutor in France said that police today shot and killed a man in Marseille, a port city in the south. This man was thought to have stabbed at least five people. One of the injured people is in a very serious condition.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that prosecutor Nicolas Bessone told reporters that the attacker was a man from Tunisia who was legally in France. He stabbed the manager of a hotel. The manager had just asked him to leave because he did not pay for his stay.</p>
            <p>Bessone said that the suspect also attacked the manager's son, another person staying at the hotel, and two people on the street. The person staying at the hotel was hurt the most seriously.</p>
            <p>A police source, who did not want to be named, said that police came to the scene and killed the man.</p>
            <p>The office of the Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, said that Retailleau plans to visit Marseille tonight. He is expected to see the main police station in the city.</p>
            <p>A person living nearby who saw the event told AFP that the suspect tried to stab a police officer when police tried to catch him.</p>
            <p>Another person who saw what happened told AFP that the man was holding "two big knives."</p>
            <p>Police closed off the area and set up a tent for forensic examination in front of a fast-food restaurant.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Bessone and the police said the Tunisian attacker had two knives and a metal stick.</p>
            <p>The event happened at 2:45 PM local time in the 1st district of Marseille.</p>
