            <h1>China Airlines Works with Top US Airline for Flights Across America</h1>
            <p>China Airlines announced today that they are working with Southwest Airlines, the biggest airline for domestic flights in the United States. Chen Han-Ming, the general manager for China Airlines, said that travelers will be able to buy one ticket through China Airlines and then connect to Southwest Airlines flights that go to many places all over the US.</p>
            <p>China Airlines and Southwest Airlines held a joint press conference today in Long Beach, California. Steven Swan, who is in charge of flight routes and partnerships for Southwest Airlines, was there for the start of this new cooperation. He said that China Airlines is Southwest Airlines' first partner in Asia.</p>
            <p>Southwest Airlines is the fourth largest airline in the US. It carries the most passengers on domestic flights. Every day, it operates more than 4,000 flights.</p>
            <p>At the end of July, China Airlines announced a new direct flight to Phoenix. China Airlines also has direct flights to Los Angeles, San Francisco, Ontario (California), Seattle, Vancouver, and New York. From these cities, passengers can now connect to Southwest Airlines flights to other parts of the US.</p>
            <p>Chen Han-Ming said that China Airlines is growing its business in the US. He hopes this will bring more travelers to Taiwan, both for connecting flights and for tourism. He believes it will help Taiwan's tourism industry grow and wants Taiwan to become a main travel hub in Asia.</p>
            <p>Steven Swan, a leader from Southwest Airlines, went to Taiwan in early March to talk about this partnership. He said that besides connecting their flight networks, they are also talking about letting members use their frequent flyer miles on both airlines. If they agree, travelers will be able to use their collected miles for both China Airlines and Southwest Airlines.</p>
            <p>Swan has worked in the airline industry for over 23 years and has been a manager at several companies. He has visited Taiwan for business more than 10 times. He said that working with China Airlines will help Southwest Airlines compete better in the US market. He also said that Southwest will learn from China Airlines and share experiences with them.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese airlines working with North American airlines is a recent trend. For example, STARLUX Airlines also started working with American Airlines on August 15. Chen Han-Ming said that Southwest Airlines has a very large network of flights in North America. By working together, it will be easier and faster for travelers to connect to different places in the US, making travel more convenient.</p>

            <h1>Japan's Honjo High School Visits Tainan First High School for International Learning</h1>
            <p>Teachers and students from Honjo High School, which is part of Waseda University in Japan, recently visited Tainan First High School. Students from both schools also went to the Zengwun River to do a field study on the plants and animals in the river. This was a way for students from different countries to learn together.</p>
            <p>Tainan First High School announced today that Honjo High School's principal, Handa Toru, and 12 students visited Tainan First High School on August 14. They had two days of meaningful activities, including science research, cultural experiences, and tours of local places.</p>
            <p>Honjo High School has a team that studies rivers. Every year, they volunteer to survey rivers in Honjo City, Japan, and publish their findings in a book. When they came to Taiwan, they brought their newest book. They joined the science class from Tainan First High School to study the Zengwun River. Students from both schools worked in mixed groups. They put on special waterproof clothes and used nets in the water to see the river life up close.</p>
            <p>For sharing their research, the science class from Tainan First High School gave presentations about their two science fair projects completely in English. This helped them have academic discussions with people from other countries. It also helped them think about their research from a global point of view and broaden their minds with different cultural ideas. This prepares them for future work in international academic and professional areas.</p>
            <p>Also, the teachers and students from Honjo High School visited the Yujing Mango Wholesale Market. There, they learned about Tainan's farming industry and local culture. They also visited Japanese-era buildings and temples in Tainan City, making their exchange deeper and broader.</p>
            <p>During their visit, two twin sisters from Honjo High School wore kimonos and showed how to do a Japanese tea ceremony. They also gave a complete tea set to Tainan First High School. This helped the Taiwanese students learn more about traditional Japanese culture and improved the friendship and understanding between the two schools.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung "High Speed Youth" Music Show: Fire EX. Joins New Bands to Create Song</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Youth Bureau's "2025 High Speed Youth Music Show" will happen on August 23 at LIVE WAREHOUSE in Pier-2 Art Center. During the event, two new bands that have been trained by the program will release a new song. This song was made together with members from the band "Fire EX." This shows the new and creative energy of young people.</p>
            <p>Lin Kai-hsuan, the head of the Youth Bureau, said that "High Speed Youth" is now in its fifth year. He said it is an important program by the city government to help young people become talented in the music industry. The program includes "training classes" and "work experience." These help young people understand different jobs in the music industry, both in front of and behind the stage. The music show also helps more people see the new bands, making Kaohsiung a place that helps new and important Taiwanese bands grow.</p>
            <p>The Youth Bureau announced today that this year, the event will focus on two new bands: "BUTTER RIOT" and "YUMMY MAN." These two bands will release their new songs, made with members of the band Fire EX., for the first time. The event will also have three popular bands, "P!SCO," "Child King," and "EmptyORio," joining in. This will create a big music event at the end of summer in southern Taiwan. The event is free, and music fans are welcome to come.</p>
            <p>The Youth Bureau said that the two new bands this year were chosen by teachers from "High Speed Youth" and "StreetVoice." Most of the band members are from Kaohsiung and often play in small music venues in the city. "YUMMY MAN" plays Taiwanese rock music that shows strong feelings and humor. "BUTTER RIOT" is much influenced by punk music and sings about how young people feel confused and hopeful about life today.</p>
            <p>Also, besides the new bands playing for the first time, the event also invited "P!SCO" from Taipei. This band is known for its stage performances that are good to watch and listen to. They are called "the dance-rock band that makes you move a lot." "Child King," a local band from Kaohsiung, sings about everyday life in fluent Taiwanese, with music that is honest and deep. The last band to play, "EmptyORio," plays energetic punk music that directly faces real life. They show strong and delicate feelings hidden behind a strange outer look.</p>
            <p>The Youth Bureau said that this year's show will combine rock, punk, and pop music. It will tell stories about being young with special melodies and lyrics. They invite music fans to come this Saturday at 2:30 PM to support young musicians with their presence.</p>
