The top US general, Dan Caine, said on June 26 that the US military did not use special bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Isfahan nuclear site. This is because the site is very deep underground, and the bombs would likely not work there.

This is the first time the US military has explained why they didn't drop large bunker-buster bombs on the Isfahan nuclear site. US officials believe that nearly 60% of Iran's enriched uranium, which is needed to make nuclear weapons, is stored underground in Isfahan. However, US B2 bombers dropped many bunker-buster bombs on Fordow and Natanz, but Isfahan was only hit by missiles from submarines.

Caine's spokesperson did not comment, as they cannot talk about his secret briefings to Congress.

One US official said that CIA chief Ratcliffe stated that US intelligence believed most of Iran's enriched nuclear material was hidden in Isfahan and Fordow. Caine and Defense Secretary Hesses said that the military action against Fordow went as planned, but they did not talk about the effects on Isfahan and Natanz. On June 27, President Trump again claimed that no materials were moved from Iran's three sites before the US military acted.

Trump's government officials did not answer questions from Congress about where Iran's enriched uranium was. Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, told CNN after the briefing that some of Iran's nuclear ability is "deep underground, where we can never reach it. This means they can move a lot of stored nuclear material to places where US bombers cannot reach."

Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, told CNN that satellite photos show Iran has been using the underground tunnels at Isfahan.

Lewis noted that on June 26, there were a few vehicles at Isfahan, and at least one tunnel entrance was clear by the morning of June 27. He said, "If Iran's enriched uranium was still inside when they blocked the tunnels, it might have been moved to other places now." According to Lewis, later satellite photos on June 27 showed the tunnel entrance was still open.

Earlier, CNN also reported that new satellite images from Maxar Technologies on June 27 showed digging equipment at Iran's Fordow nuclear site.
