https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-cool-april-inflation-likely-resumes-downward-trend-2024-05-15/
Prices for goods and services in the U.S. did not rise as much as people thought in April. This is good news for the central bank and makes people hope that inflation will continue to go down. The cost of living had been rising quickly in the first few months of this year, which worried many, but this new report suggests things might be getting better. While some prices, like for gas, went up, other important areas like housing saw smaller increases. This slowdown in price rises could mean that people's money will go further, and the economy might become more stable.

**AI's Impact on Jobs: Some Roles Safer Than Others**
https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/08/these-are-the-4-job-types-that-ai-is-least-likely-to-replace.html
As Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to change the world of work, many people worry about their jobs. However, a recent report suggests that some types of jobs are less likely to be taken over by AI. These include roles that need a lot of human interaction, like therapists and teachers, where understanding emotions and building relationships are key. Jobs requiring high levels of creativity, such as artists or writers, are also considered safe, as AI struggles with true innovation. Additionally, complex problem-solving roles, like scientists or researchers, and jobs that involve working with the physical world, like plumbers or electricians, are also hard for AI to replace. Experts say that workers should focus on developing skills that complement AI, rather than competing with it.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers to Combat Overtourism**
https://edition.cnn.com/travel/venice-tourist-tax-day-trippers/index.html
The beautiful Italian city of Venice has started asking day visitors to pay a small fee to enter. This new rule began in late April and is a trial to help manage the huge number of tourists who visit the city every day. Venice has been struggling with "overtourism," where too many visitors put a strain on its delicate environment and infrastructure, making life difficult for local residents. The fee, which is around 5 euros, applies to anyone visiting the city for a single day during peak times. The goal is not to stop people from coming, but to encourage visitors to stay longer or to visit during less busy periods, helping to protect the historic city for future generations.`;
