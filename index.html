A recent study suggests that using Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools at work could make employees more productive. This means people can do more tasks or finish them faster. However, the report also warns that AI might make workers feel less involved or happy with their jobs. This is because AI can take over some parts of their work.

The study found that if AI handles too many tasks, it might reduce a worker's creativity or problem-solving skills. Workers might feel less important or that their skills are not fully used. This could lead to them feeling less connected to their work and even wanting to leave their jobs.

Companies need to find a good balance. They should use AI to help workers, not replace them entirely. For example, AI could help with repetitive tasks, freeing up employees to focus on more creative or strategic work. The goal is to use AI to improve both productivity and worker happiness.

**New Satellite to Study Earth's Water**

Scientists have launched a new satellite called SWOT, which stands for Surface Water and Ocean Topography. This mission will help us understand Earth's water more clearly than ever before. SWOT will measure the height of water in lakes, rivers, and oceans around the world.

Understanding how water moves across the Earth is very important. This is called the global water cycle. Climate change is affecting this cycle, leading to more droughts in some places and more floods in others. By collecting detailed information, SWOT will show scientists exactly how much water is available in different areas.

The data from SWOT will help experts manage water resources better. It will also improve our understanding of how climate change is affecting water supplies globally. This information is key for future planning, from agriculture to preparing for natural disasters.

**Italy Takes Steps Against Too Many Tourists**

Italy is taking action to control the large numbers of tourists visiting its most popular places. Cities like Venice and the island of Capri are facing problems because too many visitors are causing difficulties for local residents and damaging historical sites. This issue is known as "overtourism."

For example, Capri has recently introduced rules to limit daily visitors, especially for day-trippers coming by boat. Venice has also been trying different ways to manage tourist flow, including a new fee for day visitors to certain areas. These measures aim to protect the unique culture and environment of these destinations.

The goal is to find a balance where tourists can still enjoy Italy's beauty, but locals can also live comfortably. Authorities hope these new rules will help preserve Italy's cultural heritage and improve the daily life of residents, ensuring a better experience for everyone in the long run.`;
