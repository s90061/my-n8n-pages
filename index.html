            <h1>Lu Hsiu-yen Joins Lo Chih-chiang to Eat at an Old Meatball Shop, Offers Good Wishes and Support</h1>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Hsiu-yen went with Kuomintang (KMT) chairman candidate Lo Chih-chiang tonight to eat at an old restaurant called "Taichung Meatball." They recorded it live. Lu Hsiu-yen said that this restaurant is almost 100 years old and is one of her favorite places to eat. She hopes that by using the candidate's popularity, they can help the economy. She also gave Lo Chih-chiang good wishes and support.</p>
            <p>Last week, Lu Hsiu-yen ate sticky rice cakes with another KMT chairman candidate, Hau Lung-pin. Tonight, she ate meatballs with Legislator Lo Chih-chiang, who is also running for KMT chairman. Lu Hsiu-yen said that because the chairman candidates are very well-known, her job as mayor is to help the economy. So, she used the candidates' popularity to help Taichung's economy.</p>
            <p>Lu Hsiu-yen said she chose "Taichung Meatball" because it is nearly 100 years old in Taichung and is one of her favorite places. She has eaten there for decades. When she was a news director for a TV station, her apartment was across from "Taichung Meatball," so she often went there to enjoy the meatballs. A shop that only sells meatballs and can operate for almost 100 years, and also received a Michelin Bib Gourmand award, is truly something special for Taichung.</p>
            <p>Regarding Lo Chih-chiang running for party chairman, Lu Hsiu-yen said she would also give him good wishes and support. She believes elections are happy events. As a party member, she has a duty to give opportunities to members who are willing to take on responsibilities and serve. She must vote for capable and virtuous people. She will give good wishes and support to every candidate.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang said that many talented people are running in this party chairman election. Everyone is excellent, and whoever wins will be a good thing for the KMT. He personally tries hard but also stays calm during the process. Everyone competes fairly, and whoever gets the blessings of the party members will naturally be elected. Being elected is the start of taking on responsibility. If someone is not elected, they should fully support the party chairman. He believes this is a positive attitude. Lu Hsiu-yen is someone everyone hopes to get blessings from, so he came to visit her today.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang was born in Hualien. He thanked Lu Hsiu-yen for starting the "Return Home Reconstruction Subsidy" and sending firefighters from Taichung City to help in the disaster area of Guangfu Township in Hualien. He said that he thanks Lu Hsiu-yen on behalf of Hualien Legislator Fu Kun-chi and indigenous Legislator Kao Chin Su-mei. He will also suggest that the central government consider doing the same as Taichung City's "Return Home Reconstruction Subsidy" policy.</p>
