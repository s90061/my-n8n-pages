            <h1>Taiwan Stock Market Drops More Than 350 Points; Financial Commission Asks People Not to Worry</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's stock market reached a new high of 23486.08 points today. After that, it fell by 352.64 points, closing below 23000 points. This happened because of uncertainty about customs duties between Taiwan and the United States. An official from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that the Taiwan stock market is still around 23000 points. They have also asked the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the over-the-counter (OTC) market to study how customs duties will affect different industries. The official said, "It should be okay."</p>
            <p>During a ceremony in Kaohsiung for a new Asian asset management center, Zhang Zhen-shan, head of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, spoke to reporters. He said that the Taiwan stock market is still around 23,000 points. He also mentioned that Taiwan's position regarding global customs duty trends "should be fine." When asked if they have plans for different customs duty rates, Zhang Zhen-shan said people might be worried, but the exact numbers for customs duties are not out yet. He added that they have asked the OTC market and the Taiwan Stock Exchange to check how customs duties will affect industries. He said, "It should still be okay."</p>
            <p>The FSC also gave more information. Taiwan's stock market closed today at 22987.92 points, which is a drop of 352.64 points. This is a 1.51% decrease. The total value of shares traded was 435.315 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Foreign investors bought shares worth 10.024 billion New Taiwan Dollars. At the same time, the stock market in Shanghai went up by 0.61%, Hong Kong went up by 0.37%, Singapore went down by 0.14%, Japan went down by 0.29%, and South Korea went down by 1.60%.</p>
            <p>The FSC stated that as of the end of June this year, the price-to-earnings ratio was about 17.78 times. The cash dividend yield was 2.96% (or 3.05% if stock dividends are included). The total money earned by companies listed on the stock exchange and OTC market in Taiwan reached about 22.85 trillion New Taiwan Dollars by the end of June 2025. This is 13.75% more than the same time last year, which is the highest amount ever for this period. As of July 21, the minimum level of money kept for stock trading on credit was 178.59%.</p>

            <h1>Sea Dragon Frogmen to Focus More on Penghu, Army Says It Will Make Them Stronger</h1>
            <p>The "Sea Dragon Frogmen" are special forces who work for the Army's Special Operations Command. They are very important for protecting Taiwan's outer islands. We hear that they used to focus mostly on Kinmen and Matsu. But now, their main group of soldiers will move to Penghu. This change is happening because new army buildings have been built and there are new training plans. The Army said that they decide where to put their forces and how to use them based on what fighting missions they have and what dangers the enemy poses. This helps to make their fighting power stronger overall.</p>
            <p>The "Sea Dragon Frogmen" are one of Taiwan's important fighting groups. They are part of the Army's Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion. They can fight on land, in the water, and in the air. Their jobs include shooting from far away, secretly entering enemy areas, blowing things up, fighting against terrorism, and finding people. Right now, they are in Kinmen, Matsu, and Penghu, which are outer islands. But their main base was in Kinmen.</p>
            <p>We hear that the Sea Dragon Frogmen have worked with and trained with the United States for a long time. After thinking carefully and because the military has built new buildings in Penghu, the military plans to move most of the Sea Dragon Frogmen to Penghu. Inside the new base, there is a special track that can quickly launch "Sea Dragon boats." The military is still thinking about whether to add unmanned boats.</p>
            <p>The Army Headquarters said that they plan where the country's military forces are placed and how they are used. This planning depends on the dangers from enemies and what missions they need to do. This is to make the country's defense stronger. Also, military exchanges between Taiwan and the United States happen regularly and are planned each year. They usually do not talk about these exchanges.</p>

            <h1>Humanistic Education Foundation: Chou Tai-ying Should Be Fired Forever for Hurting Students</h1>
            <p>National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) held a meeting today for the Sports and Competition Department about the female soccer team's blood test case. It is said that they decided to fire Chou Tai-ying. Feng Chiao-lan, who is the head of the Humanistic Education Foundation, said that the harm Chou Tai-ying caused to students is serious enough for her to be fired forever. She added that if Chou Tai-ying is only fired for 2 or 4 years, it means they are just pretending to solve the problem.</p>
            <p>National Taiwan Normal University found out that Chou Tai-ying, a coach for the female soccer team, threatened players. She said she would lower their grades if they did not get blood drawn for a research study. Today, the Sports and Competition Department held a meeting to talk about this blood test case with the female soccer team. Trustworthy information suggests that the department decided to "fire" Chou Tai-ying. However, the head of the Sports and Competition Department, Cheng Ching-feng, only confirmed that they made a different decision from their first one. (Their first decision was softer, like not giving her a pay raise, and did not include firing her.) He hopes this new decision will meet what society expects.</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan told the Central News Agency today that it is not yet clear if the department decided to "fire her forever," or "fire her and not let her be hired for 4 years," or "fire her and not let her be hired for 2 years."</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan thinks that Chou Tai-ying's actions and the way she hurt students are enough to "fire her forever." For example, a recent recording showed that after the issue became public, Chou Tai-ying still threatened students. She told them to say what she wanted them to say when they spoke to others. These actions show that Chou Tai-ying often treats students badly. She does not know the difference between a teacher and a student, or how people should act with each other. She also cannot control her feelings.</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan said that Chou Tai-ying has for a long time treated students as if they were her own property, like people she could tell what to do. She forgot that students are independent people who can make their own choices. Feng Chiao-lan called this "very strong abuse of power."</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan also mentioned that problems with rules about how research is done should be thought about. Chou Tai-ying threatened students who did not want to join the blood test study by saying they would have to "leave the team." Also, even at a recent press conference, Chou Tai-ying kept saying that she "did not use grades to threaten" students. This shows that she does not feel bad about what she did.</p>
            <p>Chu Chun-chang, who is the Deputy Minister of Education, recently said that on July 18, a special committee met. This committee is called the "Committee for Reviewing Bullying Incidents in Universities and Colleges." They decided that this case meets the rules for "firing forever" or "firing and not hiring for 4 years."</p>
            <p>Feng Chiao-lan explained that the three levels of review committees at National Taiwan Normal University work by themselves. But the Ministry of Education is in charge, so it can explain the law and say what it thinks. This can have some effect. She also asked the university's college and school-level committees that will meet next to seriously think about "firing forever." If they do not, it means they do not understand how serious this event is. This would also mean they cannot truly make the sports environment at the school better.</p>
