            <h1>Google Cloud COO: AI Will Reach Every Business and Every Part of It</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 27 (CNA) â€“ Francis deSouza, who is the Chief Operating Officer for Google Cloud, said today that in the past few years, companies moved their information and programs to the cloud. But now, there is a bigger trend: artificial intelligence (AI) being used by regular people and by businesses. We are just at the start of this trend. In the future, AI will be in every business and every part of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. deSouza spoke at an online meeting with media. He said that usually, when new technology appears, smaller, newer companies use it first. Then, bigger companies start to use it later. But this time, it is different. Some very big companies, even in industries that usually adopt new technology slowly, are now eagerly using AI. This shows how good the return on investment (ROI) from AI is for these companies.</p>
            <p>He talked about a study done by Google Cloud with other companies. The study showed that if businesses choose the right situations and tools, they can get their money back from using Google Cloud AI in less than one year. Also, the return on investment can be more than 700% in three years.</p>
            <p>As "Agentic AI" becomes more common, the use of AI will surely grow a lot. Mr. deSouza noticed that if there is a strong return on investment, customers are happy to spend money. Customers believe they can get benefits in two ways: first, by making their operations work better; and second, by using AI and their data to start new businesses and earn more money.</p>
            <p>He said that to meet customer needs, Google is building data centers around the world. This year, they plan to invest 75 billion US dollars (about 2.3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars) to build this infrastructure. Google is working hard to get space, electricity, and computer chips. They are also making sure they have the right technology and people, and that they can work with many customers.</p>
            <p>When asked why Google Cloud recently got Meta and OpenAI as big customers, Mr. deSouza said that Google Cloud's infrastructure is very strong and almost always working. It is also the only very large cloud service provider that has its own AI technology. He said, "Customers are not just buying today's products. They also believe we can help them move towards the future."</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Builds Tamsui Riverfront; Mayor Chiang Wan-an Says People Can Enjoy World-Class River Views</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 27 (CNA) â€“ Today, the Taipei City Hydraulic Engineering Office held a ceremony at Dadaocheng Wharf Plaza to start the "Tamsui River Waterfront Area Improvement Project." This project is expected to be finished by the end of 2028. Mayor Chiang Wan-an said that this will let people enjoy beautiful river views like those around the world, without having to leave the city.</p>
            <p>The Hydraulic Engineering Office stated that they have been planning the "Tamsui River Waterfront Area Improvement Project" for a long time. Today, Mayor Chiang Wan-an led the ceremony himself. Lawmakers, local leaders, and citizens were invited to see the start of this riverfront rebuilding project. The work will follow a rule of "build first, then remove, and do it in stages." This means they will build new parts before taking down old ones, and work will happen step by step. This will cause less trouble for people's daily lives. The first and second parts of the project are expected to be done by 2026, and the whole project by the end of 2028.</p>
            <p>The Hydraulic Engineering Office explained that the project has four main parts along the river. The first is the "Western Waterfront Time-Space Corridor." Here, they will build a new bridge for people to walk across, connecting Yuquan Park and the riverfront. This will join areas both inside and outside the riverbank, creating a green walking path in the air.</p>
            <p>The second part is the "Dadaocheng Fireworks View Revitalization Area." This will make the Dadaocheng Wharf area better and allow more space for events. The "Dadaocheng to Dunhuang Wharf Waterfront Path" will make the walking path wider along the river. This will give people a nice place to walk, look at the river, and watch the sunset.</p>
            <p>The fourth part is the "Dunhuang Water Recreation Base." This will have a new place for yachts, stairs for viewing, and a light meal area. It will connect with the Beitungh Culture Park, bringing together history, culture, and the riverfront.</p>
