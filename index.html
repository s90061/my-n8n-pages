Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the world of work. Experts say that AI will not only take over some tasks but will also create completely new jobs. This means that workers will need different skills to succeed in the future.

While AI can do many things like analyzing data or repeating tasks, it still needs human creativity and critical thinking. Because of this, skills like problem-solving, teamwork, and understanding emotions are becoming even more important. Companies are looking for people who can use AI tools effectively, but also bring unique human abilities to the table.

To prepare for these changes, many people are learning new skills related to technology and AI. Companies are also investing in training for their employees. The goal is to work together with AI to improve productivity and find new solutions, rather than seeing AI as a threat to jobs.

**Record Heatwaves Hit Asia, Affecting Daily Life**

Large parts of Asia are currently experiencing extremely hot weather, with temperatures reaching new records. This severe heat is making daily life very difficult for millions of people and is also affecting work and public services.

In several countries, schools have closed early or switched to online lessons to protect students from the heat. Many people who work outside, such as farmers and construction workers, have had to reduce their working hours or stop working during the hottest parts of the day. This has a big impact on their income and the economy.

The heat also puts a lot of stress on power grids as more people use air conditioning. Health officials are warning citizens to stay hydrated and avoid going out during the hottest hours to prevent heat-related illnesses. Scientists say these record-breaking temperatures are becoming more frequent and intense because of climate change.

**Popular Tourist Spots Face Challenges of Overtourism**

Many famous places around the world are seeing more tourists than ever before. While tourism brings money and jobs, too many visitors can cause problems for local communities and the environment. This situation is often called "overtourism."

Some popular cities and natural areas are experiencing damage to their historical sites, too much rubbish, and higher prices for local people. In some cases, the large number of tourists can also change the local culture, making places feel less authentic.

To deal with these issues, some governments and tourism organizations are trying new strategies. These include limiting the number of daily visitors, encouraging tourists to visit during less busy times, and promoting smaller, lesser-known destinations. The goal is to create a more balanced and respectful travel experience that benefits both visitors and the local communities.`;
