            <h1>US and Israel Recall Gaza Ceasefire Negotiation Teams; US Accuses Hamas of Not Being Sincere</h1>
            <p>Israel and the United States today called back their teams who were talking about a ceasefire in Gaza. They did this to discuss the situation. An American special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said that Hamas, a Palestinian group, was not honest during the talks.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Witkoff wrote on X, a social media platform: "Even though mediators worked very hard, Hamas seemed to be unorganized and not sincere. Now we will look at other ways to bring the hostages home and try to make a more peaceful place for the people in Gaza."</p>
            <p>After almost two years of war between Israel and Hamas, the situation for people in Gaza has become much worse. Israelis are also worried about the other hostages. Both sides are under pressure to make an agreement.</p>
            <p>Mediators are still trying to find an agreement to stop the fighting and free the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>According to health officials in Gaza, many people have died from hunger there in the past few weeks.</p>

            <h1>Trump Denies Wanting to Destroy Musk's Companies, Hopes All US Businesses Thrive</h1>
            <p>Today, former U.S. President Trump said he does not want to destroy the companies owned by Elon Musk, a very rich person in technology. People are wondering if Trump supports the U.S. government working with companies owned by Musk, who is also the head of the electric car company Tesla.</p>
            <p>The Hill newspaper reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social: "Everyone says I will destroy Elon Musk's companies by stopping some or all of the large financial help the U.S. government gives him. This is not true!"</p>
            <p>He also wrote: "I want Elon and all companies in our country to do very well, even better than before! The better they do, the better America will be, which is good for all of us. We are setting new records every day, and I want that to continue!"</p>
            <p>Trump said these things the day after Karoline Leavitt, who works for the White House press, said she does not think Trump supports the government signing deals with xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company.</p>
            <p>When asked if Trump wants the government to stop the recent contract with xAI, Leavitt said she would talk to the President about it.</p>

            <h1>Wrestling Legend Hulk Hogan Dies at 71</h1>
            <p>Today, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) announced that Hulk Hogan, a famous American sports and entertainment star, has passed away at 71 years old. He made professional wrestling popular around the world and openly supported Donald Trump when he ran for U.S. president. Trump later shared his sadness online.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that WWE wrote on X, a social media platform: "WWE is sad to announce that Hulk Hogan, a Hall of Fame member, has passed away. Hogan was one of the most well-known faces in popular culture and helped WWE become famous worldwide in the 1980s." The post did not say why he died.</p>
            <p>This strong man with light blonde hair and tanned skin became the face of professional wrestling in the 1980s. He helped wrestling change from a low-class show to a billion-dollar entertainment for the whole family.</p>
            <p>A key moment in this change was the WrestleMania III event in 1987. In a full Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan, Hulk Hogan used a very powerful body slam against the French wrestler AndrÃ© the Giant.</p>
            <p>Hulk Hogan also used his fame from wrestling to go into Hollywood, but he was not very successful. He appeared in movies like "Rocky III." However, he kept returning to the wrestling ring when his health allowed.</p>
            <p>He joined the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.</p>
            <p>Last year, Hulk Hogan went to the Republican National Convention (RNC) to support Donald Trump's new try for president. At that time, Hulk Hogan tore off his shirt to show a Trump vest underneath. He then shouted to the cheering crowd: "Let Trumpamania rule again!"</p>
            <p>After the news of Hulk Hogan's death, Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that "Today, we lost a good friend." He also said that "Hulk Hogan always supported MAGA (Make America Great Again) â€“ strong, tough, smart, but with the most open heart."</p>
            <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance also wrote on X: "Hulk Hogan was a great American hero. He was one of the first people I truly looked up to as a child. Last time we met, we planned to have a beer next time. We will only meet again in the afterlife, my friend! Rest in peace."</p>
