            <h1>Gold Bar Tariffs Cause Market Changes; Trump Says Gold Will Not Be Taxed</h1>
            <p>San Francisco, August 11 (CNA) â€“ After the gold market was affected by news of tariffs last week, US President Donald Trump said today on his social media platform, "Truth Social," that gold will not be taxed.</p>
            <p>Last week, the British newspaper "Financial Times" reported about a letter from the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The report said that the US had started taxing 1-kilogram imported gold bars, which made gold futures prices reach a new high. According to the letter, 1-kilogram and 100-ounce imported gold bars should be put into a customs group that has higher taxes.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump wrote on social media, "Gold will not be taxed."</p>
            <p>Last week, after the news about gold bar tariffs came out, the price of gold futures for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Comex) went up to 3534.10 US dollars per ounce on August 8. This was a new record high. Later, the price gain became smaller, going up by 1% to 3489.40 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Tariffs on gold bars could badly affect Switzerland, which is the world's largest place for refining gold. Switzerland has a similar tax rate of 39%.</p>
            <p>Gold is seen as a safe investment. Its price has reached new highs this year because of tariff threats and political problems in the world.</p>
            <p>Later, an official from the White House told Agence France-Presse that the government plans to issue an official order soon to make the information clear.</p>
            <p>After Trump's post, the price of gold futures went down by 2.48%. It closed at 3404.70 US dollars per ounce.</p>

            <h1>US Media: Trump Signs Order, Extends US Tariff Delay for China by 90 Days</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 11 (CNA) â€“ Several US media outlets reported today that US President Donald Trump has signed an official order. This order will delay the addition of higher taxes on Chinese goods for another 90 days. This happened just hours before the trade truce between Washington and Beijing was going to end.</p>
            <p>The "Wall Street Journal" and the financial news channel CNBC reported that the delay for adding more taxes will be for another 90 days. Earlier this year, the US and China had put extra taxes on each other's products. They reached a temporary trade truce only in May.</p>
            <p>After high-level trade talks between the US and China in Switzerland in mid-May, the White House released a joint statement from both countries. In the statement, the US said it would lower its taxes on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%. China said it would lower its taxes on US goods from 125% to 10%.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the trade truce between the US and China was set to end at 12:01 AM Eastern Time on August 12 (12:01 PM Taiwan time).</p>
            <p>This official order will stop the US from increasing taxes on Chinese goods to 145%. It will also stop China from increasing taxes on US goods up to 125%. If these taxes were put in place, it would almost be like stopping all trade between the two countries.</p>
