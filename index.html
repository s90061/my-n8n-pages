            <h1>Czech Election: President Pavel Wants to Keep the Country Safe from Russia</h1>
            <p>(Prague, October 2, Central News Agency) The Czech parliamentary election is coming soon. President Petr Pavel said in a TV speech that this election is very important. He stated that more than ever, the country needs a government that can keep it safe, protect its independence, and stop it from being controlled by Russia.</p>
            <p>Three days before the election, President Pavel gave a speech for about five minutes on Czech television. He said that before almost every election, people say it's a big turning point, the most important election in the country's history. He wouldn't say that exactly, "but this election is truly very important because the safety situation in Europe and the world is getting worse. Also, many things we used to be sure about are now disappearing."</p>
            <p>He strongly said that the Czech Republic needs a government that will always keep the country safe. Today, the Czech Republic is safe because it is a strong part of the European Union and NATO. "We need a government that protects our independence within the group of democratic countries. We don't want to be controlled by Russia or affected by its plans to get more power in Central and Eastern Europe. If that happens, it will greatly affect our freedom, safety, and money."</p>
            <p>He said that after the votes are counted, he will respect what the voters decide. He will follow the rules in the constitution when he forms a new government. "I will work to create a stable and capable government. I will ask the next Prime Minister not to let our safety be in danger."</p>
            <p>He also said that he is not the "last helper" and will not change the election results for anyone. The voters will make the final decision about who is in the next government.</p>
            <p>President Pavel asked people who have not decided to vote yet to please go and vote. He said some people might feel there is no good choice, and every choice has problems. This is because the world is not perfect. We cannot expect one political party or person to meet all our hopes. We can only try to get close.</p>
            <p>Pavel said that if voters don't like some of the main candidates, they should use their right to choose who gets a chance. If you don't vote, you let others make decisions for you, and even for your life.</p>
            <p>Pavel also criticized rumors on social media before the election that said the results would be fixed. He said that the election process is fair and clear. Many thousands of citizens chosen by different political parties watch over the election committees.</p>
            <p>Finally, Pavel thanked the Czech people for voting, "for our country, our democracy, our freedom, and our safety."</p>

            <h1>Manchester Synagogue Attack: Police Say Attacker Was a Syrian-British Citizen</h1>
            <p>(Manchester, October 2, Foreign Wire Services) A deadly attack happened today at a synagogue in Manchester, UK. Police have called it a terrorist attack. They said the attacker was a 35-year-old British citizen who was originally from Syria.</p>
            <p>This morning, outside a synagogue in Manchester, a car drove strangely and then crashed into a group of people. The driver then got out and used a knife to stab and hurt people.</p>
            <p>The attacker could not get inside the synagogue to cause more harm because guards and some people from the synagogue worked together to stop him. However, two Jewish people died from the attack, and four others were badly hurt and are now in the hospital.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Greater Manchester Police later said in a statement that the male attacker's name was Jihad Al-Shamie. Police shot and killed him.</p>
            <p>Police also said that three other people were arrested. They are suspected of planning, preparing, or causing terrorist actions. Two of them are men in their thirties, and one is a woman in her sixties.</p>
            <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer held an emergency meeting about the Manchester event. Afterwards, he said from his office that a terrible person had attacked Jewish people just because they were Jewish. He promised to do everything he could to keep Jewish communities in the UK safe, including sending more police to guard buildings and important places.</p>
            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel felt sad with the British Jewish community.</p>
            <p>He said, "Our thoughts are with the families of those who died, and we hope the injured people get well soon. As I warned at the United Nations, being weak against terrorism only causes more terrorism. Only strength and working together can defeat it."</p>
            <p>Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the event made him "shocked." He stressed that crimes against religious groups are "extremely bad."</p>
            <p>Turk wrote on social media platform X, "Freedom of religion or belief is very important for us humans, and we must protect it."</p>

            <h1>Israel Stops Aid Ships for Gaza; Protests Happen Around the World</h1>
            <p>(Barcelona/Rome, October 2, Foreign Wire Services) After Israeli forces stopped a group of ships carrying help for people in the Gaza Strip, many protests for Palestinians happened around the world today. In Europe, protestors blocked roads and broke windows in shops.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that armed Israeli soldiers got onto about 40 ships that were trying to break through Israel's sea blockade and bring supplies to Gaza. They arrested over 400 foreign people who supported Palestinians, including Greta Thunberg, a young environmental activist from Sweden. Because of this, Israel is being criticized by many countries.</p>
            <p>In Barcelona, a big city in Spain, protestors broke windows of shops and restaurants. They also sprayed anti-Israel words on them. Shops like Starbucks, Burger King, and Carrefour were damaged. The protestors said these businesses were helping Israel attack Gaza.</p>
            <p>Akram Azahomaras, who joined the protest, said, "These protests are the only thing we can do." But she thought that breaking things would not help. "We need to do this peacefully, with words, not with fighting."</p>
            <p>In Italy, videos showed students taking over university campuses like Milan University and Rome University. They used car tires to block the entrance to Bologna University. News reports said that hundreds of people in Turin blocked the city's main ring road.</p>
            <p>Medical staff and pharmacists in Rome are planning a quick event. The organizers said they would turn on flashlights and phone lights while reading the names of 1,677 medical workers who died in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Italian labor unions have asked for a big strike to support the aid ships for Gaza. More than 100 protests or meetings are planned across the country.</p>
            <p>However, Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto criticized some protestors for causing trouble. He wrote on social media platform X, "Does anyone really believe that blocking a train station, an airport, a highway, or destroying a shop in Italy will bring comfort to the Palestinian people?"</p>
            <p>Besides these cities, thousands of protestors also marched in Dublin, Ireland; Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; and Geneva, Switzerland. They were all against Israel stopping the aid ships.</p>
            <p>Similar gatherings also happened in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mexico City, Mexico; Karachi, Pakistan; and Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group that rules Gaza, attacked Israel. After this, Israel started its attacks in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Israel said that Hamas's attacks killed about 1,200 people. Also, 251 people were taken as hostages to Gaza. According to Palestinian officials, the war in Gaza has caused more than 66,000 deaths.</p>
