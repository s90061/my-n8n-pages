            <h1>Ukraine and Europe Leaders Will Talk to Trump on Aug 13 to Influence US-Russia Summit</h1>
            <p>The presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, and Russia, Vladimir Putin, will meet on August 15. They plan to talk about stopping the war between Russia and Ukraine. But Ukraine and European countries are not invited to this meeting. Many countries are worried about this.</p>
            <p>News from Ukraine says that President Trump will talk with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders on August 13. People think this call is the last chance for them to talk before the summit.</p>
            <p>"Ukrainska Pravda" newspaper reported this news. Arianna Podesta, a spokesperson for the European Union, said that Trump and Zelenskyy will have a call on August 13. The German Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, will lead the meeting. The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and other European leaders will also join. They will talk about the situation of the war between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>This phone call is seen as the last effort from Ukraine and European leaders. They want to talk to Trump and Putin before their meeting. They hope to influence what happens at the summit.</p>
            <p>Lately, President Zelenskyy has been calling many leaders. For four days in a row, he has talked with leaders from Canada and Lithuania. He also spoke with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. These two leaders are often seen as more friendly with Russia.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said in a speech that he talked with Modi about ways to persuade Russia. He said that Modi has often said, "This is not a time for war." Earlier, Zelenskyy wrote on social media that they talked about stopping Russia from selling energy. They also plan to meet in September during the United Nations General Assembly. They will prepare for a special visit.</p>
            <p>The meeting between Trump and Putin will happen on August 15 in Alaska, USA. People expect them to talk about how to stop the war in Ukraine. News that came out earlier showed a possible plan. Putin suggested that Ukrainian soldiers must leave the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. This would be the first step for a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>In return, Russian soldiers would leave some parts of the Kharkiv and Sumy regions. But they would keep control of some areas they already took.</p>
            <p>Also, people who know about the talks said that Putin also offered ideas for a ceasefire in the south. He suggested that the current battle lines should be the border. Russian soldiers would keep control of most parts of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. But the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson themselves would stay under Ukraine's control.</p>

            <h1>US-Russia Summit on August 15; Trump Wants "Helpful Talks" with Putin</h1>
            <p>The leaders of the United States and Russia will meet on August 15 in Alaska, USA. They will talk about the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has been going on for more than three years. Today, US President Donald Trump said he hopes to have "helpful talks" with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
            <p>At a press conference in the White House, Trump said his meeting with Putin on August 15 will be a "trial talk." He wants to see if Putin is willing to make a deal. Trump thinks they will know if they can make progress in just two minutes.</p>
            <p>Trump said he will talk to Putin and tell him, "You must end this war."</p>
            <p>After his meeting with Putin on August 15, Trump will immediately call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other European leaders.</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "The next meeting will be between Zelenskyy and Putin. Or, it could be Zelenskyy, Putin, and me together. I will be there if they need me."</p>
            <p>Russia currently controls about one-fifth of Ukraine's land. Ukraine controls very little land in Russia. Today, Trump said, "Some land will be exchanged."</p>
            <p>Trump has talked about exchanging land between Russia and Ukraine before. However, neither Russia nor Ukraine wants to give up land as part of a peace agreement.</p>
