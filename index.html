  <h2>National Palace Museum's Main Hall Repair Plan Not Approved Yet</h2>
  <p>The Taipei City Cultural Affairs Bureau recently reviewed the National Palace Museum's plan to repair and expand its main building. The plan was not approved.</p>
  <p>The National Palace Museum thanked the review committee for their ideas. They said they will change the plan based on the committee's suggestions and send it again to the city government for review.</p>
  <p>The museum's repair project is a key part of their "New National Palace Museum" plan. In 2022, the museum sent their repair plan for the main building to the city. The city asked them to make changes and hold a public meeting. After making changes and holding a meeting last year, the museum sent the plan again in October. The city asked for more changes and information, which the museum provided.</p>
  <p>During the recent meeting, 4 members agreed with the plan, but 11 members did not. So, the plan was not approved. The museum will work with their building design team to change the plan and will ask for ideas from different groups of people. Then, they will send the plan to the city cultural bureau again.</p>

  <h2>Over 4000 Breastfeeding Rooms Available with Online Map</h2>
  <p>Many mothers want to give their babies breast milk to make them stronger. To help mothers breastfeed easily when they are out, there are now more than 4000 breastfeeding rooms across Taiwan.</p>
  <p>The National Health Agency provides a "Breastfeeding Room Map" and a LINE account. These tools help mothers quickly find rooms and directions to them.</p>
  <p>A law passed in 2010 says that people can breastfeed in public places. No one can stop them or ask them to leave. The law also says that certain large public places must have breastfeeding rooms. These rooms are only for mothers to breastfeed or express milk, not for other uses.</p>
  <p>The head of the National Health Agency, Wu Chao-chun, said that breastfeeding is very good for babies. He encourages mothers to breastfeed. The "Breastfeeding Room Map" allows people to use their phone to find nearby rooms and get directions. They can also search for rooms in areas they plan to visit.</p>
  <p>By the end of 2024, there were 4049 breastfeeding rooms in Taiwan. This includes places like train stations, airports, department stores, and large supermarkets. There are 2698 rooms that are required by law. Also, 1351 rooms have been set up voluntarily by places like schools, hospitals, and workplaces.</p>

  <h2>Hsinchu Scout Camp Not About Recalling Officials, Says Legislator Cheng</h2>
  <p>Lin Chih-chieh, a spokesperson for the "Hsinchu Recall" group, said today that during a scout camp in Hsinchu City, Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien (from the KMT party) spoke against recalling officials and gave out flyers. However, Cheng Cheng-chien said he was invited to the event, did not give out flyers, and did not talk about this topic during the activity.</p>
  <p>Lin Chih-chieh said in a written statement that the scout camp happened on June 28 and 29 at the Hsinchu City Government building. She received complaints from parents that Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien talked about recalling officials and handed out flyers. She will give these complaints to the prosecutor for investigation.</p>
  <p>She added that scout values include honesty, integrity, and bravery. She believes it was wrong for Cheng Cheng-chien to talk about recalling officials and give out flyers.</p>
  <p>Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien wrote on Facebook that he was invited to the event and did not hand out flyers or talk about recalling officials. He said someone purposely put scout badges with anti-recall flyers in pictures to confuse people and trick the public.</p>
  <p>He stated that this way of connecting proper activities with unrelated items to make political claims is a trick to make people look bad. He believes that citizens care about education, building new things, and money matters. He said he will continue to do what is right.</p>
