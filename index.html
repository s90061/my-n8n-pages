            <h1>Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group Has Lunch with President Lai, Stresses "No Trouble in Taiwan Strait"</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 10 (CNA) â€“ A group of Japanese lawmakers visited Taiwan for the Double Ten National Day. Mr. Sasaki Norihisa, who works for the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group (Nikko Kon), said today that after the celebrations, they had lunch with President Lai Ching-te. During the lunch, they gave a letter from Ms. Sanae Takaichi, the newly elected leader of Japan's LDP party. They strongly said that "nothing bad must happen in the Taiwan Strait." They also said that their goal to keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is the same as Taiwan's.</p>
            <p>The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group is a group of Japanese lawmakers from different parties who support Taiwan. Mr. Furuya Keiji, a member of parliament and the head of this group, led a "Japanese Parliamentary Delegation to Celebrate the Republic of China National Day." This group came to Taiwan for the Double Ten National Day events. There were 28 members of parliament, and they held a press conference in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Kaneko Yasushi, who is a vice-head of the group, said that Mr. Furuya Keiji had to go back to Japan after President Lai's speech and the performances. This was because the LDP party had an urgent meeting for its leaders.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Sasaki Norihisa spoke, he said he was happy to lead the group of lawmakers to Taiwan. He also said that after the National Day ceremony, the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group had lunch with President Lai. They also gave President Lai a personal letter from Ms. Sanae Takaichi to Mr. Lai Ching-te, who is the head of the DPP party.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said that at the lunch, he spoke for the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group. He told President Lai and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim that they felt very sorry about the damage caused by Typhoon Kabsa in Hualien. He also gave them a list of people who gave money for disaster relief. Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism will send floating devices to Taiwan by October 17. These devices will help watch water levels in reservoirs, showing Japan's support for working together on disaster prevention.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sasaki Norihisa also mentioned that this year is the 100th anniversary of the National Palace Museum. After the press conference, he will go to the museum to give them a valuable pottery artifact from Japan for an exhibition.</p>
            <p>Talking about the situation in the region, Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said that China is putting more and more pressure on Taiwan. He said, "Nothing bad must happen in the Taiwan Strait." He also said that Taiwan, Japan, the United States, and Australia should work together more closely. The Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group said they are committed to keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, and this is the same as Taiwan's commitment.</p>
            <p>When asked about the contents of Ms. Sanae Takaichi's letter, Mr. Sasaki Norihisa said he "did not know." He thought it was a reply to President Lai's congratulatory message. However, he also said that sending a personal letter to the head of the DPP party is not new. Mr. Fumio Kishida, a former leader of the LDP party, also sent similar letters before.</p>
            <p>The media asked about Mr. Minoru Kihara, who is the secretary-general of the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group and a member of parliament, not joining the group. He will soon become the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Mr. Sasaki Norihisa answered that Mr. Kihara Minoru could not visit Taiwan because a family member was ill, and there was "no political reason."</p>
            <p>Ms. Yasuko Komiyama, a vice-head of the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group and a member of parliament from the Constitutional Democratic Party, added that the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Group has always included members from different parties. She said that Mr. Furuya Keiji has also been a minister twice. No matter which political party they are from, they all care a lot about the partnership with Taiwan and play important roles in the government.</p>
