            <h1>Recruiters Complain About Unclear Pay Raises; Army Says to Use Current Pay Information</h1>
            <p>Army recruiters who work on the ground have written online that a new law was passed to increase special pay for volunteer soldiers to NT$30,000. However, the budget for next year (2027) does not yet include this money. This makes it hard to encourage people to join the army, and some people from outside are questioning it.</p>
            <p>The Army announced this evening that any information used for recruitment, such as pay, benefits, and special allowances, must be based on what is actually being paid or done right now. The Army has asked all levels to check their recruitment materials. If any materials have wrong information, they must be corrected and clarified right away to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

            <h1>South Africa Asks Taiwan's Office to Move from Capital; Scholars Say South Africa is Giving Up Power to Please Beijing</h1>
            <p>South Africa has asked Taiwan's representative office to move out of Pretoria, its capital city. Scholars have written articles criticizing South Africa. They say the country is giving up its own power and simply agreeing with Beijing's views. They believe this harms South Africa's strong and long-lasting trade relationship with Taiwan. They suggest that South Africa should have its own "One China policy" that focuses on its own country's benefits.</p>
            <p>Since October last year, the South African government has sent two letters asking Taiwan's office to move from Pretoria. While discussions were happening, the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DIRCO) website changed the name of Taiwan's office to "Taipei Business Office" and put it under "International Organizations." It also changed the office's address to Johannesburg. Then, on July 21st, the government officially announced that both offices would be renamed to "Taipei Business Office in Johannesburg" and "Taipei Business Office in Cape Town."</p>
            <p>Two experts, Greg Mills and Ray Hartley, wrote an article on August 17th for a South African newspaper called Daily Friend. They said that what the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DIRCO) did is like "giving its power and responsibilities to Beijing." They believe this does not help South Africa, but only helps Beijing. They also said South Africa's policy towards Taiwan has become "diplomatic emptiness."</p>
            <p>Mills and Hartley explained that South Africa and Taiwan trade about US$2 billion worth of goods and services every year. South Africa sells more to Taiwan than it buys. Also, there are about 450 Taiwanese factories in South Africa, employing around 40,000 people. These factories help local economies a lot. Even though China is South Africa's biggest trading partner, South Africa still has some power. China needs raw materials from South Africa and also needs different markets to sell its products. If China punishes South Africa, it would hurt both countries.</p>
            <p>The two experts pointed out that Taiwan is a country where people vote for their leaders, and it shares values like freedom with South Africa. On the other hand, China is ruled by one party, treats minority groups badly, supports Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and is expanding its influence in the South China Sea. China's values are very different from the laws, government system, and free press that South Africa's constitution believes in. They said, "Most Western countries see Beijing as a threat, but South Africa has become a partner in defending Russia's actions."</p>
            <p>They stressed that if South Africa stands with China, it will face more problems in its long-term relationships with other countries in terms of diplomacy and trade. They believe that by letting Beijing make its strategic decisions, the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs is no longer showing South Africa's own power.</p>
            <p>The two experts also compared the relationship between Taiwan and the Czech Republic with Taiwan and South Africa. They said, "South Africa needs its own 'One China policy'." The Czech Republic's foreign policy is based on what is best for its country. It uses democratic values to make its trade and political talks with Taiwan stronger. The Czech Republic does not give in to Beijing's demands on trade, politics, or human rights. This shows that their foreign policy is based on their values.</p>
            <p>Regarding China's unhappiness about the Czech Republic's friendly ties with Taiwan, the experts said that the Czech Republic has actually not lost money by making its relationship with Taiwan stronger. In fact, as a member of the European Parliament, JiÅ™Ã­ PospÃ­Å¡il, said, Taiwan has invested many times more money in the Czech Republic than China has. For example, Foxconn has created more than 5,000 jobs in the Czech Republic, making it the country's sixth-largest company. Recently, Taiwan and the Czech Republic have also started talking about working together on military equipment like howitzers, transport vehicles, and drones. This shows that their relationship is very important strategically.</p>

            <h1>Trump Plans to Send Thousands of National Guard Soldiers to Chicago to Fight Crime and Immigration</h1>
            <p>News reports say that the government of former U.S. President Donald Trump has been planning to send National Guard soldiers to Chicago in recent weeks. This is to help fight crime and problems with immigration.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post newspaper, using information from officials who did not want to be named, reported that the U.S. Department of Defense is already making plans. They might send thousands of National Guard members to Chicago, the third-largest city in the U.S., as early as September. The Department of Defense did not confirm these reports.</p>
            <p>Trump already sent National Guard soldiers to Washington D.C. this month. Defense officials said that these soldiers in Washington D.C. will soon carry weapons.</p>
            <p>On August 22nd, Trump said he would take similar actions in big cities like Chicago and New York, which are led by Democratic mayors. He told reporters at the White House, "We will make our cities very, very safe. I think Chicago will be our next target, and then we will help New York."</p>
            <p>Several unnamed sources told CNN that the plan for sending National Guard to Chicago might be like what Trump did in Los Angeles in June. At that time, Trump sent 4,000 California National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines, even though the California government did not want them.</p>
            <p>The plan to send National Guard soldiers to Chicago would also help the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take more action against immigrants who are in the country without legal permission.</p>
            <p>The governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, and the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, are both from the Democratic Party. They strongly disagree with this idea.</p>
            <p>Pritzker wrote on social media platform X (formerly Twitter): "Trump and the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) Republicans are trying to make their party look like the 'law and order' party. This is very far from the truth."</p>
            <p>Johnson said that the Chicago city government has not received any official notice from Trump's government about sending military forces. He called such actions "lacking coordination, unnecessary, and unacceptable."</p>
            <p>According to Chicago police records, the city had 573 murder cases in 2024. This is 8% less than in 2023.</p>
