            <h1>Climate Activist Greta Thunberg Leads Aid Ships to Gaza</h1>
            <p>A group of ships carrying help and people like Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg left Barcelona, Spain today. The organizers said they will try to "break the illegal blockade of Gaza."</p>
            <p>According to the "Global Sumud Flotilla" organizers, about 20 ships sailed from the eastern Spanish city just after 3:30 PM local time. They promised to "create a safe way for help and stop the ongoing killing of Palestinian people."</p>
            <p>This group says on its website that it is an independent organization, not connected to any government or political party.</p>
            <p>The ships have Palestinian flags. Hundreds of people are on board, including activists from many countries. For example, Irish actor Liam Cunningham and Spanish actor Eduard Fernandez are there.</p>
            <p>Also on the ships are many members of parliament and famous people from European countries, including the former mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau.</p>
            <p>The ships are expected to arrive in Gaza, a coastal area badly affected by war, by mid-September.</p>
            <p>Greta Thunberg told reporters, "Today's main point is not why we are sailing. It's not really about the mission we are starting."</p>
            <p>"It's about Palestine, about how people are purposely stopped from getting the most basic things to live. And it's about how the world can stay silent."</p>

            <h1>Israel Attacks Gaza, Says Hamas Spokesperson Abu Obeida Killed</h1>
            <p>Israel said today that Abu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas's armed group, was killed yesterday in an Israeli attack. He is the latest high-ranking Hamas member killed in the war, which has lasted almost two years.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Abu Obeida, who spoke for the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas's armed wing), was the target of an attack. Defense Minister Israel Katz later wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that "Hamas's terror spokesperson Abu Obeida has been removed in Gaza."</p>
            <p>In the Gaza Strip, 23 months of destructive fighting have badly hurt Hamas's leaders. Israel says it wants to destroy the armed group and free the people taken hostage in the attack on October 7, 2023, which started the war.</p>
            <p>Eyal Zamir, the head of the Israel Defense Forces, promised to keep targeting Hamas leaders. He said that most of them are now outside the country.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army has been getting ready to attack Gaza City, the biggest city in the Gaza Strip. Recently, they have bombed the area more and warned people to leave immediately.</p>
            <p>Hamas has not yet said anything about Abu Obeida's death. The Israeli army says his real name was Hudaifa al-Kahlut.</p>
            <p>Since the war began, he had given many speeches on TV. He always wore a military uniform and covered his face with a Palestinian scarf. He also sent out voice messages, press releases, and posts on social media.</p>

            <h1>US Judge Stops Government from Sending Unaccompanied Children to Guatemala</h1>
            <p>Today, a US federal judge signed an order to stop President Trump's government from sending 10 immigrant children, who are alone, to Guatemala. Lawyers said that sending these children away goes against US laws.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that a group for immigrant rights, the National Immigration Law Center, filed a lawsuit for these children, aged 10 to 17, early in the morning. The judge made this decision based on their lawsuit.</p>
            <p>Judge Sparkle Sooknanan of the Federal District Court in Washington, D.C. ordered the government to stop sending the children away for 14 days. This was to allow for an urgent court meeting at noon. The judge said it seemed the children were already in the process of being sent away.</p>
            <p>Current and former US officials told Reuters that Trump's government made a deal with Guatemala. This deal would allow children who are alone to be sent back to Guatemala. The government planned to start sending them away this week. CNN first reported this plan on August 29.</p>
            <p>After Republican President Trump returned to the White House in January, he began a big effort to find and remove immigrants.</p>
            <p>According to federal law, children who arrive at the US border without parents or guardians are called "unaccompanied minors." They are sent to safe places run by the federal government. They stay there until they can live with family members or in foster homes.</p>
