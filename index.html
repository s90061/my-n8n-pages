<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy," hostility, and provocation. This accusation followed a speech in which he stated that Taiwan is "of course" a country, supported by historical evidence and legal proof.

Beijing asserts that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times. It claims the island is one of its provinces and has no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly disagree with this view. They have repeatedly offered to hold talks with China, but these offers have been rejected. China considers Lai a separatist.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Lai's Sunday evening speech, said he had deliberately distorted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and maintained that the island has never been a country.

"It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that openly encouraged conflict across the Taiwan Strait, and a mix of 'Taiwan independence' errors and false beliefs," the office said in a statement.

It added, "The misleading statements made by Lai Ching-te, which go against history, reality, and legal principles, will simply be discarded by history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply presenting historical facts. It called Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country "just a made-up lie without any basis."

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to acknowledge the objective existence of the Republic of China and the current situation in the Taiwan Strait, where 'the two sides are not under each other's control'," it added in a statement.

In 1949, the Republic of China government moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war against Mao Zedong's communists. The Republic of China remains the island's official name.

Lai has repeatedly stated that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future. He also emphasized that since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak for it.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has experienced increasing military and political pressure from China, including military exercises.

**Taiwan's China Airlines postpones retirement of older planes due to Boeing 787 delays**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - China Airlines, Taiwan's national carrier, is delaying the removal of some of its older aircraft from service. This is due to hold-ups in receiving Boeing 787-9 jets, which may lead to compensation payments from Boeing, according to the airline's recently appointed chairman.

China Airlines, founded in 1959, is currently upgrading its fleet. Last year, it divided an order for new long-haul aircraft, valued at nearly $12 billion at list prices, between Boeing and the European company Airbus.

China Airlines has also ordered 24 Boeing 787s for regional and some longer-distance flights. This order includes 18 of the 787-9 model and six of the larger 787-10 variant.

However, Chairman George Kao stated that China Airlines' plan to replace its older Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos is being affected by delays in new aircraft deliveries, particularly for the 787-9s.

"We are currently experiencing a significant impact. Some aircraft that were planned to be retired or returned at the end of their lease agreements will now remain in service, and their leases will be extended," he told Reuters in an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, home to Taiwan's main international airport.

Boeing has not provided China Airlines with an exact schedule for the 787-9 delays, though it has indicated that deliveries will "basically" begin by the end of 2025, added Kao, who is a trained pilot, started as a flight attendant, and became chairman in March.

"This is written in the contract," he said when asked if China Airlines would seek compensation.

"For example, if the delay is due to issues in the supply chain, Boeing is responsible and must provide some compensation. But if it's not, then there is no compensation. It's all documented in the contract."

Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.

Other airlines are facing similar challenges.

Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), an organization representing airlines globally, recently described predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade as "completely unacceptable."

Despite this, Kao expressed optimism about expansion plans. He mentioned the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year, which will allow for increased capacity on routes such as New York and London. He also noted a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport, with its first section expected to open later this year.

He also hinted at more aircraft for Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary that primarily operates domestic flights with ATR-72 turboprops. Mandarin Airlines is being restructured to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan using new jet aircraft.

"I can discuss this with aircraft lessors," he said, without revealing the specific jet models that might be added. "We have this plan to help Mandarin Airlines grow."

China Airlines faces competition domestically from its long-standing rival EVA Air and the fast-growing Starlux Airlines, which recently ordered 10 additional A350s.

Kao explained that while the Taiwanese market itself is small, transit traffic, a key focus for all three airlines, means that supporting three full-service airlines is not a problem.

He added that Seoul's Incheon airport is too large, making it easy for passengers to get lost, Tokyo's landing fees are too expensive, and Hong Kong has "political issues." In contrast, Taoyuan airport's new terminal will significantly improve the travel experience.

"Our passengers are not all Taiwanese; many are transit passengers. This is because Taiwan's location, connecting the Pacific to all of Asia, is very convenient."

**Nvidia Secures Entire Wistron Plant Through 2026 to Build AI Servers**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) has reportedly reserved all production capacity at Wistron's newly opened server facility in Taiwan until 2026. This move is to meet the increasing demand for AI servers, as reported by Economic Daily.

Nvidia has reportedly secured all server manufacturing capacity at Wistron's recently launched plant in Zhubei, Taiwan. This is for the production of its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. These orders, which extend through 2026, show Nvidia's strong effort to guarantee essential AI infrastructure capacity, as demand continues to be higher than supply.

The plant began operations this quarter and was officially opened on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production are already in place for at least a year. Economic Daily and Commercial Times reported that Nvidia has effectively secured all future output from the plant.

Wistron's combined operations are estimated to produce 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter. The company has warned that its current capacity might not meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has acquired an adjacent building to serve as a second AI server site next year, aiming to double its production in Taiwan.

AI server shipments have become a main driver of growth not only for Wistron but also for Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is also expanding its presence in the U.S. with a new facility near Dallas, Texas.

By reserving full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is ensuring that its cloud and system partners receive the necessary quantities of AI servers, while competitors face tighter supply limitations. Nvidia's control over the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity indicates its strategic goal to dominate the AI hardware ecosystem.
