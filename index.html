            <h1>Man Takes Deposit from Typhoon Victims for House Repairs, Disappears, Caught by Police in Hengchun</h1>
            <p>A man named Chen, over 70 years old, lives in Syuejia District, Tainan City. His house was damaged by a typhoon. He looked online for a team to fix it. A man agreed to do the repairs. But after taking a deposit of NT$190,000, he disappeared. Last night, the police found and arrested the 31-year-old man, Mr. Chou, in Hengchun Township, Pingtung.</p>
            <p>Huang Hsin-pei, who leads the detective team at Syuejia Police Station in Tainan, spoke to the media. He said the police received a report on July 18th from the victim. The victim said his roof was damaged by the typhoon. He could not find anyone to help fix it for many days, so he posted online asking for help. Someone, who called himself "Jiang Wei," kindly offered to help. He came to the house and helped fix part of it. After that, they signed a contract for a large amount of money for the repair work.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said the person who reported the crime told the police that the man asked for a big deposit before finishing the repairs. He asked for the money several times, reaching a total of NT$190,000. Then he disappeared. The victim realized something was wrong and called the police. After getting the report, Syuejia Police Station formed a special team with the Tainan City Criminal Investigation Division, Taichung City Police Department, Nantou County Police Department, and Pingtung County Police Department to find the man.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang said that after their investigation, they quickly found out who the suspect was. They used his car to find him. The suspect tried to avoid the police by turning off his phone, changing cars, and moving around at night. But the special team still caught him last night in Hengchun Township, Pingtung County. After questioning, the police will send the case to the prosecutors.</p>
            <p>Wu Chien-te, the head of Syuejia Police Station, wants to tell people that they should be careful when choosing companies to repair their homes. If a company you don't know asks for a large amount of money before finishing the work, it might be a scam. People should be careful and check things thoroughly to avoid being cheated.</p>

            <h1>Hsinchu City Recall Votes Approaching: Both Sides Hold Rallies During Golden Week</h1>
            <p>Hsinchu City is getting ready for a vote to remove some officials from their positions. Tonight, groups who want to remove them held an event. They asked people to vote to remove those who are not fit for their jobs. The people facing this vote are Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an (who is currently suspended) and Kuomintang legislator Cheng Cheng-chien. They also held rallies tonight. They hope citizens will go out and vote against people using power badly.</p>
            <p>The groups in Hsinchu City that want to remove officials, called "Hsinchu Double Recall," held an event tonight at the 228 Memorial Park in Hsinchu City. The event was called "Recall is Love, Anti-Communism Protects Taiwan." Ker Chien-ming, the head of the Democratic Progressive Party in the Legislative Yuan, and several Hsinchu City council members from the same party came to support.</p>
            <p>Ker Chien-ming spoke and said that he was the first to call for a big recall. His main goal is "to fight communism and protect Taiwan." He said that the Kuomintang and Taiwan People's Party in the parliament are trying to give the country to China. They also want to stop the central government from working by using the "Financial Discretion Law." He added that Cheng Cheng-chien is rarely in the parliament, and Kao Hung-an was found guilty of corruption in her first trial. He said that people who are not fit for their jobs should be removed.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chieh, a spokesperson for "Hsinchu Double Recall," said that Kao Hung-an did not value the chance Hsinchu citizens gave her. The city's growth has stopped, and places are neglected. She also said that Cheng Cheng-chien is involved in many lawsuits and might be working with the Chinese Communist Party. She asked people to remove those who do not do their job well and disappoint the public. This would help Hsinchu City grow again.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party held a rally tonight at Tiangongtan Park in Hsinchu City. It was called "719 Anti-Evil Recall, Protect Hsinchu." Huang Kuo-chang, the party chairman, was there. They also invited Miao-Li County Commissioner Chung Tung-chin, Chiayi City Mayor Huang Ming-hui, and New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih to speak. Together, they asked people to vote "no" to support Kao Hung-an and Cheng Cheng-chien.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the parliament is working on things like more holidays, changes to the legal system, and supporting workers and soldiers. But he said the Democratic Progressive Party is using government power to control those who disagree. He asked his supporters to vote on July 26th to protect democratic values, stand together against misused power, and end this "big drama."</p>
            <p>Kao Hung-an spoke and said that the Democratic Progressive Party started this recall. She reminded citizens to understand how a "one-sided recall" would hurt democracy and city management. If she is removed, citizens will not have the right to choose, and the central government will directly send someone to take over. She asked citizens to vote "no" to the recall to protect Hsinchu City's growth.</p>
            <p>Cheng Cheng-chien pointed out that the Democratic Progressive Party has been in power for a long time but has not increased the funds Hsinchu City receives. Instead, this has limited the city government's projects. He asked citizens to vote "no" on July 26th to the recall. He wants them to refuse political attacks and protect Hsinchu City's future growth and fair sharing of resources.</p>
