            <h1>France to Recognize Palestine: Key Points</h1>
            <p>On July 24, French President Emmanuel Macron said that France will announce its recognition of the State of Palestine in September, during the United Nations General Assembly. Experts say this action might make other European countries follow suit. It could also make Hamas take a stronger position during talks for a ceasefire.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post noted that France will be the biggest Western power and the first G7 member to recognize Palestine. This announcement comes as more reports of hunger are coming out of Gaza.</p>
            <h2>France Joins Recognition of Palestine, European Countries Face Pressure to Follow</h2>
            <p>For more than ten years, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been trying to become a full member of the United Nations. In 2012, the UN recognized Palestine as a "permanent observer." However, to become a full member, the Security Council needs to approve it. The United States has stopped Palestine from becoming a full member many times.</p>
            <p>Eyal Mayroz, a senior lecturer in Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Sydney, said that Macron's action will put more pressure on other European countries, especially the United Kingdom, to do the same. The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, is facing increasing calls from within his Labour Party to recognize the State of Palestine.</p>
            <h2>Over 140 Countries Recognize Palestine, European Countries Follow Recently</h2>
            <p>With this announcement, France will join over 140 countries that recognize Palestine. Many countries, including Russia, China, India, and Malaysia, recognized Palestine when the Palestine National Council declared it a state in November 1988. However, at that time, the United States and most Western European countries did not recognize it. This was because Washington insisted on a two-state solution achieved through negotiations.</p>
            <p>But the situation changed during Israel's military actions in Gaza. Norway, Spain, Ireland, and Slovenia all recognized the State of Palestine last year.</p>
            <h2>Macron Recognizing Palestine Does Not Mean Supporting Hamas</h2>
            <p>Hamas welcomed Macron's decision, calling it a "positive step" towards justice and self-determination for Palestinians. Mayroz stated that increased international pressure on Israel could lead Hamas to take a stronger stance in ceasefire talks.</p>
            <p>However, the Washington Post believes that Macron's announcement to recognize Palestine does not mean he supports Hamas. This is because he also called for Hamas to give up its weapons. He had previously stated that Hamas should not have any role in Gaza after the conflict ends. In April of this year, Macron expressed his support for the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, to take control of Gaza.</p>
            <p>Currently, the Palestinian Authority manages some parts of the West Bank. The Gaza Strip is controlled by Hamas. Although both are part of the Palestinian group, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas have always been against each other.</p>
            <p>Even though it has support from many Western countries, the Palestinian Authority, which is located in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, struggles to put its policies into action. Also, many Palestinians do not respect it because they believe it is corrupt and inefficient.</p>

            <h1>Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Meets US Treasury Secretary, Focuses on Trade and Economic Cooperation</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry, Gan Kim Yong, is currently visiting the United States. He announced that he met with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other officials to talk about economic issues between their two countries that benefit both sides. Former US President Trump had earlier announced a list of tariffs, and Singapore was included with a 10% tariff.</p>
            <p>Since the free trade agreement between Singapore and the United States began in 2004, the amount of trade between the two countries has continued to grow. The United States has had a trade surplus with Singapore. The tariffs on Singapore's products in Trump's tariff list are relatively low.</p>
            <p>Today, Gan Kim Yong posted on LinkedIn that he met with US officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. They discussed economic topics that are good for both Singapore and the US. They also talked about how to make trade between them better and explore new ways to work together in areas like the digital economy and international platforms for cooperation.</p>
            <p>Gan Kim Yong also went to a meeting with representatives from American companies. This meeting was organized by the US Chamber of Commerce. During the meeting, they discussed how important it is to have strong supply chains and a clear, predictable environment for doing business.</p>
            <p>He said that the United States has always been an important and strategic partner for Singapore. Singapore will continue to talk and work with the US government and businesses to move forward on issues that both sides care about.</p>
            <p>Gan Kim Yong recently spoke at a press conference about how tariffs might affect Singapore's economy. At that time, he said, "I mentioned that the United States offered a potential reduction in tariffs for medicines exported from our country (Singapore) to the US. We are currently talking with the US to better understand what they expect, so we can find practical solutions for Singaporean businesses." Regarding the semiconductor industry, Gan Kim Yong stated, "Perhaps after we finish our discussions about medicines, we will move on to the topic of semiconductors."</p>
            <p>Singapore is a very important center for trade in Asia. It is in a key location on the Malacca Strait, which connects the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Because Singapore relies a lot on international trade, its economic performance is often seen as a sign of how the global trade environment is doing.</p>

            <h1>NTU Student Ding Yan-chen Dominates Opponent, Aims for Gold in Universiade Men's Singles Badminton</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's new badminton star, Ding Yan-chen, who is a student at National Taiwan University (NTU), played in the Universiade men's singles semi-final today. He defeated China's Zhou Xinyu with scores of 15-7 and 15-6 at the Rhein-Ruhr Universiade. He is now the second Taiwanese player to reach the men's singles gold medal match at the Universiade, following Wang Tzu-wei.</p>
            <p>Ding Yan-chen is 21 years old and studies Industrial Management at National Taiwan University. He has performed very well in the men's singles event at the World University Games in Germany. He has won every game without losing a single set. In the quarter-finals, he beat Malaysia's Eu Yang, which meant he was guaranteed at least a bronze medal and moved forward to the semi-finals.</p>
            <p>In today's semi-final match against China's Zhou Xinyu, Ding Yan-chen was ahead from the start in the first set and quickly built a large lead, winning 15-7. In the second set, Ding Yan-chen continued to play very well, winning 15-6. He has now successfully secured a spot in the gold medal match. He will play against France's Enogat Roy for the men's singles gold medal.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that Taiwanese male badminton players have won medals six times in the past at the Universiade. Ding Yan-chen is trying to become the second Taiwanese player to win the men's singles title at the Universiade. The first was "Badminton Prince" Wang Tzu-wei, who won at the 2017 Taipei Universiade.</p>
            <p>Also, Taiwan has performed very well in mixed doubles badminton, with three pairs reaching the semi-finals. After Wu Xuan-yi and Yang Chu-yun won a difficult three-set match against China's Liao Pin-yi and Li Qian, Taiwan is now sure to win gold, silver, and bronze medals. Wu Xuan-yi and Yang Chu-yun will play against Chen Zheng-kuan and Hsu Yin-hui in a match where two Taiwanese pairs compete for the gold medal. Lin Yu-jie and Zheng Yu-jie, who lost in the semi-finals, won a bronze medal.</p>
