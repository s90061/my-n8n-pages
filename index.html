            <h1>Israel Bombs Residential Building in Gaza City Again, Third Time in Three Days</h1>
            <p>On September 7th, the Israeli army bombed a tall residential building in Gaza City. Gaza City is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip. The army said they were attacking a place used by Hamas, a Palestinian group. This was the third residential building in Gaza City that the Israeli army has bombed in three days.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu's government approved a plan to take over Gaza City in August. But Israel has not yet publicly said they have started a big attack. Even so, the Israeli army has increased its bombings and fighting around Gaza City in recent weeks. They want to put more pressure on Hamas.</p>
            <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said today that they attacked a tall building in Gaza City called Al-Roya Tower. They said Hamas used this building to watch where Israeli soldiers were.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army had already told people to leave the building and nearby areas two times before. They told residents to go to a "humanitarian zone" in Al-Mawasi, which is in the city of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza.</p>
            <p>Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City said that one person died because of the bombing. Hamas has always said they do not use residential buildings for military purposes.</p>
            <p>A few hours earlier, Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the start of a government meeting that the Israeli army had increased its attacks on Gaza City. He said, "We are doing more in the areas outside and inside Gaza City... we are destroying tall buildings that we know terrorists use."</p>

            <h1>Pitcher Teng Kai-wei Strikes Out 8 in First 4 Innings, But Walks in 5th Lead to Loss</h1>
            <p>On September 7th, Taiwanese baseball player Teng Kai-wei started as a pitcher for the San Francisco Giants against the Cardinals. He struck out 8 batters in 4 innings, matching his best record in one game. But in the 5th inning, he could not control his pitches well. He walked three batters in a row, making the bases full. Then, the other team hit a single, and he had to leave the game. He was given the loss.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei, who is 26 years old, wore the Giants' number 66 jersey today. He played away against the St. Louis Cardinals. He played very well in the first 4 innings, getting 8 strikeouts. This matched his personal best from his last game against the Colorado Rockies. It was also close to the high level of strikeouts that Kuo Hong-chih, another Taiwanese pitcher, achieved 17 years ago when he got 8 strikeouts in 3.2 innings.</p>
            <p>However, in the 5th inning, he walked three batters in a row, which put runners on all bases. Then, the other team got a hit, and he gave up runs and had to leave the game. The Giants lost the game 3 to 4. Teng Kai-wei officially pitched 4 innings. He gave up 3 hits, had 8 strikeouts, and walked 5 batters. He was responsible for 4 runs. His ERA (Earned Run Average) for this season is now 7.54.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei threw a total of 77 pitches, and 41 of them were strikes. In the first 4 innings, he did not let the other team hit much, and he got many strikeouts without giving up any runs.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei gave up 4 runs in the 5th inning. He walked three batters in a row, which filled all the bases. Then, Lars Nootbaar, the first batter for the Cardinals, hit a single. This was the first run scored by either team in the game.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei left the game when the score was 0-1 and the bases were full. Jose Butto took his place. Butto then gave up another hit and a walk, which meant the three runners Teng Kai-wei had left on base all scored. These three runs were also counted against Teng Kai-wei.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei took the loss. This season, he has played 6 games in Major League Baseball and has a record of 2 wins and 4 losses.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei showed his great ability to strike out batters in the first 4 innings. He got 2 strikeouts in the 1st inning, 1 in the 2nd, 2 in the 3rd, and all 3 outs in the 4th inning were strikeouts.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei had thrown 57 pitches after 4 innings. He had a chance to try for the record of most strikeouts in one game by a Taiwanese pitcher in Major League Baseball. Chen Wei-yin holds this record. He got 12 strikeouts in 5.2 innings against the Athletics on July 29, 2021, and 12 strikeouts in 6.1 innings against the Brewers on May 11, 2016.</p>
            <p>Even so, Teng Kai-wei's 8 strikeouts in 4 innings are a very good performance for a Taiwanese pitcher in Major League Baseball. It is as good as Kuo Hong-chih's strong strikeout performance in 2008.</p>
            <p>On May 6, 2008, Kuo Hong-chih pitched in relief against the New York Mets. He took over from the starting pitcher, Hiroki Kuroda, and struck out 8 batters in 3.2 innings, getting the win. In that game, Kuo Hong-chih faced 13 batters and struck out 8 of them. Today, Teng Kai-wei faced 15 batters in the first 4 innings and struck out 8 of them.</p>

            <h1>Bolsonaro Supporters Protest in Many Cities Before Supreme Court Rules on Coup Case</h1>
            <p>On September 7th, thousands of supporters of Brazil's former far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, protested in many cities. This happened just before the Supreme Court decides on a case about a failed attempt to overthrow the government, which involves Bolsonaro.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that this week, the Supreme Court will decide if Bolsonaro secretly planned to stay in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing opponent, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.</p>
            <p>If Bolsonaro, who is 70 years old and used to be an army captain, is found guilty, he could go to prison for up to 43 years. This case has made his friend, former US President Trump, very angry.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since August, so he was not at today's Independence Day protests. These protests took place in many big cities, from the capital BrasÃ­lia to Rio de Janeiro and SÃ£o Paulo. His loyal supporters gathered on Paulista Avenue in central SÃ£o Paulo around 3 or 4 PM. They wore clothes in the green and yellow colors of the national flag.</p>
            <p>Some supporters held signs that said they supported Bolsonaro and were against Lula and the Supreme Court judges. Others held signs that read, "Thank you, President Trump."</p>
            <p>The protestors asked for a pardon for hundreds of Bolsonaro supporters. These supporters broke into the Supreme Court, the President's office, and Congress in BrasÃ­lia on January 8, 2023. The protestors want the Congress to vote for a pardon that could also include Bolsonaro. This way, even if he is found guilty in the future, he could still be pardoned.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro was president from 2019 to 2022. He was not allowed to run for president until 2030 because he questioned Brazil's voting system but did not show any proof.</p>
