I am sorry, but I encountered an error when trying to fetch the news URLs from Taiwan using the `news_url` tool. The error message was "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'parts')". This means I cannot get the news articles to translate for you. The tool might be experiencing a temporary issue.
