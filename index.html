            <h1>Zelenskyy Warns UN: Stop Russia Or Face Dangerous Arms Race</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy spoke at the United Nations. He asked strong countries to work together and stop Russia's war against Ukraine. He said if they don't stop Russia, there could be a very bad arms race. He also said that Russia is trying to spread the war to other countries, not just Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that the war between Russia and Ukraine has already started a very destructive arms race. He also said that Ukraine is ready to sell its weapons to countries that are its friends.</p>
            <p>He said, "It is simple: stopping this war now is cheaper than building underground schools or big shelters for important buildings later."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy gave examples: Russian drones and warplanes have flown into the sky of NATO countries like Poland and Estonia. He said this shows that Russian President Putin is trying to see how far he can go outside of Ukraine.</p>
            <p>He explained, "Now, Russian drones are flying over Europe, and Russia's actions have spread to many countries. Putin wants to make the war bigger to keep it going. Now, no one can feel safe."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that Ukraine has decided to start selling weapons made in Ukraine to its allies.</p>
            <p>He told them, "You don't have to start this defense race from nothing. We are ready to share what we have learned and proven in war."</p>
            <p>"We are ready to make you safe now with our modern weapons. We have decided to start selling weapons. These are strong systems that have been tested in real war when other international groups have failed."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also warned today that Europe must not let Russia gain power in Moldova, an important country. He said this would make Moldova like Belarus and Georgia, which are now controlled by Russia.</p>
            <p>He said, "Russia is trying to do to Moldova what Iran did to Lebanon in the past. But the world's reaction is still not enough. In Europe, we have already lost Georgia. And for many years, Belarus has moved closer to depending on Russia. Europe cannot afford to lose Moldova too."</p>
            <p>In his speech today, Zelenskyy also talked about his meeting with US President Trump yesterday.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said, "President Trump and I had a good talk. I also spoke with many other important leaders. When we work together, we can make big changes."</p>
            <p>"Of course, we are working hard to get real help from Europe. And of course, we depend on support from the United States."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that with help from the European Union and NATO, Ukraine can get back all the land it has lost. This is a change from what Trump has said before. For several months, he often said that Ukraine probably could not get back a lot of Russian-controlled land.</p>

            <h1>US Stops Giant Company's Bicycles Due to Claims of Forced Labor</h1>
            <p>Today, US customs officials announced that they have put a temporary hold on bicycles, bike parts, and accessories made by the Giant company. This is because there is information that Giant may have used forced labor. This includes treating weak workers badly, not paying them enough, and making them work too many extra hours. Giant can choose to destroy these goods or show proof that they were made fairly.</p>
            <p>The US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a statement this morning that Giant company broke a US law. This law, called Title 19, Section 1307, stops products made with forced labor from coming into the United States. So, CBP will immediately stop Giant's bicycles, parts, and accessories made in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>When CBP looked into Giant company, they found several signs of forced labor listed by the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO). These signs were: using people who are in a weak position, bad working and living conditions, being forced to work because of debt, not getting paid, and working too much overtime.</p>
            <p>CBP said that Giant company made money by doing these things. This made their products cheaper than they should be. This unfairly made millions of dollars for Giant and hurt US businesses. The ILO believes that almost 28 million workers around the world are forced to work.</p>
            <p>Susan S. Thomas, who works for CBP's trade office, said, "Companies that import goods must carefully check their supply chains and understand them." CBP will continue to look into claims of forced labor. They will act when they find it in US supply chains.</p>
            <p>The order against Giant company is the newest step CBP has taken to deal with forced labor. When CBP has proof that imported goods are made with forced labor, they will stop those goods. Companies whose goods are stopped can choose to destroy them, send them back to where they came from, or prove that the goods can enter the US.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said it will work with the Ministry of Labor. They will help Giant company quickly fix any issues about forced labor. This will help CBP remove the temporary hold on Giant's products soon.</p>
