            <h1>Argentina Live Torture and Murder Case Shocks the Nation, Thousands Protest</h1>
            <p>Today, thousands of protesters walked in the streets of Buenos Aires, Argentina. They asked for fairness for three young women who were tortured and killed. The terrible crime was shown live on social media, making the whole country very upset.</p>
            <p>The families of the victims carried signs with the names and pictures of the three women. They marched with different left-wing groups to the country's main government building.</p>
            <p>Signs among the protesters said things like: "This is a drug gang's killing of women!" and "Our lives are not something to throw away!"</p>
            <p>Twenty-year-old cousins Morena Verdi and Brenda Del Castillo, and 15-year-old Lara Gutierrez, were missing for five days. On September 24, their bodies were found buried in a garden outside a house in a southern part of Buenos Aires.</p>
            <p>Police investigators said that this crime is linked to drug gangs. The cruel act was shown live on Instagram to 45 special private accounts.</p>
            <p>On September 26, the Minister of National Security, Patricia Bullrich, announced that a fifth person was arrested. This means five people are now in custody for the crime, including three men and two women.</p>
            <p>Investigators stated that the three victims thought they were going to a party. But they were tricked and forced into a van. It is believed that this was a "punishment" because they broke the gang's rules. It was also done to scare other people.</p>
            <p>Javier Alonso, who is in charge of security for Buenos Aires Province, said that the police learned about the video when they questioned one of the arrested people. This person told them about the video.</p>
            <p>In the video, a leader of the gang can be heard saying, "This is what happens when you steal my drugs."</p>
            <p>News from Argentina said that the torturers did terrible things to the victims. They cut their fingers, pulled out their nails, beat them, and stopped them from breathing.</p>
