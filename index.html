The Ministry of Agriculture announced that farms have lost more than 2.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) because of Typhoon Danna and recent heavy rains. Bananas were the most affected crop, with losses of about 220 million NTD.

The storms damaged 16,624 hectares of farmland. About 37% of these farms were hurt, meaning 6,200 hectares could not be harvested. Other crops that suffered losses include pomelos, guavas, bamboo shoots, and oranges.

Animals and fishing farms also had damage. Farm buildings and fishing boats were also destroyed. Tainan, Chiayi, Yunlin, and Changhua were among the cities and counties with the most damage.
