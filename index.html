            <h1>American Woman Arrested for Smuggling Drugs from Laos to Taiwan for Unseen Fiance</h1>
            <p>The Aviation Police Bureau said today that an American woman was arrested. She wanted to send money to her fiance, whom she met online but never saw. So, she agreed to carry drugs from Laos to Taiwan. A person who said he was her fiance's boss arranged this. The police and Taipei Customs stopped her. They also found and arrested a man named Ye who was supposed to receive the drugs. Both are now facing drug charges.</p>
            <p>Chen Po-chuan, who is in charge of a police team, told reporters that in May, Taipei Customs and the Aviation Police checked the woman's luggage. The American suspect, named Ms. C, was at Taoyuan International Airport. She was coming to Taiwan after a flight transfer in Hong Kong. They found 4.237 kilograms of heroin hidden in her luggage. Heroin is a very dangerous drug. It is worth more than 30 million New Taiwan Dollars. The police sent the case to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office for breaking drug laws.</p>
            <p>Ms. C, who is about 50 years old, told the police her story. She met her fiance online, but she never met him in person. Her fiance was in jail. Later, she met another person online who said he was her fiance's boss. This person said she needed to send money regularly to her fiance in jail. Ms. C had many debts and could not pay. So, she took a job offer from the "boss." She flew from the U.S. to Laos for a job interview. The company paid for her flights, food, and accommodation while she waited for the job. She also got thousands of New Taiwan Dollars each day as pocket money.</p>
            <p>Chen Po-chuan added that after some time, Ms. C got her job. She received a suitcase with drugs hidden inside. Then, she flew to Taiwan through Hong Kong. The "company" paid for her flights, food, and place to stay. Her payment would depend on how well she did the job. But Ms. C could not clearly explain who the "boss" really was or what her job was about. The job and the money she was offered did not seem right. She also said she did not know about the drugs. The police did not believe her. They arrested her on the spot and sent her to court.</p>
            <p>The Aviation Police Bureau quickly formed a special team. They worked with Prosecutor Li Meng-ting from the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office. The team carefully investigated the case. At the end of the same month, they found and arrested Mr. Ye in Zhongli, Taoyuan City. He was the person who was supposed to receive the drugs in Taiwan. But Mr. Ye said a friend asked him to pick up someone and he did not know about the drugs. The police think that both Ms. C and Mr. Ye were working for a criminal group. After questioning, the police sent the whole case to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office for breaking drug laws. They were charged in September.</p>

            <h1>US Federal Reserve Likely to Cut Interest Rates; Market Watches for Future and Disagreements</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve, also called the Fed, is expected to lower interest rates for the first time tomorrow in 2025. But many things will affect its future plans. These include more political pressure and possible disagreements among its members.</p>
            <p>Most people in the market think the Fed will announce a 0.25% interest rate cut after its two-day meeting. This is mainly because there are fewer jobs in the U.S.</p>
            <p>However, how quickly and how much the Fed will cut rates next is still not clear.</p>
            <p>First, U.S. President Donald Trump has done several things that make decisions harder for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Just a few hours before the officials were supposed to meet this morning, the situation was still very unclear.</p>
            <p>In recent months, Trump has kept asking the Fed to cut interest rates a lot. In August this year, he removed Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed's board. This caused legal problems, and for a time, she might not have been able to go to this meeting.</p>
            <p>Also, after another board member suddenly left last month, Trump chose Stephen Miran, one of his main economic advisors, to join the Fed board. This started a quick process to appoint him. The Senate approved this choice only at the very last moment.</p>

            <h1>"Trump-Xi Meeting": Beijing's Shopping List is Key for Final Plans</h1>
            <p>The details for U.S. President Trump's official visit to China are now in their final stages. Hong Kong media has reported that a large list of American goods that Beijing will buy, like Boeing planes and soybeans, is very important for Trump to go. This visit is expected to happen around the time of the APEC summit.</p>
            <p>If President Trump's visit happens, it will be the first time a U.S. president has visited China since November 2017. It will also be Trump's second visit to China. This would also make it possible for Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit the U.S. next year.</p>
            <p>The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong reported on September 17 that China and the U.S. are in the final talks for this official visit. Whether Trump goes depends on if there are many good results to announce. A big list of American products that Beijing will buy is a key part.</p>
            <p>A person who wished to remain unnamed said in the report that China and the U.S. have made good progress on Trump's visit. This progress happened after the fourth trade talks in Spain. The agreed results include a new deal for China to buy many American goods. It is very likely that American Boeing planes will be on this list.</p>
            <p>The anonymous source also said that China formally invited Trump for an official visit in the first week of September. This kind of invitation usually means it's "mostly confirmed" and planning is in a "very advanced stage." Both sides really want the "Trump-Xi meeting" to happen. They hope this important diplomatic event will be seen as a big win in their own countries.</p>
            <p>The official visit of Trump to China is expected to be around the time of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting. This meeting will be held in South Korea from October 31 to November 1.</p>
            <p>Another unnamed source mentioned that besides visiting Beijing, China has suggested that Trump could take the high-speed train to Shanghai during his visit.</p>
            <p>High-speed rail is seen as a great example of the country's development. It shows China's economy and progress. Beijing and Shanghai are 1,300 kilometers apart. The fastest high-speed train only takes 4 hours. This suggestion also aims to connect with the China International Import Expo, which starts on November 5 at the National Exhibition and Convention Center in Shanghai.</p>
            <p>It is understood that this idea is still being discussed. The U.S. side is worried that it might be too tiring for Trump, who is 79 years old. Others are also worried that this trip might look like a compromise to China.</p>
            <p>"In the end, President Trump will decide where he wants to go and what he wants to do in China. He seems very excited about this visit himself, but he also needs to listen to his team's advice," said one source.</p>
            <p>Earlier news from other countries said that American Boeing is talking with China about selling 500 commercial airplanes. If this deal happens, it would be the first time China buys a large number of Boeing planes since Trump became president.</p>
            <p>China buying American soybeans is also a main point on the list. Reuters reported that in 2024, China bought about 20% of its total imported soybeans from the U.S. This is 41% less than in 2016. From January to July this year, China bought 42.3 million tons of soybeans from Brazil but only 16.6 million tons from the U.S.</p>
