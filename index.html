The process to remove Hualien legislator Fu Kun-chi from office has reached its third step. Both the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) are actively campaigning in markets.
On Saturday morning, KMT members, including a New Taipei City councilor, visited Chongqing Market in Hualien City. They asked people to vote "no" in the impeachment vote on July 26. They said this would "protect Hualien and defend democracy." The KMT councilor said they want a stable life and criticized the DPP for causing problems by trying to remove opposition lawmakers. He hopes Fu Kun-chi can continue to help Hualien.
In the afternoon, DPP legislator Wang Yi-chuan and a group called "Weguang Hualien" went to Ji'an evening market to ask for votes. Wang Yi-chuan told the media that the vote is only about removing Fu Kun-chi, not about the DPP. He also mentioned that after a big earthquake in Hualien last year, many people lost their homes, but Fu Kun-chi went to China. Wang Yi-chuan believes Fu Kun-chi must face the consequences, and the impeachment will be successful.

**Argentina Says Iran Is Threatening UN Nuclear Watchdog Chief**

Argentina has accused Iran of threatening Rafael Grossi, who is from Argentina and leads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The IAEA is a UN group that checks nuclear power around the world.
Grossi recently asked to visit some nuclear sites in Iran that were bombed by Israel and the United States. But Iran said no. Iran's government also said that Grossi was not doing his job because he did not speak against the attacks on its nuclear sites. The parliament in Iran voted to stop working with the IAEA.
On Saturday, Argentina's Foreign Ministry supported Grossi. They said they "strongly condemn Iran's threats" against him. They also told Iran to make sure Grossi and his team are safe. The statement did not say exactly what the threats were.

**Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Party "League of Social Democrats" Closes Down**

The League of Social Democrats (LSD), a political party in Hong Kong, has announced it will close. They held their last public protest on June 8th. The LSD was the only political party in Hong Kong that kept holding public protests and asking for people's rights even after the National Security Law was put in place in June 2020.
LSD was known as a strong pro-democracy group. Police often watched their public events. The party's Facebook page said that sometimes, over 10 police officers were present when only four LSD members were giving out leaflets.
The LSD chairman, Chan Po-ying, and three other members were fined in June. This was because they collected money without a license and put up posters without permission during their street activities. Chan Po-ying said she became chairman in 2021 when six other leaders were sent to prison. She did not want the party to close then.
She also shared that people would quietly show support, which gave them strength. She believes that protesting in public is a right for citizens, even if it doesn't change what the government does.
