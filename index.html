            <h1>Tensions between the US and Venezuela: Trump plans to send F-35 jets to Puerto Rico</h1>
            <p>Sources said today that US President Trump will send 10 F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico. This is part of an operation to fight drug dealers. At the same time, the US is increasing its military presence in the Caribbean, and tensions with Venezuela are growing.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, these fighter jets will join US warships already in the southern Caribbean Sea. Trump is putting more pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The US says Maduro leads a drug trafficking group.</p>
            <p>Tensions have become higher in recent days. The US Department of Defense said yesterday that two Venezuelan military planes flew close to a US Navy ship in international waters. The US called this a "very provocative" action.</p>
            <p>On September 2, the US military bombed a ship in the Caribbean Sea that they believed was carrying drugs. Trump said this ship belonged to "Tren de Aragua," a Venezuelan gang linked to Maduro. This incident caused 11 deaths.</p>
            <p>US sources said that the F-35 fighter jets will be placed at an air force base in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a US territory in the Caribbean with over 3 million people.</p>
            <p>Maduro, who is a strong left-wing leader, is seen by the US as an illegitimate leader for the 2024 election. He criticized the US military actions, calling them "the biggest threat our continent has faced in the past hundred years."</p>
            <p>He announced that the country is ready to "defend its land with armed struggle." He has called up about 340,000 active soldiers and more than 8 million reserve soldiers.</p>
            <p>Maduro told foreign reporters, "If Venezuela is attacked, it will immediately enter an armed struggle."</p>

            <h1>UK Deputy Prime Minister Rayner Resigns, Prime Minister Starmer Changes Cabinet</h1>
            <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has resigned because she did not pay enough property tax. After her resignation, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer changed many people in his government today. He is trying to make the Labour Party government stronger.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse said that Rayner was found to have broken rules for government ministers when she bought a property in southern England. She decided to resign, which made Starmer change his cabinet for the first time in 14 months since he became prime minister. During this time, the Reform UK party, which is far-right, has become more popular than the ruling Labour Party.</p>
            <p>According to the BBC, David Lammy, who was the Foreign Secretary, will take Rayner's place. Yvette Cooper, who was the Home Secretary, will become the new Foreign Secretary. The report also said that Shabana Mahmood, who was the Justice Secretary, will become the Home Secretary, and David Lammy will also be in charge of justice matters.</p>
            <p>Since Starmer became Prime Minister last July, his government has had many problems. Rayner's situation is the latest difficulty.</p>
            <p>During this time, Starmer's government had to change its plans for welfare and payments for older people's heating. Also, it could not stop migrants from arriving in small boats without permission. This has made the Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, more popular.</p>
            <p>This week, Rayner admitted she did not pay enough tax when she bought her beachside property. She asked the government's independent ethics advisor for help. Laurie Magnus, the advisor, wrote in a letter to Starmer that Rayner "did not listen" to the legal advice she received. Because of this, he believed she "broke the rules."</p>
            <p>Rayner wrote in her letter to Starmer, "Because of what the investigation found and how it affected my family, I have decided to resign." She also left her jobs as Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>
            <p>Many people thought Rayner could be a future leader of the Labour Party. She was also a main target for political attacks from the Conservative Party and right-wing media.</p>
            <p>Rayner left school at 16 when she became pregnant. Her direct way of speaking was popular with working-class people.</p>
            <p>Rayner is proud to support socialism, but she knows she must be practical first. One of her favorite sayings is, "Ideology alone cannot feed me."</p>

            <h1>New York Times: US Navy SEALs Went to North Korea in 2019, Mission Failed, North Korean Sailors Killed</h1>
            <p>The New York Times reported today, using information from many current and former military officials, that US Navy SEALs secretly landed in North Korea in early 2019. President Trump approved this. Their mission was to install electronic listening devices. However, North Korea found out about the plan. The US soldiers met a North Korean boat on the shore, shot and killed the crew, and then left. The mission was not successful.</p>
            <p>On a winter night in early 2019, members of the US Navy SEALs came out of the water in North Korean seas. They moved quietly to a rocky shore to put in electronic listening equipment. If they had succeeded, the US could have listened to messages from North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>This was a very high-level and difficult secret mission. It had big possible consequences and could not fail.</p>
            <p>At that time, President Donald Trump was going to meet with Kim Jong Un. The SEALs' mission could have given the US very important secret information. But the soldiers had to go onto North Korean land. If they were found, the meeting would stop. It could also cause a hostage problem and make the conflict between the two countries, which both have nuclear weapons, worse. This mission was very risky and needed the President's approval.</p>
            <p>The mission was done by SEAL Team 6, the same group that killed Osama bin Laden, who planned the 9/11 attacks. The soldiers practiced for many months and knew they had to be very precise. But that night, the special forces, wearing wetsuits and night vision goggles, met a North Korean boat with bright lights at the front.</p>
            <p>To avoid being discovered, the SEALs fired their weapons. Within seconds, everyone on the boat was dead. The soldiers did not install the listening devices. They left the shore and went back into the water.</p>
            <p>This operation is still a top secret and has never been made public. The US and North Korea have not said anything about this event. At that time, the Trump government also did not tell important members of Congress who oversee secret operations. The New York Times is the first to report this. The newspaper also said that the White House did not tell Congress about a possible illegal action. The White House has not responded to the New York Times report.</p>
            <p>The New York Times talked to more than 20 US government workers, former Trump government officials, and current and former military people who knew about the mission. Because it is a top secret, they could only speak without giving their names.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that it reported the secret military operation carefully. It still has sensitive information about the mission. This information could affect how intelligence is collected and how special operations are done in the future.</p>
            <p>For many decades, the US has tried to work with North Korea to control its nuclear weapons program. But neither improving relations nor increasing economic sanctions has worked. The SEALs' mission was one of the US's actions against North Korea. But it is still not clear how North Korea found out about the US's secret mission in 2019.</p>
