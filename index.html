            <h1>South Korea's Sancheong County Hit by Extreme Rain and Landslides After March Wildfire; At Least 6 Dead, 7 Missing</h1>
            <p>(Seoul, July 20, Central News Agency) A big landslide happened in Sancheong County, South Gyeongsang Province, South Korea, on July 19. This mountain village was badly damaged again. It had a big forest fire in March this year. At least 6 people have died, and 7 people are missing.</p>
            <p>According to information from South Korea's Ministry of Interior and Safety and the Fire Department, very heavy rain has fallen across South Korea for 5 days in a row. Because of floods and landslides, at least 10 people have died and 9 are missing as of 5 AM today.</p>
            <p>Just from the landslide in Sancheong County, South Gyeongsang Province, on July 19, 6 people died and 7 are missing. Also, 2 people were seriously hurt, and 58 people were saved. Rescue teams are still looking for people in the Sancheong area. The number of people who died or were hurt might change.</p>
            <p>From July 16 to 18, Sancheong County received 348.2 millimeters of rain each day. On July 19, it rained 283.8 millimeters. The total rain over these four days was almost as much as the area usually gets in a whole year. Because of this, on July 19, the county issued its first-ever evacuation order for the whole county. Over 33,000 people quickly left their homes.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported that Sancheong County had a big forest fire in March this year. The fire burned for 213 hours, killed 4 people, and caused 28.7 billion Korean Won in damage (about 620 million New Taiwan Dollars). Some residents' homes have not been rebuilt yet, and they are still living in temporary shelters.</p>
            <p>This continuous heavy rain in South Korea has caused 9,504 homes and 12,921 people to leave their homes in 14 main areas across the country. The area of damaged farmland is 24,247 hectares, which is about the size of 34,000 football fields.</p>

            <h1>Wu Der-rong: Tropical System Likely to Develop from July 23, 40% Chance of Hitting Northern Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 20, Central News Agency) Weather expert Wu Der-rong said today that the eastern and southern parts of Taiwan will have heavy rain. This is because of the outer clouds of Typhoon Wipha and the monsoon circulation. He thinks that from July 23, another tropical weather system will start to grow within the monsoon circulation. Right now, European weather models show a 40% chance that northern Taiwan will be affected by it.</p>
            <p>According to typhoon news from the Central Weather Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, at 2 AM today, Tropical Storm Wipha was located at 21.5 degrees North latitude and 116.2 degrees East longitude. This is 1020 kilometers west of Eluanbi. It is moving northwest at 26 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Wipha's center has a pressure of 975 hectopascals. The strongest wind near its center is 30 meters per second, and sudden strong gusts can reach 38 meters per second. The average radius for 7-level winds is 150 kilometers, and for 10-level winds, it is 50 kilometers.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote in his "Classroom for Leaking Heavenly Secrets" column for the Meteorological Application and Promotion Foundation. He said that the latest European weather models show that today, because of Wipha's outer clouds and the monsoon circulation, there will be occasional local rain and slightly higher temperatures in central and northern Taiwan. The eastern and southern parts will have heavier rain. People should be careful about "a lot of rain" for several days, which could cause damage.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong also said that the latest models show that tomorrow, because of the monsoon circulation, there will be a lot of moisture and unstable weather. There is a chance of scattered showers or thunderstorms everywhere, and the eastern part will still have heavy rain. On July 22 and 23, the weather will still be unstable within the monsoon circulation. The eastern part will have clear rain. In the mountains of western Taiwan, there will be local showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon, and they might spread to some flat areas.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong pointed out that the weather changes from July 24 will depend on the "tropical system" developing within the monsoon circulation and where it goes. We still need to watch it closely.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong explained that the latest "Path Probability Forecast Map" from the Weather Administration and the latest European ensemble model both show that today and tomorrow, Wipha will bring strong winds and heavy rain to Hong Kong, Macau, and the coast of Guangdong. Also, weather models from different countries show that from July 23, another "tropical system" will slowly develop within the "monsoon circulation." However, its path is very different in different models, which means there is a lot of "uncertainty."</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong said that the current European ensemble model, which ran 50 simulations, shows that the tropical system is most likely (about 70%) to turn north from the east side of Taiwan. The chance of it affecting northern Taiwan is about 40%. All countries' models are still being updated, so we should keep a close eye on it.</p>
