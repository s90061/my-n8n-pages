            <h1>Trump Says a Gaza Agreement is Close to Ending the Nearly Two-Year War</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that he believes an agreement will soon be reached to end the war in the Gaza Strip. He said this after talking with Israel and Arab countries recently.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, Trump told reporters at the White House, "I think we have an agreement."</p>
            <p>He also said, "It looks like we have an agreement for Gaza. I believe this agreement will free the hostages and end the war."</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Trump did not share more details.</p>
            <p>This week, leaders from different countries are meeting at the United Nations in New York. The United States has shared a 21-point plan for peace in the Middle East. The goal is to stop the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip, which has lasted for almost two years.</p>
            <p>According to Steve Witkoff, a special representative from the US, this plan was given to officials from Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan on September 23rd.</p>

            <h1>iPhone 17 Review: Experts Say "Air" Makes Thin Phones Even More Exciting</h1>
            <p>The new iPhone 17 series phones have been on sale for one week, but Apple's official website and stores still don't have enough of them. After reviewing all the new phones, tech expert Tim Ge said that the regular iPhone 17 is a great deal because it's affordable and has much better features. It's the most surprising new product this year. The iPhone 17 Pro is great for professional photography, and the iPhone Air makes us think differently about how thin a phone can be.</p>
            <p>If you go to Apple's website today to order an iPhone 17 or iPhone 17 Pro, it says you will have to wait 2 to 3 weeks for it to arrive. The larger iPhone 17 Pro Max takes even longer, 3 to 4 weeks. However, the iPhone Air is not selling as fast, and all colors are available now in stores.</p>
            <p>Tim Ge told CNA reporters that the regular iPhone 17 is very popular this year because it's cheap and has many improved features, making it a good value. It might even make some Android phone users switch to iPhone. But for most people buying a new phone, they would probably choose the high-end iPhone 17 Pro first, then the iPhone 17, and then the iPhone Air.</p>
            <p>Tim Ge said directly that the iPhone Air only works with eSIM (an electronic SIM card) and does not have a regular physical SIM card slot. This is one reason why some customers are hesitant to buy it, as many older people don't even know what an eSIM is. But he agrees that being thin and light is very important. The Air feels great to hold, and it's surprising how light it is the first time you pick it up. It also has a strong titanium frame, so it's not easy to break. It's also very easy to recognize when you carry it around.</p>
            <p>He thinks Apple will first see how people react to this new "Air" phone line. Then, they will decide what new features or parts to add to the next version.</p>
            <p>Talking about the iPhone 17 Pro, Tim Ge believes it's more like a professional camera this year. All three back cameras have been improved to 48 megapixels. You can change between different zoom levels, like having 8 small lenses with you. The improvements in both photos and videos are very clear.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 is 7.95 millimeters thick and weighs 177 grams. This is lighter than the iPhone 17 Pro, which is 8.75 millimeters thick and weighs 204 grams.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 Pro is better than the regular version because its main camera has a new telephoto lens. Its sensor is 56% bigger than the previous model, allowing it to take photos with 8 times optical zoom quality at a 200mm equivalent focal length.</p>

            <h1>Labor Group Says Foxconn's Zhengzhou Factory Overworks Staff to Make Phones; Foxconn Says Employee Safety is Important</h1>
            <p>A labor rights group has released a report. It says that workers at Foxconn's factory in Zhengzhou, China, still face very tough working conditions. These workers are assembling the newest iPhone 17 phones. They work long hours and their pay is sometimes delayed. Foxconn has responded, saying that the company puts the health and safety of its employees first.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times and Bloomberg News reported that China Labor Watch, a human rights group based in the US, investigated Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory for six months this year. They sent undercover workers to interview over 100 employees at the factory.</p>
            <p>China Labor Watch found that more than half of the approximately 200,000 workers hired at Foxconn's Zhengzhou factory during busy production times were "dispatch workers." However, Chinese law states that the number of such workers should not be more than 10% of a company's total staff.</p>
            <p>These dispatch workers do not get the same benefits as regular employees. The China Labor Watch report also said that some of the dispatch workers' pay is held back and delayed. This is to stop them from leaving during the busiest times of making Apple's iPhone series phones.</p>
            <p>Also, most dispatch workers earn between 25 and 28 Chinese Yuan per hour. But some get as little as 12 Chinese Yuan per hour, depending on their experience. Many employees said they often work extra hours to earn more money per hour.</p>
            <p>China Labor Watch stated that most workers work 60 to 75 hours per week. This is much more than China's legal maximum working hours and also more than Apple's own limit of 60 hours per week.</p>
            <p>China Labor Watch also claimed that the Zhengzhou factory unfairly treats certain ethnic groups and pregnant women when hiring them.</p>
            <p>Foxconn replied to this by saying that the company does not allow unfair treatment. They said they care most about their employees' health and safety. They welcome honest talks with everyone involved and are ready to share how they are making improvements and progress.</p>
            <p>Apple Inc. said that after they learned about China Labor Watch's findings, their team went to the factory and started an investigation right away. Apple "follows the highest standards for labor, human rights, environment, and ethics."</p>
