Wang Long-hsing, a leader from the Kaohsiung City Philharmonic Culture and Arts Foundation, gave a speech in Finland. He spoke at a meeting called "Taiwan Business Bridge." He said that when businesses support culture, it helps culture grow. He also said that culture makes a city and a country shine brightly. He invited everyone to visit Taiwan and feel its charm.

This year, the Festival X Mikkeli art festival in Finland chose "Taiwan" as one of its main themes. The Kaohsiung Chinese Orchestra was invited to perform four times. Besides the performances, there was also the "Taiwan Business Bridge" meeting. At this meeting, Mr. Wang Long-hsing and Ms. Jian Mei-ling, a vice-director from Kaohsiung City's culture office, gave talks about Taiwan and two professional music groups from Kaohsiung.

Wang Long-hsing, who is the head of Long-hsing Steel company, spoke for business leaders in Taiwan. He explained that he works in the steel industry. He said, "In 2010, in my hometown Kaohsiung, I had the chance to join the Kaohsiung City Philharmonic Culture and Arts Foundation. From that time, I started to learn about performing arts. In these years, taking part in art and culture events has brought me a lot of happiness and new ideas. My workers also enjoyed these cultural activities with me." Mr. Wang believes that culture and art are very important for how cities and societies grow. He said, "Cities that are doing well often have many art museums, libraries, theaters, and book stores. Taiwan is like this." He also helps by giving money to cultural projects. He feels good when he sees that people in his city, Kaohsiung, can enjoy these music shows. He is also a member of the General Association of Chinese Culture. He is happy to help connect culture and businesses. He thinks businesses can help culture get better, and culture can make a city and a country shine. At the end, he talked about Taiwan. He said it is about 400 kilometers from north to south, and you can travel quickly by high-speed train or highway. He also said Taiwan has beautiful nature, delicious food, and friendly people. He welcomed everyone to Taiwan.

Ms. Jian Mei-ling said in her speech that art museums give color to a city, and orchestras give it sound. She proudly said that Kaohsiung has two full-time professional music groups: the Kaohsiung City Symphony Orchestra and the Kaohsiung City Chinese Orchestra. She called them the "soul of the city" and its "cultural powerhouses." She also mentioned that Kaohsiung is building more cultural places, like the Weiwuying National Arts and Culture Center. These places help Kaohsiung become a major spot for international art events. She believes music is not just a show, but a public service that helps people share culture and talk to each other. Ms. Jian said that the Kaohsiung Chinese Orchestra's performance at the Mikkeli art festival shows the world Taiwan's music and ideas. It also shows Kaohsiung's strength in culture. She said Kaohsiung will keep working with other countries on culture and art, using music to build connections between the city and the world.

**Tea Shop in Taichung Attacked Twice with Paint; Police Arrest 3 Suspects**

A tea shop in Fengyuan District, Taichung, was attacked with paint two times in a row. The police received a report on June 29. Within six hours, they found and asked three people who might be involved to come for questioning. The police found out that these three people might have had a money problem with the tea shop owner. The police then sent the three people to court for damaging property.

The three people involved are a 21-year-old man named Yang, a 31-year-old man named Li, and a 33-year-old man named Lin. They told the police that they had a disagreement with the tea shop owner, Mr. Hsieh, possibly about money. That's why they threw paint. The tea shop owner did not call the police at first. The police found him by talking to his landlord.

Later, the three people went back to the tea shop. They brought a turtle and a black dog, made a video, and said angry things to Mr. Hsieh. They even took pictures in front of the Fengyuan Police Station. Mr. Hsieh then wrote online that the police had caught the people who threw paint, but not the person who told them to do it, a man named Chen. The Fengyuan Police Division said today that other people linked to this case have also done other bad things in the city. A special police team has been set up to work with the Taichung District Prosecutors Office to find and arrest these people. The police also said they will not let troublemakers cause problems in their area. They will act strongly against anyone who breaks the law. For the pictures taken in front of the police station, the police said it is not against the law, so they cannot do anything about it for now. The first investigation did not show that Mr. Chen was involved in the paint throwing, but the police will keep looking into it to find out more.

**UN Official Called "Undesirable" by Venezuela for Human Rights Criticism**

The government in Venezuela has said that Volker Turk, a United Nations official for human rights, is "not welcome." This happened after Mr. Turk's office said that human rights in Venezuela are getting worse.

Last week, Mr. Turk spoke against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. He said that over the past year, people have been unfairly held in prison, their legal rights have been ignored, and some have even disappeared. Venezuela's top lawyer's office called Mr. Turk's report "a challenge."

Jorge Rodriguez, who leads Venezuela's National Assembly and is a friend of President Maduro, asked his government to stop talking to Mr. Turk's office. Before the vote, Mr. Rodriguez said that Mr. Turk could come back later, "when he is not so annoying" and "at least acts politely and with good sense." The United Nations Human Rights Office has been present in Venezuela since 2019. Its reports, which often criticize the government, often cause problems with President Maduro's government.
