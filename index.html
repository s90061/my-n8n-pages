            <h1>Another Boxer, Imane Khelif, Will Not Join Boxing World Championship After Lin Yu-ting</h1>
            <p>The head of the World Boxing Federation (WB), Mr. Van der Vorst, said today that an Algerian female boxer named Imane Khelif will not be in the World Championship. This is because she did not sign up. The WB also asks all boxers to have a gender test before they can join. Imane Khelif can complain about this rule.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that less than a year ago, Imane Khelif and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting won gold medals at the Paris Olympics. There were questions about their gender at that time. In May, the WB made a new rule. It said all boxers must have a gender test before they can join WB boxing events. The WB will also be in charge of boxing at the 2028 Olympic Games.</p>
            <p>Imane Khelif wants the WB to change its rule. So, she has complained to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. This court is the highest place for sports problems in the world.</p>
            <p>Mr. Van der Vorst said today, "She has the right to do that. But we want to say that we made the gender test rule for important reasons. We want to make sure the matches are safe and fair for everyone."</p>
            <p>The WB World Championship will start tomorrow in Liverpool, UK. Reporters asked Mr. Van der Vorst if Imane Khelif failed the gender test. He answered, "It's too early to say. She is not even joining the competition here in Liverpool for her boxing group."</p>
            <p>The Algerian Boxing Federation did not answer Reuters' questions right away.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the WB said that Lin Yu-ting from Taiwan will also not be in the Liverpool World Championship. Mr. Van der Vorst said today, "I know her country's boxing group also did not put her name on the list to join."</p>

            <h1>Putin Says He Is Ready to Talk If Zelenskyy Comes to Moscow</h1>
            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin said today that he is ready to talk with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This would happen if Zelenskyy comes to Moscow. But Putin also said that it is not clear yet if such a meeting would be useful.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy has often tried to meet Putin. He wants to talk about how they can agree to end the fighting. Former US President Donald Trump has also been working to find a peace plan. He said he hopes the two leaders can talk.</p>
            <p>Putin spoke in an interview after visiting China. He said he is always open to meeting Zelenskyy. But he repeated what the Kremlin always says: these talks must be well-prepared before they happen. Also, the talks must lead to real results.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "About meeting Zelenskyy, I have never said no to such talks. But will it be useful? We will see."</p>
            <p>Putin also said that for things to get better, Ukraine must first end its special law (martial law). It must also hold elections and let people vote on who should own certain lands.</p>
            <p>In 2022, Moscow said it had taken over four areas in southeastern Ukraine. But Kyiv (Ukraine's capital) and most Western countries said this was wrong. They believe Russia started a war to take land illegally, like in old times.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Can Start a Special Fund to Deal with US Tariffs, Says Wei Chi-lin</h1>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin, who is the head of Grand Bills Finance, said today that the time of free trade around the world is over after the pandemic. The US has recently put new taxes (tariffs) on goods. Taiwan can start a special fund, called a sovereign wealth fund, to put money into American businesses. This can help reduce problems for Taiwan's old industries and local service businesses.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin said today that the government is working hard on ten new big projects for AI. They want all kinds of businesses to use AI (Artificial Intelligence). After the pandemic, trade changed a lot. The time when countries could trade freely has ended. This greatly affects Taiwan, which grows its economy by selling many things to other countries. However, Taiwan has good workers. It imports products, adds more value to them, and then sells them. Because of this, Taiwan has done very well.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin said that Taiwan has earned more from trade than it has spent for many years. Taiwan has about 600 billion US dollars in foreign money saved. This is a very large amount for the size of Taiwan's economy. Recently, many businesses are having problems because of the new US taxes on goods. He suggested that Taiwan could create a sovereign wealth fund to invest in the US. This money would not only be for things like factories or machines. It could also be used to buy company shares or bonds to help.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin said that Taiwan's sovereign fund could start with 100 to 200 billion US dollars. The National Development Council would watch over it. At first, some of the money could be managed by foreign experts. This would help Taiwan learn how to invest well. If Taiwan uses this fund to invest in the US carefully, it can also become closer with the US.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin is also the Vice Chairman of the Taiwan AI Academy Foundation. He said that the government announced 2017 as the "first year of AI" for Taiwan. At that time, they believed in the future of AI and the company Nvidia. So, they decided to create a public platform to train more AI experts in Taiwan. Now, 13,000 students have taken courses there.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-shun, the head of the Taiwan AI Academy, said that the academy will hold the Taiwan AI Annual Conference this year. It will be from September 9th to September 10th at the Academia Sinica's building for humanities. About 1,500 people are expected to come.</p>
