            <h1>Physical Therapy Association's 50th Anniversary: President Lai "Returns Home" and Asks for 3 Tasks</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Physical Therapy Association held its 50th-anniversary party today. President Lai Ching-te attended, calling it "returning home." He asked the association to help with three tasks:</p>
            <p>1. Shorten the unhealthy period of Taiwanese people's lives by 10%.</p>
            <p>2. Participate in long-term care services.</p>
            <p>3. Join the newly established Sports Department.</p>
            <p>The 50th-anniversary event started today. More than 300 experts, scholars, and medical workers from the UK, Japan, Korea, and Hong Kong attended. They discussed how physical therapy is changing and its future.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, who studied rehabilitation medicine at National Taiwan University, also came to the party. He first thanked Wang Zi-juan, the head of the Physical Therapy Association, for her hard work in changing the physical therapist law. He said she worked like "Ah-Hsin," treating the Legislative Yuan (Taiwan's parliament) like her own home. Without her visiting different political groups, the law would not have gotten support from all parties. It would have been hard for only the Democratic Progressive Party to pass it.</p>
            <p>President Lai said he used to be a physical therapist. He often thinks, "Once a physical therapist, always a physical therapist." He believes he has a duty to make the laws better so physical therapists can help people more and grow. This is a shared goal.</p>
            <p>The President said that even after the law change, there are still a few things that need everyone's help. First, after he became president, he started the "Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee" in the Presidential Office. He hopes this will make Taiwanese people healthier, make the country stronger, and make the world welcome Taiwan.</p>
            <p>President Lai pointed out that people in Taiwan live for 80.77 years on average. However, they live with bad health for more than 8 years of that time. This means 10% of their lives are unhealthy, perhaps lying in bed, using a wheelchair, or needing help with daily life. The Healthy Taiwan Promotion Committee wants to change this. It needs help from all areas, especially physical therapists, to reach this goal together.</p>
            <p>President Lai said the second task is that Taiwan is becoming a super-aged society. It needs physical therapists and occupational therapists more to help older people stay healthy. He hopes everyone will strongly support the government's long-term care services.</p>
            <p>Finally, he talked about the Sports Department, which will officially start on September 9th. It needs many people and different skills, and physical therapists are very important. Recently, Taiwan has done very well in sports competitions. Every time he welcomes heroes who win honor for the country at the Presidential Office, he sees physical therapists in the support team. This shows how much they help athletes. When the Sports Department starts, it will improve sports for everyone, support competitive sports, and grow the sports industry. Physical therapists are needed for all these things.</p>
            <p>Zheng Su-fang, the Vice President of the World Confederation for Physical Therapy, said in her speech that President Lai is an excellent graduate of a physical therapy program, which is the first time this has happened in the world. In his political life, he has always fully supported the growth of the physical therapy profession in many ways. This includes the recent change to the physical therapist law, which allows people without a specific disease to see a physical therapist directly. The President protects the country, and she asked everyone to continue to be his best support.</p>

            <h1>Yi Huiman Investigated; China Securities Regulatory Commission Party Committee Supports Investigation and Strong Anti-Corruption Efforts</h1>
            <p>After the Communist Party of China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection announced today that former China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Chairman Yi Huiman is under investigation, the CSRC Party Committee quickly held a meeting. They said they strongly support the decision by the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the National Supervisory Commission to investigate Yi Huiman. They also said the CSRC Party Committee must "learn deeply from the lessons, use this case as a warning, and always be alert" to work hard to remove the causes and conditions for corruption.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that Wu Qing, the Secretary and Chairman of the CSRC Party Committee, led this meeting. During the meeting, they shared the decision from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission to investigate Yi Huiman for "serious violations of discipline and law." Everyone at the meeting agreed to strongly support this decision by the Party Central Committee, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and the National Supervisory Commission.</p>
            <p>The meeting mentioned that the decision by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the National Supervisory Commission to investigate Yi Huiman clearly shows the "Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core" is always committed to "governing the Party strictly in all respects." It also clearly shows that the Communist Party of China always fights corruption "with no forbidden zones, full coverage, and zero tolerance." This sends a strong message that they will "never stop, never step back, and carry the anti-corruption struggle to the end."</p>
            <p>The meeting said that the CSRC Party Committee must "learn deeply from the lessons, use this case as a warning, and always be alert." They need to improve their "political judgment, political understanding, and political execution ability." They must also willingly accept supervision from the Discipline Inspection and Supervision Group stationed at the CSRC and other groups. They must keep a strong resolve and a high-pressure approach, and firmly win the "tough, long-term, and overall anti-corruption battle."</p>
            <p>The meeting stated that leading officials must set an example and keep improving their "Party spirit and conduct." They need to establish a "correct view of power" and strongly focus on improving their work style. They must fully improve the ways to supervise and limit public power, deepen investigations and punishments for both corruption and bad work style at the same time, and create good ways and methods to prevent new and hidden forms of corruption. They must work hard to remove the causes and conditions for corruption to grow.</p>
            <p>The meeting stressed that they must continue to strengthen and expand the results of the education on deeply following the spirit of the "Eight Provisions of the Central Committee." They must make regular and lasting improvements based on central inspections. They must truly keep the "strict tone, strict measures, and strict atmosphere" for a long time.</p>
            <p>The meeting asked them to firmly follow the important decisions made by the Party Central Committee for the capital market. They must strengthen supervision according to the law, effectively prevent risks, and strongly promote "high-quality development" of the capital market. This will better help the economy continue to grow and serve the larger goal of "Chinese modernization."</p>

            <h1>AKIRA Misses Tainan Food the Most, Proudly Says His Own Danzai Noodles are Super Delicious</h1>
            <p>Lin Chi-ling's husband, Japanese star AKIRA, will perform with his junior groups at the "Trendy Taipei" event tomorrow. Today, he said that he spent Qixi Festival (Chinese Valentine's Day) with his wife and son at a local festival. He also mentioned that his favorite Taiwanese food he misses the most is Tainan Danzai noodles. He laughed and said the Danzai noodles he cooks are "top-class" delicious.</p>
            <p>AKIRA arrived at Songshan Airport at noon today. One hundred fans were there to welcome him. Some people held up signs to greet him.</p>
            <p>AKIRA said in an interview this afternoon that he spent this year's Qixi Festival with his wife Lin Chi-ling and their son at a festival near their home. He also cares a lot about spending time with his family. He said, "Instead of making things purely by hand, I like to add some meaningful decorations when preparing gifts for others."</p>
            <p>AKIRA travels between Taiwan and Japan. He said he has been missing Tainan snacks recently. He can also taste that the flavors in Tainan are different from Taipei. What he misses most is Danzai noodles. He said, "I also cook them at home. The Danzai noodles I cook are probably top-class."</p>
            <p>In addition, the movie "Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Swordsmith Village Arc Part 1: Akaza Strikes Again" is now showing. Netizens said that with parents like AKIRA and Lin Chi-ling, they could have a child like the main character Tanjiro. AKIRA laughed and said that this put a bit of pressure on him because Tanjiro is a very famous character from a popular work. He felt a little shy that people said this. He added, "A child is a child. I won't limit him, but when he grows up, I will tell him about this, 'You might become like this when you grow up.'"</p>
            <p>AKIRA will lead his junior groups, PSYCHIC FEVER and BALLISTIK BOYZ, to perform together at the "Trendy Taipei" event at Taipei Arena tomorrow night.</p>
