Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on jobs around the world. Experts say that AI will not just take over some tasks, but it will also create many new types of jobs. This means that the way we work is changing a lot.
Many jobs will require new skills as AI tools become more common. For example, people might need to learn how to work with AI, manage AI systems, or develop new AI programs. This means that lifelong learning will be very important for workers in the future.
While some jobs might disappear because AI can do them automatically, other jobs will change. People will focus more on tasks that need human creativity, critical thinking, and social skills. Governments and businesses are now thinking about how to prepare workers for these changes so everyone can succeed in the new job market.

**New Plant-Based Plastic Offers Hope for a Cleaner Earth**

Scientists have made an exciting new discovery that could help the environment. They have developed a new kind of plastic that breaks down naturally, and it's made from plants. This plant-based material offers a more sustainable choice compared to traditional plastics, which stay in the environment for hundreds of years.
This new plastic is made from waste materials from plants, like leftover parts from corn or sugar cane. It is designed to decompose safely, returning to the earth without causing pollution. This is good news because plastic pollution is a serious problem for our oceans and land.
This innovation could change how many products are packaged and manufactured. Businesses are interested in using this new material for things like food containers, shopping bags, and other everyday items. It's a big step towards a future where we use less harmful plastics and protect our planet.

**Popular Cities Struggle with Too Many Tourists**

Many famous cities around the world are facing problems because too many tourists are visiting them. Places like Venice in Italy and Amsterdam in the Netherlands are seeing their local life change as a result of "overtourism."
This high number of visitors puts a lot of pressure on the city's services, like transport and housing. For local people, it can mean that rent becomes very expensive, making it hard for them to live in their own city. Also, the large crowds can change the real local culture and daily life, as shops and restaurants start to cater only to tourists.
To deal with this, some cities are starting new rules. These might include limiting the number of tourists, increasing visitor fees, or encouraging people to visit during less busy times. The goal is to find a balance where tourists can still enjoy these beautiful places, but local communities can also maintain their quality of life and culture.`;
