Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, announced today that Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which checks nuclear activities, will work together in a "new way." This comes after Iran recently passed a law to stop working with the IAEA.

Araghchi said that cooperation has not stopped but will change. He added that Iran will look at requests to visit its nuclear sites one by one, always thinking about safety. The minister also told diplomats that Iran is still ready to use diplomacy to build trust in its nuclear plans. However, he said that other countries must also truly want diplomacy and not hide other goals.

A fire started at a metal factory in Xindian District, New Taipei City, on Friday evening. The New Taipei City Fire Department quickly arrived to put out the fire. They got the fire under control in about 30 minutes, and no one was hurt or trapped inside.
