            <h1>Fed Official Calls for Rate Cuts to Prevent Worse Job Market</h1>
            <p>Michelle Bowman, who is a top official at the US central bank (the Fed), said today that the newest report on US jobs shows the job market is "weak." Because of this, she thinks the Fed should cut interest rates three times this year. This is to stop the job market from getting even weaker.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Bowman, who handles rules for the Fed, spoke at a meeting in Colorado. In her speech, she asked for "strong actions" to lower the main lending rate.</p>
            <p>She said that lowering rates would "help stop the job market from getting worse unnecessarily." She also said that if the job market gets bad, cutting rates now would mean the Fed would not need to make bigger cuts later.</p>
            <p>Bowman also said that prices might have gone up because of President Trump's tariffs this year. She thinks this might only be a "one-time effect."</p>
            <p>She expects that after the tariffs' effect goes away, prices will go back down to the Fed's goal of 2%.</p>
            <p>She said in her speech: "We should not only focus on the higher inflation numbers. We also need to remove some limits in our policies to stop the job market from getting weaker."</p>

            <h1>Trump Family Business Plans to Get $1.5 Billion for New Public Company</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported on August 8 that the Trump family's cryptocurrency business, called "World Liberty Financial," plans to raise $1.5 billion. They want to create a public company that will hold their cryptocurrency, $WLFI.</p>
            <p>The report, quoting people who know about the plans, said that the deal's details are not finished yet. However, the company has talked to big investors in cryptocurrency and technology about this new joint business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that World Liberty Financial is a "decentralized platform." Their website says that President Trump and his son helped start this platform. Since it began, the platform has made $500 million for the Trump family.</p>
            <p>The $WLFI cryptocurrency has not yet been called a "security" by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. This means it does not have to follow the same strict rules as investments like stocks.</p>

            <h1>Putin's Envoy: Some Countries Don't Want Russia-Ukraine Peace, Will Try to Harm Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>After US President Trump announced yesterday that he will meet Russian President Putin on the 15th, Putin's special envoy for international economy and investment, Kirill Dmitriev, said today that some countries will make "great efforts" to stop this meeting from going well.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had said before that Russia and Ukraine are close to agreeing on a ceasefire. This might end the conflict that has lasted three and a half years. The details of this agreement are not public yet. However, Ukraine might have to give up a large part of its land, and many European countries do not like this idea.</p>
            <p>Dmitriev said today that some countries want the war to continue. He wrote on his Telegram social media account: "Some countries that want the conflict to continue will surely try very hard to harm the planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump."</p>
            <p>Dmitriev also said that these efforts mean "provocations and spreading false information." But he did not say which countries or what kind of "provocations" he meant.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin had already confirmed that this meeting between the Russian and American leaders will happen. Yuri Ushakov, a helper of Putin, said that the two leaders will "focus on discussing ways to find a lasting peaceful solution for the crisis in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said: "This will clearly be a difficult process, but we will work on it with strong effort and energy."</p>
