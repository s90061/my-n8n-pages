            <h1>Zelenskyy: Talking with Allies about Security Details</h1>
            <p>Ukraine and its Western friends have been discussing how the war with Russia might end. However, Ukrainian people do not feel very positive about the future. Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said that after meeting with Washington, the situation is better than it was one or two weeks ago. He is now talking closely with many countries about specific security plans. They are discussing what exact help countries can give with sea, land, and air forces, information sharing, and money.</p>
            <p>The leader of NATO, Mark Rutte, visited Kyiv today. He held a joint press conference with President Zelenskyy after their meeting. They talked about security issues and how they will work together in the future.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said in the meeting that they are still discussing with allied countries what real support they can provide. This includes sending military forces by sea, land, and air, working together on intelligence, financial help, and weapons. He said that security is not only about international forces but also about making Ukraine's own defense stronger.</p>
            <p>He explained that to get security, countries first need to show they want to help. Second, weapons need to be made and sent quickly. It is also important that Ukraine gets the equipment it needs first. Finally, there needs to be money and financial support. He said that a group called the "Coalition of the Willing" has formed, including Japan and Canada. There are now 30 member countries, but how much each country will help is still being discussed.</p>
            <p>Regarding Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov's recent statement that Russia should also be part of Ukraine's security system, Zelenskyy said he found it hard to understand. He asked, "What guarantees does the attacker need?"</p>
            <p>About a possible meeting with Russian President Putin, Zelenskyy repeated that Ukraine does not have any conditions. He is willing to have talks with two or three parties. But for now, it seems Russia does not want to end the war and is trying to avoid direct talks with Ukraine.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that Russia's current plan is to avoid sanctions from US President Trump. Russia is also using diplomacy to reduce pressure from the US and its allies. Ukraine will depend on its allies to push for stronger sanctions.</p>
            <p>"If Russia does not agree to end the war through diplomacy, if they do not want to end the war, then we will rely on our allies' strong sanction plans. We believe we must use all ways to make sure Russia no longer avoids meetings," Zelenskyy said.</p>
            <p>Rutte added that NATO is working closely with Europe, the US, and Ukraine in two main ways. First, they are making Ukraine's military stronger after the war or a long ceasefire. Second, they are setting up a system for security guarantees from Europe and the US.</p>
            <p>Rutte admitted that past agreements like the "Minsk agreements" and the "Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances" did not stop Russia from attacking. So, this new security plan will be different. He stressed that at the summit in Washington D.C., it was confirmed that Ukraine's journey to join NATO "cannot be reversed."</p>
            <p>He noted that NATO is already working with Ukraine in several ways. This includes joint training in Poland, opening an office in Kyiv, and adding Ukraine's needs to the "Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL)." Within one month, Ukraine received 1.5 billion US dollars (about 45.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in military aid.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Ukraine, Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom signed the "Budapest Memorandum." Ukraine agreed to give up its nuclear weapons and join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In return, Russia had to respect Ukraine's power and borders. However, this agreement and the "Minsk Agreement," signed in 2014 during the conflict in eastern Ukraine, only led to ceasefires that were often broken. Neither agreement stopped Russia's full invasion of Ukraine in 2022.</p>

            <h1>Interest Rate Cut Expected, Oil Prices Go Up</h1>
            <p>New York, August 22 (Reuters) â€“ Oil prices went up today. This happened because the head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, suggested he might be open to cutting interest rates in September. This positive news was stronger than worries about a limited oil supply.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for October delivery increased by 0.2%. It closed at 63.66 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price of Brent crude oil for October delivery increased by 0.1%. It closed at 67.73 US dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Official: National Guard in Washington D.C. Will Soon Carry Weapons</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 22 (Reuters) â€“ President Trump recently ordered the National Guard to be sent to Washington D.C. to fight crime. Today, defense officials said that the National Guard members in the capital, Washington D.C., will soon carry military weapons.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that before sending troops to Washington's streets last week, Trump called the city a "crime-ridden rat's nest." He also said that Chicago and New York would face similar situations in the future. Both Chicago and New York are currently led by Democratic politicians.</p>
            <p>A defense official, who did not want to be named, said: "Following the Secretary of Defense's instructions, members of the Joint Task Force-DC (JTF-DC) will soon carry their service weapons while on duty." This official was talking about the task force whose job is to lower crime rates in the capital, Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>The US Army had previously stated when the troops arrived that "weapons can be provided if needed, but these weapons will be kept in the armory."</p>
            <p>Currently, there are over 1900 National Guard members in Washington D.C. They come from the D.C. area itself, as well as from Republican-led states like West Virginia, South Carolina, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee.</p>
            <p>Trump said today that Chicago and New York would also have similar arrangements. He told reporters at the White House, "We will make our cities very, very safe." He added, "Chicago will be our next target, and then we will help New York."</p>
