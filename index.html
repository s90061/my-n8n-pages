            <h1>People Against Communism Abroad Announce Plan to Overthrow Chinese Rule</h1>
            <p>People living outside China who are against communism have joined together. They have announced a "Declaration of All People's Resistance Movement" in big cities like New York, Washington D.C., London, and Tokyo. They hope to encourage people inside China to unite and protest. Their goal is to remove the current government and help China become a democracy. The declaration also strongly criticizes the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for threatening Taiwan with force.</p>
            <p>The "Declaration of All People's Resistance Movement" events were organized by China Action and the Citizens' Resistance Association. They started yesterday and will last for two days in cities such as New York, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, Berlin, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo.</p>
            <p>In Washington D.C., the event took place this morning in front of the U.S. Capitol building. About 10 Chinese people living in the Washington D.C. area held banners. The banners said things like "Time's up, roll the ball" and "Stop CCP, Free China." They also shouted slogans like "Communist Party, get out!" and "Xi Jinping, step down!" to share their message.</p>
            <p>Yang Zili, who led the event in Washington D.C., said he hopes this event will make people in China unite and "rise up to fight." He believes this will help China become a democracy in the end.</p>
            <p>The people at the event also read the declaration. It said that now is the time to act to end the current rule and start a new time of freedom and democracy. They called for a clear plan: "Within three years, start a nationwide resistance movement" to reach this goal. They strongly believe that only by removing the current government and making big changes can China solve its serious economic and social problems.</p>
            <p>The declaration clearly stated that when a government completely fails to protect its people's rights, "the people have the right and must change or get rid of it."</p>
            <p>The declaration also listed many problems with the Chinese government. These include harshly treating Tibetans and Uyghurs, taking away freedom and law in Hong Kong, and threatening and bullying Taiwan with military force.</p>
            <p>Yang Zili explained that the declaration itself is against the CCP using force to unite Taiwan. He said, "We care about the people of Taiwan being able to have freedom and live in a free system... We don't want them to lose their freedom and rights like the people of Hong Kong."</p>
            <p>After this series of events in cities around the world, there will be more activities in the future. Yang Zili said this is a long-term effort to spread the message. More people need to agree with their goals over time.</p>
            <p>He said that the movement for democracy moves forward step by step. "We hope to connect with the protests for democracy and rights inside China. This way, we can eventually help the country become democratic and remove the dictator."</p>

            <h1>Reuters: US State Department Spokesperson Nominated as Deputy UN Ambassador by Trump</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. â€“ US President Trump announced today on social media that he has chosen Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokesperson, to be the next US Deputy Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Bruce has been the State Department spokesperson since Trump became president in January this year.</p>
            <p>Trump announced Bruce's nomination on social media. He praised Bruce for doing a "great job" as the State Department spokesperson.</p>

            <h1>Six Soldiers Die in Explosion at Hezbollah Weapons Storage in Lebanon</h1>
            <p>Beirut â€“ The Lebanese army said that six soldiers died today when a weapons storage area exploded near the border with Israel. A source from the army said that the soldiers were taking away ammunition from a Hezbollah base at the time.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Lebanese army has been in the southern part of the country. This is because of a ceasefire agreement last year that ended the war between Israel and Hezbollah. The army has also been destroying military buildings belonging to Hezbollah, a group supported by Iran, in that area.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, the Lebanese government decided to disarm Hezbollah. They asked the army to make a plan to finish this by the end of the year. However, Hezbollah said it will ignore this decision from the government, which was made under strong pressure from the United States. Iran, a country that supports Hezbollah, also said today that it is against this action.</p>
            <p>The Lebanese army released a statement. It said that six soldiers died while a military unit was checking and taking apart a weapons storage area. This area was in Wadi Zibqin, in the Tyre district, near the Israeli border.</p>
            <p>A military source, who wished to remain anonymous, told AFP that the explosion happened "inside a Hezbollah military building." The source added that the soldiers were "clearing ammunition and unexploded bombs left over from the recent war" when it happened.</p>
