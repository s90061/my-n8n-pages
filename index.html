            <h1>Hualien County Councilor's Suggestion to Give NT$50,000 to Everyone Sparks Discussion; Hu Ren-shun Says It Was Irony.</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Chang Chi, Hualien County, July 31st) Hualien Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) County Councilor Hu Ren-shun made a suggestion in February. He suggested giving New Taiwan Dollars (NT$) 50,000 to all county residents. This idea has caused a lot of discussion recently. Today, Hu Ren-shun explained that he made the suggestion to joke about Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Fu Kun-chi's idea to give everyone NT$10,000. So, Hu rewrote Fu Kun-chi's Facebook post to make his proposal.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Hualien County Government replied to the NT$50,000 proposal. They said that the central government has not yet met with local governments about changing the "Financial Expenditure Law." Because of this, they don't know where the money will come from. Also, any plan for spending money must have a clear order of importance. It also needs to follow budget rules and legal basis. The county councilor's suggestion cannot be discussed yet.</p>
            <p>Hu Ren-shun wrote on Facebook that the main reason for his suggestion was that Fu Kun-chi pushed through the NT$10,000 payment in January. This caused problems for how the government manages money and for the country's overall growth. At that time, Hu wanted to make Fu's wife (Hualien County Magistrate Hsu Chen-wei) and all the people understand how silly this idea was. So, he used irony to remind everyone. He never thought that a county council proposal, which usually no one reads, would become very popular six months later.</p>
            <p>Hu Ren-shun said, "The proposal does look strange. Normally, proposals are not written this way." He explained that his assistant rewrote two of Fu Kun-chi's Facebook posts about giving NT$10,000. This was done to share Fu Kun-chi's ideas.</p>
            <p>Hu Ren-shun stated that this proposal is a "suggestion" type. To give NT$50,000 to everyone, one condition must be met: the anti-recall effort must succeed. This would give Hualien an extra NT$16.1 billion each year. Also, Hsu Chen-wei must be willing to support giving NT$50,000 to everyone.</p>
            <p>Hu Ren-shun mentioned that now the goal of stopping the recall has been achieved. Will Hsu Chen-wei help all Hualien people? Last year, the Hualien County Government gave out NT$3,000 in "stimulus vouchers." Xiulin Township and Shoufeng Township also have examples of giving cash to people before.</p>
            <p>Hu Ren-shun said that now Fu Kun-chi and Hsu Chen-wei only say they will use the NT$16.1 billion for subsidies, not for construction projects. If the money is given to the public, people can decide to use it for false teeth, school fees, or other things. All shops in Hualien would benefit. (Editor: Lin Shu-hui) 1140731</p>

            <h1>U12 Baseball World Cup: Japan's Sotoyama Taiki Hits Home Runs from Both Sides; Says He Decides Based on Pitcher's Ball Type.</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Tainan, July 31st) In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Japan's player Sotoyama Taiki can hit from both the left and right sides. So far in the competition, he has hit one home run as a right-handed batter and one as a left-handed batter. Today, in the Super Round against South Korea, he kept changing between batting left and right. Even his head coach said he wanted to know why. Sotoyama Taiki explained that he decides based on the game's rhythm and the type of pitches the pitcher throws.</p>
            <p>Sotoyama Taiki, a player for Japan in the U12 Baseball World Cup, has hit a total of 2 home runs so far. In the first round against Taiwan, he hit a home run as a right-handed batter. Yesterday, against Mexico, he hit a home run as a left-handed batter. Today, in the Super Round against South Korea, he changed between batting left and right in every turn at bat. He got one hit in three tries today.</p>
            <p>When the Japanese team's head coach, Okubo Hideaki, was asked why Sotoyama Taiki kept changing how he batted, he smiled and answered, "I really want to know too." He thought maybe the player was just doing what felt right to him. He didn't know if it was good or bad, so he just let the player do what he wanted.</p>
            <p>Sotoyama Taiki explained that he was struck out in his first turn at bat. He felt he couldn't find the right rhythm and missed high pitches. In his second turn, the pitcher threw high balls, so he changed to left-handed batting. In his third turn, he faced a right-handed pitcher and felt he could control the rhythm well, so he changed back to right-handed batting. He said he chooses whether to bat right or left based on whether the pitcher's balls are high or low, and on how he feels about the rhythm.</p>
            <p>Sotoyama Taiki shared that he first started as a right-handed batter. But his father also batted from both sides. Plus, Sotoyama himself is fast. If he practiced batting left-handed, he could get more hits inside the infield. That's why he started practicing batting from both sides. He once took part in a 400-meter track relay race as the last runner and got third place in the country. (Editor: Li Hsi-chang) 1140731</p>
