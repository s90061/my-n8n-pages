Since 2024, Chinese electric car brands like BYD and Great Wall have become a threat to Brazil's car industry. These Chinese electric and hybrid cars are affordable and use modern technology. This makes it difficult for local car makers to compete.

Chinese cars are increasing their presence in Brazil because more electric and hybrid cars are being imported. Also, Chinese companies like BYD and Great Wall are building factories in Brazil to start making electric cars in 2025.

Chinese car companies also sell their cars at very competitive prices, often lower than other cars on the market. This attracts many buyers and worries Brazilian car companies.

Chinese car makers invest in new technology, offering cars with features that compete well with cars from older, more established brands. The Chinese government also helps its electric car industry with money and policies, making Chinese cars even more competitive.

Brazil's car industry is looking for ways to deal with this competition. They are trying to work with foreign companies and develop their own technology. They are also asking their government to protect the local market, for example, by increasing taxes on imported cars and encouraging local companies to invest in making electric and hybrid cars.

According to data from Brazil, in the first half of 2024, China sold 62,600 electric cars to Brazil. This means Chinese cars made up 91.4% of all electric cars imported by Brazil. So far in 2025, a total of 111,000 electric cars have been sold, and Chinese brands still sell a lot.

The growing number of Chinese electric cars is causing strong competition in the Brazilian car market. The future of Brazil's car industry will depend on how well car makers can change and offer good products that consumers want. They can do this by protecting their market, investing in technology, or finding strategic partners.

**Trump Pressures Illegal Immigrants: 1% Tax on Non-Bank Remittances to Other Countries**

US President Trump signed a new law today called the "Great American Act." This new rule says that people, including US citizens, foreigners with temporary work visas, and students, who send money from the US to other countries using methods other than banks will pay a 1% "remittance tax." This is the first time the US has put a tax on money sent by foreign workers, and it is expected to affect economies in Latin America.

Starting January 1, 2026, if you send money from the US to another country using cash, money orders, bank checks, or other non-bank ways, you will have to pay a 1% tax. For example, if you send $10,000, you will pay an extra $100 tax, in addition to any bank fees.

This new rule applies to both US citizens and non-citizens, including green card holders, temporary workers, students, and others. However, if you send money from a US bank account or use a US bank card or credit card, you will not have to pay this tax.

This new rule for millions of legal and illegal foreign workers in the US was first suggested to be a 5% tax on foreign remittances by the House of Representatives, then lowered to 3.5%. The Senate then reduced it to 1% and made it apply to US citizens too. The House approved it on July 3. The money collected from this tax will be used for border security and managing immigration.

There are about 32 million people born in other countries working in the US, making up a significant part of the workforce. About half of them are from Latin America. Only around one million people work in the US with regular work visas.

The US is a major country for sending money abroad. Many workers from Central and South America work in the US and send money back home to support their families. If they do not have legal work documents, it is often difficult for them to send money through regular banks, so they use other or unofficial ways. Many people from India, China, and the Philippines also work in the US and send their earnings to their home countries.

The Trump government's new rule about money sent abroad by foreign immigrants and temporary workers has caused a lot of concern in Central and South American countries. It is expected that less money will be sent, and unofficial money transfer methods might become more common. This could even affect the economies of many countries.

**"Great American Act" Stricter on Student Loans; Less Profitable Majors Harder to Get Loans**

US President Trump signed the "Great American Act" today, which will have a big impact on American society. In higher education, students studying subjects like arts and humanities, who often earn less after graduation, will find it harder to get student loans because they may not be able to pay them back easily. Also, large universities' donation funds will have to pay an 8% tax on their investment income. This could lead to fewer scholarships and affect the quality of professors.

The Great American Act directly changes how Americans pay taxes and also affects many different industries, including higher education.

The law states that graduate students studying for a master's degree can borrow up to $100,000 from the government. For doctoral, medical, and other professional degrees, the limit is $200,000. Although the law does not explicitly say so, how well a student can pay back the loan after graduation will be an important factor in deciding if they get the loan. The cost of tuition and how much money they can earn from their future job are key to getting a loan.

Many people in the US have difficulty paying back their student loans. In the first three months of this year, the total amount of federal student loans was $1.78 trillion, increasing by 2% every three months. Five million people are late on their payments, and many older people still have student loan debt. The Trump government wants to reduce the number of loans given out starting next year to lower costs and set standards for university courses.

Lawmakers from both major parties discussed what a "professional degree" means. Graduates from fields like language, art, education, history, and social work typically earn less than $40,000 a year when they start working. Doctors can earn a lot, but their student loans for advanced degrees can be more than $240,000.

Jon Fansmith, a senior official at the American Council on Education, told the New York Times that the law does not allow for exceptions. He said that not all courses should be judged by how much money they can help you earn. If students want to become rich, they do not need to study social work; similarly, a master's degree in English literature will not make them rich.

Besides making it harder to get student loans and reducing access to some courses, the Trump government's Great American Act also targets university donations. Big universities like Harvard and Princeton will face higher taxes on their alumni funds, which might reduce the number of scholarships available.

The law states that schools with an average donation fund of $2 million per student, like Harvard University, must pay an 8% tax on their investment earnings. This is lower than the initial proposal of 21% from the House of Representatives.

The New York Times reported that US universities use about 5% of their donation fund earnings each year to help students financially, pay professors, and cover operating costs. This money is a main source for scholarships.
