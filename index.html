            <h1>Financial Supervisory Commission: Warning Accounts Went Down in September for the First Time; Asking Banks to Make AI Models More Accurate</h1>
            <p>Banks are still fighting against fraud. Lawmakers are worried that some banks' AI models for detecting fraud are too broad. This causes people's accounts to be frozen, so they cannot make payments. People get upset because they have to go to the bank in person to unfreeze their accounts. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said today that the number of warning accounts went down for the first time in September. If a bank's AI detection model is not good, the FSC will talk to the bank right away and ask them to make it better and more accurate. This will help to lower the number of "wrongly frozen" accounts.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee invited FSC Chairperson Peng Jin-lung and other heads of related organizations today. They came to present their work reports and answer questions.</p>
            <p>KMT lawmakers Yen Kuan-heng, Lee Yen-hsiu, Taiwan People's Party lawmaker Huang Shan-shan, and DPP lawmaker Lin Chu-yin all asked about this issue. Many people shared online that their accounts were frozen even when they transferred money to their own other accounts, or when they received small amounts of money as a group buyer. Some people didn't even know their trading account was frozen until they couldn't make payments. They hope banks will make their AI detection systems more accurate. They also hope banks will tell people when their accounts are frozen.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung explained that there are two types of these accounts. One type is a warning account reported by police and investigators to the bank. Banks cannot unfreeze these accounts. If you have a question, you need to complain to the police. The other type is accounts that financial institutions can identify as high-risk after the anti-fraud law passed last year. These accounts can be partly frozen. This second type has caused some complaints recently.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung said that in 2021, there were about 66,000 warning accounts, and about 3,000 new accounts were added each month. At the beginning of this year, there were 150,000 warning accounts. Fraud groups kept using inactive accounts, and banks also continued to take action. In September, the number of warning accounts went down for the first time. This shows that the controls are working well. In April this year, only about 10 banks saw a decrease in warning accounts. Now, about 25 banks have seen a decrease, which means the controls are effective.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung pointed out that the FSC did not tell companies exactly how to do things. It only asked companies to manage warning accounts. Some banks' AI models were not good at freezing accounts. The FSC immediately talked to these banks and asked them to make improvements and adjust their models accurately. The FSC requires every bank to have a 24-hour customer service hotline so people can contact them quickly. Banks must also share their "wrongly frozen" experiences with other banks. He believes this problem will slowly get better.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung stressed that the determination to fight fraud will not change. He also asked the Bankers Association's anti-fraud committee to discuss and share experiences about "wrongly frozen" accounts. He hopes these kinds of events will not happen again.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Tong Cheng-chang, Director-General of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said that banks have started using AI detection to find suspicious accounts early. In September, the number of warning accounts decreased by more than 580 for the first time. This shows that the controls are generally working, and they will continue to manage them.</p>
            <p>Lawmakers were worried that bank AI models might be too broad. Tong Cheng-chang explained that if the models are not accurate, they might cause trouble for people. He asked banks to review and improve their models, including making the settings more accurate and the models more effective. If people want to report a problem, banks also need to set up a good way to handle it. He also asked banks to open a special hotline, and for simple cases, people can use robots online to unfreeze accounts.</p>
            <p>Tong Cheng-chang explained that freezing an account is a temporary control. The goal is to ask users to do KYC (Know Your Customer) again to understand why their money flow changed.</p>

            <h1>Tumor Near Liver and Heart: Taipei Veterans General Hospital Did a 14-Hour 'Bomb Disposal' Surgery, Cleaning Liver Outside the Body and Putting It Back</h1>
            <p>Ms. Pan, who is 53 years old, found an evil tumor during a regular health check. This tumor was tightly wrapped around her liver veins and the large vein that carries blood to the heart, reaching all the way to her heart. Taipei Veterans General Hospital used a very rare surgery in the world. They took out the liver, cleaned the tumor from it outside the body, and then put it back. The surgeon worked for 14 hours in this "bomb disposal" surgery, helping her get a new life.</p>
            <p>Ms. Pan spoke at a press conference at Taipei Veterans General Hospital today. She remembered last June when she got her test results. The "malignant leiomyosarcoma" (an evil tumor from muscle cells) felt like a sudden bad storm that destroyed her world. Normal treatments like chemotherapy and radiation could only help for a short time. Only surgery could fix the problem forever. But the tumor was in a very dangerous place, so many hospitals said no. A surgery to remove it completely seemed impossible.</p>
            <p>Ms. Pan did not want to give up. At the end of March this year, she went to Taipei Veterans General Hospital for help, which brought a spark of hope. Dr. Liu Chun-shu, a transplant surgeon at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, compared this surgery to "removing a bomb with many fuses. If you make one small mistake, it will explode." The team faced many difficult steps, like controlling blood flow in the liver, rebuilding veins, and removing the tumor from the heart and the main vein. Every step was very risky.</p>
            <p>Dr. Liu Chun-shu had a brave and detailed idea. He planned to take the liver out of the body completely. Then, outside the body, he would carefully cut out the tumor and rebuild the liver veins. At the same time, the heart surgery team would use a machine to keep blood flowing outside the body. They would remove the tumor in the main vein and the right side of the heart, and then rebuild the main vein. Finally, they would put the "like-new" liver back in. This sounds like a movie, but it was Ms. Pan's real life plan.</p>
            <p>After practicing many times and talking clearly with Ms. Pan and her family about the risks of the surgery, Ms. Pan still trusted them completely. The "bomb disposal" surgery happened on April 9th this year. They used a machine to keep blood flowing outside the body. The medical team cut open her stomach with a "Mercedes-Benz shaped cut." They carefully separated the liver from the main vein, leaving some of the tumor close to the heart. Then, the liver was taken out and kept in a special liquid, waiting to be put back.</p>
            <p>Dr. Liu Chun-shu shared that the liver transplant team worked very fast to remove the tumor from the liver outside the body. At the same time, the heart surgery team removed the tumor from the main vein and the right side of the heart. Then they quickly put the liver back into the body. The whole surgery took 14 hours. They fought with death and finally won. Ms. Pan has been in good condition since the surgery, with no signs of the tumor coming back. She is now a very rare case in medical history around the world.</p>
            <p>Dr. Liu Chun-shu said that malignant leiomyosarcoma is a rare and aggressive evil tumor. It comes from smooth muscle cells, so it can happen anywhere in the body. The exact cause is not clear yet, but changes in genes and inherited diseases are thought to be possible risks. It happens to only 1 to 2 people out of a million. It is most common in people aged 40 to 60, and women have a higher chance of getting uterine malignant leiomyosarcoma.</p>
            <p>Because the exact cause is unknown, there is no known way to fully prevent it right now. Keeping a healthy lifestyle and avoiding known risks, like not getting too much radiation exposure, may help with overall health. Dr. Liu Chun-shu reminded people that if you find any unknown lumps or strange symptoms, you should see a doctor early to get the best treatment as soon as possible.</p>

            <h1>Many Problems in KMT Chairperson Election; Sean Lien Asks Teams Not to Harm the Party</h1>
            <p>There are many problems in the Kuomintang (KMT) chairperson election. There are reports that outside forces are trying to affect the election, which is causing concern. Sean Lien, who is the head of the KMT election oversight group and also a vice-chairperson, said today that he and his father, Lien Chan, were also affected. He asked all campaign teams and their supporters not to help the party by hurting it with these methods. He said this will only give the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) more chances to criticize the KMT, which is actually harming the KMT.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairperson election will be held on October 18th. The competition is getting very strong. Sean Lien said on Facebook tonight that he has received many questions from party members. They are worried about the problems in the chairperson election, including that the KMT has never done any internal polls for the chairperson election.</p>
            <p>Sean Lien explained that the KMT has gone through three big elections in less than four years. If they could find any money, they would use it to help party workers who are being hurt by the government's legal actions. They would never spend any money on polls for any campaign team.</p>
            <p>About the problem of online trolls affecting the election, Sean Lien explained that fake accounts have spread fake news about him and his father, Lien Chan, in this election. But neither he nor the party headquarters have the legal power to investigate this. So, he can only strongly ask all campaign teams, and most importantly, their supporters, not to use methods that might not help themselves but will definitely hurt the KMT in the last week before the election.</p>
            <p>Sean Lien emphasized that these actions will only give the DPP more reasons to criticize the KMT in the future. He said it is actually harming the KMT. He also asked that even if people have doubts, they should not blame other teams without clear proof. This will help keep the party united after the election.</p>
            <p>Sean Lien believes that after two big elections and one big recall vote in less than four years, the KMT is facing even more serious survival problems. He was amused by how some media talked lightly about the challenges the KMT is facing, as if it was obvious. He said it's like "watching someone drink hot water and not feeling the burn yourself."</p>
            <p>Sean Lien mentioned that some important KMT issues, like cooperation between the KMT and the Taiwan People's Party, can wait until the second day after the election. Cross-strait policy can wait until the third day after taking office. Nominations for the local elections can even wait until one month after taking office. But the problem of survival is a challenge that the next party chairperson must face the moment they take office.</p>
            <p>Sean Lien said that as a volunteer who has worked very hard for the KMT for the past four years, he kindly asks all candidates to guide all party members and the public who care about the KMT. He asks them to explain how they will lead the KMT to overcome problems and become strong again with real and workable actions.</p>
