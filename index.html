            <h1>Man Parks Illegally, Police Find Many Drug Coffee Bags</h1>
            <p>Recently, police in Taichung were patrolling in Xitun District. They saw a car parked illegally. When they went to check, they smelled something like burning drugs inside the car. They found 35 bags of drug coffee on the car floor mat. After questioning, the police sent the driver, Mr. Lin, to the prosecutor's office. They are still looking for where the drugs came from.</p>
            <p>The Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Bureau said today that on the evening of July 31, officers from Hean Police Station were patrolling. They were near the corner of Hankou Road Section 2 and Daxin Street in Xitun District. They saw a black car stopped illegally on a red line, and its engine was still running. The driver looked strange. The police thought something was wrong and went to check.</p>
            <p>The police drove their patrol car closer and used their siren to warn the driver, but the car did not move. When the police got close to the car window, Mr. Lin, who is 35 years old, opened the door quickly and got out. He told the police, "I was replying to messages and didn't notice I was parked illegally." But there was a strong, sharp smell on him, like drugs had been burned.</p>
            <p>The police then looked around inside the car. They saw many bags of drugs on the car's floor mat. They counted them and found a total of 35 bags of drug coffee. Mr. Lin was arrested right away. After questioning, he was sent to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for drug offenses. The police are still trying to find the source of the drugs.</p>

            <h1>World Children's Art Exhibition Shows Local Culture: Harvest Season and Hope for Peace in Paintings</h1>
            <p>The 56th World Children's Art Exhibition gave out awards today. Many of the winning artworks show special local culture. They show how children see their daily lives, social problems, and cultural things. For example, a student from Taitung drew about the harvest season, and a student from Ukraine drew about hoping for peace.</p>
            <p>The 56th World Children's Art Exhibition of the Republic of China had its award ceremony today. It was organized by the Chinese Association for Children's Fine Arts Education and helped by the National Taiwan Museum of Arts Education. This year, 41 countries joined, including the United States, Japan, Malaysia, and Thailand. More than 50,000 artworks came from Taiwan, and more than 10,000 came from other countries. They chose 88 special excellence awards and 256 excellence awards from Taiwan. From other countries, they gave 25 gold medals, 35 silver medals, and 60 bronze medals.</p>
            <p>Many of the winning artworks show local cultural features. They show children's thoughts on their daily experiences, social issues, and cultural things. For example, Su Xuan, a student from Jieda Elementary School in Jinfeng Township, Taitung County, won a special excellence award for her work "Harvest Season".</p>
            <p>Su Xuan shared that her painting has mountains, rivers, red quinoa, and peanuts. People can hunt in the mountains and catch fish and shrimp in the rivers. Red quinoa and peanuts can be food. She hopes her artwork makes everyone feel the joy of a good harvest.</p>
            <p>Lin You-chen, a student from Wenshan Elementary School in Nantun District, Taichung City, created "Underground Big Illegal Building". While riding the subway during a trip, he wondered if there were more trains underground. He used rabbits as human-like characters and combined hidden meanings with imagined spaces. His art shows he cares about social problems.</p>
            <p>Artworks from other countries are also rich and varied. For example, a Ukrainian student's work "My City" shows the child's wish for peaceful days, when they can learn again and live happily. A student from Belize created "How Children Will Run the Future World." This artwork focuses on Mother Earth and shares love for the world and care for everyone.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Museum of Arts Education is now showing the winning artworks in its 3rd exhibition hall and art space. There will also be a traveling exhibition around Taiwan and other activities. Experts will talk with teachers, students, and parents about the children's paintings in an interactive way.</p>
