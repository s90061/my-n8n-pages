            <h1>US Puts New Limits on Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel Making Chips in China</h1>
            <p>The United States has announced new rules. These rules will make it harder for big chip-making companies like Samsung, SK Hynix, and Intel to make computer chips in China. The US government will take away special permissions that allowed these companies to buy US equipment for making semiconductors in China.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that in 2022, the US Department of Commerce stopped American semiconductor equipment from being sold to China. But at that time, Intel from the US and Samsung and SK Hynix from Korea were allowed to continue making chips in China. They had special permission.</p>
            <p>Now, if these companies want to buy American equipment to make chips in China, they will need to get a special license. This new rule will likely mean that US companies that make semiconductor equipment, such as KLA, Lam Research, and Applied Materials, will sell less to China. It might also help Micron, an American company that is a main competitor to Samsung and SK Hynix in the memory chip market.</p>
            <p>According to the official announcement, this new system for buying equipment will start in 120 days. Intel sold its factory in Dalian, China, that made NAND Flash memory a few years ago to SK Hynix. However, Intel continued to make silicon wafers there until this year.</p>

            <h1>Overseas Chinese High School Wins Against Feng Yuan Commercial High School in Youth Volleyball Semifinal</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Apex Youth Volleyball Invitational Tournament is almost finished. Today was the second-to-last day. In the boys' competition, Overseas Chinese Senior High School played against Feng Yuan Commercial Senior High School. Overseas Chinese was losing 5 to 10 in the last set, but they came back and won 18 to 16. This means they will play in the championship game tomorrow against Pingtung High School.</p>
            <p>This is the fourth year of the Apex Youth Volleyball Invitational. In the boys' matches, there was a very exciting game. Overseas Chinese and Feng Yuan Commercial are both strong teams in the High School Volleyball League (HVL). They were playing for a spot in the final match. After four sets, both teams had won two sets each. In the fifth set, Overseas Chinese was far behind. It looked like they would lose and not go to the final. But luckily, they started to play much better. Also, Feng Yuan Commercial had trouble receiving the ball. So, Overseas Chinese slowly caught up.</p>
            <p>Overseas Chinese stopped their opponents from winning the game two times. Then, a player named Lin Li-wei made a very important spike that was strong and powerful. This gave his team a chance to win. Finally, they won with a successful block. This made the final score 18 to 16, a close win for Overseas Chinese.</p>
            <p>After the game, the captain of Overseas Chinese, Huang Pin-yan, spoke to reporters. He said that when they were leading by two sets at the beginning, he just wanted to finish the game quickly. But then their setter, who helps set up attacks, got hurt. This made the team's spirit go down. Huang Pin-yan then spoke to his team and said, "I will carry us." He explained that the most important thing for winning was to follow the coach's instructions: just get the serve over the net and then try their best to defend and attack back.</p>

            <h1>Government Says New Law's Formula Causes Lienchiang County's Shared Tax to Decrease</h1>
            <p>The Executive Yuan (Taiwan's government) announced that there is a problem with the formula in the new Public Finance Act. Because of this problem, Lienchiang County will receive less shared tax money next year. The central government will help Lienchiang County by covering the difference, so they will still receive the same amount of money. Also, because the central government is giving a record-high amount of money to local governments, Premier Cho Jung-tai will invite leaders from all local governments to discuss how money and responsibilities should be divided.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Finance announced the amount of shared tax money that cities and counties will receive next year. This was calculated using the new Public Finance Act formula. According to the Ministry of Finance's list of how the central government's shared tax will be given to local governments, Taipei City will receive much more money. Its amount will go from NT$70.702 billion to NT$114.924 billion. New Taipei City will also receive more, from NT$55.061 billion to NT$95.768 billion.</p>
            <p>Taichung City will see an increase from NT$45.244 billion to NT$74.104 billion. Tainan City will go from NT$32.721 billion to NT$49.670 billion. Kaohsiung City's amount will increase from NT$50.741 billion to NT$75.780 billion. Taoyuan City will go from NT$36.275 billion to NT$65.285 billion. Lienchiang County, which many people are watching, will have its amount kept at NT$723 million, even with the formula problem. However, some cities and counties, like Keelung City and Yunlin County, are not happy. They say the shared tax money they received is not what they calculated it should be.</p>
            <p>Executive Yuan spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said through media groups this evening that because of the new formula, some cities and counties are getting a very big increase in shared tax money. For example, if we don't count the NT$1 billion subsidy for a specific financial business tax, Taipei City's shared tax would increase by almost 65%. Even with the subsidy, it's still a 62.5% increase. In contrast, Lienchiang County's shared tax would have decreased next year. So, the Ministry of Finance has added money to make sure Lienchiang County receives the same amount as before.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih also said that next year, the central government will give local governments a total of NT$884.09 billion in shared tax. This is NT$416.51 billion more than this year, which was NT$467.59 billion. This is an increase of almost 90%. This amount makes up 31% of the central government's total income. Because of this, the central government has to think again about how money and responsibilities are shared between the central and local governments. Premier Cho Jung-tai will soon invite the leaders of all local governments to discuss this important topic. Lee Hui-chih added that today, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics also sent out information about "The Way Central Government Subsidies for Cities and Counties Will Be Divided for 2026" to local governments. Soon, they will also invite accounting staff from local governments to talk about how different funds will be given out.</p>
