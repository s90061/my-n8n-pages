            <h1>Oil prices rise sharply as market focuses on Trump-Putin meeting and US interest rate cut outlook</h1>
            <p>US President Trump warned that if his talks with Russian President Putin about the war in Ukraine fail, there will be 'serious consequences'. Also, people in the market think the US might lower interest rates next month. This could make the demand for oil go up. Because of this, oil prices went up a lot today, about 2%. They reached the highest price in one week.</p>
            <p>Brent crude oil futures went up by $1.21, or 1.8%. They closed at $66.84 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil also went up by $1.31, or 2.1%. It closed at $63.96 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Trump to hold bilateral meeting with Putin: Hopes to pave the way for US-Russia-Ukraine summit</h1>
            <p>US President Trump will meet with Russian President Putin in Alaska. Trump said today that his main goal for tomorrow is to prepare for a three-way meeting between the US, Russia, and Ukraine. He hopes this meeting can happen soon, and maybe some European leaders will be invited. He also believes that if he were not the US President, Putin would try to take over all of Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost 3 and a half years. Trump plans to have a one-on-one meeting with Putin tomorrow in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city. This will be the first time the current US and Russian presidents meet since 2021.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to the media this afternoon in the Oval Office at the White House. He said that he thinks tomorrow's meeting with Putin will be 'a very good meeting'. But he said the second meeting is more important. That would be a three-way talk between Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and himself. He added, 'Maybe some European leaders will be invited, maybe not, I'm not sure yet.'</p>
            <p>He believes that Putin will work for peace, and Zelenskyy will also work for peace. He said, 'We will see if they can get along. If they can, that would be very good.'</p>
            <p>Trump said that tomorrow, the only thing he wants to do is to prepare for a meeting of the leaders from the US, Russia, and Ukraine. He hopes it can happen soon, and it would be best if it takes place directly in Alaska.</p>
            <p>He said, 'We will clearly see everyone's positions.' He believes he can tell if the meeting will be good or bad just a few minutes before it starts. He stated, 'If the meeting does not go well, it will end quickly. If it is good, then there will be a peaceful outcome very soon.'</p>
            <p>Trump thinks that Putin wants to make a deal. In Trump's opinion, if he were not the US President, Putin would likely try to take all of Ukraine. He said, 'But I am the President, he will not trick me.'</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told the media earlier today that Trump will go to Alaska tomorrow morning. He will have a one-on-one meeting with Putin. After that, representatives from the US and Russia will have a meal together, and then there will be a press conference.</p>
            <p>Since Trump returned to the White House earlier this year, he has been trying to get a permanent stop to the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. But so far, he has not gotten any big agreements from Russia.</p>

            <h1>Russia and Ukraine exchange prisoners again before Trump-Putin summit</h1>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine announced today that they each exchanged 84 prisoners of war. This is the latest in a series of prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine this year, where hundreds of people have been set free.</p>
            <p>This prisoner exchange happened before Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump are set to meet for a summit in Alaska on August 15.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on social media that the exchanged prisoners included 'soldiers and civilians'. Some of these people 'had been held by the Russians since 2014, 2016, and 2017'.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also said that 'people who defended Mariupol' were on the list for this exchange. Mariupol is a port city in Ukraine. Russian forces surrounded it in February 2022 for almost three months. In the end, it fell to the Russian army.</p>
            <p>The Russian Ministry of Defense stated on Telegram, a messaging app, that the United Arab Emirates helped to make this prisoner exchange happen. The Russian people who were released are now getting 'psychological and medical help'.</p>
            <p>Large-scale prisoner exchanges were the only real achievement made during three rounds of peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian representatives in Istanbul from May to July.</p>
            <p>In the most recent talks last month, Russia and Ukraine agreed to exchange 1,200 prisoners from each side.</p>
            <p>A Russian negotiator also said that Moscow offered to return the bodies of 3,000 dead soldiers to Kyiv.</p>
