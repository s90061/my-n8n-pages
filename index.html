            <h1>Former President Tsai Ing-wen: "I could not let the first female president fail" after a difficult 2018</h1>
            <p>Former President Tsai Ing-wen shared a video on Facebook today. It was from an event for Taiwan Girls' Day. She said that 2018 was probably her worst time. Everyone said she would only be president for one term. At that time, she told herself she could not lose this fight. "I could not let the first woman president fail." So, she kept going. She wanted to show that a woman can be a very good president in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ing-wen also said that at the event, a girl asked her how to deal with "limits because of gender and how to overcome them."</p>
            <p>Tsai Ing-wen explained that when people need to make choices, they always face different limits. She said not to see these limits as problems. Instead, she said that when you work to remove these limits, you actually grow stronger.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ing-wen also talked about how she stood up again after a failure. She said that 2018 (when her party, the Democratic Progressive Party, lost badly in local elections) was probably her hardest time. Everyone thought she would only serve one term as president. But she told herself, "I must not lose this. This is the first time a woman is president, and I cannot let the first female president fail." So, she continued to work hard. She wanted to prove that a woman can be a very good president in Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Global Oil Prices Fall Because of US-China Trade Worries and Expected Too Much Oil</h1>
            <p>Global oil prices went down today. This happened because trade problems between the United States and China are getting worse. This made people want to buy less risky things. Also, the International Energy Agency (IEA) thinks there will be much more oil than needed in 2026.</p>
            <p>The price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November went down by 79 cents, or 1.33%. It closed at $58.70 per barrel.</p>
            <p>The price for Brent crude oil from the North Sea for December went down by 93 cents, or 1.47%. It closed at $62.39 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Powell Says Fed May Stop Reducing Its Balance Sheet Soon, Warns of Slowing Job Growth</h1>
            <p>Jerome Powell, who is the head of the US central bank (the Federal Reserve or Fed), said today that the Fed might soon stop reducing its balance sheet. He did not give clear information about future interest rates. He also warned that job growth in the US is slowing down a lot.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news company, reported that Powell spoke at an event in Philadelphia. He talked about how they are doing with quantitative tightening (QT). This means reducing the Fed's assets, which are more than 6 trillion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Powell did not say exactly when the Fed would stop reducing its balance sheet. But he noted that some signs show the Fed is close to its goal of having "enough reserves" for banks.</p>
            <p>In his prepared speech, Powell said, "Our long-term plan is to stop reducing our balance sheet when reserves are a little higher than what we think is enough. We might reach this in the next few months. We are closely watching different signs to make this decision."</p>
            <p>When money is tight, the Fed wants to keep reserves "plenty." This makes sure banks have enough money and the economy keeps working. As things change, the Fed's goal will be to have "enough" reserves, so there is not too much money in the market.</p>
            <p>Powell said that "signs of money getting tighter have started to appear." He said if they keep reducing reserves, it could slow down the economy. But he also said that the Fed does not want its balance sheet to go back to about 4 trillion US dollars, which it was before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
            <p>About interest rates, Powell kept his recent opinion. He said that decision-makers are carefully watching the tight job market. They are looking at the risks between jobs and rising prices.</p>
            <p>He said, "The unemployment rate was low at the end of August. But job growth has slowed down a lot. This might be because fewer people are working, there are fewer immigrants, and fewer people are looking for jobs. In a job market that is less active and a bit weak, the risk of fewer jobs seems to have gone up."</p>
            <p>Powell mentioned that the Fed's group that makes decisions, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), decided in September to lower the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points. This was to deal with the situation.</p>
            <p>People expect the Fed to lower interest rates two more times before the end of this year. Some Fed officials also agree with this. But Powell did not say what he thought about it.</p>
            <p>He said, "When we try to balance our goals for jobs and prices, there is no policy path without risks." The FOMC plans to have a meeting on October 28-29.</p>
