The U.S. might cancel waivers that allow global chipmakers to send American technology to China. This potential policy change could impact key players like Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC. According to the Wall Street Journal, the waivers might be revoked because they are believed to be helping China‚Äôs advanced military and AI capabilities. These waivers were originally granted in 2022 when the U.S. first imposed strict export restrictions on China's semiconductor industry. This was seen as a gesture of goodwill to allies, allowing these companies to continue production in China, which is the world's largest semiconductor market and crucial for their financial stability, especially for South Korean and Taiwanese firms. Revoking these waivers would represent a significant shift and further escalation in U.S. tech policy.

**Stock Market Today: S&P 500, Nasdaq Fall Amid Geopolitical and Economic Concerns**

U.S. stocks mostly declined on Friday as investors reacted to various global developments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a slight increase of nearly 0.2%, but the S&P 500 erased its 2025 gains, dropping 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 1.5%. Oil prices increased due to rising geopolitical tensions, with West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures climbing over 3% to more than $80 per barrel, and Brent crude oil futures rising 2.7% to nearly $85 per barrel. Investors are considering the possibility of direct U.S. military involvement in the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict, now in its second week.

This week, inflation has been a major focus on Wall Street. The Producer Price Index (PPI) showed that wholesale prices in May increased more than expected, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April eased slightly more than anticipated. These figures have led strategists to reduce their predictions for interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, with markets now expecting only one 25-basis-point cut this year. Other factors influencing the markets include former President Trump's upcoming decision on tariffs, as a 90-day tariff exemption for some Chinese goods is set to expire on July 9, and the ongoing tensions in the chip sector between the U.S. and China.

**Tencent Music Shares Double on Break From China Price Cut Script**

Chinese tech investors, tired of intense price competition, can find success in online music, which is thriving by moving in a different direction. Shares of Tencent Music Entertainment Group (TME) surged up to 14% on Thursday, marking its largest gain since January. This rise came after the Chinese streaming giant announced a strategy to increase prices and expand its premium subscription service.

This move signals a departure from the fierce competition that has defined China‚Äôs technology sector for years, often sacrificing profits. The change in strategy highlights how Beijing‚Äôs broad crackdown on internet companies and a greater focus on profitability, rather than just market share, are influencing the industry. Shawn Yang, managing director at Blue Lotus Capital Advisors, stated, ‚ÄúWith the crackdown over, we expect more companies to focus on monetization rather than growing users at all costs. Tencent Music is setting a good example for the industry.‚Äù

While Tencent Music has previously tested price increases, it began aggressively promoting a new premium tier in the first quarter. This service offers advanced features like lossless audio and exclusive content and costs 50% more than the basic package. CEO Liang Zhu expressed confidence in the premium offerings, citing strong content and a competitive advantage. He added that the company will continue to offer various services at different price points, including a free, ad-supported tier.
