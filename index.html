            <h1>India Political Rally: 36 People Died in a Stampede</h1>
            <p>In Tamil Nadu, India, at least 36 people died and about 58 were hurt in a crowd crush. This happened at a campaign event for Vijay, a famous actor who is now a politician. The governor of Tamil Nadu, M.K. Stalin, shared his sadness on social media platform X. He said that 8 children and 16 women were among those who died.</p>
            <p>V. Senthilbalaji, a member of the parliament, said that around 58 people were sent to the hospital for treatment. Vijay, who uses only one name, stopped his speech when the crowd became chaotic. The 51-year-old actor said he felt "heartbroken" about the sad event.</p>
            <p>Vijay wrote on social media X, "I send my deepest condolences and sympathy to the families of my dear brothers and sisters who died in Karur County." The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that a large number of people pushed hard against the fences near the stage to see Vijay. This caused the stampede.</p>
            <p>Governor Stalin has ordered a committee to investigate the "sad event." A retired judge will lead this committee. He also said that the families of those who died will get 1 million rupees (about 340,000 New Taiwan Dollars) as compensation.</p>
            <p>India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, said the event was "very sad." He wrote on social media, "My heart is with the families who lost their loved ones. I hope they can be strong during this difficult time."</p>

            <h1>Former US Officials: Taiwan Has Good Ways to Deal with Trump by Making its Defense Stronger and Investing in the US</h1>
            <p>Taiwan is facing threats from China and uncertainty from the United States. Former US officials have written that Taiwan's leaders must put enough money into their defense and ability to recover from problems. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is a world leader in making computer chips. This also gives Taiwan an economic advantage. By spending more on defense and investing in the US, Taiwan has "strong cards" when it talks with the US.</p>
            <p>Experts Phil Gordon and Ryan Hass from the Brookings Institution in Washington D.C. wrote an article in Foreign Affairs magazine. They talked about how Taiwan should deal with China's increasing pressure and the possible uncertainty if Donald Trump becomes president again. Gordon used to be a national security advisor to former US Vice President Kamala Harris. Hass was in charge of China, Taiwan, and Mongolia affairs for the White House National Security Council when Barack Obama was president.</p>
            <p>The article said that Taiwan's leaders must quickly fix their weaknesses so they can keep their way of life even with China's growing power. Most importantly, Taiwan's leaders must invest enough in defense and resilience.</p>
            <p>The article stated that Taiwan needs to invest more in mobile weapons, such as mobile rocket launchers, shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles, and air defense systems. Small, cheap drone systems can add important layers of defense. Making cybersecurity stronger will also help Taiwan be more resilient. Having ammunition ready and saving energy, medicine, and food will also help to stop China from thinking it can take Taiwan quickly and cheaply.</p>
            <p>Gordon and Hass believe these actions are very important for Taiwan to defend itself. They will also help Taiwan avoid criticism from the US that it is not doing its part.</p>
            <p>Also, the article emphasized that Taiwan has an advantage that almost no other US partner has: economic power that can be a base for national security. Taiwan makes about 95% of the world's most advanced semiconductor chips. As the AI revolution grows, Taiwan's position in the world market will only become stronger. "This gives Taiwan the financial ability to steadily increase defense spending and present it as a victory for Trump."</p>
            <p>The article said that TSMC's leading position in the world chip market gives Taiwan advantages that other countries can only wish for. TSMC can invest in the US, as the Trump administration wants, without hurting its own competitive position. This means that even with Trump's business-like way of doing things, "Taiwan's security will remain important for the long-term interests of the US for many years."</p>
            <p>The article noted that by increasing its defense budget, investing in the US, and showing that Taiwan is a reliable partner for keeping peace and stability, "Taiwan holds strong cards in dealing with Trump."</p>
            <p>However, Gordon and Hass also said in the article that these things cannot completely stop the risk that Trump might give in on Taiwan issues. He might do this to make a trade deal with China or improve his relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Trump and Xi are expected to meet later this year. Gordon and Hass think that Xi Jinping might ask Trump to promise to sell fewer weapons to Taiwan. Or he might ask Trump to clearly say that the US "opposes" Taiwan's independence and supports Taiwan and China eventually becoming one. Trump might be tempted to agree to get a deal. But even in this situation, Taiwan still has a lot of power and enough resources to decide its own future.</p>
            <p>Because China keeps threatening Taiwan with military force, President Lai Ching-te has announced that next year's defense budget will increase to 3.32% of Taiwan's total economic output (GDP). He expects it to reach 5% of GDP by 2030.</p>

            <h1>Colombia's President Says US Broke International Law After His Visa Was Taken Away Because He Supported Gaza</h1>
            <p>Today, Gustavo Petro, the President of Colombia, criticized the United States for taking away his visa. He said that the US broke international law because he spoke against Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Petro walked in New York City in a protest to support Palestine. He also told American soldiers not to follow President Trump's orders. After this, the US quickly said it would take away Petro's visa.</p>
            <p>Petro wrote on social media, "I no longer have a visa to go to the United States. I don't care. I don't need a visa... because I am not only a citizen of Colombia but also a citizen of Europe. I truly believe I am a free person in the world."</p>
            <p>He added in a post on social media platform X, "Taking away a visa for speaking out against genocide shows that the US no longer respects international law."</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Petro is not the first Colombian president to have his US visa taken away. In 1996, Ernesto Samper, who was president at the time, had his visa canceled. This happened because of a political scandal. It involved claims that a drug cartel from Cali helped pay for Samper's election campaign.</p>
            <p>Petro was in New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Outside the UN headquarters in New York, he told the crowd, "I ask all US Army soldiers not to point their guns at people. Please do not follow President Trump's orders, and instead listen to the call of humanity!"</p>
            <p>On September 23, Petro also gave a speech at the UN General Assembly. In his speech, he strongly criticized Trump, calling him a "partner in genocide" in the Gaza Strip. He also asked for a "criminal investigation" into missile attacks by the US in the Caribbean Sea on ships suspected of carrying drugs.</p>
