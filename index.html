https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/gen-z-drives-luxury-second-hand-market-resale-platforms-bloom-2024-05-24/

Younger consumers, known as Gen Z, are changing the luxury market. Instead of always buying brand new expensive items, they are increasingly choosing second-hand luxury goods. This trend is helping to grow online platforms that sell used designer clothes, bags, and accessories. These platforms allow people to buy luxury items at lower prices, making them more affordable for a wider group.

Gen Z is also very interested in sustainability. Buying second-hand items is seen as more environmentally friendly because it extends the life of products and reduces waste. This focus on sustainability and value is influencing big luxury brands to think about how they can join this growing market, perhaps by offering their own resale programs or working with existing platforms. The shift shows that luxury is not just about owning something new, but also about smart choices and environmental care.

**AI Changes the Skills Workers Need**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing many jobs around the world. As AI tools become more common in workplaces, companies and employees need to adapt. Experts say that the future of work will require people to have new skills. It's not just about knowing how to use AI, but also about soft skills like creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving, which AI cannot easily replicate.

Many businesses are now investing in training programs for their staff. These "upskilling" initiatives help employees learn how to work effectively with AI, rather than being replaced by it. For example, a job that once involved a lot of data entry might now focus on analyzing data provided by AI. This trend means that continuous learning will become even more important for staying competitive in the job market.

**Popular Tourist Destinations Combat Overtourism**

Many of the world's most beautiful and famous places are struggling with overtourism. This means too many visitors are arriving at once, which can harm local communities, the environment, and the quality of the travel experience itself. Cities and natural sites, from Venice to national parks, are looking for ways to manage the large numbers of tourists, especially during peak seasons.

To solve this problem, some destinations are putting new rules in place. These include limiting the number of daily visitors, charging higher entry fees, or even banning certain types of tourism. The goal is to encourage more sustainable travel practices. Tourists are also being asked to play their part by considering less crowded destinations, traveling during off-peak times, or choosing tours that support local businesses and respect the environment.`;
