<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/china-says-taiwan-president-spreading-114632506.html">News Link</a>

BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Monday accused Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te of "heresy", hostility, and provocation. This accusation followed a speech in which Lai stated that Taiwan is "of course" a country, supported by historical evidence and legal proof.

Beijing claims that democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to China since ancient times. They argue that the island is merely one of its provinces and has no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject this view. They have offered talks with China multiple times, but these offers have been rejected. China refers to Lai as a "separatist".

China's Taiwan Affairs Office responded to Lai's Sunday evening speech, stating that he had intentionally twisted history to promote his Taiwan independence agenda and that the island has never been a country.

Their statement said, "It was a 'Taiwan independence' declaration that blatantly incited cross-strait confrontation, and a hodgepodge of 'Taiwan independence' fallacies and heresies full of errors and omissions."

"The fallacies fabricated by Lai Ching-te in contravention of history, reality and jurisprudence will only be swept into the rubbish heap of history."

In response, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which handles China policy, stated that Lai was simply presenting historical facts. They added that Beijing's belief that the island has been Chinese since ancient times and is not a country is "just a fabricated lie without any basis".

"We call on the Chinese communist authorities to face up to the fact that the Republic of China objectively exists and the status quo in the Taiwan Strait that 'the two sides are not subordinate to each other'," their statement added.

The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists. This remains the island's formal name.

Lai has repeatedly asserted that only the people of Taiwan can decide their future. He also states that since the People's Republic of China has never ruled the island, it has no right to claim it or speak on its behalf.

Over the past five years, Taiwan has experienced increased military and political pressure from China, including war games.

**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%B1%A8%E5%83%B9%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train (ÂçÄÈñìËªä) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

TRA fares will be fully adjusted on June 23, with an average increase of 26.8%. This adjustment covers various train ticket prices, lost and found return fees, luggage, and bicycle transportation fees. For example, the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will increase by NT$153. In addition to fare adjustments, TRA will implement a major timetable change on June 26, and revise its refund policy for delays and other promotional measures. Taiwan PASS prices will also be adjusted, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version seeing the highest increase.

This fare adjustment marks the end of a 30-year freeze on TRA prices. Specifically, local train fares from Taipei to Banqiao will increase from NT$15 to NT$22, and the Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will increase to NT$975. Luggage and parcel fees will see an average increase of 36%, with items under 70 kg for distances within 300 km increasing from NT$70 to NT$100, a hike of 43%. Transportation scholar Huang Tai-sheng noted that TRA's price increase is significant, roughly one-third.

In addition to fare increases, TRA's discount measures have also been reduced. The free mileage for using EasyCard or iPASS on Tze-Chiang Limited Express trains will be shortened to 50 km. The "Love Child Ticket," which used to cost one-quarter of the full fare for children aged 6 to 12 with disabilities, will also be canceled, though children aged 6 to 12 will still receive a half-fare discount. For residents of Hualien and Taitung, TRA offers point rewards, with 8 times points on weekdays and 5 times on holidays, which can be used to offset ticket purchases.

Regarding train delays, TRA has also set new rules. If a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes due to a malfunction or reasons not attributable to the passenger, or if the departure time is uncertain, passengers can choose not to travel and apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Huang Tai-sheng pointed out that if the High-Speed Rail were to follow suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to manage demand by adjusting prices. He hopes that TRA passengers will not switch to the High-Speed Rail.

It is worth noting that the TPASS commuter monthly pass is not affected by this price increase, but the government's subsidy amount will increase. Transportation scholar Chang Sheng-hsiung believes that while it will not create a financial black hole, it will indeed increase the financial burden. He explained that the increased burden mainly comes from the TRA portion, while the use of MRT, city buses, and national highway buses remains unaffected.

The Taiwan PASS offered by the Tourism Administration will also see price adjustments, with increases ranging from 5.6% to 31.5%, with the EasyGo version having the largest increase, from NT$1900 to NT$2500. This comprehensive fare adjustment means that the public will face higher costs for their daily commuting and transportation.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week"**

<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E9%81%8A-201000087.html">News Link</a>

The global semiconductor industry's annual event, "SEMICON Taiwan 2025," officially commenced on June 17. Marking its 30th anniversary, SEMI, the International Semiconductor Industry Association, announced that the exhibition will be fully upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the US-China tech war, with Trump pressing allies to bring companies back with high tariffs, major manufacturers like TSMC face even greater pressure to invest in the US. In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "pick sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional reorganization. Semiconductors have shifted from being commercial goods to strategic assets, with decision-making moving from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

With "Leading with Collaboration. Innovating with the World." as the theme for SEMICON Taiwan 2025, this year marks the debut of International Semiconductor Week. Key international forums will be held on September 8th and 9th, followed by the exhibition from September 10th to 12th. Cao Shi-lun, SEMI Global Chief Marketing Officer and President of SEMI Taiwan, stated that in the first quarter of 2025, global semiconductor equipment shipments reached $32.05 billion, a 21% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and edge computing applications, showing strong growth momentum.

However, he also stated that the industry faces challenges like supply chain restructuring and geopolitical issues. The US government is using methods such as equipment embargoes (ASML), talent cut-offs (US experts), and supply chain decoupling, forcing companies to "pick a side." Semiconductor industry professionals believe that with accelerated regional reorganization of supply chains, they need to re-evaluate production and investment plans to deal with policy risks and geopolitical uncertainties.

Regarding ongoing semiconductor tariffs, relevant industry players noted that according to Section 232 of the Commerce Department's regulations, after the Commerce Secretary initiated an investigation on April 1st this year, a report must be submitted within 270 days, meaning it will be released by December 27th at the latest. The US President then has 90 days after receiving the report to make a decision, which means the semiconductor tariff deadline will fall around March 27th next year. However, the actual situation may vary due to political considerations or the complexity of the investigation.

Diversifying operations is the best approach. TSMC, as the leading wafer foundry, is increasing its investment in the US to meet customer demand. Industry players stated that geopolitical factors are driving supply chain independence, which helps support demand for semiconductor equipment. In addition, the demand from AI/HPC applications is driving the adoption of advanced manufacturing processes (GAA), the growth of HBM demand, and the development of advanced packaging technologies, which will also increase investment in semiconductor equipment.
