Apple recently presented its new artificial intelligence (AI) features, called "Apple Intelligence," at its annual developer conference. These smart tools will be built directly into the iPhone, iPad, and Mac operating systems later this year. The goal is to make daily tasks easier and more personal for users.

The new AI allows devices to do things like rewrite text, create unique images, and summarize long emails or articles. Siri, Apple's voice assistant, will also become much smarter and more natural in conversations. It will be able to understand context better and perform actions across different apps.

A key part of Apple's strategy is privacy. The company stated that many AI tasks will be processed directly on the user's device. For more complex requests, Apple will use a secure cloud system designed to protect personal information. Apple also announced a partnership with OpenAI, allowing users to access ChatGPT directly through Siri for certain tasks, if they choose. This move marks Apple's significant entry into the rapidly growing AI competition.

**Global Heatwaves Impact Daily Life and Health**

Large parts of the world are currently experiencing record-breaking heatwaves, leading to significant challenges for daily life. Countries in Europe, Asia, and North America have seen temperatures rise to dangerous levels, causing health warnings and disruptions. This extreme weather event is affecting millions of people.

The intense heat makes it difficult for people to go about their normal routines. Outdoor activities are often cancelled, and many businesses adjust their operating hours to avoid the hottest parts of the day. Public transport can also be affected. Health authorities are advising people to stay hydrated, remain indoors during peak heat, and check on elderly or vulnerable neighbours.

Scientists explain that these frequent and severe heatwaves are becoming more common due to climate change. The increased temperatures put a strain on power grids as more people use air conditioning, and they also increase the risk of wildfires. Communities are working to adapt to these new weather patterns and develop strategies to cope with future heat events.

**Travelers Increasingly Choose Sustainable Options**

A growing number of people are now choosing to travel in ways that are more environmentally friendly and support local communities. This trend, known as sustainable tourism, is changing how destinations and travel companies operate. Travelers are becoming more aware of their impact on the planet and local cultures.

Instead of flying, some travelers prefer to take trains or buses for shorter distances to reduce their carbon footprint. When choosing accommodation, many are looking for hotels or guesthouses that use renewable energy, recycle, or source local food. There is also a greater interest in supporting small local businesses and respecting cultural traditions.

The travel industry is responding to this demand. Airlines are investing in more fuel-efficient planes, and many hotels are introducing eco-certification programs. Tour operators are offering more responsible tours that focus on wildlife conservation or community engagement. This shift suggests that sustainable travel is becoming a significant part of the global tourism industry.`;
