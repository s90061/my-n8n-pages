            <h1>Philippines to Increase Joint Sea Patrols due to China's Actions</h1>
            <p>The Philippines Navy said it will do more joint patrols with other countries. This is because China is expanding strongly in the South China Sea. More countries will also join these patrols.</p>
            <p>Roy Trinidad, a spokesperson for the Philippines Navy, said today at a press conference that China's actions change every time the Philippines and other countries do joint patrols, called "Maritime Cooperative Activities" (MCA), in the West Philippine Sea. This includes areas near Scarborough Shoal and northern Philippine islands.</p>
            <p>Trinidad said, "We have noticed that when foreign ships are in Philippine waters, China does not threaten or act aggressively."</p>
            <p>He pointed out that in 2023, the Philippines did only 3 joint patrols with friendly countries in the West Philippine Sea. In 2024, this increased to 11 times. So far this year, it has been more than 10 times.</p>
            <p>The "West Philippine Sea" is what the Philippines calls its claimed area in the South China Sea. It includes the 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone that extends from the Philippines' coast into the South China Sea. This area overlaps with the South China Sea area that China claims using its ten-dash line. The two countries have had many conflicts in these disputed waters for a long time.</p>
            <p>In November 2023, the Philippines and the United States did their first joint patrol, named "Maritime Cooperative Activity." After that, countries like Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, and India also joined. Manila sees this as international support for the Philippines' position in the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>Trinidad said that other countries have shown interest in joining. The Philippines will do joint patrols with more countries in the "West Philippine Sea" in the future.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, on August 11, Chinese warships and coast guard ships pushed away a Philippine coast guard patrol boat near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Even though two Chinese ships ended up hitting each other, experts see China using warships as a way to increase tension.</p>
            <p>When asked by reporters how the Philippine military would support the Coast Guard if similar events happen in the future, Trinidad said the military has emergency plans. There will be different ways to respond to different situations, but he did not give details.</p>
            <p>Trinidad said that China's actions will not change the Philippines' overall way of defending its sea.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei City to Announce Before Towing Illegally Parked Cars, Starting September</h1>
            <p>Today, the New Taipei City Department of Transportation announced that starting from September, there will be a one-year trial of announcing before towing illegally parked cars. This will happen every day from 9 AM to 12 PM and from 2 PM to 7 PM. However, if cars are parked illegally near schools, within 10 meters of bus stops, or in other special areas, they will be towed right away without an announcement.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Transportation explained in a press release that they have signed a new contract with towing companies this year. This contract says that all towing vehicles must have broadcast equipment. They must also broadcast a reminder before towing cars. This new rule will be tried for one year starting in September.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Transportation said that currently, towing in New Taipei City does not require a siren or broadcast. They decided to add the broadcast system to help people move their illegally parked cars faster. The department also said that to avoid disturbing people living nearby and to keep things safe and orderly, the broadcast before towing will only happen during two periods: from 9 AM to 12 PM and from 2 PM to 7 PM every day.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation reminded people that cars parked illegally in places important for pedestrian safety will be towed immediately without a broadcast. These places include areas near schools, libraries, hospitals, sidewalks, and crosswalks. Also, cars parked illegally within 10 meters before or after bus stops, cars parked next to another car (double parking), or cars parked illegally within 10 meters of an intersection will be towed right away.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation added that the broadcast before towing is a reminder and a helpful step, but it is not a necessary part of enforcing the law. The police will still issue tickets and tow illegally parked cars according to Article 56 of the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act. During the trial period, they will continue to collect feedback from everyone. The Department of Transportation also asks people to follow traffic rules and not park illegally to avoid having their cars towed.</p>
