            <h1>Shigeru Ishiba Meets Bill Gates, Promises US$550 Million for Vaccine Access</h1>
            <p>Today, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with Bill Gates, who co-founded Microsoft. They met at the Prime Minister's office. They talked about how to deal with infectious diseases in developing countries like those in Africa. Japan might give up to 550 million US dollars over the next five years to GAVI. GAVI is a group that helps make vaccines available everywhere.</p>
            <p>NHK, a Japanese TV channel, reported that Prime Minister Ishiba met Bill Gates in the afternoon at his official residence, which is the government's main building. Ishiba showed respect for Gates's hard work to fight infectious diseases in developing countries like those in Africa. He also said, "Japan wants to help too."</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Ishiba said that GAVI is working hard to give vaccines to people in developing countries, like those in Africa. He said that the Japanese government will give up to 550 million US dollars to help this work.</p>
            <p>Ishiba also said that the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) will start tomorrow in Yokohama City. He explained that the Japanese government wants to help plans that save the lives of children in Africa.</p>
            <p>After his talk with Ishiba, Gates told the media, "Prime Minister Ishiba and I discussed health issues around the world. Japan thinks this is very important." He added that Japan has many new and advanced products, and he hopes these will help improve health in Africa.</p>
            <p>Gates created a foundation to help with international problems like sickness and poverty. His foundation also supports GAVI's work. GAVI helps children in developing countries, such as those in Africa, get important vaccines.</p>

            <h1>Ability Enterprise's 60th Anniversary: Chairman says Robots and Drones will drive new growth</h1>
            <p>Today, Ability Enterprise held a big dinner for its 60th anniversary. Chairman Chang Hsiao-chi said that the company will keep focusing on car optics and AI technology. They are also working hard to enter the market for robot vision parts and drones. By 2027, they hope these new areas will make up 20% of their business. They expect to have robot orders confirmed until the second half of 2026.</p>
            <p>Ability Enterprise had its 60th-anniversary dinner at the Far Eastern Shangri-La hotel in Taipei today. Dong Jiong-hsiung, who started the Nengli Group, and his sons Dong Jun-ren and Dong Jun-yi, who are now leading the company, were all there.</p>
            <p>Ability Enterprise sees that there is a strong demand for car parts. Sales of their 360-degree cameras for cars are still growing. They have new products like infrared full-color wide-angle camera parts and Stereo 3D camera parts. They plan to start making these in small amounts in the third quarter of 2025. They will begin making money from these products from 2026 to 2027. Car camera products for Japanese cars will be made and sold in large amounts in 2026. They are also making progress with projects in Europe and continue to get new car company customers in Europe and America.</p>
            <p>Also, 2025 is thought to be the first year for human-like robots. Ability Enterprise received an order for sensors from Mantis Robotics in the US. They expect to send these products in the fourth quarter. They are also investing in Agility Robotics with Nengli Asia. They hope to work together to make robot vision parts and produce them. They want to become a supplier for robot companies in the US.</p>
            <p>Chairman Chang Hsiao-chi said that their digital camera business can still grow a lot. He believes that moving into robots and drones will be a new way to grow. He expects the company's business to increase year after year for the next three years. He mentioned that last year they spent more money to build more factories in Vietnam and add new production lines. This year, they are still investing 15 million US dollars in their factories in Liaobu, China, and in Vietnam. This will make their total production capacity 30% larger.</p>
            <p>However, this year, tariffs (taxes on goods) and exchange rates caused problems. In the first half of the year, they lost 140 million New Taiwan Dollars because of currency exchange. Chang Hsiao-chi thinks that as the tariff situation becomes clearer, their business will become steady again.</p>
            <p>He also said that they can see robot orders lasting until the second half of 2026, and the selling price of vision parts is higher. For drones, they will start selling whole drones instead of just parts. They expect to start making money from drones as early as the second quarter of 2026. Their main customers are companies that sell drones for people to use, from Europe, America, and China.</p>
            <p>Ability Enterprise believes that new products like robot vision and drones will make up 5% to 10% of their income in 2026. By 2027, they aim for these products to be 20% of their income. These new products will be a strong way for the company to grow in the future.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Arm Hires Amazon AI Expert to Develop Its Own Chips</h1>
            <p>Today, some people who know about the situation said that Arm Holdings has hired Rami Sinno. He was the director for AI chips at Amazon.com. Arm hired him to help them make their own computer chips.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Sinno helped Amazon create its own AI chips called Trainium and Inferentia.</p>
            <p>Until now, Arm has never made its own chips. Arm mostly designs the main parts and instructions for computer processors. Then, it lets other companies use its technology. Companies like Apple and Nvidia use Arm's technology in their chips.</p>
            <p>In July, Arm announced that it plans to use some of its profits to make its own chips and other parts. Rene Haas, the CEO, talked about doing more than just designing chips. He mentioned that they might start making smaller chip parts called "chiplets" and complete systems.</p>
            <p>Arm mostly earns money from fees when its customers sell products that use Arm's technology. Almost all smartphones in the world use devices based on Arm's design. Also, server chips made with Arm's special technology have made good progress in the data center market. For a long time, AMD and Intel controlled this market. SoftBank Group from Japan owns most of Arm's shares.</p>
            <p>Arm wants to make its business bigger. So, besides offering important chip technology, it is also actively making its own full design plans.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Arm has been working to make its team stronger for developing complete chips and systems. People familiar with the matter said that Arm has hired Nicolas Dube, a senior person from HPE, who has experience designing large systems. They also hired Steve Halter, a chip engineer who used to work for Intel and Qualcomm.</p>
            <p>Before joining Arm, Sinno was in charge of making AI chips at Amazon. These chips were cheaper and worked better than Nvidia's graphics processors.</p>
