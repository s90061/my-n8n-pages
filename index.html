            <h1>Typhoon Willow Approaches: Yushan Protected Area Closed, Cingjing Guest House Shuts Down</h1>
            <p>The weather office has issued a sea typhoon warning for Typhoon Willow. Because of this, the Yushan National Park office said that starting at 5:30 AM on August 12th, people cannot enter the park's protected areas. Also, the Cingjing Guest House will close from 2 PM. At the same time, people can only leave the Green Green Grassland, but not enter it. There are now only about 500 visitors.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration announced the sea typhoon warning for Willow early this morning. The Yushan National Park office said that when a typhoon warning is active, any permits to enter the park's protected areas are no longer valid during this time. After the typhoon, if people want to enter the protected area again, they must apply again. The park will announce when it is safe to enter again after the typhoon warning is lifted and damages are fixed.</p>
            <p>The Yushan National Park office asks hikers who are already in the mountains to check for new information. They should get ready for the typhoon and quickly talk to their contact person. They should plan to go down the mountain or find a safe place and leave dangerous areas right away. Hikers who have not yet started their trip should cancel their plans. This will help them avoid accidents in the mountains.</p>
            <p>According to the Yushan National Park office's data from 11 AM today, a total of 86 groups with 299 people had applied to enter the park. From these, 18 groups (83 people) were told not to go up the mountain. 8 groups (25 people) have already come down. 10 groups (22 people) are staying in safe places in the mountains. 6 groups (20 people) are finding shelter where they are. 36 groups (132 people) are on their way down the mountain. The park could not reach 8 groups (17 people) who had entered.</p>
            <p>The Cingjing Farm Guest House, managed by the Veterans Affairs Council, will close from 2 PM today. The Green Green Grassland will also only allow people to leave from 2 PM. The sheep show and horse show in the afternoon will still happen. Cingjing Farm said that it was sunny in the morning, but there were clearly fewer visitors, only about 500 people. Because the typhoon is coming, they have done more to prepare. They have cut tree branches, put tape on windows, and prepared sandbags.</p>

            <h1>KMT Lawmakers Say Most Taitung People Against Wind Power, Ask Companies to Stop Plans</h1>
            <p>Today, Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Huang Chien-pin said that the East Wind Power Company is planning to hold a meeting about how building wind farms will affect the environment in the Taitung NanHui area. He said that a survey shows more than half of Taitung residents do not support building wind farms along the coast. He thinks the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Environment should tell the company to stop this wind power plan right away. He said the plan has no public agreement and will harm the environment, so it should be canceled.</p>
            <p>KMT lawmakers Huang Chien-pin, Wu Tsung-hsien, Cheng Tien-tsai, and independent lawmaker Kao Chin Su-mei held a press conference at the Legislature this morning. They said that wind power companies are still trying to build wind farms on Taiwan's most beautiful east coast, even though many local people are strongly against it. They pointed out that more than half of Taitung residents are against having wind turbines on the east coast. They asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Environment to immediately tell the companies to stop all development.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin explained that Taiwan Asia Wind Power is leading two land-based wind power projects in Taitung, called "Dongcheng" and "Dongfeng." These plans want to put 58 large wind turbines in Chenggong Township, Changbin Township, Taimali Township, Dawu Township, and Daren Township. This has made local people very upset. They worry it will hurt the local environment, the lives of residents, and the traditional areas of indigenous groups.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin said that the wind turbines would be placed on the beautiful coastal lines of Taiwan Provincial Highways No. 9 and No. 11. If many large wind turbines are built there, the view of the Pacific Ocean, which is famous worldwide, will no longer be a beautiful natural scene. Instead, it will be a long line of big man-made fans. He said this would destroy the shared memories of all Taitung people. The many natural habitats along the coast would also be greatly harmed by the wind turbines. The low-frequency noise from the turbines might also affect the health and daily lives of residents. It could even hurt the traditional lands of indigenous people.</p>
            <p>Huang Chien-pin stated that a survey by a public trust polling company showed that 50.7% of Taitung residents do not support building wind farms on the Taitung coast. This proves that most Taitung people are against wind power that harms the coastline, and stopping it now is what the public wants. He believes the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Environment should immediately tell the companies to stop developing wind power that has no public agreement and harms the environment. They should not continue any development and should withdraw the project.</p>
            <p>Kao Chin Su-mei pointed out that the data on "Taiwan Power Company's electricity generation from different units" clearly shows that wind power is not very effective. She said that harming the western coast in the past proved that wind power is not a good source of energy. So, she asked why the government still insists on damaging Taiwan's most beautiful east coast to develop wind power that is not very effective.</p>
            <p>Kao Chin Su-mei said she strongly opposes building wind farms that are not effective. She also called on all levels of government and companies to follow the Indigenous Peoples Basic Law when doing any development that involves indigenous traditional lands or tribes. They must also make sure to respect the right of indigenous people to agree to such projects after discussion.</p>
            <p>Cheng Tien-tsai noted that the leaders and chairpersons of seven Amis tribes in Changbin Township, Taitung County, had already signed a joint statement. They asked the government and companies to immediately stop and cancel the development project. They also asked to stop all actions that the tribes have not agreed to. As an Amis lawmaker, he fully supports the four main demands of the local tribes: they are against building large wind farms on traditional lands, they ask for the Indigenous Basic Law's right to discuss and agree to be followed, and they are against separate talks and dividing the groups.</p>

            <h1>Hung Shen-han: Number of Workers Affected by Tariffs Now Estimated at 42,000, Down from 120,000</h1>
            <p>Today, Minister of Labor Hung Shen-han said that because of talks with the government, the US reciprocal tariff policy's impact has changed. The tariff rate has gone down from 32% to 20%. The number of workers who might be affected has also decreased. In April, it was thought that 120,000 people could be affected, but now it's estimated to be 42,000 people.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Executive Yuan explained the US reciprocal tariffs and plans to help industries. Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the impact on jobs from these tariffs includes things like reduced work hours or lower pay. She stressed that 42,000 people being affected does not mean all of them will lose their jobs. The government has already started different support programs.</p>
            <p>Regarding the US reciprocal tariffs, Minister of Labor Hung Shen-han wrote on Facebook today that the job impact includes various situations, such as fewer work shifts or job loss. He said that the 42,000 people affected do not all face losing their jobs. The Ministry of Labor will use its money first to help workers in affected industries who still have jobs. They will try their best to keep workers in their current jobs so they do not become jobless.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han pointed out that trade talks have changed the reciprocal tariff. In April, it was the original tax plus 32%, but by August, it was lowered to the original tax plus 20%. The talks are still ongoing. Based on expert estimates, the number of workers who might be affected has gone down from a possible 120,000 in April to a possible 42,000 now. The Ministry of Labor will not feel too happy or relaxed about this. It will still be careful and ready for any possible negative effects.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han said that Taiwan's unemployment rate in June this year was the lowest for that month since 2001. The number of people working was also the highest for that month in history. The Ministry of Labor will continue to carefully watch all job-related numbers. It will also prepare all plans to help workers deal with the effects of the reciprocal tariffs.</p>
            <p>Lastly, Hung Shen-han mentioned that the Ministry of Labor started preparing for the tariffs in April. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan also approved the "Measures to Support Workers' Stable Employment in Response to International Situations." The Ministry of Labor created these measures based on special laws. The goal is to do their best to help workers keep their jobs steady during these changing times.</p>
            <p>Hung Shen-han emphasized that the Ministry of Labor will quickly finish the legal steps needed. They will also change and improve support plans as needed. When dealing with the reciprocal tariffs, they will do their very best to help and support workers who might be affected. This will help workers face the challenge of uncertain job situations.</p>
