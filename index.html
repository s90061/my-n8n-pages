            <h1>People Against Communism in San Francisco Gather at Pier to Support "All-People's Resistance Movement"</h1>
            <p>People who are against communism in other countries have joined together to announce the "All-People's Resistance Movement Declaration." They are asking for an end to the Chinese Communist Party's one-party rule. About tens of people in San Francisco joined this event. They held peaceful activities like speeches and releasing balloons at Torpedo Wharf, which is near the Golden Gate Bridge. The people at the event asked the Chinese Communist Party to give basic rights to every Chinese person.</p>
            <p>Today, tens of people in San Francisco who are against communism joined with other cities around the world in the fog. They supported the "All-People's Resistance Movement Declaration." Fang Zheng, who survived the Tiananmen Square crackdown, and others read the declaration. People at the event gave speeches to support those who say no to the Chinese Communist Party. Wang Han, a young Chinese person, said in his speech that he hopes to fight for and protect his own rights.</p>
            <p>This event was put on by China Action and the Citizen Resistance Association. Xiang Li, a representative from China Action, said that the event's main goal is to end the Chinese Communist Party's one-party rule. She hopes to encourage Chinese people around the world to join a peaceful, non-cooperation movement.</p>
            <p>People at the event held up signs that said "Get Rid of the Communist Party" and "Judge Xi Jinping." They gathered at Torpedo Wharf, a famous place near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. The signs had both Chinese and English words, which made many people stop and watch. Wang Han said he hopes that local American people will also see what they are doing.</p>
            <p>Wang Han said that many Americans still do not know much about China. He hopes this event will help them understand how the Chinese Communist Party harms human rights.</p>
            <p>Wang Han also said that the Chinese Communist Party not only rules Chinese people very strictly but also spreads this way of ruling around the world, which is worrying. If the Chinese Communist Party invades Taiwan one day, Taiwan is the only Chinese-speaking democracy in Asia. Then the free world will face a bigger and more serious threat.</p>
            <p>At the end of the event, people let balloons go into the sky. Wang Han said that releasing balloons was a special idea for this event. It means the Chinese Communist Party should leave, and it shows people's wish for freedom.</p>

            <h1>New Nuclear Rules Could Start in October; 6 Things Needed for Nuclear Plants to Run Again</h1>
            <p>A public vote on restarting the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant Unit 3 will happen on August 23. The Nuclear Safety Council recently announced new rules for safety checks. These rules say that nuclear power plants must provide 6 important things if they want to run again. If no one disagrees, these rules could start as early as October. An official from the Nuclear Safety Council said that because all nuclear power plants in Taiwan are currently stopping operations, Taipower will need to carefully plan for staff and training. They will also need to figure out how to make all facilities work again. These will be the most important parts of getting ready.</p>
            <p>In May, the Legislative Yuan passed changes to Article 6 of the "Nuclear Reactor Facility Control Law." This change says that if a power plant wants to keep running after its license ends, the company can ask the government for a new license. This new license can be for up to 20 years.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, the Nuclear Safety Council announced the supporting new rules called "Rules for Applying and Checking Nuclear Reactor Facility Operating Licenses." These rules explain that if nuclear power plants want to continue operating in the future, they must fill out an application form for a new license and a plan to run again. They also need to include a report on checks related to radiation and a report explaining earthquake safety. The draft of these new rules is now open for public comments for 60 days. They could be officially announced in October.</p>
            <p>Taipower will start its own safety checks and peer reviews after the new nuclear management rules are officially announced. They will check if the plants are safe to restart and what the timeline and costs would be. Then, they will send this information to the Nuclear Safety Council for review.</p>
            <p>All nuclear power plant licenses in Taiwan have ended. So, it is very important to see if the plants can go back to how they were when they were operating.</p>
            <p>The Nuclear Safety Council's new rules for the restart plan list six important points:
                <br>1. The current situation of the plant site and units, and the plan's schedule.
                <br>2. Plans for organization, staffing, and training.
                <br>3. Tasks for restarting the facilities and plans for regular maintenance and checks.
                <br>4. Plans to bring back laws and documents needed for operating.
                <br>5. Plans for quality checks and inspections.
                <br>6. Other things the main government office asks for.</p>
            <p>An official from the Nuclear Safety Council explained that nuclear power plants reduce their staff when they stop operations. So, Taipower will likely spend a lot of time and effort on planning for staff, training, and making sure the facilities can operate again. For example, the Ma-anshan Nuclear Power Plant Unit 3 reactor currently has no fuel. The emergency water supply system does not need maintenance. If it needs to run again, they must make sure all related systems work as they should.</p>
            <p>As for the review time, the official said it depends on how long Taipower needs. After the Nuclear Safety Council receives all documents, they will do a safety review and checks at the site. In the past, the Nuclear Power Plant Unit 1 asked to continue operating before its license ended. This means the Nuclear Safety Council has experience with this kind of review. At that time, they also asked American experts to help with training for the review.</p>
            <p>Regarding the new rules that ask for radiation and earthquake safety checks, the official explained that Taipower already needs to do geological surveys based on new earthquake information. They also need to check earthquake risks and make necessary improvements. They also consider international experiences, such as making sure everything is safe after the Fukushima accident. Because people care a lot about earthquake safety, the new rules ask Taipower to give a full explanation of earthquake safety. This will show if their past work followed the rules. The most important thing is that safety will continue to be maintained during future operations and be open to public judgment.</p>
            <p>Also, the new rules ask Taipower to provide a report on checks related to radiation. This report must follow all related radiation laws, including the Nuclear Management Law, the Ionizing Radiation Protection Law, the Radioactive Waste Management Law, and the Nuclear Accident Emergency Response Law.</p>
