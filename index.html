            <h1>Financial Watchdog: Public Banks Offer NT$30-50 Billion in New Youth Home Loans Monthly</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced today that new "Youth Home Loan" applications approved after September 1 will not count towards a specific limit in the Banking Act. This change helps young people get home loans from public banks, as a lack of available funds was a problem before. Over the past year, public banks have provided about NT$30 billion to NT$50 billion in new youth home loans each month, which should be enough to meet the demand.</p>
            <p>Also, life insurance companies do not offer the new youth home loans. However, they do offer regular home loans. Mr. Tsai Huo-yen, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, added that six life insurance companies had NT$294.3 billion in outstanding home loans by the end of August. On September 3, the FSC met with these six companies to understand their home loan situation. The companies expect to provide an additional NT$330 billion in new home loans by the end of 2026. So, people who need home loans can also apply through life insurance companies.</p>
            <p>Article 72-2 of the Banking Act, often called the "real estate lending rule," says that commercial banks' total loans for building homes and businesses cannot be more than 30% of their total deposits and financial bonds when the loan is given. This rule makes sure that banks do not put too much money into long-term loans and real estate.</p>
            <p>In 2018, the FSC listed some types of loans that do not count towards the Article 72-2 limit. These include loans for building or buying schools, hospitals, government buildings, long-term care facilities, social housing, factories, and urban renewal projects. Loans for operating funds for construction companies working on these projects are also excluded. This means that the new youth home loan program is the first new exclusion added since 2018. The FSC officially announced this rule today, and it is effective from September 1.</p>
            <p>The media asked if removing the new youth home loans from the Banking Act's limits would cause property speculation again. Mr. Tung Cheng-chang, the Director-General of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said in a press conference that Premier Cho Jung-tai is very concerned about this. He stressed that there must be a way to check applications. There were some cases before that went against the policy's goal. So, the Ministry of Finance asked public banks to control these loans better. They improved how they check applications and review loans after they are given. They also took back more than 5,000 problematic loans.</p>
            <p>The real estate lending rule says the ratio cannot be more than 30%. Mr. Tung pointed out that banks usually have even stricter internal rules, perhaps setting it around 28.5%. Overall, the ratio for local banks under Article 72-2 of the Banking Act is 26.04%. For the eight major public banks, the ratio is 27.61%, with First Commercial Bank being higher at 28.3%. This change aims to solve the problem by excluding the new youth home loans. While it is hard to guess how many people will apply in the future, based on the past year, public banks have had NT$30 billion to NT$50 billion available for new youth home loans each month, which can meet the needs.</p>
            <p>Regarding whether the FSC has talked with the Central Bank about controlling real estate loan concentration, Mr. Tung said that all financial government departments have ways to communicate, and the FSC respects the Central Bank's power. Currently, the percentage of overdue home loans for banks is about 0.08%, which is much lower than the 0.16% for all bank loans. This shows that banks are managing real estate loans well. This exclusion is not about giving more money but about helping people use the Youth Home Loan program and not be unable to get a loan because of limits. As for individual loans for urban renewal or old building rebuilding projects, these will be treated as regular home loans and will not be loosened.</p>
            <p>The new youth home loan interest subsidy will last until the end of July next year. People are asking about this time limit. Mr. Tung said that this plan goes back to September 1. He explained that if all previous new youth home loans were excluded, the amount of money available would suddenly increase a lot, which could affect the housing market. For now, it will continue until the end of July next year. The Ministry of Finance will review the policy regularly after that.</p>
