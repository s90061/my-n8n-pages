            <h1>Tsai Ing-wen: After 2018 Difficulties, I Could Not Let the First Female President Fail</h1>
            <p>Former President Tsai Ing-wen shared a video on Facebook today. It was about an event for Taiwan Girls' Day. She said that 2018 was probably her worst time. Everyone said she would only be president for one term. At that time, she told herself that she could not lose. She thought, "I cannot let the first female president fail." So, she kept going. She wanted to show that a woman could be a very good president in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ing-wen also said that at the event, a girl asked her how to deal with "limits because of gender, and how to get over them."</p>
            <p>Tsai Ing-wen explained that when people have to make choices, there are always different kinds of limits. She said not to see these limits as problems. Instead, trying to remove these limits actually helps you grow.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ing-wen also shared how she strongly stood up after a setback. She said that 2018 (when her party lost many local elections) was probably her worst time. Everyone said she would only be president for one term. At that time, she told herself, "I must not lose this fight. This is the first time a woman is president. I cannot let the first female president fail." So she kept working hard. She wanted to prove that a woman can be a very good president in Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>IMF Report: Taiwan's Economy Expected to Grow by 3.7% in 2025</h1>
            <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced today in Washington that they have raised their prediction for Taiwan's economic growth in 2025 to 3.7%. Also, the IMF has raised its prediction for global economic growth this year. This is because the effects of taxes on imports and financial conditions are not as strong as they first thought.</p>
            <p>In its newest "World Economic Outlook" report, the IMF thinks Taiwan's real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow by 3.7% this year. This is more than the 2.9% they predicted in their April report. For 2026, their prediction has gone down to 2.1% from 2.5% in April.</p>
            <p>The report also says that the yearly increase in consumer prices for Taiwan will be 1.7% this year, which is less than the 1.8% they predicted in the April report. Next year, the yearly increase in consumer prices will be 1.6%, which is the same as the April report.</p>
            <p>Regarding unemployment, Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected to stay at 3.4% for both this year and next year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the IMF's new report also said that the United States recently signed trade agreements with some big economies. This stopped former US President Donald Trump's original threat of large taxes on imports from happening. Also, other countries did not fight back with their own taxes. Because of this, the IMF has raised its global growth prediction for the second time since April.</p>
            <p>The IMF now predicts that the world's real GDP will grow by 3.2% in 2025. This is higher than the 3.0% they predicted in July and also better than the 2.8% from April. The IMF still expects global economic growth to be 3.1% in 2026, which is the same as their July prediction.</p>
            <p>But the IMF also warned that Trump might start the trade war between the US and China again. This could greatly slow down how much the world produces.</p>
            <p>Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist at the IMF, said that taxes on imports were lower than expected. Also, the world economy was helped by companies being flexible, importing goods earlier, and quickly changing supply chains. Furthermore, Europe and China used financial help, the US dollar became weaker, and there was a lot of investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI). These things also helped.</p>
            <p>Gourinchas said, "Overall, the situation is not as bad as we worried. But it is worse than we thought a year ago, and not as good as we need."</p>
            <p>Based on the IMF's main prediction, the US economy is still strong. Its growth rate for 2025 is expected to be 2.0%, which is a little higher than the 1.9% predicted in July. For 2026, the US GDP growth is expected to be 2.1%. This is also a small increase from July's prediction, but it is still lower than the 2.8% from 2024.</p>
            <p>The Eurozone's growth prediction also went up a little, from 1.0% in July to 1.2%. This happened mainly because Germany increased its spending and Spain continued to show strong economic activity.</p>
            <p>Japan's growth rate prediction for 2025 went up a lot to 1.1%, which is more than the 0.7% predicted in July. For 2026, the growth rate is expected to go down to 0.6%, but this is still 0.1% higher than the July prediction.</p>
            <p>The IMF's prediction for China's growth has not changed. It is expected to be 4.8% in 2025, mainly because exports have increased. However, the IMF noted that this might not continue. For 2026, the predicted growth rate is 4.2%.</p>

            <h1>Bloomberg: EU May Make Chinese Companies Share Technology to Boost Local Industries</h1>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported from Brussels today that the European Union (EU) is thinking about new rules. If Chinese companies want to work inside the EU, they might have to share their technology with European companies. This plan aims to make EU industries stronger and more competitive.</p>
            <p>People who know about this plan said it would apply to companies wanting to enter important markets like cars and batteries, and other digital and manufacturing industries. The plan might ask companies to use a certain amount of EU products or workers. They might also need to add more value to their products inside the EU. Making companies form joint ventures (working together with an EU company) is also an idea they are thinking about.</p>
            <p>The same people said that these rules are expected to start in November. Technically, they will apply to all companies that are not from the EU. The main goal is to stop Chinese factories from becoming too powerful and hurting European industries.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg also pointed out that the EU is using similar methods to China's "protectionism" to fight against Beijing. This might cause China to react strongly, and it could hurt the trade relationship between the EU and China, which is still very important for both sides.</p>
