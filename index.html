            <h1>HTC's New AI Glasses Make Stock Price Rise; Pre-orders are Strong for Black Ones</h1>
            <p>HTC has launched its new VIVE Eagle AI smart glasses. After this, the company's stock price went up a lot, more than 60%, reaching 70 New Taiwan Dollars. Taiwan Mobile, the only phone company selling these glasses, said today that many people are pre-ordering them. About 80% of these customers chose more expensive monthly plans, costing NT$1399 or more. The black color is the most popular, followed by gray. This has helped Taiwan Mobile earn more money from each customer and increased the share of 5G revenue to 66% in the second quarter of 2025.</p>
            <p>Huang Chao-ying, who is in charge of global sales for HTC VIVE, believes that the VIVE Eagle will sell more than any other VIVE product in HTC's history. Lin Dong-min from Taiwan Mobile explained that people in Taiwan like the HTC VIVE Eagle AI glasses a lot because of three main reasons. First, many people in Taiwan wear glasses, so they are more open to smart glasses. Second, the VIVE Eagle AI glasses have useful features like smart translation, scene recognition, and quick answers. These features help Taiwanese people who like to learn new things. Third, it is the first product made with Traditional Chinese as a key feature and uses popular AI systems like Google Gemini, which makes it easier to use.</p>

            <h1>Government Will Immediately Give NT$63.6 Billion to Local Governments After Budget Bill Passes</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan passed an additional budget bill. This bill includes money for general payments to people, more support for businesses, and funds for local governments. The Executive Yuan, which is Taiwan's Cabinet, said that it will immediately send NT$63.6 billion to local governments. This money is for general support, as the Legislative Yuan asked.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan approved an additional budget of over NT$81.9 billion. This money is for things like local government support, payments for not cutting down trees, and better pay for soldiers. However, about NT$5.9 billion was cut from the budget. This includes NT$1.5 billion for the Central Election Commission for managing elections, NT$280 million for the Ministry of Culture, and NT$401.46 million for advertising from different government departments. On the other hand, a special budget of NT$60 billion for fixing damage from Typhoon Doksuri and heavy rains on July 28 was fully approved, though some of its use is on hold.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said that the government is sad that NT$5.9 billion was cut from the budget. But she also thanked the Legislative Yuan for passing the disaster recovery budget without cuts. She mentioned that Premier Cho Jung-tai had talked with Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu about this special law before. The Executive Yuan hopes that this way of talking and working together between different political parties can continue in the future.</p>

            <h1>Thailand's Prime Minister Paetongtarn Removed From Office, Hurting Shinawatra Family's Power</h1>
            <p>Today, Thailand's Constitutional Court decided to remove Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her job. Six judges voted for it, and three voted against it. She had only been in office for about one year. The court said she did not follow moral rules. This decision is a big problem for the Shinawatra family's political power and might cause new troubles in Thailand.</p>
            <p>Paetongtarn, who is 39 years old, is the youngest daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, a former Prime Minister. She was the youngest Prime Minister Thailand ever had. In the last 20 years, there have been many political problems in Thailand. Paetongtarn is the sixth Prime Minister from her family, or supported by her family, to be removed by the military or the courts.</p>
            <p>The court said that Paetongtarn broke moral rules during a phone call in June with Hun Sen, the former Prime Minister of Cambodia. This phone call was later shared online. In the call, she called Hun Sen "Uncle" and called a Thai military leader her "opponent." Many people in Thailand, especially those connected to the powerful military, were very angry about this.</p>
            <p>Some conservative politicians in Thailand said that Paetongtarn was too respectful to Cambodia and made the military look weak. Her main political partner then left her government, which almost made the government fall apart. Several senators then complained about her to the Constitutional Court. They said she did not meet the "clear honesty" and "moral standards" that ministers must have, and that she should be removed. The court stopped her from working as Prime Minister on July 1st.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional Court wrote in its decision that Paetongtarn's leaked phone call with Hun Sen went against moral rules. It also said that she cared more about her personal interests than the country's interests, which damaged Thailand's good name and made people lose trust. The court's statement said, "It seems the defendant's personal relationships matched Cambodia's side, and the defendant was happy to follow Cambodia's wishes."</p>
            <p>Today, Paetongtarn said that she was trying to help the country during her phone call with Hun Sen. After the court removed her, she told reporters, "My intention was for the country, not for myself. It was to save people's lives, both civilians and soldiers."</p>
            <p>Because of the court's decision, the Thai Parliament now needs to choose a new Prime Minister. But this might take a long time because Paetongtarn's party, Pheu Thai, is losing power and it is hard for them to keep their weak group of allies together in the House of Representatives. The current acting Prime Minister, Phumtham Wechayachai, and the Cabinet will continue to manage the government until a new Prime Minister is chosen. There is no set time for when this election must happen.</p>
            <p>There are five people who could become the next Prime Minister. Only one of them is from the Pheu Thai party: Chaikasem Nitisiri, who is 77 years old and used to be the Justice Minister. However, he does not have much experience in government and usually stays out of the public eye in politics. Other people who might become Prime Minister include Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former Prime Minister who led a military takeover in 2014, and Anutin Charnvirakul, a former Deputy Prime Minister whose party left Paetongtarn's government after the phone call was leaked.</p>
