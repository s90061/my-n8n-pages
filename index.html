            <h1>US and China talks finished; China says they agreed to extend the break from tariffs</h1>
            <p>Officials from the United States and China finished two days of talks today. They were trying to fix money problems and stop a trade war from getting worse. China said that both sides agreed to continue a deal they made in mid-May. This deal stopped new taxes on goods for 90 days. But China did not say when this extension would start or how long it would last.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the talks did not lead to any big new agreements. However, Li Chenggang, a trade official from China, said that both countries want to extend the 90-day deal. This deal, made in mid-May, stopped new taxes on goods. But it is not clear when the extension will begin or how long it will last.</p>
            <p>These discussions might help set up a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year. But President Trump said he did not ask for the meeting. Chinese officials also did not talk about it.</p>
            <p>For many months, President Trump said he would put high taxes on goods from other countries. Now, he has made trade deals with places like the European Union and Japan. But talking with China is harder. China is a very strong economy and controls most of the world's rare earth metals. This makes the talks with the US very difficult.</p>
            <p>In May, the US and China stopped plans to add very high taxes on each other's goods. This prevented a full stop in trade between them. But if they cannot agree, world trade and money markets could become unstable again.</p>
            <p>To show how important these talks are, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today said the world economy might grow more. But they also warned that if the taxes on goods go up again, it could be a big problem.</p>
