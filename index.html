            <h1>Prime Minister Ishiba Meets Bill Gates, Promises US$550 Million to Help Spread Vaccines</h1>
            <p>Today, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba met with Bill Gates, who helped start Microsoft. Mr. Gates visited the Prime Minister's office. They talked about how to fight infectious diseases in developing countries like those in Africa. Japan might give up to 550 million US dollars over the next five years to GAVI, a group that helps spread vaccines around the world.</p>
            <p>NHK, a Japanese TV station, reported that Prime Minister Ishiba met Bill Gates in the afternoon at the Prime Minister's office, which is like the government's main building. Mr. Ishiba showed his respect for Mr. Gates' efforts to stop infectious diseases in developing countries, especially in Africa. He also said that Japan wants to help with this important work.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Ishiba said that GAVI is working hard to give more vaccines to people in developing countries, including those in Africa. He stated that the Japanese government will give up to 550 million US dollars to support this in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ishiba also said that the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) will start tomorrow in Yokohama city. He shared that the Japanese government hopes to help with plans that will save the lives of children in Africa.</p>
            <p>After his meeting with Prime Minister Ishiba, Mr. Gates told reporters that they discussed global health problems. He said that Japan cares a lot about these issues. He also mentioned that Japan has many new, advanced technologies that he hopes will help improve health in Africa.</p>
            <p>Mr. Gates created a foundation that provides international help for problems like diseases and poverty. This foundation also supports GAVI's work, which helps children in developing countries, such as those in Africa, get important vaccines.</p>

            <h1>Canon's 60th Anniversary: Robots and Drones to Drive New Growth</h1>
            <p>Today, Canon Inc. held a dinner to celebrate its 60th anniversary. The chairman, Zhang Xiao-qi, said that the company will continue to focus on optics for cars and AI technology. Canon is also working hard to enter the market for robot vision modules and drones. By 2027, they hope these new areas will make up 20% of their business. They believe they have clear orders for robot-related products until the second half of 2026.</p>
            <p>Canon's 60th-anniversary dinner took place today at the Far Eastern Shangri-La Hotel in Taipei. Dong Jiong-xiong, the founder of the Nori Group, and his two sons, Dong Jun-ren and Dong Jun-yi, who are taking over the business, were all there together.</p>
            <p>Canon sees that the demand for car-related products is strong. Sales of their 360-degree cameras for cars are still growing. New products like infrared full-color wide-angle camera modules and Stereo 3D camera modules will start test production in the third quarter of 2025. These new products will start bringing in money from 2026 to 2027. Car camera lenses for Japanese cars will start being made in large amounts and shipped in 2026. Projects in the European market are also moving forward, and Canon is continuing to find new car company customers in Europe and America.</p>
            <p>Also, 2025 is seen as the first year for human-like robots. Canon has received an order for sensors from Mantis Robotics in the US, and they plan to ship these by the fourth quarter. Canon is also investing in Agility Robotics with Nori Asia. They want to work together on making robot vision modules and hope to become a supplier in the American robot market.</p>
            <p>Zhang Xiao-qi said that there is still room for digital camera sales to grow. He believes that getting into robots and drones will be a new way for the company to grow. He expects the company's business to increase year by year over the next three years. He mentioned that last year they spent more money to expand production in Vietnam and add new production lines. This year, they are continuing to invest 15 million US dollars in their factories in Liaobu, mainland China, and Vietnam. This will increase their total production capacity by 30%.</p>
            <p>However, this year, tariffs (taxes on goods) and exchange rates have caused problems. In the first half of the year, the company lost 140 million New Taiwan Dollars due to exchange rate changes. Zhang Xiao-qi thinks that as the uncertainty about tariffs goes away, the company's operations should become stable again.</p>
            <p>He also pointed out that orders for robots are clear until the second half of 2026, and the price per unit for vision modules is higher. For drones, Canon will move from just supplying parts to shipping whole drones. This will start bringing in money as early as the second quarter of 2026. Their main customers will be drone brands for general consumers in Europe, America, and China.</p>
            <p>Canon expects that new products, like robot vision and drone-related sales, will make up 5% to 10% of their total income in 2026, and they aim for 20% in 2027. This will give a strong boost to their business growth in the future.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Arm Hires Amazon AI Expert to Develop Its Own Chips</h1>
            <p>Today, people who know about the situation said that Arm Holdings has hired Rami Sinno, who was in charge of AI chips at Amazon.com. This move is to help Arm make its own computer chips.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Mr. Sinno helped Amazon create its own AI chips called Trainium and Inferentia.</p>
            <p>Until now, Arm has never made its own chips. Arm's main job is to design the basic structure and instructions for computer processors. Then, they let other companies use their technology. Companies like Apple and Nvidia use Arm's technology in their own chip products.</p>
            <p>In July, Arm announced that it plans to use some of its profits to make its own chips and other parts. CEO Rene Haas spoke about moving beyond just designing chips. He mentioned that they might also develop small chip parts called "chiplets" and complete systems.</p>
            <p>Arm mostly earns money from fees paid by customers who sell products using Arm's technology. Almost all smartphones around the world use devices based on Arm's designs. Also, server chips made with Arm's special technology have made good progress in the data center market. This market has been controlled by AMD and Intel for a long time. SoftBank Group from Japan owns most of Arm's shares.</p>
            <p>To grow its business, Arm is not only providing important chip technology but also actively working on its own complete design plans.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Arm has been trying to make its team stronger for developing full chips and systems. People close to the company said that Arm has hired Nicolas Dube, a high-level person from HPE with experience in designing big systems. They also hired Steve Halter, a chip engineer who used to work at Intel and Qualcomm.</p>
            <p>Before this, Mr. Sinno was in charge of making AI chips at Amazon. These chips were cheaper and worked better than the graphics processors made by Nvidia.</p>
