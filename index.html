Food prices are still going up for families, even though overall inflation is slowing down. In April, food cost 2% more than it did a year ago. Some specific items, like olive oil and chocolate, have become much more expensive. This increase is happening because farmers face high costs for things like energy and fertilizer. Also, bad weather and problems with international shipping, such as issues in the Red Sea, make it harder and more expensive to get food to stores. Because of these rising costs, people are trying to save money by buying cheaper brands or looking for special offers and discounts. Experts believe that food prices will continue to increase, but they expect the rate of growth to be slower than before.

**Companies Call for More Employees to Return to the Office Full-Time**

More large companies are now asking their staff to work in the office every day, five days a week. This is a big change from the "hybrid" work models that became popular during the pandemic, where people worked partly from home. Company leaders believe that working together in person helps employees create new ideas, work better as a team, and learn from more experienced colleagues. However, some employees prefer the flexibility of working from home and might even start looking for different jobs if they are forced to return to the office full-time. Although more people are going back to the office now, the number is still lower than before the pandemic. This new trend of a full return to the office is especially strong in industries like banking and technology.

**Popular European Destinations Fight Back Against Too Many Tourists**

Many famous cities in Europe, such as Venice, Amsterdam, and Barcelona, are facing problems because too many tourists visit them. This issue, known as "overtourism," leads to very crowded places, higher prices for people who live there, and harm to local culture and the environment. To deal with this, these cities are now taking steps to fix the situation. For example, Venice has started asking day visitors to pay a small fee to enter the city. Amsterdam has stopped new tourist shops from opening and is trying to move its famous red-light district. Barcelona is reducing the size of tour groups and planning to close a local airport to limit flights. Florence wants to stop new short-term apartment rentals in its city center. Also, some Greek islands are now limiting how many people can come from cruise ships. The main aim of these changes is to make tourism more sustainable and improve life for the people who live in these popular cities.
