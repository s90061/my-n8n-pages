            <h1>US Puts 39% Tax on Swiss Goods, Swiss Official Sees Hope in Talks</h1>
            <p>After the US President Trump put a high tax of 39% on goods coming from Switzerland, the Swiss Vice President, Guy Parmelin, said today that he had "good talks" with important US officials. He did not share many details.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Parmelin, who is also the Minister of Economic Affairs, returned home after his talks in Washington. He said he saw a "real chance" for the two countries in the future.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Trump announced that Swiss goods sent to the US would have a tax of up to 39%. This surprised Switzerland. It was one of the highest new taxes Trump put on goods from many countries.</p>
            <p>In early August, the Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter and Parmelin quickly went to Washington. They wanted to talk about making the tax situation better. But their short meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not change things. Rubio was not in charge of tax policy.</p>
            <p>After his most recent trip, Parmelin wrote on X (a social media platform): "I had good talks with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington."</p>
            <p>He added: "Switzerland sees a real chance for both countries in the future, and we want to make our economic partnership stronger."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs did not share details of the talks. This was for "strategic reasons related to the negotiations," according to the Swiss News Agency (Keystone-ATS).</p>

            <h1>New Ebola Outbreak in Congo: 15 Dead Out of 28 Suspected Cases</h1>
            <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has announced a new outbreak of the Ebola virus in its southern Kasai province. This outbreak has already caused at least 15 deaths.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that tests done at the National Institute for Biomedical Research in Kinshasa, the capital of DRC, showed that this outbreak involves the most dangerous type of Ebola virus.</p>
            <p>The government of DRC is also dealing with new and worse fighting in the eastern part of the country. On top of this, the US has cut its financial help, making DRC's health system, which is already very weak, even more in danger.</p>
            <p>The DRC's Ministry of Health announced the new Ebola outbreak after a 34-year-old pregnant woman in the Kasai province was the first person confirmed to have the disease.</p>
            <p>Last month, this woman was taken to the hospital because she had symptoms of a bleeding fever. She died a few hours later because many of her organs stopped working.</p>
            <p>The DRC Ministry of Health said that this new outbreak might have caused 15 deaths among 28 people who showed symptoms. Among those who died were four health workers.</p>
            <p>This is the 16th time the DRC has had an Ebola outbreak. Health Minister Samuel-Roger Kamba said that about 53.6% of people who get the disease are expected to die, which shows how serious the situation is.</p>
            <p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is very likely that more cases will appear.</p>

            <h1>Gaza City Tower Destroyed by Airstrike; Israeli Army Says Hamas Used It for Monitoring</h1>
            <p>Today, Israel used an airstrike to destroy a tall building in Gaza City. This is the second tall building hit in two days. The Israeli army had previously told people to move south to a "safe area" because they were planning an attack on the center of Gaza City.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that for several weeks, Israel has been warning about a new attack on the largest city in the Palestinian territory. However, they did not say when it would happen.</p>
            <p>Israel has increased its airstrikes and ground actions in the areas around Gaza City. This has caused worries that the already bad situation could get even worse.</p>
            <p>Witnesses and AFP journalists said that Israeli planes dropped thousands of leaflets today in several neighborhoods in western Gaza City. These leaflets asked residents to leave.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Bassal, a spokesperson for Gaza's civil defense group, told AFP that 24 Palestinians died today because of Israeli attacks. Five of these people died near a center that gives out aid west of Khan Yunis.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said today that they attacked a tall building in Gaza City. They stated that the Palestinian group Hamas was using the building to "watch" Israeli forces. They also added that they took "steps to reduce harm to civilians."</p>
            <p>Witnesses identified the building as the "Sussi" residential building and said it was completely destroyed.</p>
            <p>Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz shared a video that showed the building, which was about 15 stories high, falling down in smoke and dust.</p>
            <p>Hamas criticized the attack and said they do not use homes or civilian buildings for military purposes.</p>
