            <h1>School Year to Start: Pingtung Police Tell University Students "Don't Trade Your Diploma for an Accident"</h1>
            <p>The new school semester is coming soon. The police in Pingtung have looked at traffic accidents involving university students between January and August this year. There were more than 3,600 such accidents. The police have made a video to promote safe riding called "Don't trade your diploma for an accident." It uses real accident scenes to teach students how to drive safely.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Police Department reported that from January to August this year, there were 3,650 road accidents involving university students aged 18 to 22. These accidents caused 2,147 injuries or deaths. Compared to the same period last year, the number of accidents went down by 549, and the number of injuries and deaths went down by 392. Overall, the numbers are decreasing, but there are still many accidents.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Police Department said in a press release today that many new university students use motorcycles for the first time. They might not have enough driving experience, might not know the roads well, or might not know about defensive driving. This often causes accidents. To make university students aware of the dangers of riding, the police made the safety video "Don't trade your diploma for an accident." It uses real accident scenes and strong messages to help students learn correct driving habits.</p>
            <p>The video explains, "If you don't yield when turning, it's not just breaking a rule, it can also kill." It also says, "Wait three more seconds for a lifetime of peace." The video uses lively language to remind young riders, "Speed does not guarantee safety. Being fast doesn't mean you'll arrive safely; going slow gives you a chance to get there safely."</p>
            <p>Police looked at common reasons for accidents. These include not keeping a safe distance while driving, turning vehicles not yielding to straight-ahead vehicles, distracted driving, and running red lights. This shows that many students, after getting their driver's licenses, still don't fully understand driving safety.</p>
            <p>Pingtung police ask everyone to be careful. They will continue to stop people for serious traffic violations like driving without a license, dangerous driving, speeding, and running red lights. This is to keep students safe and maintain good traffic order around schools.</p>

            <h1>Defense Department May Change Name to War Department; White House Seeks Ways to Follow Trump's Idea</h1>
            <p>After US President Trump asked to change the name of the Department of Defense to the Department of War, his team is working hard on plans for this. The Wall Street Journal reported that White House officials said this change might need approval from Congress. However, the White House is looking for other ways to make this idea happen.</p>
            <p>The Department of Defense is the biggest part of the US federal government. Reuters reported that Greg Steube, a Republican member of the House of Representatives from Florida, has suggested this change in a yearly bill about defense policies. This shows that some Republican members in Congress support Trump's idea.</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said, "As President Trump said, our military should focus on attacking, not just defending. This is why the President wants the Pentagon to focus on fighting forces, not on policies about diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI), or 'woke' ideas. Please stay tuned!"</p>
            <p>Trump has often suggested this idea since he became president. On August 25, he said, "When it was called the War Department, we won all our wars. We won everything."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that on that day, when Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung in the Oval Office, he said the old name "sounds stronger." He also said the change would happen "in about a week." Trump was talking about wars the US fought before World War II ended and the Department of Defense was created.</p>
            <p>A former official said that the Pentagon started preparing legal proposals for this change in the first few weeks of Trump's second term. One idea was to ask Congress for permission to use the old name during a national emergency. Also, they wanted the top civilian official of the Department of Defense to use the title "Secretary of War" again.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the White House did not give many details about this plan. However, they strongly supported what Trump said this week about the US military's ability to attack.</p>
            <p>The US War Department slowly changed into the Department of Defense after many changes. This change began with the National Security Act, passed in 1947. This law brought the Army, Navy, and Air Force together into one organization called the "National Military Establishment."</p>
            <p>An update passed in 1949 officially named it the "Department of Defense." This created the structure it has today.</p>
            <p>Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth are working to make the US military look tougher. They are also making other changes, such as removing several high-ranking military officers who did not agree with Trump.</p>
            <p>Also, the Trump government tried to stop transgender people from joining the military and asked transgender people already serving to leave. The Pentagon said that transgender people are not suitable for military service, but civil rights groups said this was not true and was illegal discrimination.</p>
