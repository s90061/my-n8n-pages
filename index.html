            <h1>New Dabeng Elementary School Playground Opens in New Taipei, a New Landmark for Flying High</h1>
            <p>The "Dabeng Spreading Wings and Soaring" children's playground recently opened at Dabeng Elementary School in Wanli District, New Taipei City. It means that the school is like wings, helping children to bravely spread their wings and fly freely. It not only helps children develop physically and mentally but also provides a happy place that is safe, creative, and educational.</p>
            <p>Principal Xu Jiahong of Dabeng Elementary School told reporters today that the new playground, which opened recently, was designed by all the teachers and students. The name "Dabeng" (meaning a large bird spreading its wings) was the main idea. Next to the slide and swings, there is a large bird with open wings. This symbolizes children spreading their wings and flying with confidence, just like the bird.</p>
            <p>The school said that the design follows the Ministry of Health and Welfare's "Safety Rules for Children's Playgrounds." It includes climbing ropes, climbing slopes, slides, horizontal ladders, and swings. These facilities are both safe and challenging, meeting the needs of children of different ages. They help children develop physical fitness, balance, coordination, and social skills through play.</p>
            <p>Principal Xu Jiahong said that playing is the most natural way for children to learn. The new playground lets students explore, work together, and challenge themselves in a safe environment. They also learn to understand others and help each other. She thanked the Education Bureau and everyone who supported the school in creating an inclusive playground that has educational meaning and local spirit.</p>
            <p>Wanli District Mayor Huang Pangmian said in a press release that the local government is working hard to improve school facilities and the quality of learning. The opening of Dabeng Elementary School's playground not only helps the students and teachers but also gives local residents a good place to relax. It encourages families to spend time together and helps the community grow.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City Councilor Zhou Yaling of the Democratic Progressive Party also praised the school's efforts. She said that education should start from daily life, and this kind of space is where children begin to grow.</p>

            <h1>Sanae Takaichi Becomes LDP President, Japan's Three Main Business Groups Show Hope</h1>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi, a senior member of Japan's parliament, was chosen today as the new head (president) of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Leaders from Japan's three major business groups â€“ Keidanren, Keizai Doyukai, and Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry â€“ said they have high hopes. They wish she can create a stable government.</p>
            <p>Japan's TBS TV reported that Yoshinobu Tsutsui, the head of Keidanren (which includes large Japanese global companies), spoke about Takaichi's past important roles, like being the minister in charge of economic security. He described her as "a politician who knows a lot about many policies, including economy and foreign affairs."</p>
            <p>However, Tsutsui also said, about how to deal with the many problems in Japan and abroad: "We hope that the ruling group, mainly the LDP and Komeito party, can quickly and surely make policies happen and create a stable political situation."</p>
            <p>Mutsuo Iwai, a senior member of Keizai Doyukai, mentioned that Japan might have its first female prime minister. He said, "This is a chance to bring many different ideas into national politics."</p>
            <p>But Iwai also stressed, "The most important thing is to get rid of the political distrust caused by ongoing money issues in politics and to build trust with the public again."</p>
            <p>Ken Kobayashi, the head of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (which includes small and medium-sized businesses), said, "We strongly hope that the party will work together, build a strong political base, and show strong leadership at the same time."</p>

            <h1>KMT and TPP Congratulate Sanae Takaichi, Hope for Deeper Exchange</h1>
            <p>Sanae Takaichi has been chosen as the president of Japan's LDP. She might become Japan's first female prime minister. Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) have both sent their congratulations. They hope to keep making their relationship with the LDP stronger. Many lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties have posted photos with Sanae Takaichi. They hope Takaichi will follow former Prime Minister Abe's policies and help Taiwan and Japan be good friends.</p>
            <p>The results of Japan's LDP presidential election were announced today. Sanae Takaichi won against her opponent, Shinjiro Koizumi, in the second round. She is now the 29th president of the LDP. It is expected that the parliament will name her as Japan's first female prime minister.</p>
            <p>KMT spokesperson Yang Chih-yu said that the KMT sends its sincere congratulations to Sanae Takaichi for becoming the LDP president. The KMT hopes to keep improving its relationship with the LDP under Takaichi's leadership, based on the friendship between the two parties over many decades.</p>
            <p>The TPP said in a statement that they offer their sincere good wishes to LDP President Sanae Takaichi. Japan is a long-time friend of Taiwan. The TPP hopes there will be more chances to work together in the future to make the friendship between Taiwan and Japan stronger.</p>
            <p>Many lawmakers also shared pictures with Sanae Takaichi on social media and congratulated her. Wang Ting-yu, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said in both Chinese and Japanese that with Sanae Takaichi, who follows former Prime Minister Abe's ideas, Taiwan and Japan's friendship can reach new heights. This is very good news.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Chiu Yi-ying said that Sanae Takaichi led a group to visit Taiwan in April this year. Chiu Yi-ying and Sanae Takaichi talked deeply about Taiwan-Japan relations, safety in the region, and working together on trade. Chiu also thanked Sanae Takaichi for always helping Taiwan and Japan be friends and for strongly supporting their democratic partnership.</p>
            <p>Chiu Yi-ying also said that Sanae Takaichi strongly supports the policies of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. She believes that under Sanae Takaichi's leadership, Taiwan and Japan will work and communicate even more closely. Chiu herself will work hard to help Taiwan and Japan be good friends and create a successful and peaceful future together.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Chen Kuan-ting said that Sanae Takaichi winning shows that Japanese society is very worried about safety in the region. As China's military power grows, Japanese voters and political leaders have strongly agreed to choose Sanae Takaichi, who has clear views.</p>
            <p>Chen Kuan-ting said that Taiwan and Japan should use this special chance. They should change their good friendship into a strong partnership with real meaning. They should first work more closely on things that are not about traditional safety. For working together on the economy, Taiwan's strong semiconductor industry and Japan's plan for economic safety can fit together perfectly. Together, they can build strong technology and safe supply chains for democratic countries.</p>
