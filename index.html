            <h1>Poor Woman Sold to Brothel Asked Not to Support Her Old Father; Court Said Father Was Not Involved and Refused</h1>
            <p>A poor single mother with a disability from Taitung asked the court to free her from supporting her father. She said her father drank too much alcohol and did not take care of her when she was young. She also said he sold her to a brothel. Her father said he was busy making money and did not have much time for the family. He also said his wife sold their daughter, and it was not his fault. The court decided in favor of the father.</p>
            <p>The 91-year-old father lives in a nursing home in Taitung. The cost of the nursing home is NT$31,800 per month. After government help, he still needs about NT$15,000 each month. So, he asked his youngest daughter to pay for some of these costs.</p>
            <p>The youngest daughter asked the Taitung District Court to remove her duty to support her father. She said that when she was 4 years old, her father drank a lot and did not care for the children. She and her three older sisters often did not have food. Their grandmother had to give them meals. When she was between 14 and 15 years old, her parents sold her to a brothel. She tried hard to escape, and a neighbor called the police. Because of this, her mother went to prison.</p>
            <p>The youngest daughter also said she has a moderate disability and is from a low-income family. She is a single mother and has to support her two adult sons who are still in school. One of her sons has a mental and physical disability. She said she can barely pay her rent now. She hoped the court would free her from supporting her father.</p>
            <p>The man's third daughter also came to court and said that the money their grandmother used to support them came from selling spirit money. She said, "I never saw my father give money to my grandmother."</p>
            <p>The third daughter also said that her oldest sister and second sister were also sold. She knew clearly what happened. She saw that her oldest sister took her youngest sister to the brothel, but she knew that their father made all the decisions in the family. No one dared to go against him. She said it was the father who told the oldest sister to take the youngest sister away.</p>
            <p>The father told the court that at that time, he asked his mother to help take care of the children. He said he gave the money he earned to his mother. He said his family was very poor, and he was too busy working to take care of the children. He also said that his son-in-law and wife were the ones who sold the youngest daughter to the brothel, and it had nothing to do with him.</p>
            <p>The court checked the records and found that the man's wife, Ms. Lin, was indeed sent to prison for selling three daughters. When the prosecutor questioned her, Ms. Lin admitted that she sold her daughters without her husband's permission. She said that selling her daughters was her own act and not related to her husband or anyone else.</p>
            <p>About the father not supporting his daughters, the judge thought that even if the daughters did not see their father giving money to their grandmother, it does not mean the father did not give money.</p>
            <p>The judge believed that the daughter's claims against her father were not strong enough. Also, the judge found no proof that the father purposely abused, seriously insulted, or physically or mentally harmed his daughters. So, the court rejected the daughter's request to be free from supporting her father. This case can still be appealed.</p>

            <h1>AI and Net-Zero / Lu Shiow-Yen Visits Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre to Make Taichung Stronger</h1>
            <p>Changing to digital ways is already happening in many industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching "net-zero" carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and companies. These are very important for Taiwan's future ability to compete. CNA's reporting team is looking closely at how the government and different industries are using AI to make work better and create new green ideas. They are seeing Taiwan's industries improve again.</p>
            <p>Taichung International Convention and Exhibition Center is expected to open by the end of this year. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-Yen, who is visiting Australia, went to the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre yesterday. She wanted to learn how they run their center. She hopes to use their good experiences and ideas about lasting development to make Taichung's center better and more competitive in the world.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government released a press release today. It said that on August 8, Mayor Lu Shiow-Yen focused on convention and exhibition centers. She visited the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre in Queensland's capital city. She learned about new ways the center uses for sustainable operation, smart management, and helping the city grow.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that the Taichung International Convention and Exhibition Center has been built over many years. It will start operating by the end of this year. In the future, it will be an important place for exhibitions and meetings in central Taiwan. It will be very important for improving industries, growing the economy, and making Taiwan more known around the world.</p>
            <p>She also said that the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre is the second largest exhibition center in Australia. For many years, it has worked hard on green operations, sustainable buildings, and connecting with the local community. For example, the center uses systems to save energy and reduce carbon. It also uses renewable energy and reuses food waste. These actions show that the center cares about and practices ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance). This was very impressive.</p>
            <p>Taichung City Government's Economic Development Bureau said that the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre is in the South Bank cultural area, which is in the city center. The Queensland government paid for the entire building. The company ASM Global runs the center and brings in events. The center opened in 1995. Every year, it holds more than 1,000 meetings, exhibitions, shows, and banquets. On average, over 700,000 people from Australia and other countries visit it each year.</p>
            <p>Also, Mayor Lu met with Brisbane Mayor Adrian Schrinner and City Council President Sandy Landers. They talked about different topics, such as the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games, public transport, building parks, and preventing floods and disasters.</p>

            <h1>Added Equal Tariffs; Machine Tool Association: We Agree, Hope Government Negotiates</h1>
            <p>The United States has started to use equal tariffs. Taiwan's temporary tax rate is 20%. The Trade Administration said that Taiwan must add this 20% to the original Most Favored Nation (MFN) tax rate for goods. Any anti-dumping or anti-subsidy taxes must also be added. The Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry (TAMI) said they understood this would happen. They hope the government can talk with the US through diplomatic ways. This way, they can get the best results for Taiwan's industries.</p>
            <p>TAMI said that when the US announced a temporary equal tariff rate of 20% for Taiwan, they already believed that the tax rate would not just become 20%. Instead, it would be an extra 20% added to the existing Most Favored Nation tax rate.</p>
            <p>TAMI pointed out that this added tariff on exports to the US will greatly affect the machine tool industry. They hope the government can help make product classifications clear. This would help companies get special tariff benefits. They also hope the government will suggest ways to deal with this during the changeover period.</p>
            <p>TAMI also hopes the government can help the industry move faster with "double transformation." This means using AI technology to change to digital ways and also to become greener. They want to build an industry system and set up rules for machine tools and a center to check machine tool products.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, TAMI wants the government to continue providing help for developing international markets. They also ask for business loans and lower interest rates. This would help companies build more locations overseas quickly. They also hope the government will combine resources from industry, government, and schools. This would help find international partners and make the machine tool industry strong and able to recover quickly.</p>
