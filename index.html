**Are Loans for Land Use Right Cases Difficult Due to Credit Rules? Central Bank Clarifies**

The Central Bank of Taiwan has explained why it might be difficult to get loans for properties where you only own the building, not the land (called superficies). Some people thought this was because of the bank's rules to control lending.

The Central Bank clarified that its lending rules do not apply to everyone. For example, young people buying their first home, people who inherited a house, or those buying a new house after selling an old one can still get loans more easily.

However, banks might be careful with loans for properties that don't include land ownership. This is because owning only the building can make it harder for banks to decide how much to lend.

**Dalai Lama Announces Reincarnation Will Continue; Beijing Says Chinese Laws Must Be Followed**

The Dalai Lama has announced that the tradition of finding his next life (reincarnation) will continue. He stated that only he has the right to choose who will be the next Dalai Lama.

However, China's government said that the next Dalai Lama must follow Chinese laws and religious rules. They also said the new Dalai Lama must be found inside China. China believes it has the right to approve the successor, based on history.

Many Tibetan people are not sure about China's role in choosing the next Dalai Lama. The current Dalai Lama also wrote in his new book that China should not interfere. He said Tibetans should not accept someone chosen by China for political reasons.
