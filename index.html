            <h1>Namasia Roads Are Cut Off; Premier Cho Calls Mayor Chen, Central Government Will Help</h1>
            <p>Recently, there have been heavy rains in southern Taiwan. Because of landslides, many roads leading to Namasia District in Kaohsiung City are blocked. Supplies can only be carried in by walking. A government official said that Premier Cho Jung-tai was worried because strong rains are expected again in the next two days. He wanted to visit the area himself, but he decided not to go yet so he would not stop the rescue work. So, he called Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai to check the situation. They learned that over 300 families in Namasia District are safe at home, and they have enough supplies.</p>
            <p>Heavy rains continue in southern Taiwan. The Central Weather Bureau today continued to issue warnings for heavy or very heavy rain. From early morning to morning tomorrow, there will be more heavy rain in areas south of Taichung. The recent continuous heavy rains have caused flooding, landslides, and mudslides. In Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and 9 townships including Sanhemen in Pingtung County, schools and offices will be closed on August 3rd. The Central Emergency Operation Center raised its alert level to Level 1 at 9 PM.</p>
            <p>Many roads connecting to Namasia District in Kaohsiung City are blocked due to landslides. For now, supplies are being carried in on foot. A government official stated that Premier Cho Jung-tai was concerned about the ongoing rain in the south. Besides listening to reports, he also called Mayor Chen Chi-mai immediately. He originally wanted to visit the disaster area to understand the situation himself. However, because the rain is still heavy and the mountains are unstable with loose soil, he decided to wait for these two days to avoid affecting the rescue efforts. Premier Cho has asked the relevant government departments to help fully. Mayor Chen Chi-mai thanked Premier Cho for his concern for the area.</p>
            <p>The government official also said that after checking with Kaohsiung, it was confirmed that transport to Namasia is cut off, but all 300+ families in the Namasia mountain area are safe, and there are no problems with supplies. A local person from Kaohsiung said that besides food, some local people had asked for baby formula earlier, and it was delivered this afternoon.</p>
            <p>Because of the ongoing heavy rain in southern Taiwan, the government official said that Premier Cho Jung-tai has not planned any visits for today and tomorrow to avoid affecting rescue work. But he will go to the Central Emergency Operation Center at 9 AM tomorrow. He plans to talk by video call with the local governments of Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County to get updates on the disaster caused by the southwestern air flow on July 28th.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also reminded people on Facebook tonight that the Weather Bureau predicts heavy rain for a short time again tomorrow. This includes heavy rain or local downpours in areas south of Taichung, a chance of local downpours or more in mountain areas of Kaohsiung and Pingtung, and local heavy rain in northern and southeastern areas in the afternoon. He reminded people not to go into mountain areas if it's not necessary these days. The central and local governments will continue to work hard to prevent disasters and help people get through this difficult time together.</p>

            <h1>South African Politician: Taiwan's Chip Rules Will Hurt South Africa's Economy Twice</h1>
            <p>CAIRO (CNA) â€“ To respond to the South African government breaking an agreement and lowering the status and changing the names of two Taiwanese offices, Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently announced it would consider limiting chip exports to South Africa. Ryan Smith, a spokesperson for South Africa's Democratic Alliance, said that with the uncertain import taxes from the United States, Taiwan's plan to limit chips will hurt South Africa's economy in two ways.</p>
            <p>Since October last year, the South African government has sent two letters asking Taiwan's offices to move out of the capital city of Pretoria. While talks were ongoing, the South African Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) website changed the name of Taiwan's representative office to "Taipei Liaison Office" and put it under "International Organizations." Also, the office's address was changed to Johannesburg. Then, on July 21 this year, South Africa issued another public notice, changing the names of the two offices to "Taipei Liaison Office in Johannesburg" and "Taipei Liaison Office in Cape Town."</p>
            <p>Because of what the South African foreign ministry did, Taiwan's representative office in Pretoria (which is like an embassy) and the office in Cape Town will completely lose their ability to handle diplomatic tasks like giving out passports, visas, and certifying documents.</p>
            <p>Ryan Smith, a member of parliament and international relations spokesperson for the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's second-largest ruling party, recently wrote on the party's official website. He said that South Africa is now going through a hard time negotiating a trade agreement with the United States. But the Foreign Minister, Ronald Lamola, decided on his own to lower the status and change the name of Taiwan's offices and ask them to move from the capital. This was "not necessary," and now South Africa faces a second problem: Taiwan may limit the import of semiconductor chips.</p>
            <p>Smith said that these limits could put tens of thousands of jobs in South Africa at risk. The South African car industry relies on Taiwanese chips. Each year, it exports about 300 billion South African Rand (about 495 billion New Taiwan Dollars) worth of car products worldwide. This creates tens of thousands of jobs in South Africa.</p>
            <p>Smith strongly criticized the situation. He said that the South African government's main task now should be to create a strong economic plan to make the economy better and to fix the rising number of people without jobs. However, the African National Congress (ANC), which leads the national unity government (GNU), is putting its own party's interests first. It refuses to follow a real "non-aligned foreign policy" as planned by the government.</p>
            <p>Smith further explained that asking Taiwan to move its offices at this time is not a foreign policy that cares about the country's well-being. Instead, it is a foreign policy that gives in to party political interests to gain benefits for itself, and it severely harms the country's economy.</p>
            <p>Smith emphasized that South Africa's future economic growth needs semiconductor chips. So, South Africa cannot afford to follow a foreign policy that forces it to be unfair to its trade partners.</p>
            <p>Smith asked the South African government to talk with the Taiwanese government as soon as possible to make sure they can get this very important and irreplaceable technology.</p>
            <p>The Democratic Alliance is very friendly to Taiwan. After the general election in July last year, it became the second-largest ruling partner in South Africa's first ever "national unity government" (GNU). It now holds 12 positions in 32 government departments.</p>
            <p>Ivan Meyer, the federal chairperson of the Democratic Alliance, was punished by China in February this year because he visited Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Also, Li Chong-wei, a South African lawmaker of Taiwanese descent who is also from the Democratic Alliance, told CNA that South Africa exports a lot of valuable metals to Taiwan every year. So, South Africa could think about raising the import tax on these valuable metals as a way to respond.</p>
            <p>Li Chong-wei also said that the United States is South Africa's second-largest export market, after China. The US now charges South Africa a 30% tax, which hurts a lot. Also, China's economy is not doing well now, so it will buy less. This means that exporting valuable metals to Taiwan is quite important for South Africa.</p>
            <p>The Economic Division of the Taiwan Representative Office in South Africa stated that in 2024, the total amount of valuable metals South Africa exported to Taiwan reached 1.25 billion US dollars (about 37.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars), and the import tax was 5%.</p>
            <p>Li Chong-wei said that Taiwan can buy the valuable metals it needs from other countries like the United States, Canada, India, or Australia. Also, because the New Taiwan Dollar is stronger against the US Dollar now, if Taiwan buys from the United States, it can also help reduce the trade imbalance between Taiwan and the US.</p>

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Taiwan Barely Beats South Korea; Coach Says "Doing Our Best Is a Great Game"</h1>
            <p>TAINAN (CNA) â€“ In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Taiwan played against South Korea today. The game lasted four and a half hours and went into the 9th extra inning. Taiwan finally won 11 to 5. They will play South Korea again tomorrow for third place. Coach Chang Tzu-chien said that in this game, everyone kept trying and did not give up. "Doing our best is a great game," he said.</p>
            <p>The last game of the U12 Baseball World Cup Super Round was between Taiwan and South Korea. The game was stopped for a short time because of rain. Both teams fought hard until the 9th extra inning. In the top of the 9th inning, Taiwan's hitters played very well and scored 7 runs at once. South Korea only scored 1 run in the bottom of the 9th. Taiwan won the game.</p>
            <p>After the game, Taiwan's head coach Chang Tzu-chien said that everyone worked hard in this game. When the game was paused because of rain, he kept encouraging and reminding the players to stay focused and not lose their energy. He was also confident that they could win this game.</p>
            <p>Coach Chang said that in this game, he felt that everyone tried their best, no matter what. They did not give up and kept going until the end. There were hard times during the game, but the team worked together and supported each other. He was very moved that they could win.</p>
            <p>Because the United States beat Japan in another game, Taiwan will not play in the championship game. The result of Taiwan's game against South Korea decided who they would play next. Taiwan won, so Japan and the United States will play for the championship. Taiwan will play South Korea again for third place.</p>
            <p>Coach Chang said that at the beginning of the competition, they hoped to play in the championship game. Even though the result was not what they wanted, everyone tried their best during the games. "As long as we try our best, it's a great game," he said.</p>
            <p>Today's game finished around 10:45 PM. But because they are worried about more rain, the championship game and the third-place game tomorrow will start at 10 AM at two different places. Coach Chang said that winning today's game has greatly helped the team's spirit. Because of the game schedule, he will pay special attention to the players' energy. He hopes they can play a good game.</p>
