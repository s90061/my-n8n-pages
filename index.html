Taiwan will combine two major exercises in July: the Han Kuang military exercise and the Urban Resilience exercise. Simply put, in times of crisis or war, when the military is focused on combat and unable to assist with major civilian disasters, local communities must be able to "save their own hometowns." National security officials stated that the goal for July is to inform the public that defense resilience is not solely the military's responsibility; every civilian partner, especially non-military departments, must also be involved. Officials noted that this year, by combining the Han Kuang and Urban Resilience exercises, they aim to link the military's response to enemy forces with non-military preparations.
