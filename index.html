**Stanford University Group Visits Human Rights Commission to Talk About Workers' Rights**

A group of students and professors from Stanford University's Hoover Institution visited Taiwan's National Human Rights Commission today. They talked mainly about protecting the rights and well-being of migrant workers and fishers. They also discussed caring for fishers and making sure the fishing industry is good for the environment and the economy.

The Human Rights Commission said that since it started, it has always made migrant workers' rights a top issue, especially for those in difficult situations and for fishers. They have already written three reports on these topics.

The students asked many questions about human trafficking, unfair treatment of workers from other countries, and fees paid to agents. One member of the Human Rights Commission, Wang Mei-Yu, said that "flags of convenience" ships (FOC) make it hard to protect the rights of fishers, and this is an important problem to solve. Another member, Ji Hui-Jung, mentioned that recently, groups in Taiwan have asked for WiFi on long-distance fishing boats to help foreign fishers communicate better. Even though the government has a plan to help, not many boats have WiFi yet. The commission is also worried about foreign fishers getting their pay directly and having easy ways to complain. They hope the problems with "flags of convenience" ships can be solved soon.
