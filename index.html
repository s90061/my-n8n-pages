            <h1>Egypt's Foreign Minister: Hamas Will Not Have Any Role in Gaza's Future</h1>
            <p>Egypt's Foreign Minister, Badr Abdelatty, said today that Hamas will not have any role in the future of Gaza. He is an important person who helps solve problems between Israel and Palestine.</p>
            <p>He said this as Hamas is thinking about President Trump's peace plan. Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has openly supported this plan.</p>
            <p>At a meeting in Paris, Abdelatty stated, "Hamas has no role in the future."</p>
            <p>He also said, "We, Arabs and Muslims, all agree on this. Even people inside Hamas know very well that they will not have any role. This is true."</p>
            <p>However, he added, "We should not give anyone an excuse to kill so many innocent people every day, using Hamas as a reason."</p>
            <p>"This is ethnic cleansing and genocide happening now. Enough is enough, truly enough."</p>

            <h1>US Treasury Secretary: Next US-China Talks Should Have Big Progress</h1>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that the leaders of the United States and China will meet in South Korea at the end of the month. Their trade teams will also talk. He believes that because the two leaders will talk face-to-face, this round of talks should be the best and will have important breakthroughs. China is buying less soybeans from the US, but other countries will buy more to make up for it.</p>
            <p>On the CNBC financial TV show, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent spoke about the meeting between the US and Chinese leaders. He said that the most important thing will be a meeting about policy. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet in South Korea at the end of the month. Bessent also said, "I will lead the talk team to speak with China's Vice Premier (He Lifeng)."</p>
            <p>Bessent pointed out that direct talks between the two leaders are very helpful for setting up plans and moving trade forward. This makes it much easier for the talk teams. Both sides have agreed to continue their trade agreement for 90 days, which ends on November 10th. He believes that with Trump leading and the relationship between Trump and Xi, this round should be the best and will have big breakthroughs.</p>
            <p>He said that both sides can continue talking, for example, about China buying US farm products. In January 2020, during Trump's first time as president, the US and China made a trade deal. China agreed to buy more than 50 billion US dollars worth of farm products and did so that year. But after former President Joe Biden became president, China did not continue to buy these products.</p>
            <p>Bessent once asked Chinese officials in Geneva why they stopped buying US soybeans and other products. They only answered with one word: "Biden."</p>
            <p>Bessent stressed that high-level Chinese officials used American farmers, especially soybean farmers, as a way to gain advantage in the talks. More than 90% of American farmers support Trump. China is buying fewer US soybeans, but some of this will be covered by trade deals with other countries. Almost all of the US's deals with other countries include buying farm products.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Fall as OPEC+ May Produce More and US Government Stays Closed</h1>
            <p>Oil prices fell today to their lowest point in almost five months. This happened because OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries, is expected to agree to produce more oil at their meeting this weekend. Also, the US government is still closed, which makes people worried about the economy and want to play it safe.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil for delivery in November went down by 2.1%. It is now $60.48 per barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
            <p>Brent crude oil from the North Sea, for delivery in December, dropped by 1.9%. It is now $64.11 per barrel in London.</p>
