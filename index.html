            <h1>Man Arrested for Setting Up "Metaverse" Investment Platform and Suspected of Illegal Fundraising</h1>
            <p>Last year, a man named Liao and others created an investment platform called "Metaverse." They are suspected of illegally collecting money. Yesterday, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office ordered the Investigation Bureau and Taipei City Police to search three different places. They also questioned seven people, including Mr. Liao. After questioning, the prosecutor decided today that Mr. Liao and an employee named Hong should be held in custody and not allowed to see visitors.</p>
            <p>The investigation found that Mr. Liao and his group created the "ETmeta Metaverse" platform. They held meetings to invite people to invest in something called "ETM coin." They told people that if they kept ETM coin for 1 day, they could earn 1% profit. If they kept it for 10 days, they could earn 1% to 2% profit every day. They also said people could take their money back any time, and ETM coin could be exchanged for Tether.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that many people started investing in January last year. At first, they received interest from their investments. But by September last year, the platform stopped paying out money. That's when people realized they had been tricked. In total, 16 investors have reported the case.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office told the Fujian Province Investigation Office and the Taipei City Criminal Investigation Division to search three places, including the homes and offices of Mr. Liao, Ms. Hong, and others. They also questioned Mr. Liao, Ms. Hong, one person accused named Xu, and four witnesses.</p>
            <p>After questioning them all night, the prosecutor believes that Mr. Liao and Ms. Hong might have broken laws related to banking, fraud, and money laundering. Their crimes are serious, and there is a risk they might work together to hide things. So, today, the prosecutor asked for them to be held in custody without visitors. The other people accused and witnesses were allowed to go home.</p>

            <h1>Frequent Disputes over Fake Learning Portfolios; Student Group Calls for Stronger Academic Ethics Education</h1>
            <p>Recently, some students had their university admissions canceled by National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University because their learning portfolios were not true. Today, the student group EdYouth released a report about the 108 curriculum. They suggested that academic honesty education should be stronger for learning portfolios. They also want students to say when they use AI in their work.</p>
            <p>EdYouth held their 4th report presentation today about the 108 curriculum. Ten students worked together on the report. From June 4th to July 18th, they collected information from 1004 high school student surveys and did 54 interviews. They looked at nine main topics, including AI and information education, mental health support at school, technical and vocational education, and high school entrance exams for general high schools.</p>
            <p>Lee Bing-xun, a student from Soochow University and one of the main writers, talked about a new "3+2 vocational college program" that the Ministry of Education is promoting. This program is for vocational high school students to continue their studies at vocational colleges. However, some national vocational universities offer only a few spots, and some even have very high requirements to get in. This new program takes 4 years and 150 credits to get an associate's degree. Students might not be very interested in it, and many vocational high school students don't even know about this new system.</p>
            <p>For information education, Lee Bing-xun said the report shows that 94% of students have used AI tools that create content in class. Also, 88% of students think schools should teach them how to use these AI tools correctly and responsibly. At the moment, high school computer classes are often optional, lectures, or just experiences. The depth of the courses, teaching, and support systems are not enough. Also, the courses don't have clear instructions, and teaching about AI knowledge and ethics is weak.</p>
            <p>Chen Yin-chia, another main writer and a student from National Chengchi University, said that 34.6% of students believe different teachers have different standards for checking students' course work in their learning portfolios. 75.9% of students think that after the deadline for checking work has passed, students should still be allowed to redo their course work. This would give students a chance to make their work better for the university departments they want to apply to.</p>
            <p>Recently, a high school student was accepted into the medical department at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, but their application documents were not true. Another high school student was accepted into the medical department at National Taiwan University, but their science fair project did not follow research rules. Both students had their university admissions taken away.</p>
            <p>Chen Yin-chia also mentioned that the report suggests that in the future, learning portfolios should include stronger education on academic honesty. When teachers guide students to create small research papers, science fair projects, written reports, or results from projects, they should focus on teaching academic honesty. Also, teachers should encourage students to say when they use AI in their learning portfolios. This will help students understand how to use AI tools that create content as a helpful tool in the right way.</p>
            <p>Feng Yu-chieh, a student from Taipei Digital Experimental High School, said that 47% of students do not agree that local language classes help them become more interested in local languages. However, 36% are not happy with the teaching materials, and 30% are not happy with the classes themselves. The report suggests creating local language courses and materials that are organized, local, and useful for daily life. It also suggests improving teacher training, increasing teachers' professional skills and pay, and making classes more interactive. This would help avoid relying too much on online classes.</p>
