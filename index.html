            <h1>Nanyang Industries: Watching Tariff Changes, Taiwan Car Market Needs to Grow</h1>
            <p>Nanyang Industries, part of Sanyang Industry, held an event today to show new Hyundai cars. Looking at the car market in Taiwan, Nanyang Industries said that so far in September, some orders have increased. This is because a tax reduction plan for goods helped customers who didn't buy cars in the past two months to decide to buy now. However, the whole market has not grown much. Things will become clearer once the issue of tariffs (taxes on imported goods) is decided.</p>
            <p>Zhan Xing-sheng, an executive vice president at Nanyang Industries, said that changes in tariffs are still a concern. These changes can affect the whole economy and also make people less likely to buy cars. The market is still watching to see if tariff changes will cause big problems for the economy. But people still need commercial vehicles (like vans or trucks) no matter what.</p>
            <p>Zhan Xing-sheng added that Nanyang Industries continues to bring in new business travel vehicles and large commercial vehicles. They hope to sell more of these.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that about 3,500 luxury business vans with 9 seats are sold each year in Taiwan. For large commercial trucks with 3 seats, about 650 are sold each year. For heavy commercial vehicles weighing more than 5 tons, about 11,000 are sold each year.</p>

            <h1>ASEAN Finance: OBI Pharma's Human-like Antibody Gets Patent in Thailand</h1>
            <p>Today, OBI Pharma received a notice from a patent office. Their human-like antibody called Anti-CÎµmX (also known as FB825) has received a patent in Thailand. The patent is named "Anti-CÎµmX Antibody That Can Bind to Immunoglobulin E on Human B Lymphocyte Membranes." The patent number is 109715.</p>
            <p>OBI Pharma said that the Academia Sinica owns this patent. However, OBI Pharma has a special right to use this patent. This means they can make, use, and sell products related to this patent.</p>
            <p>According to OBI Pharma's official website, FB825 has already received patents in major countries for making medicine, like the United States, the European Union, Japan, and China. This creates strong patent protection around the world for the medicine, how it works, and where it targets. In August this year, OBI Pharma's sales were 9.758 million New Taiwan Dollars, which is 11.32% less than last year. For the first eight months of the year, sales were 78.993 million New Taiwan Dollars, which is 4.26% more than last year.</p>
