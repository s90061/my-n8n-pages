Lithuania's Defense Minister said that the Philippines is showing the world how China acts aggressively in the South China Sea. This shows that China is not as peaceful and friendly as it pretends to be.

The Philippines started an action called "Transparency Initiative" in 2023. They have been sharing videos of China's actions in the disputed waters. The Minister said that using water cannons on peaceful fishermen and hitting Philippine ships are not peaceful acts.

The Minister also supported a former Philippine senator. This senator was punished by China for speaking against China's aggressive actions and for making laws about Philippine territory in the South China Sea. The Minister also said that she and her family have been punished by China for speaking against them. She added that China often uses pressure and threats.
