The Ministry of Agriculture's Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency is working with the Taitung County Government. They are creating a place where people can buy and use local wood, helping to recycle and reuse resources. This project aims to turn local wood from fallen trees and other sources into materials for building, furniture, and crafts. This will help small businesses and promote sustainable use of wood.

**NVIDIA H20 Chip Ban Lifted, Boosting NVIDIA's Earnings and Taiwan's Supply Chain**

NVIDIA's CEO, Jensen Huang, announced that the U.S. has approved the sale of the H20 chip, a lower-spec AI chip, to China. This is good news for NVIDIA's finances because the company had already recorded large costs related to H20 inventory. The H20 chip was designed for the Chinese market to follow U.S. export rules. The lifting of the ban means NVIDIA can now sell chips that were previously held back, which is expected to reduce losses. This news also helps the spirits of Taiwan's supply chain companies like TSMC, Shuanghong, and Inventec.
