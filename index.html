            <h1>Hungkuang University Students and Teachers Help Remote Areas Learn Together This Summer</h1>
            <p>Taichung, August 25 (CNA) Students and teachers from Hungkuang University's Department of Elder Welfare and Long-term Care went to remote areas this summer. There were 22 of them. Their goal was to help old people learn and serve the community. They planned many different classes for local elementary school students and older adults. This helped different generations learn together and pass on local culture.</p>
            <p>Hungkuang University released a press statement today. It said that the Department of Elder Welfare and Long-term Care held a five-day summer camp at Zhongshan Elementary School in Dongshi District, Taichung City. The camp was called "Generations Learning Together x Local Culture." It included classes on understanding old age, making crafts, local culture, pictures of grandparents and grandchildren, and teaching children about healthy food.</p>
            <p>They connected with local culture by teaching children about Hakka culture stories. They also had activities where children could experience what it's like to be old. This helped children understand the difficulties older people face in their daily lives.</p>
            <p>Assistant Professor Hsu Meng-jue from the Elder Welfare Department said that they hope university students can go into communities. This way, students can learn outside of books and see what Taiwan's aging society and education in remote areas are really like. Most importantly, they want to create a "three-together" model: good together, included together, and built together with the local community.</p>
            <p>On the first day of the summer camp, university students helped children "get to know older people." The children used colorful clay to make models of their grandparents. They learned about their own grandparents and shared their stories. In the activities to experience old age, children wore special equipment to act like older people. They played games to understand how aging can make it hard to move, see, or pick up things. This helped them truly feel what daily life is like for older people.</p>
            <p>The camp invited a local Hakka culture teacher to share "The Story of Bo Gong" (the Earth God). They also led the children in playing with Hakka bamboo toys. This helped the children learn about local stories and Hakka culture.</p>
            <p>The university student volunteers for the camp were first-year students and students from their second to fourth years in the Elder Welfare Department. They shared that they used their knowledge of elder welfare and long-term care that they learned in school. They also had training and practiced the activities beforehand to lead the children and older adults. By volunteering in the community, they not only learned how to lead activities but, more importantly, learned to respect, listen, and connect with the unique aspects of each community.</p>

            <h1>Singapore Fights E-cigarettes, Lists Etomidate as a Drug</h1>
            <p>Singapore, August 25 (CNA) The problem of e-cigarettes in Singapore is getting a lot of attention. The Singapore government is now treating e-cigarettes as a drug problem, especially because of a substance called "Etomidate" found in them. They are increasing efforts in law enforcement and education to deal with this issue.</p>
            <p>Singapore banned e-cigarettes in 2018. However, recently, "Zombie Pods" (Kpods) that contain Etomidate have caused public concern.</p>
            <p>Lianhe Zaobao newspaper reported that Singapore's Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said at an event that Etomidate will be listed as a Class C drug under the "Misuse of Drugs Act."</p>
            <p>The fact that Etomidate and other harmful, addictive substances are being mixed into e-cigarettes and sold has caused worry. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong recently said at a National Day rally that the government will treat e-cigarettes as a drug problem. They will greatly increase law enforcement and education to fight this.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong said that for people addicted to e-cigarettes, the government will help them quit through supervision and recovery programs. They will also start a big public education campaign. This campaign will begin in schools and universities and also include National Service.</p>
            <p>The report stated that e-cigarettes with Etomidate are commonly called "Zombie Pods." They can harm the health of users. They may cause serious side effects like feeling sick, throwing up, uncontrolled muscle twitches, or confusion. In some cases, they can even cause organs to fail or lead to death.</p>
            <p>Now that Etomidate is a Class C drug, users must go through mandatory supervision and treatment. Repeat offenders will be taken to court and could face at least one year in prison. Those who sell, distribute, or bring these e-cigarettes into the country will face even stronger punishments, which might include caning.</p>
            <p>Users will have a health check at the National Addictions Management Centre. Depending on how strong their addiction is, patients might be sent to an outpatient program to quit their addiction. There, they will get help in private or in groups.</p>
            <p>The report also said that to stop e-cigarettes from entering the country, Singapore's border checkpoints (by sea, land, and air) increased their checks last week. In five days, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority found 184 cases involving e-cigarettes. They seized more than 850 e-cigarettes and related items.</p>
