            <p>(CNA reporter Lin Qiaolian, Pingtung County, July 26) The final competition of the 2025 Taiwan Cup Rocket Competition is happening from July 25 to 27 in Xuhai, Mudan Township, Pingtung County. Today, the Pingtung County Government held a live broadcast party. County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi and local people watched the rocket launch live and saw drone performances. They saw this exciting moment together.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Government held the live event for the rocket competition finals today at the Pingtung County Stadium. Chou Chun-mi and Yu Hsien-cheng, the deputy director of the National Space Center, pressed the rocket launch button together. This showed that Taiwan's first rocket competition finals officially began.</p>
            <p>The county government said that the live broadcast let people at the stadium see the exciting moment of the rocket launch at the same time. After that, Chou Chun-mi visited different booths for science education. She joined teachers and students to try activities. These included learning how rockets work, interacting with AI, and experiencing VR space adventures. She felt the fun of learning science. This showed Pingtung's effort to teach everyone about space.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that this first rocket competition is not only the first national rocket competition held in Taiwan. It is also the first large-scale rocket competition seen in Asia. In total, 56 teams from all over Taiwan signed up to compete. 15 teams made it to the finals. After the last review, only 10 teams were chosen. Pingtung Science Experimental High School successfully advanced. They became the pride of the host area.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi pointed out that Pingtung is a good place to develop space technology. It is at a similar latitude to Houston, USA. It also has a large open area and is near the sea. In March this year, the National Science and Technology Council announced that the national rocket launch site will be in Jiupeng Village, Manzhou, Pingtung. They also plan to build a "Space Village." This village will combine transport, education, industry, and daily life services. It will help the whole Hengchun Peninsula become a center for rocket technology in Taiwan.</p>

There were interactive booths like "AI Rocket Badge Creation," "VR Space Experience," "Acetylene Rocket Principle Demonstration," and "Flight Lab." On July 27, the winners will be announced.
