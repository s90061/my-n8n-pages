            <h1>Hualien Lake Water Level Goes Down; Guangfu Township Starts Flu Shots on October 1st</h1>
            <p>The blocked lake in Matai'an Stream in Hualien is overflowing. Today, the Central Emergency Operations Center's forward office said that Guangfu Township will start giving flu shots tomorrow. Local people and volunteers will get the shots. Also, the water level of the blocked lake is still going down and is now stable.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Central Emergency Operations Center's forward office held a press conference. Different groups shared the latest updates. Lai Chien-hsin, the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs and chief coordinator, said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Hualien County Health Bureau are working together. Guangfu Township will begin giving vaccines tomorrow. People who can get the vaccine include Guangfu residents, volunteers and soldiers helping with disaster relief, and other groups helping with the rescue.</p>
            <p>If Guangfu residents have lost their ID or are not on the list, they can still get the vaccine by providing their ID number to check.</p>
            <p>Lai Chien-hsin said that for urgent daily needs like water and electricity, the related groups are still providing and restoring them. For lunchbox delivery, people can pick them up at certain spots. If anyone knows about older people living alone or others who need help, please deliver lunchboxes to them when you pass by. The office will make changes based on the situation and add more places for urgent lunchbox delivery. Local volunteer cooking groups will also help in the future.</p>
            <p>Huang Chun-tse, the head of the Hualien Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, Ministry of Agriculture, said that drones checked the Matai'an Stream blocked lake at 7:40 AM today. The water level was 1020.5 meters, the lake area was 12.8 hectares, and the water storage was 5.95 million tons (yesterday it was 6.10 million tons). This is a little less than yesterday, and it is 6.5% of the original water volume. It has been confirmed that the blocked lake is still overflowing and not blocking the river again. It is now stable.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Labor: Sun Lung Express Driver Can Apply Again for Full Work Injury Benefits</h1>
            <p>Today, the Republic of China Occupational Injury Victims Association protested outside the Ministry of Labor. They asked for the remaining work injury death benefits for a Sun Lung Express truck driver to be given quickly. The Ministry of Labor answered that people can apply to the Bureau of Labor Insurance. If the benefits are approved, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will also give a comfort payment.</p>
            <p>The Occupational Injury Association stated that Lu Zhi-wei, a Sun Lung Express truck driver, had brainstem bleeding while delivering goods to the Taiwan Glass factory at noon on March 31, 2017. He was taken to the hospital, but he died in May. In the first court trial, the judge believed the Ministry of Labor's report. It said Lu Zhi-wei's death was not due to overwork from a job injury, and the family lost the case. In the second trial, the High Court asked National Taiwan University Hospital to check again. They confirmed that the cause of death was strongly linked to his work, and the court changed its decision, so the family won.</p>
            <p>However, after winning the case, the Occupational Injury Association applied to the Bureau of Labor Insurance for the remaining 10 months of work injury death benefits (they had already received 30 months of regular death benefits). But the Bureau of Labor Insurance refused to pay, saying it needed a final decision from the third trial. The association asked the Ministry of Labor not to delay care because of the need for a third trial. They said the ministry should give the payments after the first trial, like in the RCA case.</p>
            <p>The Occupational Injury Association criticized that the first trial's report was wrong. This caused the family's justice to be delayed for about 3,000 days. They said the Ministry of Labor should not favor what employers say. It should prioritize what workers and their families say.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor said that in this case, the work-injured worker's family won the civil lawsuit against the company for work injury compensation in the second trial. If the worker's family has new evidence, they can apply to the Bureau of Labor Insurance. The Bureau of Labor Insurance will look at the information. If new evidence is found, it will restart the review process according to Article 128 of the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>
            <p>For help related to the worker's family, the Ministry of Labor will ask local work injury experts to offer help. If the Bureau of Labor Insurance later approves the occupational illness or death benefits, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration will give a comfort payment.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor said that this case was investigated for possible overwork by labor inspection groups. The company was punished by law for breaking labor laws. During the investigation, they collected as much evidence as possible. They talked to other drivers who had similar work. They also used information given by both the company, the worker, and the family. All this information was used to write the report.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Labor stressed that after looking at the second trial's decision, there were no big differences in the facts that the labor inspection groups accepted at that time. The only difference was the medical opinion from National Taiwan University Hospital, which the court asked for later, compared to the earlier judgment on whether this case was a work-related illness. The ministry did not only use the employer's words and ignore what the family said.</p>

            <h1>Memory Price Increase Causes Stock Rally; Adata Reaches 18-Year High</h1>
            <p>Memory prices are expected to keep going up. Because of this price increase, the stocks of memory companies, like Adata, are all rising. Adata's stock price went up to its daily limit of 157 NT dollars during the day. This is the highest it has been in 18 years and 8 months. Apacer's stock price reached 72.8 NT dollars, the highest in over 17 months.</p>
            <p>TrendForce, a market research company, expects that in the fourth quarter, prices for both DRAM (Dynamic Random-Access Memory) and NAND Flash (storage memory) will rise at the same time. General DRAM prices are expected to go up by about 8% to 13% in the fourth quarter. If High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is included, the increase could be from 13% to 18%.</p>
            <p>For NAND Flash, TrendForce expects that prices for all types of NAND Flash products will go up in the fourth quarter. This is because many urgent orders for enterprise-level Solid State Drives (SSDs) are coming in, making the market move a lot. The average increase will be about 5% to 10%.</p>
            <p>As memory prices are expected to keep rising, memory companies' businesses should get even better. This will also push up the stock prices of companies like Adata. Adata's stock price hit its daily limit of 157 NT dollars during trading, which is the highest price since January 2007. Apacer reached 72.8 NT dollars, its highest price since mid-April last year.</p>
            <p>Nanya Tech's stock reached 75 NT dollars during the day, going up by 5.63%. Phison's stock reached 695 NT dollars, going up by 8.25%. Winbond Electronics' stock reached 34.15 NT dollars, going up by 8.75%.</p>
