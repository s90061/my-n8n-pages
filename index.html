            <h1>Aid Ships for Gaza Stopped by Israeli Army, Activists Sent to Istanbul</h1>
            <p>Turkish officials said today that a special plane will arrive in Istanbul today. On the plane will be 36 Turkish people and other people from 12 countries. This comes after Israel stopped a group of ships carrying aid to Gaza and held many people.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, a Turkish official said the special plane has 137 people from the aid ships. These include the 36 Turkish citizens. The plane is expected to land in Istanbul at 3:40 PM local time.</p>
            <p>The Turkish official also said that besides the Turkish people, others on the plane are from 12 countries. These countries are the United States, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia, and Jordan.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Oncu Keceli, who speaks for the Turkish Foreign Ministry, announced that a special plane was hired. It will take the held activists from Israel back to Turkey.</p>
            <p>Last month, Greta Thunberg and other activists went on ships called the "Global Sumud Flotilla." They wanted to break Israel's sea blockade again. They wanted to deliver medicine and food to Gaza. But since the 1st of this month, Israeli soldiers have stopped the ships and taken the people on board.</p>
            <p>Turkey called Israel's stopping of the ships a "terrorist act." On the 2nd, Turkey also said it has started an investigation into the Israeli army holding Turkish citizens on the ships.</p>
            <p>In June and July this year, Israel also stopped similar groups of ships trying to reach Gaza.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and Japan Railway Museums Work Together, Plan to Make Collections Digital Next</h1>
            <p>In 2023, the National Railway Museum Preparatory Office in Taiwan and the Railway Museum in Omiya, Japan, signed an agreement to work together. Cheng Ming-chang, who is in charge of Taiwan's National Railway Museum Preparatory Office, said that they hope to make both museums' collections better and work together to make them digital.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chang told Central News Agency that the two museums signed a cooperation agreement in 2023. As is common for museums, they will start sharing staff, exhibitions, and research. For example, in February this year, they worked with the Omiya Railway Museum. They created a special exhibition called "Japanese Style Ã— Taiwanese Flavor: Taiwan Railway's Food Culture."</p>
            <p>After having this experience working together on an exhibition, Cheng Ming-chang hopes to make both museums' collections stronger. He mentioned that the Omiya Railway Museum has some old and important documents, like official papers and train schedules from the Japanese colonial period. He hopes they can work together to make these collections digital. They plan to start looking into what is needed for this next year.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chang said that whether they work on another exhibition, maybe even in Taiwan, or study and share information from both museums, or hold small academic talks or railway discussions to help their researchers meet, it is a good chance. It will let the world see the research work of Taiwan's National Railway Museum.</p>
            <p>Also, besides working together between the museums, Mr. Toru Ishida, the director of Japan's Omiya Railway Museum, recently spoke to Taiwanese media. He said that last year, 770,000 people visited the Omiya Railway Museum. In August this year, 1,000 Taiwanese tourists bought tickets to visit. He thinks about 10,000 Taiwanese visitors come each year. He also said that when he visited Taiwan's National Railway Museum in July this year, he saw many Japanese people there. He thinks this kind of exchange is very good.</p>

            <h1>Sam Altman is Raising Money in East Asia and the Middle East to Build More for OpenAI</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported today that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, an American company that makes AI, has started a trip to East Asia and the Middle East. He wants to find people to invest money and companies to work with. He needs to do this to get more computing power for his company.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that according to The Wall Street Journal, Sam Altman has been talking to big suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan since late September last year. He wants to make more AI chips and make sure OpenAI gets them first. Companies he talked to include TSMC, Foxconn, Samsung, and SK Hynix.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not confirm if the report is true. TSMC, Foxconn, Samsung, and SK Hynix could not reply right away because it was not working hours.</p>
            <p>This week, Samsung and SK Hynix have already signed a letter that shows they want to work together. They may provide memory chips for OpenAI's data centers.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal report also said that Sam Altman plans to visit investors in the United Arab Emirates. He wants to get money to build more for OpenAI and for their research.</p>
            <p>The report also said that people who know about the matter mentioned that OpenAI recently told its investors and partners. This year, the company might spend around 16 billion US dollars to rent computer servers. By 2029, this amount could go up to about 400 billion US dollars.</p>
