            <h1>Heavy Rains Cause Traffic Problems in India; Gurugram Schools and Offices Closed</h1>
            <p>Heavy rains are still falling in India's Delhi area. The Yamuna River's water level went past the warning line this morning. Many roads are closed because of floods. Gurugram, the most affected area, has closed offices and schools.</p>
            <p>Delhi and nearby areas have had almost constant heavy rain since September 1st. This has caused a high risk of floods. This morning, the Yamuna River's water level rose to 205.75 meters. The warning level is 204.5 meters. If it goes higher than that, it causes problems for Delhi. If it reaches 205.33 meters, it is dangerous. If it reaches 206 meters, people must leave their homes.</p>
            <p>The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that Delhi and some parts of the surrounding area had heavy rain for most of September 1st. The floods caused big traffic jams.</p>
            <p>India Today newspaper said that Gurugram was hit hardest by the strong rain. In just four hours, from 3 PM to 7 PM on September 1st, over 100 millimeters of rain fell. This flooded many main roads.</p>
            <p>Pictures and videos of traffic problems in Gurugram due to floods were widely shared online. Schools and offices there have closed. Authorities have asked schools to teach online and told companies to let employees work from home.</p>
            <p>Officials said that the Yamuna River's water level might rise even more because it is still raining, and dams are releasing water. People in low areas of Delhi, especially near the Yamuna River, need to be careful.</p>
            <p>The authorities have told people living in flood-prone areas near the Yamuna River to move to safe places. They expect the water level to reach 206 meters tonight, which means people must leave.</p>
            <p>Delhi's Chief Minister, Rekha Gupta, said that the government is fully ready to deal with the current situation.</p>
            <p>Delhi and nearby cities like Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Noida have had unusual rain. This has made the temperature lower than usual for this time of year.</p>

            <h1>Death of 13-Year-Old Girl Causes Anger; Malaysian Educators Call for Action Against School Bullying</h1>
            <p>Zara Qairina, a 13-year-old Malaysian girl, should have been enjoying her youth. But she fell from her school building and died. This sad event points to school bullying and has made society very angry. Malaysian educators are asking for more attention to stop bullying. They say we should find places and ways of thinking that allow bullying to grow earlier and stop it.</p>
            <p>Zara fell at school in July and died the next day. The police and prosecutor first said it was an accident and did not check her body right away. But as rumors spread that Zara was bullied to death by the children of powerful people at the same school, her body was checked on August 18th. Attorney General Mohd Dusuki Mokhtar said that five underage girls were charged with bullying, but they all said they were not guilty.</p>
            <p>This sad event has made people in Malaysia pay a lot of attention to school bullying cases. In one place, 7,000 people gathered to demand justice for her. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also said that the investigation must be clear and fair, and no one will be protected.</p>
            <p>The Deputy Minister for Education, Innovation, and Talent in Sarawak recently warned that bullying is becoming a bigger problem. Malaysian human rights lawyer Rao Zhaoying told CNA that, according to data, bullying cases in Malaysia went from about 3,000 in 2015 to over 6,000 in 2024. This is an increase of more than 100%.</p>
            <p>Liang Shengyi, the CEO of the United Chinese School Committeesâ€™ Association of Malaysia, said in an interview that Zara's case can be seen as "the last straw." It shows long-standing problems that have built up, such as ignored bullying culture, a system that doesn't care or acts too slowly, and a system that protects powerful people.</p>
            <p>He said that the data only shows a small part of the problem. If officials cared more, they would see that bullying is a serious issue. They should investigate, analyze, and take necessary steps, including stopping, intervening, and preventing bullying.</p>
            <p>He believes that, for example, in schools, the usual way to deal with bullying is for the school to follow rules after an event happens. But these rules usually only help after the bullying has started, to fix things, make decisions, and punish people.</p>
            <p>Liang Shengyi stressed that we should not wait until bullying has become a huge problem to start "anti-bullying" efforts. Everyone should find the environments and ways of thinking that let bullying grow earlier and stop it before sad events happen. It would be even better to create an environment in education where people respect themselves and love each other so that bullying cannot even start.</p>
            <p>Another reason this case is important is that, according to the Sin Chew Daily newspaper, Zara's case is the first time the "verbal threat" law has been used since the government made bullying a criminal offense. The lawyer for the victim's family thinks that a law with a harsher punishment, "intent to harm," should be used. Society also wonders if the people who caused the harm are children of powerful families and might be protected because of their family background. This could make people feel that "powerful people can avoid punishment."</p>
