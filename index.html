            <h1>Changhua Prison Mooncakes Increase to 100,000, Sell Out Quickly on First Day of Pre-order</h1>
            <p>Today, Changhua Prison's "Iron Window Brand" mooncakes from its Rulin Workshop went on sale. Every year, these mooncakes sell out on the first day. This year, the prison has increased the number of mooncakes to 100,000 and also started selling them online. Changhua Prison said that by 4 PM today, almost all orders were taken.</p>
            <p>Changhua Prison thought about how many mooncakes the prisoners could make for the Mid-Autumn Festival. In previous years, they sold about 80,000 mooncakes. Because the mooncakes are affordable and tasty, they always sell out quickly on the first day of pre-orders. Last year, 85,000 mooncakes were sold in less than two hours. Many people left messages online saying they couldn't get through by phone and wished they could order online instead.</p>
            <p>Changhua Prison announced today that they are still offering their popular classic egg yolk pastries and vegetarian mung bean pastries this year. A box of 10 egg yolk pastries costs NT$410, which is NT$1 more per piece than last year. To let more people buy the mooncakes, and to keep the quality high, they increased the number to 100,000.</p>
            <p>Changhua Prison said that pre-orders started at 8 AM today by phone and on the correctional facility's online store. By 4 PM, they were almost sold out. The prison makes these mooncakes not to make money, but to help prisoners learn a skill. This way, when they leave prison, they will have a useful skill to start a new life. This special good cause makes the "Iron Window Brand" mooncakes a top choice for many people's Mid-Autumn Festival gifts.</p>

            <h1>Nan Pao Teams Up with New Materials and ScienTrim Technology to Develop Advanced Packaging Adhesives</h1>
            <p>New Materials, Nan Pao Resins, and ScienTrim Technology announced today that they will create a new company together. This new company, called Shin Pao Hung Technology, will make high-quality glues for advanced semiconductor packaging.</p>
            <p>Nan Pao said the new company will have 500 million New Taiwan dollars as its starting money. New Materials will own 36% of the company, Nan Pao Resins will own 34%, and ScienTrim Technology will own 30%. ScienTrim Technology explained that the three companies will use their strengths together. New Materials has a strong network and knowledge in special materials for semiconductors. Nan Pao has key technology in making glues. ScienTrim Technology has experience in putting high-tech systems together and developing coating processes. Together, they will create and sell high-quality tapes for advanced semiconductor packaging.</p>
            <p>Nan Pao pointed out that there is a strong need for artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and mobile communication. These technologies need a lot of computing power and data transfer, and complex signals. This means semiconductor chips must be small, use little power, and work very well. So, semiconductor companies are not only making new production methods but also using advanced packaging technology that puts many parts together tightly and works very well. This will be a strong area for the semiconductor industry to grow. It is thought that the global market for semiconductor process tapes will grow by 9.7% each year.</p>
            <p>Nan Pao said that these special glues are very important for making good products and for making things quickly. They are even more important in advanced packaging. ScienTrim Technology said that in the past, Taiwan's semiconductor factories mainly bought materials from other countries. This new partnership is expected to make Taiwan's own supply chain for materials stronger.</p>
            <p>Nan Pao has already created a special UV-release glue for cutting and packaging semiconductor wafers. This glue can be used for advanced packaging processes like laser cutting and dividing thin chips. It sticks very well, but after being exposed to UV light, it quickly unsticks and comes off without leaving any glue behind. This makes the production process faster and helps make more good products.</p>
            <p>Nan Pao said that currently, the money they make from glues used in semiconductors and other electronic areas is about 1% to 2% of their total income. They believe this will be a new way for the company to grow, and they will continue to put more effort into this area.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Metro Offers Ankeng Light Rail "Budget Card": NT$150 for 30 Days of Unlimited Rides</h1>
            <p>New Taipei Metro Corporation announced today that from September this year to January next year, they will offer a special "Ankeng Budget Card" monthly pass for NT$150. After buying the card, people can ride the Ankeng Light Rail as many times as they want for 30 days. If a person rides more than 40 times in a month, they can get a special gift before the end of the next month.</p>
            <p>New Taipei Metro Corporation said in a press release that the NT$150 "Ankeng Budget Card" monthly pass will be available from September this year to January next year. The company hopes this will help commuters spend less money on transport and encourage people to use public transport more often in their daily lives.</p>
            <p>New Taipei Metro Corporation said that after buying the card, people can ride the Ankeng Light Rail unlimited times for 30 days. If cardholders ride the Ankeng Light Rail more than 40 times in a month, they can get a special gift by the end of the next month.</p>
            <p>New Taipei Metro Corporation stated that people who buy the card for the first time will receive a special limited-edition souvenir card. This card looks like three NT$50 coins, showing that the budget card offers great value for money. It also includes the letter 'K' for Ankeng Light Rail and the line's special color. This makes the card useful and also a nice item to collect.</p>
            <p>New Taipei Metro Corporation also said that they will continue to watch how well this offer works. They will review the details of the offer regularly and slowly make different types of tickets available for more uses. They hope to work with the public to create public transport that is more convenient, produces less carbon, and is more sustainable.</p>
