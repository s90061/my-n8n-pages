            <h1>China Remembers the War; Officials Say it Belittles Taiwan and Misrepresents its Status</h1>
            <p>This year marks 80 years since World War II ended. Important people in Taiwan's government said today that if we care about peace, we must not let powerful countries attack others. This is the real meaning of remembering the 80th anniversary of the war's end. China is holding large events to remember what they call the 80th anniversary of their victory against Japan. Their goal is to strengthen their idea of "One China" and incorrectly link a UN decision (Resolution 2758) to Taiwan's status. They are trying to make Taiwan seem less important and falsely claim Taiwan belongs to China.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te wrote on Facebook yesterday that World War II was a terrible event. He said that a few dictators wanted power, and that thinking we could have peace by giving in to them allowed the attackers to succeed. This pulled many countries into a cruel war. So, when powerful leaders who don't respect freedom try to grow their power again, everyone must work together to stop them.</p>
            <p>The leader of the KMT party, Eric Chu, said yesterday that President Lai talked about democracy and peace but did not mention the Republic of China's history in the war or the sacrifices of 3.2 million soldiers. Former President Ma Ying-jeou also said that Chinese people must never forget this part of history. He criticized President Lai for only talking about the end of the war, not the fighting.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese officials said today that the end of World War II 80 years ago also marks 80 years since the Republic of China government led its soldiers and people to fight together. They defeated Japan's powerful desire to expand and won the fight against invasion.</p>
            <p>Officials explained that the lesson from these 80 years is that victory in World War II happened because people around the world united to fight invaders and protect their homes. They wanted real peace. The countries that were once powerful attackers in WWII are now fully democratic countries. They have real peace and wealth and are respected by the world again. This shows that only freedom and democracy can truly help a country grow.</p>
            <p>Officials stressed that only countries that respect human dignity can be respected themselves. Dictatorship and attacking others only bring killing, sadness, and more unfairness. If we value peace, we must not allow attacks. This is the true meaning of remembering the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>
            <p>Officials mentioned that China is holding many events this year to remember what they call their victory against Japan. They are changing history by falsely saying the Communist Party led the fight against Japan. They are also holding events like "September 3rd" and "Taiwan's Retrocession" to unite Taiwan with China. Their aim is to make their "One China" idea stronger and wrongly connect UN Resolution 2758 to Taiwan's status. They continue to make Taiwan less important and falsely claim Taiwan belongs to China. The international community and the people of Taiwan will not agree with this.</p>
            <p>Officials also said that for over a hundred years, because China lost a war, Taiwan was controlled by another country for 50 years. After that, there was a long period of authoritarian rule and martial law that seemed endless. They asked what right the KMT party has to criticize Taiwanese people.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Chen Yi-shen, the head of the National History Museum, said at a meeting about the Sino-Japanese War and its end that one reason Japan gave for attacking China was to "fight communism." But this resulted in Chiang Kai-shek stopping his fight against the communists and working with them to fight Japan. This helped the Communist Party grow stronger during the 8-year war and win the civil war after the war. So, Japan's attack on China led to the creation of "Communist China."</p>

            <h1>Osamu Tezuka and Tsai Kun-lin Meet at Manga Exhibition; Minister Calls it a "Historic Moment"</h1>
            <p>Through an exhibition, Osamu Tezuka, a very famous Japanese manga artist, and Tsai Kun-lin, who started "Prince Magazine," are brought together in Taiwan. This exhibition first opened in Kyoto, Japan, and is now showing at the National Comics Museum in Taiwan. Culture Minister Li Yuan said that this exhibition is a "historic moment," especially as it happens 80 years after the end of the war.</p>
            <p>The exhibition, called "Taiwanese Youth and Japanese Youth - A Hundred Years of Encounter with Taiwan-Japan Manga," finished its run in Kyoto International Manga Museum in June this year. It opened today at the National Comics Museum's East Campus. When you walk into the exhibition, you can see the desks of Osamu Tezuka and Tsai Kun-lin. These desks represent how the two men lead visitors through the history of Taiwanese and Japanese manga culture. The exhibition shows original drawings by Osamu Tezuka, such as those from "Phoenix (Greece chapter)" and "0-Man."</p>
            <p>Minister Li Yuan said in his speech that yesterday was the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II (when Japan surrendered). He thought about the long 80-year story between Taiwan and Japan as the exhibition opened. For example, 80 years ago, his father came to Taiwan from China and collected many Japanese paintings. Also, Li Yuan was born in the same year Osamu Tezuka drew "Astro Boy," and he, like Tezuka, loved insects.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan said that Tsai Kun-lin lived through the "White Terror" period. He was put in prison for 10 years because of what he read. After he was set free, he started his own publishing company and "Prince Magazine." He also gathered his friends from prison to make comics. Today's exhibition is a historic moment, Li Yuan said. "On the 80th anniversary of the end of the war, these two people from history have finally met." The exhibition also tells more stories than just these two people, showing how Taiwanese and Japanese comics met and influenced each other.</p>
            <p>Takayuki Matsutani, the president of Tezuka Productions, said that Osamu Tezuka often used to say that "manga and cartoons can cross national borders." He strongly believed that wars happen because countries don't talk to each other, or if they do, it's only about money and they don't understand each other's cultures. But through manga and cartoons, people can understand what others are thinking. This can help reduce the chance of wars happening.</p>
            <p>Matsutani added that Osamu Tezuka lived through World War II. He knew how sad war was, how valuable peace was, and how important life was. Even at a time when most people thought "manga was bad," he worked very hard to create his works. He wanted to pass these important ideas to the next generation. Matsutani encouraged everyone to learn from Osamu Tezuka. He said, "Don't be afraid of adults; adults will not be here for long. Find a way to send messages to children and let them know what we want to say."</p>
            <p>The "Taiwanese Youth and Japanese Youth - A Hundred Years of Encounter with Taiwan-Japan Manga" international exhibition opened today at the National Comics Museum East Campus and will run until October 12.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang Will Run for New Taipei City Mayor; Hou Yu-ih Says "Talk Less, Do More"</h1>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, has announced he wants to become the mayor of New Taipei City. The current mayor of New Taipei City, Hou Yu-ih, said today that New Taipei City is very large, and it's not easy to understand everything about it. He prefers to "talk less and do more" so that people can feel that real work is being done. He welcomes anyone who truly wants to work hard for New Taipei City.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang recently said he would run for New Taipei City Mayor. He hopes that other political parties not in power will choose one strong candidate together. Mayor Hou Yu-ih was in Taichung today at an event organized by the Vice President of the Parliament, Chiang Chi-chen. Before the event, he spoke to reporters and answered questions about this.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that what New Taipei citizens care about most is who can work hard for New Taipei City. He emphasized that New Taipei City is very big, and it's not easy to understand everything about it. So, it's better to "talk less and do more." He said that doing things that make people feel touched and that show real work is being done is what people want most.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih said many times that he welcomes anyone who is willing to help New Taipei City. He will tell them "good luck."</p>
            <p>When reporters asked if Huang Kuo-chang's announcement was a way to get a better deal with the KMT party, Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that New Taipei City has more than 4.05 million people. There are big differences between the city and country areas. He strongly welcomes anyone who truly wants to work hard for New Taipei City.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang was also at the same event today. When reporters asked him about Mayor Hou Yu-ih's comments that New Taipei City is large and not easy to understand, Huang Kuo-chang refused to answer, saying he needed to leave for another meeting.</p>
