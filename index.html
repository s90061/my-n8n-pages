Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work. Many people used to worry that AI would take away jobs. However, new reports suggest that AI is often becoming a helpful tool for workers, not just replacing them. For example, AI can handle repetitive tasks like scheduling meetings or writing basic emails. This allows employees to focus on more creative and important work.

Companies are starting to understand that AI needs human supervision and new skills. They are now investing more in training their staff. This training helps workers learn how to use AI programs effectively. It also teaches them new skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and managing AI systems. The goal is to create a workforce that can work well with AI, making businesses more efficient and innovative. This shift means that future jobs will likely require a blend of human and AI abilities.

**Extreme Heat Affects Daily Life Across Europe**

Many parts of Southern Europe have recently experienced very high temperatures, leading to extreme heatwaves. These heatwaves have broken records in several countries, including Italy, Greece, and Spain. The intense heat has caused serious concerns for public health, with authorities warning people about the risks of heatstroke and dehydration. Hospitals have seen more patients suffering from heat-related illnesses.

Daily life has changed significantly because of the heat. People are trying to stay indoors during the hottest parts of the day and are using air conditioning more, which puts pressure on electricity networks. Tourism has also been affected, as many travelers are changing their plans or choosing cooler destinations. Governments are advising citizens to drink plenty of water, avoid direct sunlight, and check on older neighbors. These heatwaves are a clear reminder of how climate change can directly impact our everyday lives and public services.

**Global Travel Industry Sees Strong Recovery**

The worldwide travel industry is now seeing a very strong return, especially for international trips. After a few difficult years, many people are eager to travel abroad again, and this has greatly helped airlines, hotels, and local businesses that depend on tourism. Airports are busy, and popular tourist destinations are welcoming large numbers of visitors. This increase in travel is bringing significant income to many countries.

This growth is good news for economies that rely on tourism. However, the industry is also facing some challenges. Travel costs, like airfares and hotel prices, have gone up in many places. There are also sometimes not enough staff in hotels and at airports to handle all the travelers. Despite these issues, the overall outlook for global travel remains very positive. People's desire to explore new places and experience different cultures continues to drive this important economic sector.`;
