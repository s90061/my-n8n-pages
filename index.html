            <h1>Bulareyaung Dance Company Celebrates 10 Years, Brings Hunting Discussions to German Stage</h1>
            <p>"Is hunting a tradition worth keeping, or is it a cruel act that is no longer suitable?" The Bulareyaung Dance Company (BDC) from Taitung, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, performed its dance "Luna" at the Weimar Arts Festival in Germany in September. The performance brought ancient Bunun songs to European theaters and also brought the question of whether indigenous hunting is outdated to the international stage.</p>
            <p>"Luna" is a famous work by BDC, first performed in 2018. It uses traditional Bunun tribal songs and combines them with the dancers' body movements and new ideas made up on the spot. In September, the dance group was invited to perform twice at the Weimar Arts Festival. The performance lasted almost 70 minutes and only used the dancers' singing and movements. At the end, the local audience gave them a lot of applause.</p>
            <p>Bulareyaung Pagarlava, the founder of the dance group and a Paiwan indigenous choreographer, spoke to CNA in Weimar. He said that when he created the piece, people in Taiwan were talking a lot about whether indigenous hunting should be legal. This made him think: "Can you still be a hunter if there's no hunting ground? In the same way, can we still be dancers if there's no stage?"</p>
            <p>He said that "Luna" does not give an answer. Instead, it lets the dancers and the audience think about the question. During the process of creating the work, the dancers argued about hunting. Some thought hunting was part of indigenous culture, while others directly said it was cruel. Some even said, "If you want meat, just buy it at the supermarket." Bulareyaung put these arguments from the practice room onto the stage, showing the audience many different ideas.</p>
            <p>Bulareyaung pointed out that BDC's main feature is "co-creation." The dancers' spontaneous ideas and life experiences during practice are often put directly into the work. For example, the Bunun "reporting battle achievements" was originally a ceremony where hunters proudly announced what they caught when they returned. In "Luna," this was changed into each dancer sharing their own life story.</p>
            <p>"We let the dancers shout out their own stories. Some shouted that they wanted to fly like an eagle, while others said they wanted to take care of their family." This new way of seeing "reporting battle achievements" not only helped dancers without hunting experience feel closer to themselves, but it also showed the audience how traditions can continue in modern times. This change also touched the elders in the tribe.</p>
            <p>This year marks BDC's 10th anniversary. Bulareyaung, who used to dance with Cloud Gate Dance Theatre and the Martha Graham Dance Company, has now created his own path. He admitted that in his early years, because he was indigenous, he was always defensive, feeling like he "must never be looked down upon."</p>
            <p>After returning to his hometown Taitung to start the dance group, he met a group of young dancers from different backgrounds. He slowly learned to accept all kinds of imperfections. This helped him understand where he came from and become a more real Bulareyaung. He shared with CNA that being able to create and grow with his team members is the biggest achievement he wants to report for the dance group's 10th anniversary.</p>
            <p>Looking to the next ten years, the dance group has already performed for free in 55 indigenous townships in Taiwan. Bulareyaung said the next goal is to visit all indigenous tribes across Taiwan. Many people in distant villages might never get a chance to go to a theater, so bringing their work back to these communities is a very important mission for the dance group.</p>
            <p>He also hopes that more people around the world will learn about where the dance group comes from through their dancing and singing. Bulareyaung always remembers that when he went to the Luona tribe to learn ancient Bunun songs, a 91-year-old elder told him she hoped the dance group could share Bunun songs with the whole world.</p>
            <p>After the Weimar Arts Festival, a local newspaper, "ThÃ¼ringer Allgemeine," wrote that the questions raised by the Taiwanese dance group were worth thinking about. They asked, "When hunting is no longer suitable, how can we stop indigenous cultural traditions from becoming empty shells without life?" The newspaper also praised "Luna" for successfully making the dance a mirror for its own traditions.</p>

            <h1>Joseph Wu Speaks to Conservative US Media: UN Should Recognize Taiwan</h1>
            <p>"Newsmax" is one of the media outlets supported by former US President Trump, and it has grown quickly in recent years. As the United Nations General Assembly meets, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu wrote an article for its website. He stressed that "now is the time for the United Nations to recognize Taiwan." He also used the phrase "chip in" to ask countries to see Taiwan's important contributions in areas like semiconductors.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly started on September 9th at the UN headquarters in New York. Joseph Wu's article, published today on the "Newsmax" website, pointed out that Taiwan makes big contributions to the world, but the international community mostly does not recognize this. He said it is a pity that Taiwan cannot be part of the United Nations system.</p>
            <p>He stated that Taiwan is unfairly kept out because China purposely twists the meaning of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758.</p>
            <p>In 1971, the UN General Assembly passed Resolution 2758. This resolution recognized the People's Republic of China as the only legal representative of "China" in the UN. It also removed "the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek." Since then, Beijing has linked Resolution 2758 with the "One China Principle." It has said that this means "Taiwan is part of China" and does not need its own representative. This stops Taiwan from joining UN organizations and activities.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that this resolution is wrongly connected to the so-called "One China Principle." He said it continues to be used as a tool to stop Taiwan from being involved.</p>
            <p>"However, UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not mention Taiwan at all. It only talks about who represents China in the UN. This resolution does not say that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. It also does not give the People's Republic of China the right to represent Taiwan in the UN system."</p>
            <p>He added that the United Nations has given in to China's political pressure. It uses this resolution as an excuse to keep Taiwan out of the international community. Taiwan has spoken against this unfair treatment and is getting more and more support.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that as international support for Taiwan grows stronger, the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is being highlighted more and more at meetings like the G7 summit and other discussions between two or more countries.</p>
            <p>Also, many countries' governments and lawmakers have openly said that UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 did not decide Taiwan's status. It also did not stop Taiwan from joining international groups like the UN system.</p>
            <p>"As the United Nations celebrates its 80th anniversary, and with only 5 years left to reach the Sustainable Development Goals, it is time to include Taiwan. This will help make the vision of 'leaving no one behind' and 'working together' a reality."</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that Taiwan asks all countries to "chip in." This means acknowledging Taiwan's rightful place on the world stage and accepting the contributions Taiwan can make.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Representative Office in the U.S. pointed out that "Newsmax" was started in 1998. It is one of the most important conservative media outlets in the U.S. Its website and news channel have a lot of influence among politicians and conservative viewers in America.</p>
            <p>Former President Trump's media company, "Trump Media & Technology Group," launched its TV streaming service Truth+ to the world in July. This streaming service will also work with "Newsmax." They hope to make their company bigger.</p>

            <h1>Kim Jong Un Praises Trump, Open to Talks with US but Refuses to Give Up Nuclear Weapons</h1>
            <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said today through the state news agency KCNA that Pyongyang is ready to talk with the US again. This is if the US agrees to stop asking North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. He also said that he still has "fond memories" of former US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) quoted Kim Jong Un as saying: "If the US can let go of its unrealistic wish for us to remove our nuclear weapons, accept reality, and truly want to live in peace with us, then there is no reason why we should not sit down and talk with the US."</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un said that North Korea developed nuclear weapons to protect itself because of serious threats from the US and South Korea.</p>
            <p>He stated that recent offers for talks from Washington and Seoul were refused. This is because their real aim was to weaken North Korea and change its government, so the offers were not honest.</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un said that South Korea's idea to end North Korea's nuclear program step by step showed this attitude.</p>
            <p>Kim Jong Un also said that he still has "fond memories" of former US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the two leaders met three times during Trump's first term as president, but later talks failed.</p>
            <p>KCNA reported that Kim Jong Un said: "I still have fond memories of the current US President Donald Trump." He also said that he is open to talking with Washington.</p>
