A recent report has highlighted that children in the UK spend a significant amount of time online, averaging around seven hours each day. This new study, from the Children's Commissioner, suggests that while the internet offers many benefits, there are growing worries about its effect on young people's well-being and safety. The report found that many children see harmful content or face bullying online. It also noted that parents often feel worried about their children's online activities and need more support. To address these issues, the report recommends new and stricter rules for social media companies. It also suggests that online platforms should be more responsible for the content their users see. The goal is to make the internet a safer and healthier place for young people to learn and connect.

**AI Is Changing Work: New Skills for the Future**

Artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI, is having a big impact on the job market. Experts say that AI is not just replacing jobs, but it's also creating new types of work and changing what skills people need. Many jobs will require different abilities in the future. Instead of simply repeating tasks, workers will need to focus on skills that AI cannot easily do. These include critical thinking, being creative, solving complex problems, and understanding human emotions. Workers may also need basic knowledge of how AI tools work. Companies are encouraged to train their employees for these new demands. For individuals, learning new skills and adapting to these changes will be key to staying competitive in the future workplace. The idea is to work with AI, not against it.

**Travel Is Changing: Towards Regenerative Tourism**

The way people think about responsible travel is evolving. While "sustainable travel" focused on not harming places, a new trend called "regenerative travel" aims to actively improve them. This means that travelers want to leave a place better than they found it. Instead of just reducing their negative impact, they seek to make a positive difference for local communities and the environment. For example, regenerative travelers might choose to stay in eco-friendly accommodations, support local businesses, or participate in conservation projects. This change is partly because more travelers care about ethical and environmental issues. New digital tools and partnerships are also helping people find and book these kinds of trips. The goal is for tourism to contribute to the health and well-being of destinations, making them stronger for the future.
