            <h1>Golden Bell Awards: Hosts Announced for Drama Category</h1>
            <p>The 60th Golden Bell Awards will be a bigger event this year to honor people who work in Taiwan's TV and film industry. A famous Taiwanese artist named Dong Yang-zi created the main design for the "Golden Bell 60" event. For the red carpet part of the show categories, Hsia Ho-hsi and Lin Wei-ni (also known as Mu Mu) will be the hosts. For the red carpet part of the drama categories, Huang Deng-hui and Huang Di-yang will host together.</p>
            <p>Dong Yang-zi also designed the main look for the Golden Bell Awards red carpet hosts. Today, the team that makes the show released a photo of the two hosts for the show categories. The show categories use orange as their color. Orange stands for the warmth and different kinds of communication. It shows how rich Taiwan's culture and art have been over the past 60 years of the Golden Bell Awards.</p>
            <p>Huang Deng-hui and Huang Di-yang will host the red carpet for the drama categories. The drama categories use purple as their color. Purple shows the deep stories and strong feelings in dramas. It looks back at how Taiwan's TV and radio industries have grown. It also honors old traditions and imagines what the future will be like.</p>
            <p>The Golden Bell Awards for radio will be on October 11th. The awards for TV shows and dramas will be on October 17th and 18th. All these events will take place at the Taipei Music Center. Sanli TV will be in charge of making these shows.</p>

            <h1>Youth Basic Law Bill to be Reviewed on August 14th; Youth Groups Ask for Quick Approval</h1>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan plans to look at the Youth Basic Law Bill closely on August 14th. Today, several youth groups asked for the bill to be passed quickly. They also asked for rules about how young people can join public discussions to be written into the law. They also want a special office for youth affairs to be created under the Executive Yuan.</p>
            <p>Groups like the Generations Co-Prosperity Association, Taiwan Alliance for Victims' Rights and Welfare, Taiwan Youth Association for Democracy, Taiwan One Drop of Education Association, and Soochow Island Society released a statement today. They said that 38 lawmakers in the current Legislative Yuan have already suggested this "Youth Basic Law Bill." These lawmakers are from different political parties, which shows how important they think this bill is.</p>
            <p>Zhang Yu-meng, who is the head of the Generations Co-Prosperity Association, said they hope this bill will officially define "youth" as people aged 18 to 35. They suggest making youth affairs at the central government level more important by creating a "Youth Development Committee" or "Youth Development Office" under the Executive Yuan. Rules for youth advice and public involvement should also be put into law. Every city and county should also have ways for young people to take part, to make sure everyone has an equal chance to be involved.</p>
            <p>Zhang You-jia, the deputy secretary-general of the Taiwan Alliance for Victims' Rights and Welfare, said that the Youth Basic Law should also include young people aged 15 to 17. He also said that a special office should be set up under the Executive Yuan. This office would help bring together and empower youth policies, so that policies are not spread out and resources are not wasted.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-jin, a supervisor at the Taiwan Youth Association for Democracy, believes that the rules for youth advice and youth public involvement must become official laws. Both the central and local governments need clear, stable, working, and responsible systems. All 22 cities and counties in Taiwan should have systems for youth to get involved. This will make sure these systems are the same everywhere and have a real impact.</p>
            <p>Lin Si-kai, who is the president of Soochow Island Society, said that university students come from all over Taiwan. He supports setting up systems for youth involvement in all 22 cities and counties in Taiwan. This would give all young people, no matter if they live in a city or their hometown, and whether they can vote or not, a stable way to influence public policy.</p>
            <p>Cai Qi-ye, the head of the Taiwan One Drop of Education Association, suggested that the Youth Basic Law should also include ways to protect younger students, people with disabilities, and young people in different situations. This would make sure that many different ideas are heard. For mental health, he said that support for youth counseling resources and related research should become law. This would stop policies from changing or stopping when different political parties come into power.</p>

            <h1>New Lotus Park Project Starts in Zhubei; Will Have an 18-Meter Long Slide</h1>
            <p>The Zhubei City Office in Hsinchu County said today that they will build a new Lotus Park. It will have an 18-meter long slide. The park's design will fit the shape of the land and the trees. Healthy trees will stay, and the view will be more open. Paths will connect different parts of the park, making it easy for people to walk around.</p>
            <p>The Zhubei City Office had a special event today to start the project to make Lotus Park better. Zhubei City Mayor Cheng Chao-fang said that the old Lotus Park had old and broken things. Also, there were too many trees, so it was dark and had many mosquitoes. Some paths were wet for a long time, so moss grew on them, which made it easy for people to slip and fall.</p>
            <p>The Mayor said that the city office set aside 20 million New Taiwan Dollars for this improvement project. They will build the longest slide in Hsinchu County, which will be 18 meters long. The main idea for the design is to blend with nature. It will use the land's natural shape and the look of the trees. More paths will connect the park, so people can feel the breeze as they walk through nature.</p>
            <p>Cheng Chao-fang also said that the new Lotus Park will have a special play area designed to fit the land. It will use the hills to make different levels for children to play. Besides the slide, it will have natural wood chips for safety. There will also be climbing nets and a viewing platform. This will help children explore nature and use their senses while they play.</p>
            <p>He said that the new Lotus Park is in the western part of Zhubei. It is close to the famous Lotus Temple and the Fengqi Trail. The Fengqi Trail will also get a new look in the future; its new design is being planned now. When the park opens, it will connect with the temple and the trail. Together, they will become a tourist spot that combines nature and culture.</p>
