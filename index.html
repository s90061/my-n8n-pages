Apple is thinking about using artificial intelligence (AI) from companies like Anthropic or OpenAI for its new voice assistant, Siri. This means Apple might not use its own AI technology for Siri.

Bloomberg reports that Apple has talked with Anthropic and OpenAI. Apple asked these companies to train their AI models to work on Apple's cloud system.

Apple is still in the early stages of deciding whether to use AI from other companies. They have not made a final choice yet.

**Councilor Chen Yi-chun to Appear in Court on July 25 for Fraud and Bribery Case**

Taipei City Councilor Chen Yi-chun from the Democratic Progressive Party is accused of taking assistant fees illegally and accepting bribes. She was charged with corruption. The court has set dates for her to appear, and on July 25, Chen Yi-chun and her office director, Chang Hui-lin, who are currently held, will be brought to court.

The Shilin District Prosecutors Office stated that Chen Yi-chun and Chang Hui-lin illegally took about NT$3.84 million in assistant fees by using the names of three friends since late 2018. They used this money for personal things like paying rent and buying stocks.

Also, from August 2023 to February this year, Chen Yi-chun and Chang Hui-lin are accused of taking over NT$700,000 as "consulting fees" from two builders. They then used their power as a councilor to pressure the Taipei City government to speed up building permits and tree moving for these construction projects.
