            <h1>Tainan House Foundation Collapses, Now Unsafe; City Works to Fix Slope</h1>
            <p>In the Asahan Village of Liuying District, Tainan, a house's side slope collapsed on the evening of August 2nd. The ground under the house was washed away. A parking shed, cars, and motorcycles slid down with the soil. Luckily, no one was hurt. After eight residents left the house yesterday, the collapse got bigger and damaged the house. Today, the city government quickly strengthened the slope.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Government said in a press release today that the house in Asahan Village had its ground washed away because of a landslide. Yesterday, people from the Civil Affairs Bureau, Water Resources Bureau, and district office went to the site to talk about what to do. They sent an excavator to put steel plates into the ground. They hoped this would slow down the slope's collapse. But sadly, the house's foundation still collapsed.</p>
            <p>The Civil Affairs Bureau said that after checking the house, they found it was unsafe. People should not live there anymore. Currently, eight residents have been moved to a safe place by the Liuying District Office. This is to avoid future dangers.</p>
            <p>The Water Resources Bureau explained more. Today, they quickly used steel rails and steel plates to make the bottom of the slope strong and stable. This will stop the slope from sliding and collapsing more. Later, they will continue to strengthen and check the slope as needed.</p>

            <h1>Expectations for Lower Interest Rates Increase, US Dollar Falls; New Taiwan Dollar Rises Strongly to 29.918</h1>
            <p>The New Taiwan Dollar has become much stronger against the US Dollar. This happened because new information showed that fewer people got jobs in the US than expected. This made investors worry about the job market. As a result, the US dollar and US bond interest rates both dropped a lot. Other currencies, not the US dollar, then became stronger. Today, the New Taiwan Dollar closed at 29.918, a strong rise of 0.107. It is now back to being stronger than 29. The total money traded in the Taipei and Yuanta foreign exchange markets was 1.4675 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, the New Taiwan Dollar fell sharply. This was because Taiwan's temporary equal tariff rate was set at 20%, which is higher than Japan's and South Korea's. Also, the US dollar index showed great strength, going above 100. The New Taiwan Dollar then dropped below 30 and ended at 30.025, the lowest it has been in over two months.</p>
            <p>After that, the US released its July non-farm employment numbers, which were lower than expected. The unemployment rate also went up. This made the market worry more about the US economy. US stocks fell a lot, and the US dollar index also dropped quickly to 98. All currencies other than the US dollar then rose in value.</p>
            <p>Today, the New Taiwan Dollar opened at 29.95 against the US Dollar. It quickly started to rise sharply, going up by more than 0.2. It reached its highest point during the day at 29.812. As people started to buy US dollars again, the gain became smaller.</p>
            <p>A foreign exchange trader explained that today's rise was mainly because the US dollar fell a lot. Also, some foreign investors sent money to buy Taiwan stocks, and exporters sold foreign currency. This helped the currency go back above 29.</p>
            <p>The Central Bank's data shows that the US dollar index fell greatly by 1.14% today. The New Taiwan Dollar gained 0.36%, the Chinese Yuan gained 0.47%, the Korean Won gained a strong 1.39%, and the Japanese Yen gained the most, rising by 1.80%.</p>
            <p>The foreign exchange trader pointed out that Taiwan's temporary tariff rate has been announced, but it is not the final one. The market is still waiting to see what happens, so not much money is being traded. For now, the US job data looks weak. People are now watching how other economic data from the US will perform. Also, Taiwan is still waiting for the final tariff rate and the results of the Section 232 investigation. Because the future is not clear, the currency might move between 29.8 and 30 for a while.</p>

            <h1>AirTAC's July Revenue Reaches New High for the Period at NT$2.649 Billion; Orders Higher Than Shipments</h1>
            <p>AirTAC-KY, a company that makes pneumatic parts, announced today that its combined revenue for July was NT$2.649 billion. This is a 1.9% decrease from the previous month. However, it is a 7.42% increase compared to July 2024. Even though it's the lowest in five months, it is still the highest revenue for this time of year ever.</p>
            <p>AirTAC-KY explained that in July, the value of new orders was still more than the value of products shipped. This was better than they thought it would be. The company's revenue in July and the average amount of goods shipped each day were lower than the previous month. This was due to changes in demand during different seasons for the industry. However, compared to the same time last year, there was good growth. In July, sales were especially good for products used in batteries, cars, and packaging machines.</p>
            <p>AirTAC-KY's combined revenue from January to July was NT$19.698 billion. This is an 8.83% increase compared to the same period in 2024.</p>
            <p>Looking at future business, AirTAC-KY said that new equal tariffs still have some small effects on customers' decisions to make more products. But the total demand in the market is slowly getting better. They expect that the Chinese government will keep giving policy support as needed. Also, AirTAC-KY is always creating new products and making its brand better. They also have different sales plans for different industries to get a bigger share of the market. Even with uncertainties in the world, AirTAC-KY still believes its outlook for this year is the same as before.</p>
            <p>At an investor meeting at the end of July, AirTAC-KY repeated that changes in currency exchange rates and tariffs have only a small effect. They expect that their pneumatic parts business will grow more than the average for the industry this year. The company aims for its total sales this year to grow by a low double-digit percentage (about 11% to 13%).</p>
