            <h1>UK's 6th Astute-Class Nuclear Submarine Finishes Important Diving Test</h1>
            <p>The UK's sixth Astute-class nuclear submarine has recently completed an important diving test. This brings it closer to officially joining the navy.</p>
            <p>The UK plans to build seven Astute-class nuclear attack submarines. Five are already in service. The sixth and seventh submarines are still being tested and built. They are named HMS Agamemnon and HMS Achilles, after old Greek stories.</p>
            <p>The UK Ministry of Defence announced today that "HMS Agamemnon" successfully finished its first diving test recently. The test lasted two days. It happened at the BAE Systems shipyard in Barrow-in-Furness, in northwest England. BAE Systems is a very big company that makes military equipment.</p>
            <p>The test checked many systems and features on the submarine. For example, it made sure the ballast tanks worked well to help the submarine float up. Navy engineers also measured the submarine's balance when it was both floating and diving underwater.</p>
            <p>The "HMS Agamemnon" is 97 meters long and weighs 7,400 tons. It has new nuclear technology and systems for finding and sensing things. It can travel around the world without coming to the surface of the water.</p>
            <p>Like other Astute-class submarines, "HMS Agamemnon" will carry regular weapons. These include "Tomahawk" long-range missiles for attacking land and "Spearfish" heavy torpedoes. This will help the UK better protect its nuclear weapons at sea, its aircraft carrier groups, and important things underwater.</p>
            <p>The naming ceremony for "HMS Agamemnon" happened in April last year. For the ceremony, they used beer made by a local brewery.</p>
