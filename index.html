            <h1>Energy Agency: Fix Damaged Solar Power Sites Quickly; Improve Design</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 18 (CNA) Typhoon Dianmu caused a lot of damage in Southern Taiwan. The Energy Agency said today that the amount of electricity produced by solar power systems before and after the typhoon was almost the same. This means there was no big damage, even though some people said there was. As extreme weather happens more often and becomes stronger, the agency will keep looking at how to make engineering designs and rules better. They will also work to fix damaged solar power sites quickly after storms.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Energy Agency shared a press release today. It said that Typhoon Dianmu was unusual because it landed in western Chiayi. Its very strong winds and unusual path caused more problems than past typhoons.</p>
            <p>Data shows that only about 0.4% of all solar power systems in Taiwan were damaged. Before the typhoon (July 2), solar systems made 67.75 million units of electricity. After the typhoon (July 13), they made 66.2 million units. The total amount of electricity produced was very similar. This shows that the rumors of major damage were not true.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency explained that very strong winds broke the anchoring system for floating platforms. This caused significant damage to the Xinwen detention pond in Chiayi. The Energy Agency has finished cleaning solar panels outside the pond area. They have also gathered and sorted the panels, and cleared the roads. For the area inside the pond, they will finish the cleanup as soon as possible, keeping in mind safety for workers and how long it will take.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency also said that solar power facilities are designed to be safe in strong winds. According to the Electricity Act, power companies must give an engineering plan when they ask for permission to build. This plan must include a structural report signed by a professional engineer. For example, at the Xinwen detention pond, the floating platforms and anchoring systems for the water-based solar power system were designed to handle the basic wind speed in Budai, Chiayi. A civil engineering firm already gave a structural report for this project, signed by an engineer.</p>
            <p>The Energy Agency stressed that extreme weather is happening more often and is getting stronger. To deal with this, they will continue to check and improve engineering designs and rules. They will also improve how they prepare for disasters before they happen and how quickly they fix damaged sites after a storm. (Editor: Pan Yi-Ching) 20250718</p>

            <h1>CPBL All-Star Game on July 19th at Taipei Dome; Chen Yu-Hung Will Start Against Huang Pao-Lo</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 18 (CNA) The Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) All-Star Game will start tomorrow. Over 80,000 people will come to the Taipei Dome for two days. This will be the most people ever at an All-Star Game. Tomorrow, on the first day, Team Taiwan will have Chen Yu-Hung start as pitcher against Huang Pao-Lo from Team Star.</p>
            <p>On the first day of the CPBL All-Star Game, Team Taiwan will be the visiting team, and Chen Yu-Hung will be their starting pitcher. Team Star, the home team, will have Huang Pao-Lo start. Also, two important players, Lin Chih-Sheng and Hu Chin-Lung, are playing their last year in baseball. This All-Star Game will be their last, and they are both in the starting lineup. This makes the game even more exciting to watch.</p>
            <p>For the skill challenges, CPBL President Tsai Chi-Chang will join the "Fun Relay Race" again. After that, there will be the "Iron Catcher Throwing King" challenge, which tests how accurately players can throw. Two famous catchers, Yeh Chun-Chang and Kao Chih-Kang, will show their skills at stopping runners. On the second day of the All-Star Game, the "All-Around Hitting King" challenge will test the hitting skills of four pitchers. The preliminary and final rounds of the Home Run Derby will be held on different days.</p>
            <p>The league said that the All-Star Game will bring together star players from six teams. There will also be a very large group of cheerleaders to entertain everyone. Outside the stadium, there will be exciting events like autograph sessions and Nintendo fan meetings. After the games, popular singers will perform. Tomorrow, Tanya Chua and Ricky Hsiao will sing. On July 20th, Minnie, a member of the popular Korean girl group (G)I-DLE, will perform with her dance team.</p>
            <p>Also, today, the CPBL announced that during the middle of the 5th inning in both All-Star Games, there will be a "Mario Kart World Player Friendly Match." Tomorrow, Kuo Tien-Hsin and Chan Tzu-Hsien will play against Hsu Jo-Hsi and Chen Chieh-Hsien. On July 20th, Hirano Keiichi and Tsai Chi-Chang will play against Tseng Hao-Chu and Chiang Kun-Yu.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-Chang, the president of the CPBL, said he thanks the coaches and players from all six teams for working together to make this big event happen. He also especially thanked all the excited fans for their strong support, which made this year's All-Star Game very successful again. He hopes the players will enjoy the game completely and that fans will have great summer memories. (Editor: Lin Shu-Hui) 20250718</p>

            <h1>Trump Asks Former Delta Pilot Anderson to Be US Representative at ICAO</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 17 (CNA) The White House in the United States said today that President Trump has chosen Jeffrey Anderson, a former pilot for Delta Air Lines, to be the US representative to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, a union for pilots has said they do not agree with this decision.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this choice comes as some US senators want President Trump's government to support raising the required retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67 years old. This would happen at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal.</p>
            <p>The United States has not had a permanent representative at the ICAO since July 2022. That is when C.B. "Sully" Sullenberger left the role. In 2009, Sullenberger safely landed an Airbus A320 plane on the Hudson River in New York after birds hit its engines.</p>
            <p>The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents more than 79,000 pilots from 42 airlines in the US and Canada, has criticized Trump's choice of Anderson. They said that he does not have the right experience or skills for the job.</p>
            <p>In a statement, the union said, "Mr. Anderson's only real qualification seems to be his support for increasing the required retirement age for pilots. This would make the US different from other countries in aviation around the world. It would also cause problems for the number of available pilots and for international and local flights."</p>
            <p>Last year, the US Congress did not approve a plan to raise the required retirement age for airline pilots from 65 to 67. According to international rules, airline pilots who are older than 65 years old cannot fly in most countries outside the United States.
