            <h1>Taiwan's Ocean Waste Team Joins Japan's Circular Economy Show for the First Time; Minister Kuan Pi-Ling Sends Support</h1>
            <p>The Ocean Affairs Council (OAC) is leading nine Taiwanese companies to a big show in Chiba, Japan. The show is called the 2025 Circular Economy EXPO and it starts today. These companies work in textiles, biotech, plastic recycling, and making things with less carbon.</p>
            <p>This is the first time these companies are showing their work together at this event. They have a special booth called "Taiwan Ocean Circular Hub." OAC Minister Kuan Pi-Ling encouraged the team the night before through a video call. She hopes Taiwan can show its new ways of recycling ocean waste to the world.</p>
            <p>The Circular Economy EXPO is one of Japan's most important shows about the circular economy. It focuses on how to recycle things, use lasting materials, and design products that can be reused. More than 500 companies are taking part. The Ocean Affairs Council said today that from today until September 19, they are leading the nine important Taiwanese companies. They will show how strong Taiwan is at recycling ocean waste.</p>
            <p>Minister Kuan also greeted international friends during the video call. She said that Taiwan's ocean partners have done good work to keep the ocean healthy. They have also made sustainable ideas a part of everyday life. This shows Taiwan's special qualities: "small but beautiful, strong in technology." She said Taiwan wants to tell the world about its goal: to change the "problem of ocean waste" into "chances for a circular economy." The OAC will continue to work on the "Indo-Pacific Regional Ocean Waste Cooperation Platform." They will work with Japan and other international partners to create new ways to have a circular economy for the ocean. This will help make sure the ocean stays a valuable resource for all future generations.</p>
            <p>The group going to the show includes companies like Far Eastern New Century, Shin Jen Textile, Pin Jwu Enterprise, Fu Sheng Textile, Formosa Taffeta, Yung Li Biotechnology, Zhong Jie Biotechnology, Feng Yi Green Energy Materials, and Kao Chang Trading (Cuone Branch). They will show clothes made from ocean waste fibers and many different recycled materials. This is the first time Taiwan is fully showing at a big international exhibition how it changes "waste" into "lasting resources" in its industries.</p>
            <p>Besides showing ways to solve ocean waste problems and new products, the OAC will also hold two events during the show. These are the "Taiwan Circular Focus Sharing Session" and the "Taiwan-Japan Blue Circular Industry Matchmaking Conference." Experts from other countries and leaders from Japanese companies will come together. This will help them work more with other countries and build a blue circular industry chain. This is a step from a local group for ocean waste recycling to a bigger network for ocean waste cooperation in the Indo-Pacific area. This is also a key part of Minister Kuan's plan for international cooperation on ocean issues.</p>

            <h1>FIT Hon Teng: AI Needs Data and Power; New Factory in Middle East to Start Building by Year-End</h1>
            <p>FIT Hon Teng, a company that is part of Foxconn, held its first "FIT 2025 Tech Day" in Taiwan this afternoon. The chairman of FIT Hon Teng, Lu Sung-ching, said that data and power are very important for "AI Mobility." This means using AI in things that move.</p>
            <p>Prince Fahad bin Nawaf Al Saud from Saudi Arabia was invited to the FIT Tech Day. He gave a speech as the CEO of Smart Mobility, which is a company that FIT Hon Teng started with another company in Saudi Arabia.</p>
            <p>FIT Hon Teng said that Smart Mobility officially started in May, after they signed an agreement to work together in October 2024. A ceremony to start building the new factory will happen by the end of this year. This means FIT Hon Teng is now making products in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>Chairman Lu said in his speech that the current rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is giving strength to industries. AI is leading to new technology where software controls hardware. People say, "Data is like new oil." But having oil is not enough. In the time of AI, we need ways to move data and change energy to make things work in the future. FIT Hon Teng's connectors and fast data cables are like the nerves in a person's body; they send signals and data. The power systems are like blood; they give steady and strong energy for all the heavy computing that AI needs.</p>
            <p>He explained that for AI to move things forward in the future, data and power must flow well. They need to be fast, safe, and steady to truly create value. FIT Hon Teng is a necessary company that brings these things together.</p>
            <p>Chairman Lu also said that AI is already a real force changing industries. This includes self-driving cars, drones, robots, and even flying cars that may come in the future. All these are being changed by AI. As things change, AI will redefine mobile devices, devices that process data, and devices that use power efficiently.</p>
            <p>FIT Hon Teng created a new part of its business called "One Mobility." This combines two German brands, Autokabel and Voltaira, that FIT Hon Teng bought. One Mobility focuses on strong power and combining different systems. It will work with other companies around the world to create a new way of using technology for mobility. This will open new markets and lead to working with different industries.</p>
            <p>To be more competitive and have a clear brand, FIT Hon Teng recently said it will put its two car-related businesses under one brand, "One Mobility." This will make one brand and let them share resources more effectively.</p>
