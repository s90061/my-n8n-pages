Amazon is significantly expanding its drone delivery service, Prime Air, to new locations in the United States and Europe. The company aims to reach more customers faster and more efficiently. This move follows years of development and testing, addressing regulatory hurdles and technological challenges.

The expansion will initially focus on densely populated suburban areas where Amazon believes the drones can operate safely and effectively. Customers eligible for Prime Air will be able to order thousands of everyday items, from household goods to electronics, for delivery within 30 minutes. Amazon is working closely with aviation authorities to ensure the drone operations meet strict safety standards. They are investing heavily in advanced sense-and-avoid technology to prevent collisions with other aircraft or obstacles. The company hopes this expansion will eventually make drone delivery a standard part of the Amazon shopping experience.

**Article 2: Innovation - Self-Healing Concrete**

Scientists have developed a new type of concrete that can repair its own cracks using bacteria. This innovative material incorporates tiny capsules containing dormant bacteria and a food source. When a crack forms, water enters the concrete, breaking open the capsules and activating the bacteria.

The bacteria then consume the food source and produce calcium carbonate, which is the main component of limestone. This naturally occurring substance fills the crack, effectively sealing it and preventing further damage. This self-healing concrete has the potential to significantly extend the lifespan of buildings and infrastructure. It could reduce the need for costly repairs and maintenance, making construction more sustainable and durable. Researchers believe this technology will revolutionize the construction industry. They are now working on scaling up production and testing the concrete in real-world applications.

**Article 3: Travel - Sustainable Tourism in Iceland**

Iceland is taking steps to manage the impact of its growing tourism industry and promote more sustainable travel practices. The country has seen a surge in visitors in recent years, putting pressure on its natural environment and infrastructure. The Icelandic government is implementing new regulations to protect its fragile ecosystems.

These regulations include limiting access to certain areas, increasing park fees, and promoting responsible tourism behavior among visitors. The country is also investing in eco-friendly transportation options and promoting local businesses that prioritize sustainability. Tour operators are being encouraged to offer experiences that minimize environmental impact and respect local communities. Iceland aims to balance the economic benefits of tourism with the need to preserve its natural beauty for future generations. They believe that by focusing on sustainability, they can ensure that tourism remains a positive force for the country.
