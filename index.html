            <h1>Kaohsiung Zuoying High School Visits Japan to Strengthen Education Exchange with Meiji High School</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung Zuoying High School recently went to Japan to exchange with its sister school, Meiji High School in Tokyo. The main topic of this visit was "Exploring Tokyo's City and Transportation System." They compared the transportation systems of Kaohsiung and Tokyo. The program included both academic study and hands-on experiences.</p>
            <p>Zuoying High School announced today in a press release that they became sister schools with Meiji High School in Tokyo this year. From September 17th, students from Zuoying High School began a six-day education exchange at Meiji High School. The students from Zuoying High School also stayed with Japanese students' families. This allowed them to experience meals together, weekend life, and daily interactions, helping them learn more about Japanese culture.</p>
            <p>The school said that students from both schools gave special reports at the exchange meeting. Zuoying High School's report was about "Tokyo's Cultural Landmarks, Food, Daily Life, and Transportation System." They compared these aspects with Kaohsiung's transportation system. They also said that when the Japanese students visit next March, the theme for their tour will be "Kaohsiung Harbor City Landmarks and Transportation System."</p>
            <p>Also, students from Meiji High School focused on "Japanese Transportation." They talked about how fast and punctual the Shinkansen (bullet train) is, the cultural importance of tourist trains, and the role of different types of transport in cities and for tourism. After the reports, both sides gave gifts to each other. This showed their strong friendship in education.</p>
            <p>The school also mentioned that during the exchange, Zuoying High School students visited the campus and took part in English and physical education classes. Through talking and doing sports, they felt the different ways of teaching. During lunch, they ordered and ate food in the high school cafeteria, experiencing the daily culture of a Japanese school.</p>
            <p>Zuoying High School students stayed with Japanese students' families. Through sharing meals, weekend activities, and daily talks, they learned more about Japanese culture. These few days of cultural exchange helped the students become more independent and respectful. It also created special international friendships.</p>
            <p>Principal Lin Bai-hong of Zuoying High School said that Meiji High School is a high school connected to Meiji University. Zuoying High School is also a partner school for Meiji University's overseas student admissions. Every year, Meiji University offers special places for Zuoying High School students. This organized partnership not only gives students more ways to go to university but also smoothly connects high school education with higher education, preparing students well for international opportunities.</p>

            <h1>First Local Case of Paratyphoid in 2025: Man in his 20s Sent to Emergency with Diarrhea and Fever</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced today the first local case of paratyphoid fever this year. It is a man in his twenties who is not from Taiwan. He showed symptoms in late August after arriving in Taiwan. Because he was in Taiwan during the whole time he could have caught the illness, doctors believe it is a local case. The source of the infection is still unknown.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yong-qing, a CDC doctor, explained at today's regular weekly meeting about diseases. The patient is a non-Taiwanese man in his twenties from northern Taiwan. He has no known health problems. He came from India in early August and lived in central Taiwan until late August. On August 26th, he started having a continuous fever, diarrhea, and headache. On September 1st, he went to the hospital emergency room and was admitted to a regular ward for treatment.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lin Yong-qing said that doctors found bacteria similar to paratyphoid in the patient's blood. After telling the CDC, it was confirmed to be a paratyphoid case. The patient got better after taking antibiotics. He left the hospital in mid-September after staying for two weeks.</p>
            <p>Regarding the investigation, Dr. Lin Yong-qing said that the patient was in Taiwan for 1 to 10 days before he got sick, which is the time when the illness develops. This is why it is considered a local case. Three people living with him did not show any symptoms, and their stool tests were negative. The patient also said he does not drink raw water, eat raw food, or eat seafood often. So, the source of the infection is still unclear. A detailed history of his diet will be investigated further.</p>
            <p>Guo Hong-wei, director of the CDC's Epidemic Command Center, stated that as of September 22nd this year, the CDC has counted one local case of paratyphoid. From 2021 to 2025, the number of local cases was 1, 6, 26, 3, and 1, respectively. The number of cases from outside Taiwan was 0, 0, 2, 1, and 0. For the cases from outside Taiwan in 2023 and 2024, the infections came from Indonesia, India, and Cambodia, one case from each country.</p>
            <p>For the global situation, Guo Hong-wei said that about 2.16 million paratyphoid cases are reported each year, and 14,000 of these cases result in death, mostly children. The most affected area is South Asia, with over 90% of cases. After that are Southeast Asia, West Africa, and East Asia. The countries with the most cases are Pakistan, India, and Nepal.</p>
            <p>Tseng Shu-hui, spokesperson for the CDC, explained that paratyphoid is a stomach illness caused by paratyphoid bacteria. It usually spreads when people eat food or drink water that has been contaminated by the feces or urine of someone who is sick or carries the bacteria. The time before symptoms show is usually 1 to 10 days. The time when a person can spread the illness is 1 to 2 weeks. Common symptoms include a continuous fever, headache, feeling unwell, not wanting to eat, stomach pain, diarrhea, a slower heartbeat than usual, or red rashes on the body.</p>
            <p>Tseng Shu-hui reminded everyone to always pay attention to what they eat and to keep their hands clean. Drinking water should be boiled or bottled. Food must be cooked well before eating. When cooking and preparing food, people should avoid mixing raw and cooked foods. Also, good personal hygiene is important. Before eating, after using the toilet, before handling food, or after changing diapers, people should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and clean water. This is the best way to prevent infection.</p>

            <h1>Egg Prices Drop by NT$3 Per Catty: Farm Price NT$28.5, Wholesale NT$38</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Egg Merchants Association announced that starting today, the price of eggs from farms will go down by NT$3 to NT$28.5 per catty. Starting tomorrow, the wholesale price will also drop by NT$3 to NT$38 per catty.</p>
            <p>Lin Tian-lai, the head of the Taipei Egg Merchants Association, told reporters that after the Ghost Festival, fewer people bought eggs. Two weeks ago, the price went down by NT$2 per catty. Last week, the price did not change. This week, it has gone down by NT$3 per catty.</p>
            <p>The latest information on egg production and sales from the Ministry of Agriculture shows that there are currently 37.06 million laying hens. Every day, they can provide 126,000 boxes of eggs (each box has 200 eggs). This is 6,000 boxes (1.2 million eggs) more than the average daily demand of 120,000 boxes.</p>
            <p>Taipei City sells the most eggs in Taiwan. So, the prices given by the Taipei Egg Merchants Association are often used as a guide for other cities and counties.</p>
