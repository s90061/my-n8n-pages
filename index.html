Apple is changing its approach to artificial intelligence, putting more emphasis on keeping user data private. Unlike some other tech companies that rely heavily on cloud-based AI, Apple is focusing on processing data directly on its devices, like iPhones and iPads. This means less information needs to be sent to the cloud, reducing the risk of data breaches and improving user privacy.

This shift is partly a response to growing concerns about how companies are using personal data. Apple believes that users should have more control over their information, and processing data on-device is a key way to achieve this. The company is also working on new AI features that will be able to understand user behavior and preferences without storing data in the cloud. Experts say this strategy could give Apple a competitive edge in the long run, as more people become aware of the importance of privacy. However, it also presents technical challenges, as on-device AI requires more processing power and efficient algorithms.

**Amazon's Drone Delivery Service Expands to New Cities**

Amazon is expanding its drone delivery service, Prime Air, to more cities in the United States. The company has announced plans to launch drone delivery in College Station, Texas, and Tolleson, Arizona, adding to its existing operations in Lockeford, California. Prime Air aims to deliver packages weighing up to five pounds in less than an hour.

The expansion represents a significant step forward for Amazon's ambitions in drone delivery. The company has been working on Prime Air for several years, overcoming regulatory hurdles and technological challenges. The drones use sophisticated sensors and navigation systems to avoid obstacles and safely deliver packages to customers' homes. While drone delivery is still in its early stages, Amazon believes it has the potential to revolutionize the way people receive goods, especially in suburban and rural areas. Customers who live within a certain radius of Amazon's distribution centers will be eligible to receive drone deliveries.

**Venice Introduces Tourist Tax to Combat Over-Tourism**

Venice has introduced a new tourist tax to help manage the impact of over-tourism. Visitors who are not staying overnight in the city will now have to pay a fee to enter. The measure is designed to reduce overcrowding and generate revenue for maintaining Venice's historic infrastructure.

The tax will be implemented on a trial basis on selected days, primarily during peak seasons and holidays. The amount of the fee will vary depending on the time of year and the expected number of visitors. Officials hope the tax will discourage day-trippers from visiting Venice during the busiest times, allowing the city to become more enjoyable for residents and tourists alike. Venice has struggled with over-tourism for many years, leading to environmental damage and a decline in the quality of life for locals. The tourist tax is one of several measures the city is taking to address these challenges, including limiting the number of new hotels and promoting sustainable tourism practices.
