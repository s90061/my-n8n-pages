            <h1>Suspect Arrested in Nord Stream Pipeline Explosion Case</h1>
            <p>Warsaw, September 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ Polish prosecutors announced today that a suspect has been arrested. This person is believed to be involved in the explosion of the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline in 2022. Germany had issued a warrant for this person's arrest.</p>
            <p>News reports from Agence France-Presse and Reuters say that the suspect's lawyer, Tymoteusz Paprocki, told TVN24 television that his client was arrested. "He was taken into custody this morning in a town near Warsaw," Paprocki said.</p>
            <p>Polish media reported that the suspect's name is Volodymyr, with a last name starting with Z. Reuters reported that the suspect is a Ukrainian diver, wanted by German authorities.</p>
            <p>Piotr Skiba, a spokesperson for the Warsaw Provincial Prosecutor's Office, told Agence France-Presse that the suspect had been arrested. He said that legal procedures are currently happening, but he did not share the suspect's name.</p>
            <p>The Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline explosion in 2022 was called an "act of sabotage" by Moscow and Western countries. It greatly reduced the supply of Russian gas to Europe. This event was a major step up in the conflict in Ukraine and made Europe's energy supply much worse. No one has taken responsibility for the act yet. Ukraine has said it was not involved.</p>

            <h1>Gongguan Roundabout Changed to Intersection, Traffic Jams During Rush Hour; Taipei City Proposes 4 Improvement Measures</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today was the first workday after the Gongguan roundabout in Taipei was changed to a regular intersection. Traffic jams happened during both morning and evening rush hours. The Department of Transportation said that starting tomorrow, four new measures will be put in place to help traffic. These include removing the bus lane at the end of Fuhe Bridge.</p>
            <p>The intersection of Keelung Road and Roosevelt Road, which used to be the Gongguan roundabout, was changed yesterday. Many people posted online today about the traffic situation on the first workday. Some said their bus ride in the morning took twice as long as during the construction. Even the bus driver told them to take the MRT. Other people said that traffic on Roosevelt Road backed up all the way to Jingmei, and that cars were stuck on Fuhe Bridge itself.</p>
            <p>Also, many scooter riders during rush hour wanted to avoid waiting at the red light when turning right from Roosevelt Road onto Keelung Road. So, they rode into Lane 119 of Roosevelt Road Section 4. Because they couldn't join Keelung Road from there, they had to ride to Lane 113 of Roosevelt Road Section 4 and make a U-turn. People online joked that this was like "Chiang's hairpin turn."</p>
            <p>Observations at the site also showed that in the past, scooter riders who wanted to turn left from Roosevelt Road to Keelung Road into the city would ride around the bridge support and wait in a special box for turns. Now, there is a pedestrian crossing under the bridge support, and scooters don't need to make a two-stage left turn. During both morning and evening rush hours, many scooter riders were not used to the new road design and accidentally rode onto the pedestrian crossing, sharing the path with people walking. This created dangerous situations.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, during the evening rush hour, traffic on Keelung Road going towards New Taipei City was very bad. Even from the direction of the NTU Farm, about 700 meters from the intersection going into the city, the end of the traffic jam could not be seen. A Taipower emergency vehicle, even with its siren on, was stuck in the traffic and could not move. Sometimes, scooter riders even turned off their engines and walked their scooters on the sidewalk.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Commissioner of Transportation Hsieh Ming-hung and Director of Transportation Management Engineering Department Chang Chien-hua visited the site during the evening rush hour. Hsieh Ming-hung told the Central News Agency after the visit that there was indeed traffic congestion in the morning. After a meeting with other related departments, they decided on four improvement measures, which will start tomorrow.</p>
            <p>First, for cars turning right from Roosevelt Road (southbound) to Keelung Road (eastbound) into the city, since cars and pedestrians mix, the traffic light will be changed. Pedestrians will cross the street in two stages, and more lanes for right-turning cars will be added. Also, the double white lines at the intersection will be changed to lane lines, allowing vehicles to change lanes.</p>
            <p>Third, for Wansheng Street, the traffic light timing will be adjusted slightly to give cars more time to drive. Lastly, at the end of Fuhe Bridge, because many cars need to turn left, workers will remove the bus-only lane tonight. This will allow cars to use this lane for left turns.</p>
            <p>Regarding the traffic problem on Keelung Road during evening rush hour, Hsieh Ming-hung admitted that they first expected more traffic on Roosevelt Road. However, Keelung Road had more cars than expected. So, they immediately adjusted the traffic light timing, and traffic has since returned to normal.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung said that changing the roundabout to a regular intersection is a big change, and it's normal to have some issues. The Department of Transportation will deal with these issues bravely, continue to observe, and make improvements based on what actually happens.</p>

            <h1>Gaza 20-Point Peace Plan: Trump Gives Hamas 3 to 4 Days to Respond</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ US President Trump talked with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House yesterday about the situation in the Gaza Strip. After that, he released a 20-point peace plan. Today, Trump said he will give the Palestinian group Hamas "3 to 4 days" to reply.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that during a joint press conference with Netanyahu yesterday, Trump stated that if Hamas refuses the US's 20-point peace plan, Israel will have his "full support."</p>
            <p>According to this plan, Hamas must give up its weapons. Also, Hamas and other groups must agree not to be involved in the government of Gaza, either directly, indirectly, or in any other way.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters today, "We will probably give (Hamas) 3 to 4 days. We are waiting for Hamas. Hamas either does it or it doesn't. If they don't do it, the results will be very bad."</p>
