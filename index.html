            <h1>President Lai Ching-te: The Central Government Fully Supports Hualien County Government to Quickly Rescue Trapped People</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te, who is also the chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said today that a landslide dam lake in Matai'an River in Hualien overflowed. The central government had warned about this many times before. They worked with the Hualien County Government to move many people to safety early. The central government will now fully help the Hualien County Government to quickly save people who are trapped and start cleaning up.</p>
            <p>Lai Ching-te said that strong typhoon "Kavasa" came in the past few days. He thanked all the people who help with disaster relief in central and local governments, the military, and those who keep important services like electricity and internet working. They were ready to help all the time.</p>
            <p>Lai Ching-te explained that for the Matai'an River landslide dam lake overflow in Hualien, the central government had given many warnings. They worked with the Hualien County Government to move many people out early. The central government will continue to fully support the Hualien County Government to quickly rescue those who are stuck and start fixing things and cleaning up.</p>
            <p>Lai Ching-te thanked the DPP central party office, led by Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung. They worked with local party officials in Hualien to help with government disaster relief efforts. They also found out what the local people needed after the disaster and offered help, like collecting supplies. If needed, they also formed volunteer groups to help clean homes and support people to get back to normal life quickly.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng, the spokesperson for the DPP, said in a press conference after the meeting that following President Lai Ching-te's instructions, Hsu Kuo-yung has already started various disaster relief efforts. This includes Hsu Kuo-yung personally donating NT$100,000 to help with disaster relief.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng said that right now, the central party office has formed a small team for disaster relief that has gone to Hualien. This team is led by the head of the organization department, Chang Chih-hao. They are looking for a suitable place in Hualien to help house people affected by the disaster and to receive supplies donated from different places. They expect to confirm the location by this evening.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng also said that the central party office has started to talk with party offices in different cities and counties. In the future, they plan to form volunteer teams from local party offices, similar to how they helped with disaster relief in Tainan. These teams will help the people of Hualien get back to their normal lives quickly with both people and supplies.</p>
            <p>When asked by the media, Wu Zheng mentioned that Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu also donated NT$1 million on behalf of the KMT to help with disaster relief. Wu Zheng said this is a very positive thing and hopes to see all parts of Taiwan, no matter their political party, work together to help the people of Hualien.</p>
            <p>Wu Zheng stated that the members of the Central Standing Committee cared a lot about how to help Hualien. Ruan Chao-hsiung, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, also attended the meeting. He explained that the Executive Yuan has set up an emergency center at Hualien Guangfu Sugar Factory. They will collect supplies and send them to this center.</p>
            <p>It was reported that Legislator Chung Chia-pin, the convener of the DPP caucus, said in the Central Standing Committee meeting that the party's main goal is to focus on disaster relief first. Also, the candidate selection meeting, which was planned for today, has been canceled once, and local party meetings have also been stopped for now.</p>

            <h1>Capital Securities: TSMC's Growth in Next Two Years is Clear, Good for Taiwan Stock Market</h1>
            <p>Recently, the Taiwan stock market has reached new high points often. Fan Chen-hung, the general manager of Capital Securities Investment Consulting, believes that TSMC's business will definitely grow in the next two years. Currently, TSMC makes up 40% of the Taiwan stock market's value. The market is indeed highly valued. The stock index might go up and down a bit in the short term because it has risen a lot. But because TSMC is strong and its future is clear, and with help from lower interest rates in the US, he thinks the market will not fall too much.</p>
            <p>Capital Financial Group held a meeting today to talk about investment ideas for the fourth quarter. Fan Chen-hung said that orders for advanced semiconductor production, smaller than 5 nanometers, are decided one or two years in advance. So, it is possible to mostly figure out TSMC's business results for the next two years, and the growth trend is clear.</p>
            <p>Fan Chen-hung thinks that the Taiwan stock market's value is currently high, a bit higher than the average of the last 10 years. Also, the Taiwan stock market has been going up since a market crash in early April. So, it is normal for the index to move up and down a little in the short term after rising so much. But because TSMC is strong and its future is clear, and with help from lower interest rates in the US, he believes the market will not drop too much.</p>
            <p>Capital Securities Investment Consulting gathered information about spending plans from five big US cloud service providers (CSPs): Microsoft, Meta, Google, AWS, and Oracle. They predict that these companies will spend a total of 359 billion US dollars in 2025. This is more than 50% higher than last year's 229 billion US dollars. They also expect it to grow further to 446 billion US dollars in 2026. This shows that investments in AI are not stopping.</p>
            <p>Fan Chen-hung explained that the Taiwan stock index is becoming more focused on a few big companies. TSMC alone makes up more than 40% of the market's value. Out of the top five companies by market value, if we take out Fubon Financial at number five, the first fourâ€”TSMC, Hon Hai, Delta Electronics, and MediaTekâ€”are all connected to AI. If we also include the long list of semiconductor companies that work with TSMC, and other AI-related groups like those for cooling and power, all AI-related stocks together make up over 60% of the Taiwan stock market's value. As the AI trend continues, the Taiwan stock market is still expected to do well.</p>
            <p>Capital Securities predicts that the Taiwan stock index will move between 24000 and 27000 points in the fourth quarter.</p>

            <h1>High Defense Budget: AIDC Focuses on Military Aircraft Repair and Drone Business</h1>
            <p>Next year's defense budget will be almost 620 billion NT dollars, which is a new high. AIDC (Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation) said it is ready. It is working with big US military aircraft companies to improve its ability to repair military planes. This will help them secure business for repairing many military aircraft, such as the Army's AH-1W helicopters and the Air Force's F-16 fighter jets. AIDC will also grow its business by developing drones and by increasing its civil aviation and technology services.</p>
            <p>AIDC held an online meeting for investors today. Vice President Chin Huai-sheng, Chief Financial Officer Huang Hsiu-yen, and Head of Enterprise Development Ma Ping-chun led the meeting.</p>
            <p>According to AIDC's newest financial report, in the second quarter of 2025, their income was about 8.1 billion NT dollars, and they lost 0.24 NT dollars per share. In the first half of the year, their income was 15.68 billion NT dollars, and they earned 0.01 NT dollars per share. Their profits were lower than last year because of fines for delays in delivering advanced jet trainers and a strong fall in the US dollar exchange rate.</p>
            <p>AIDC stated that it is currently working hard to deliver the advanced jet trainers on time. It is also continuing to increase the company's growth by developing drones and steadily growing its civil aviation and technology services.</p>
            <p>Regarding defense, AIDC said it is continuing to make its drone business bigger. Recently, they showed an "anti-drone system" which puts together a complete system to stop drones. This system can greatly help national security, public services, and privacy. Also, AIDC is helping Thunder Tiger Technology develop bigger drone helicopters faster. They are also planning their own production system for these drones. It is important to note that AIDC made an important partnership with a US company during the Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition. Their precise visual positioning technology is expected to bring a big change to Taiwan's drone industry.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense recently started a new bidding process for military drones that meet commercial standards. This business could be worth up to 50 billion NT dollars, making it Taiwan's largest drone purchase plan ever. AIDC said that as a member of the Taiwan Excellent Drone International Business Alliance (TEDIBOA), it always acts as a leader and helper. It helps other alliance members improve. AIDC is good at putting systems together and making high-quality products. It can provide necessary help to small and medium-sized businesses in Taiwan, both in research and production.</p>
            <p>For civil aviation business, AIDC pointed out that more people are traveling globally. The basic situation for commercial passenger planes and aircraft engines is strong, and the long-term future looks good. AIDC's machines and production abilities in making airplane bodies, parts, engine cases, and different modules have been chosen by international partners. They have received stable, long-term orders from big international companies in Europe, America, and Japan, and they are already delivering these orders.</p>
            <p>AIDC is also using its aviation knowledge to develop "technology services" for other areas. This has already started being used. AIDC explained that they developed their own "Power Island" energy storage system. They first installed it in their own factory. When there is a power cut, it can provide electricity for the entire factory for up to 6 hours. This shows that their Power Island is reliable.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan has approved next year's defense budget to be a new record high. Including special budgets, the total will be nearly 620 billion NT dollars. AIDC said they are ready for this. During the Taipei Aerospace & Defense Technology Exhibition, they worked with big US military aircraft companies to improve military maintenance capabilities. This helps secure business for maintaining many military aircraft, such as the Army's AH-1W helicopters and the Air Force's F-16 fighter jets, to meet all the military's needs.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead, AIDC said it will continue to follow government policies. It will work harder to expand into international markets, strengthen its operations, and ensure long-term development. Recently, AIDC was also chosen for the "2025 Top 100 Foreign Investor Picks in Taiwan" list. This is the first time AIDC has been on this list, showing that foreign investors are positive about the future of the defense industry.</p>
