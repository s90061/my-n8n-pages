            <h1>After Attack in Doha, White House Says Netanyahu Promises Qatar No More Attacks</h1>
            <p>On September 9th, Israel attacked Doha, the capital city of Qatar, from the air. The attack was aimed at Hamas leaders, a Palestinian group. The US government said that today, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu called Qatar's Prime Minister from the White House. He said he was sorry for the attack and promised Israel would not do it again.</p>
            <p>News agencies, like AFP and BBC, reported that Mr. Netanyahu had been very strong in his views since Israel attacked Qatar. This phone call happened while he was meeting with US President Donald Trump. They were talking about stopping the fighting in Gaza.</p>
            <p>A statement from the White House said that Israel's rocket attack on Hamas in Qatar accidentally killed Qatari soldiers. The statement said, "Prime Minister Netanyahu said he was very sorry."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that Mr. Netanyahu "said again that Israel will not attack in this way again."</p>
            <p>The White House also shared that the leaders of Israel and Qatar agreed with President Trump's idea. They want to create a new three-part plan. This plan will help them work together better, talk to each other more, and stop dangers.</p>
