            <h1>Xie Jiannan Joins Dawushan as Independent Director; Industry Sees Growth for Egg Business</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 28, Central News Agency) Dawushan, Taiwan's biggest chicken farm for eggs, announced today that Mr. Xie Jiannan has been chosen as a new independent director. Mr. Xie has more than 40 years of experience in retail and used to be the vice chairman of Pxmart. People in the industry believe Dawushan can use his rich experience in retail channels to sell more products and reach more customers.</p>
            <p>Besides being an independent director for Dawushan, Mr. Xie Jiannan is also an independent director for Kai Fund. He has many years of experience in the retail industry. When he worked at Uni-President Superstore, he led the building of IT systems, connected logistics, and created many new services. As the CEO of 85Â°C, he helped the brand grow internationally, made the supply chain better, and improved store quality.</p>
            <p>Mr. Xie also worked as the vice chairman and CEO of Pxmart. During his time there, he created mobile payment (PX Pay) and online shopping (PXGo!). He also built a complete sales system and made the fresh food supply chain more efficient. The market expects that his role as an independent director at Dawushan will really help Dawushan with marketing products and finding new ways to sell them.</p>
            <p>Also, in March this year, Dawushan's board decided to buy 51% of Fuchia Foods. Fuchia Foods is Taiwan's biggest egg processing factory. This will help Dawushan expand its business in processing egg products.</p>
            <p>Dawushan said that since the second quarter of this year, Fuchia has been part of its business. Fuchia has added NT$186 million to the total income. Fuchia's factory in Luzhu, Kaohsiung, can process 200,000 eggs per day. This is about 50% of their total production. They sell fresh egg products like hot spring eggs, soft-boiled eggs, stewed eggs, tea eggs, and egg salad in supermarkets and convenience stores in Taiwan. They also sell them to countries like the United States, Australia, Singapore, and Hong Kong. (Editor: Yang Lan-hsuan) 1140728</p>

            <h1>Xi Jinping: Floods Cause Many Deaths and Injuries; Local Governments Must Take Responsibility for Flood Control</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 28, Central News Agency) Heavy rains for many days in places like Hebei and Beijing, China, have caused serious floods. Tonight, Chinese Communist Party leader Xi Jinping gave instructions. He said that the continuous heavy rain in North China and other areas has caused big losses of lives and property. All regions and relevant departments must not only do well in flood control and relief work but also "fully take political responsibility" and carry out flood prevention measures.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi Jinping said that in recent days, East China, North China, and Northeast China have had continuous heavy rains. This has caused floods and mudslides, leading to many deaths, injuries, and property losses in places like Beijing, Hebei, Jilin, and Shandong. He said that all flood prevention and rescue work must be done well. They must try their best to find missing people and those stuck, quickly move people to safe places, and reduce the number of deaths and injuries as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that China is now in a very important period for flood prevention, from late July to early August. All regions and relevant departments must remember to prepare for the worst, "fully take political responsibility," and carefully carry out all flood prevention measures. They must closely watch weak points and important areas, and wisely send rescue teams and supplies. This will make sure that they "respond immediately and deal with it immediately" when sudden emergencies happen, to fully protect people's lives and property.</p>
            <p>Besides Xi Jinping, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also gave instructions. He said that the heavy rain and floods in Miyun District, Beijing, have caused many deaths and injuries. They must try their best to find missing people, properly help the affected people, and reduce losses as much as possible.</p>
            <p>Li Qiang mentioned that some parts of North China have had continuous heavy rains recently. The National Flood Control Headquarters of China must guide the local areas to make their plans for heavy rain and flood disasters stronger. They should monitor and warn about extreme weather, check rivers and reservoir dams, look for hidden flood risks in cities, move people in danger quickly, and truly protect people's lives and property.
