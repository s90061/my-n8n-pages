            <h1>Trump Post: U.S. Hopes to Help China, Not Harm It</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that the US wants to "help China, not hurt it." This shows a softer approach, just days after he threatened to put a 100% tax on goods from China, the world's second-largest economy.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump posted on his social media platform, "Truth Social," saying, "The US wants to help China, not hurt it!" He also said that "respected President Xi (Jinping)... does not want his country to fall into an economic slowdown."</p>
            <p>On October 10, Trump announced that starting November 1, he would add more taxes on goods from China. This was a response to China's "very strong" new rules on exporting rare earth minerals.</p>

            <h1>China's Zion Church Faces Big Arrests, US Secretary of State Condemns and Asks for Immediate Release</h1>
            <p>US Secretary of State Pompeo today criticized China for holding many leaders from Zion Church, one of Beijing's biggest unofficial churches. He called this action "bad feelings towards Christians."</p>
            <p>Newsmax, a conservative media in the US, mentioned a report from The Wall Street Journal. It said that more than 20 people connected to Zion Church have been held or are missing. For many years, this church was quite free to operate.</p>
            <p>Pompeo (Marco Rubio) said in a statement, "We ask the Chinese Communist Party to free the church leaders they are holding right away. We also ask them to let all people of faith, including those from house churches, practice their religion without fear of being punished."</p>
            <p>Since October 9, the police have taken about 30 pastors and church members from Zion Church.</p>
            <p>According to China Aid, police raided the home of Jin Mingri, the head pastor of Beijing Zion Church, in the early morning of October 10. People who know about the situation said that the police focused on questioning three pastors: Jin Mingri, Wang Lin, and Yin Huibin. They were trying to find proof from their daily activities and church work to start a case. The charges included " illegally using information networks," "illegal business operations," and "fraud."</p>
            <p>For three days starting October 9, Zion Church made statements. They asked the Chinese government to stop arresting, threatening, and bothering their church and other house churches across the country. They also asked the government to let all held or missing pastors and followers go without conditions. They want the government to protect people's basic right to religious freedom by law.</p>
            <p>The report said that Zion Church started in 2007. It is a family church that is not officially registered. Its influence reaches over 40 cities in China, and up to 5,000 people attend its Sunday services. In 2019, the main church in Beijing was forced to close. Jin Mingri, the head pastor, was put on a "border control" list. This meant he could not leave the country to be with his family. Since the beginning of this year, different branches of Zion Church in many cities across the country have been investigated, and their members have been questioned.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Semiconductor Company Wingtech's Subsidiary Frozen by Netherlands; US Controls Add Pressure</h1>
            <p>Wingtech Technology, a Chinese semiconductor company, announced today that the Dutch government has stopped its control over its Dutch subsidiary, Nexperia, for one year. This happened after Nexperia was already affected by new export rules from the US government.</p>
            <p>Wingtech Technology released a statement tonight about the Dutch government stopping its control over Nexperia for one year. Wingtech said the Dutch government stopped Nexperia's global operations because of "false national security reasons."</p>
            <p>Chinese financial news said that Nexperia is Wingtech Technology's platform for its semiconductor business. It is important in car semiconductors and special chips. It also "works closely with major companies" in new energy cars, power grids, communication, and data products worldwide.</p>
            <p>Tech media Bits&Chips reported on October 2 that the US government announced new export control rules at the end of September. Nexperia was affected by these rules.</p>
            <p>The Dutch newspaper NRC reported earlier that after the new US rules start, US companies will not be able to give controlled technology to Nexperia.</p>
            <p>At that time, Nexperia told NRC that it had already taken steps to keep its business running. It also said it would complain because these rules are "too broad and too strict."</p>
            <p>Based on the updated US rules, if an entity on the US "Entity List" owns at least 50% of a company, that company will face the same export limits. This is true even if the two companies have different names.</p>
            <p>The US is making its trade blacklist apply to more companies. This change includes parties related to those on the "Entity List." Companies on this list cannot get US goods and technology without government permission.</p>
            <p>The "Entity List" is made to stop companies and other groups that are seen as a danger to US national security or foreign policy. Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's parent company, was added to this US list at the end of last year.</p>
