            <h1>Trump Threatens to Punish India, But India Will Keep Buying Russian Oil, Say Sources</h1>
            <p>Two sources from the Indian government, who did not want to be named, said that India will continue to buy oil from Russia. This is true even though US President Donald Trump said he would punish India.</p>
            <p>One of the sources said, "These are long-term oil agreements. It is not easy to stop buying suddenly."</p>
            <p>Last month, Donald Trump wrote on his social media site "Truth Social" that India would face more punishment for buying Russian weapons and oil.</p>
            <p>On August 1, Trump told reporters that he heard India would stop buying oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported today, quoting two senior Indian officials who did not want to be named, that the Indian government has not changed its plan. One official said that the government has not told oil companies to buy less oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported this week that Indian state oil refineries stopped buying Russian oil last week. This happened because the discount on the oil became smaller in July.</p>
            <p>Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson for India's foreign ministry, spoke at a regular press conference yesterday. He said, "For our energy needs, we will think about what is available in the market and what choices we have. We will also look at the current world situation."</p>
            <p>Jaiswal added that India and Russia have a "strong and proven friendship." He also said that India's relationships with all countries are important and should not be seen from the point of view of a third country.</p>

            <h1>Movie About Older Men Filmed in Penang: Live Your Life Fully</h1>
            <p>The movie "NO GOOD! Ojiisan," about older men, was filmed in Penang, Malaysia. Local news reported that the movie tells an exciting story about "dream-chasing older men." It wants to show people to live their lives fully and without regret.</p>
            <p>Malaysia's "Guang Hua Daily" reported today that director Chang Ching-feng led the team. This included famous actors like Lee Ming-shun, who won a Golden Bell Award, Jack Neo, who is known as Singapore's King of Comedy, Hsu Hsiao-shun, a long-time TV host from Taiwan, and Huang Pei-chia, who also won a Golden Bell Award. They filmed in Penang from July 28 to August 2.</p>
            <p>In the movie, there is a part where the main character, Jack Neo, leaves Penang as a teenager to study in Taiwan. At that time, the Komtar skyscraper in Penang was being built. Forty years later, he returns home and sees that the city has changed a lot. The Komtar skyscraper has become a famous building there.</p>
            <p>Chang Ching-feng, who has visited Penang many times, said in an interview that he feels Penang is a "warm and friendly place." So, he wanted to write a story about Taiwan and Penang. One of the main characters is from Penang, and through him, the movie shows many feelings about Penang.</p>
            <p>The report also said that Lee Ming-shun, who is from Malaysia, plays a Taiwanese person in the movie. When he was in Penang, he had to remember not to use a Malaysian accent while acting, so he would not give away his true origin.</p>
            <p>Lee Ming-shun said, "I couldn't say 'Uncle' or 'Auntie' in Malaysian; I had to say 'Shushu' or 'Ayi' in Chinese. This difference was very interesting to me. I hope when the movie comes out in Malaysia, people will watch how I act as someone returning to their own place."</p>
            <p>Lee Ming-shun, who plays a retired photographer in the film, said that even though he is an "older man," it is hard to make dreams come true. But he still believes that he should live without regrets.</p>
            <p>When Hsu Hsiao-shun was interviewed, he wanted to say that Jack Neo wears women's clothes in one part of the movie. But Jack Neo quickly stopped him, saying, "That's a surprise ending; you can't tell everyone!"</p>
            <p>Chang Ching-feng shared that "NO GOOD! Ojiisan" is expected to be released next year. They plan to release it around the Lunar New Year. Everything is still being planned.</p>
            <p>He hopes that when the movie is released, it will give a message: no matter how old you are, you should bravely follow your dreams that you have not started yet.</p>

            <h1>U12 World Cup: Hu Cheng-en Hits Home Run, Gets 3 Hits, 4 RBIs, Team Never Gave Up</h1>
            <p>Hu Cheng-en, nicknamed "Wild Boar," from the Taiwan team at the U12 Baseball World Cup, played against South Korea today. He got 3 hits, 4 RBIs, and hit his third home run of the tournament. He said that before sleeping, he will think about what to do for tomorrow's third-place game. He was very happy that everyone did not give up and did not complain.</p>
            <p>Today, Taiwan played against South Korea in the last game of the Super Round at the U12 Baseball World Cup. In the third inning, when Taiwan was down by 1 run, Hu Cheng-en hit a two-run home run, which helped his team get ahead. In the extra eighth inning, he got an infield hit. In the ninth inning, he hit a two-run single, helping his team beat South Korea 11 to 5.</p>
            <p>Today, Hu Cheng-en had 3 hits in 5 turns at bat and got 4 RBIs. He played very well. He said that he was calm when he hit the home run. He did not try to hit it far. He just wanted to hit the ball well and show what he practiced.</p>
            <p>Before batting in the ninth inning, the coach told him to stay calm and do every action right. Hu Cheng-en said that after hitting the two-run single, he wanted to do a "Rising Dragon Punch" move. But he did not finish the move after getting on base, and he laughed.</p>
            <p>Today's game started at 6:15 PM and finished around 10:45 PM. Hu Cheng-en said he does not remember playing a game that late before. The most important thing he remembers is that everyone did not give up and did not complain. Everyone just wanted to win. Even though they have to play South Korea again tomorrow at 10 AM for the third-place game, he will still think about what to do before he sleeps.</p>
