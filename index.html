            <h1>After Strong Earthquake in Kuril Islands, Russia Lifts Tsunami Warning for Kamchatka Peninsula</h1>
            <p>After a strong earthquake of magnitude 7.0 happened near Russia's Kuril Islands earlier today, Russia's emergency services have removed the tsunami warning for the Kamchatka Peninsula.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Russia's emergency services had posted on Telegram, "The height of the waves is expected to be low, but everyone should still stay away from the coast." The U.S. Tsunami Warning System measured the earthquake at magnitude 7.0 but did not give a tsunami alert.</p>
            <p>Russian news agency RIA and scientists also said today that the Krasheninnikov Volcano on the Kamchatka Peninsula erupted during the night. This was the first time it released lava in 600 years.</p>
            <p>The Krasheninnikov Volcano is about 1856 meters high. The ash cloud from this eruption went up to 6000 meters.</p>
            <p>Both the strong earthquake near the Kuril Islands and the volcano eruption might be connected to a very strong 8.8 magnitude earthquake that hit Russia's Far East last week.</p>
            <p>The Kuril Islands are at the southern end of the Kamchatka Peninsula. Russian scientists warned on July 30 that strong aftershocks could happen in this area in the next few weeks.</p>

            <h1>AccuseFive Returns Home to Perform, Quan Qing Thanks Fans: Let Me Proudly Return to Yilan</h1>
            <p>The band AccuseFive returned to their hometown Yilan to perform yesterday. After three years, member Quan Qing stood on the stage at their old school, Yilan Senior High School, where she first started singing. She said, "Thank you everyone for giving me so much courage along the way. It lets me come back here feeling proud and confident."</p>
            <p>AccuseFive started their tour in their hometown, Yilan. After touring the world twice and performing in large stadiums everywhere, this time they wanted to be closer to their fans. So, AccuseFive chose to return in a very personal and emotional way. Yesterday, they performed at their old school, Yilan Senior High School. Fans agreed to wear school uniforms and pretend to be teachers or school officers, traveling through time with AccuseFive. After the show, AccuseFive, who love their fans, held a special signing event.</p>
            <p>When AccuseFive returned to their hometown to perform, Quan Qing shared her feelings in a press release. She said, "This is where I started singing. When I was a student, I found out the school had a singing contest. At that time, I wasn't very confident. I just thought I could try it. But that day, I found a little bit of courage, came to this place, and I have been singing ever since."</p>
            <p>Yun An thanked the fans, saying, "This year is AccuseFive's 8th year. We hope to sing until our 20th anniversary."</p>
            <p>Zhe Qian happily said, "Thank you to every fan here. You let us have fun on stage. I see myself like a candle, trying to take in all kinds of energy, burning myself to light up your way."</p>

            <h1>Financial Industry's First Half Profit Down 37%, Only Banks Continue to Reach New Highs</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) reports that Taiwan's three main financial industries made a total of NT$378.116 billion in the first half of this year. This is a big drop of 37.51% compared to the same time last year. Only the banking sector saw its profits grow. The FSC explained that banks' pre-tax earnings reached NT$301.88 billion in the first half of the year. This is a new record for this period, thanks to more income from interest and fees.</p>
            <p>The FSC shared the pre-tax profits for the three financial industries. These include banking, insurance, and securities, futures, and investment trusts. The banking industry covers local banks, foreign banks in Taiwan, Chinese banks in Taiwan, credit unions, bill finance companies, and postal savings. The insurance industry includes life insurance and property insurance.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Taiwan stock market performed well. This pushed the pre-tax profits of the three financial industries to a record high of NT$606.176 billion in the first half of last year. With good conditions in the stock and currency markets in 2024, the financial industries' total profits for the year could reach NT$1,058.647 billion, making over one trillion for the first time. However, this year, due to new US trade taxes and the New Taiwan Dollar quickly getting stronger by 10.97% in the second quarter, life insurance companies lost a lot of money from currency exchange. So, the three financial industries made NT$145.341 billion in June. Their profit for the first half of this year was NT$378.116 billion, which is 37.51% less than last year.</p>
            <p>Looking at the three financial industries, only banking showed an increase in profit for the first half of the year. Both insurance and the securities, futures, and investment trust sectors saw their profits decrease. Zhang Jia-kuei, the chief secretary of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said that banks' total pre-tax earnings for the first half were NT$301.88 billion. This is an increase of NT$2.6 billion, or 0.9%, compared to last year. Local banks made NT$296.73 billion in the first half, which is a 7.3% increase. Both of these amounts are new records for this time of year.</p>
            <p>Zhang Jia-kuei explained that banks' good profits were mainly because they earned more from interest and fees, and they lost less money from bad debts. However, their income from investments and other sources went down due to the financial market. This canceled out some of their gains. Postal savings also lost money because of currency exchange rates. They lost NT$18.28 billion in the first half of the year. This is NT$22.44 billion less profit than the same period last year.</p>
            <p>The insurance industry's profit in the first half of this year was NT$19.4 billion, which is a drop of more than 90% from last year. Cai Huo-yan, the deputy director of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, said that life insurance companies had a pre-tax profit of NT$3.5 billion in the first half. This is a decrease of NT$211 billion, or 98.4%, mainly because their financial investment gains fell by NT$489 billion. This was more than the NT$284.8 billion increase from their insurance business. Property insurance companies made NT$15.9 billion in pre-tax profit in the first half, an increase of NT$0.7 billion, or 4.6%, mainly due to more profit from their insurance business.</p>
            <p>The securities, futures, and investment trust industries together made NT$56.836 billion in the first half. This is NT$19.26 billion less than the same time last year, a drop of 25.31%. It continues to be "one bad, two good." Huang Chung-hao, the chief secretary of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, said that brokerage firms made NT$39.563 billion in the first half, a decrease of 34.56% from last year. This is because the stock market was very unstable in March and April, and fewer trades happened than last year. This affected the income of brokerage firms from their own trading and from commissions.</p>
            <p>Futures traders had a pre-tax profit of NT$4.67 billion in the first half, an increase of 12.04% from last year. Huang Chung-hao explained that futures trading profits don't only depend on the stock index. They can also make money when the stock market goes up and down. Also, their own trading was good. Investment trust companies made NT$12.603 billion before tax, an increase of 9.87% from last year. This is mainly because the amount of money they manage keeps growing.</p>
