            <h1>Zheng Li-wen Elected KMT Chairperson; DPP Offers Two Hopes, One Reminder</h1>
            <p>The results of the Kuomintang (KMT) chairperson election were announced today. Former legislator Zheng Li-wen has been elected as the new KMT chairperson. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) spokesperson Wu Zheng said tonight that the DPP has "two hopes and one reminder" for the new KMT chairperson. They hope the KMT can return to reasonable politics, put the country's interests first, and work together to face current challenges to national security.</p>
            <p>The DPP sent out a press release tonight. Wu Zheng said that first, they hope the new KMT chairperson will protect Taiwan's independence and put Taiwan's safety before the party's interests. Second, they hope the KMT in the parliament will supervise carefully and act positively. They should not block things because of political ideas and should not propose laws that hurt Taiwan or are against the constitution.</p>
            <p>Regarding the reminder, Wu Zheng said that during the KMT chairperson election, there was clear involvement and influence from China. He reminded the new KMT chairperson and the whole party to be very careful. There is no room for compromise on national security. All political parties should work together to protect national security and stop China's various ways of influencing Taiwan. The KMT should not support China's actions for its own party's benefit and become a helper in China's information war.</p>

            <h1>Trump's Trip to Asia: CNN Reports Aides Are Discussing Meeting Kim Jong Un</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 18, 2025. CNN reported today, citing sources, that former President Donald Trump's team is privately talking about whether he could meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his upcoming trip to Asia.</p>
            <p>Reuters, quoting the report, said that US officials have not yet started making plans for such a meeting or talked directly with Pyongyang. Earlier this year, the US tried to set up a meeting, but nothing happened because Pyongyang refused to accept a letter from Trump to Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>After Trump met with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House in August, he said publicly that he was interested in meeting the North Korean leader.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not immediately check CNN's report, and the White House has not yet replied.</p>
            <p>CNN also reported that for Trump's Asia trip, the White House is focusing more on his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping because of growing trade problems between the US and China.</p>
            <p>However, Trump has said many times, both publicly and privately, that he wants to meet Kim Jong Un. US officials have always been open to Trump meeting the North Korean leader during his Asia trip. During Trump's first time as president, officials helped arrange a handshake between the two leaders in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas in less than 48 hours after Trump sent an invitation on Twitter. This shows that things can change quickly.</p>
            <p>At the same time, North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un also said last month at the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea that he was open to meeting Trump.</p>
            <p>He said then, "Personally, I have good memories of US President Trump. If the United States can stop its pointless focus on denuclearization and is willing to work for peace with North Korea based on understanding reality, then we have no reason not to sit down and talk with the United States."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Series: Rakuten Monkeys Win First Game; Pedro Fernandez to Pitch in Game 2 Against CTBC Brothers' Brandon Leibrandt</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 18, 2025. The Rakuten Monkeys baseball team won the first game of the Taiwan Series today. The Monkeys' manager, Kobo Kaku, said that the fans in the left outfield were even louder than the home team's fans, and he was very thankful for them. Tomorrow, the Monkeys will have Pedro Fernandez start the game against Brandon Leibrandt from the CTBC Brothers.</p>
            <p>The Rakuten Monkeys beat the CTBC Brothers 3-0 in the first game of the Taiwan Series today, taking an important first win. Kobo Kaku said, "We have been playing since the challenge series, so the players are a bit tired. But no player said anything. Everyone did their best on the field, and we coaches were there to help them."</p>
            <p>Kobo Kaku also thanked the Monkeys fans who cheered loudly in the left outfield guest section today. He said, "From the start of practice, I saw our Rakuten fans filling up from the first level to the top. Their cheers today were as loud as the home team's. I am very thankful for them coming to support us."</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, the Monkeys will have their ace pitcher Pedro Fernandez start the game against the Brothers' pitcher Brandon Leibrandt. Fernandez was the best pitcher in the CPBL this season for wins and strikeouts, with 15 wins, 168 strikeouts, and a 2.01 ERA. Leibrandt started 14 games this season, with 7 wins and 3 losses, and a 1.94 ERA.</p>
            <p>In this game, the Monkeys scored runs after Lin Li stole a base in the first inning and Lin Tzu-wei stole a base in the third inning. Kobo Kaku said that these two stolen bases were sometimes planned and sometimes the players decided to do them on their own. He added, "The two players who stole bases were very brave to make those decisions, and they were key to our scoring today."</p>
            <p>Also, in the fourth inning, Chen Chen-wei hit a single, then ran to second base when the left fielder Tseng Sung-en and second baseman Yueh Tung-hua were not paying attention. Kobo Kaku said that Chen Chen-wei saw what the opposing left fielder (Tseng Sung-en) was doing and also thought about the opponent's arm strength for throwing the ball. "He took advantage of their mistake and moved to the next base. It was a very good play."</p>
