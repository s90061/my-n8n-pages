            <h1>White House Says Netanyahu Promised Qatar No More Attacks After Israel Hit Doha</h1>
            <p>(Washington, September 29, Central News Agency) On September 9, Israel launched air attacks on Doha, the capital of Qatar. These attacks were aimed at the leaders of Hamas, a Palestinian armed group. The US government said that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu called Qatar's Prime Minister from the White House today. He said he was sorry about the attack and promised that Israel would not do it again.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and BBC reported that Netanyahu's attitude had been firm since the Israeli attack on Qatar. Today's call happened while he was meeting with US President Donald Trump to talk about a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>A statement from the White House said that Israel's missile attack on Hamas targets in Qatar accidentally killed Qatari soldiers. The statement read, "Prime Minister Netanyahu expressed his deep regret."</p>
            <p>The statement also mentioned that Netanyahu "said again that Israel will not launch such attacks in the future."</p>
            <p>The White House also said that the leaders of Israel and Qatar agreed to President Trump's idea. They hope to create a three-way system. This system would help them work together better, talk more openly, and increase their efforts to stop threats.</p>
