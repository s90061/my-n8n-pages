Taiwan's Commerce Ministry has included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision is part of ongoing trade and technology tensions with China.

The move means that certain advanced technologies and products can no longer be sold to these Chinese companies without special permission from the Taiwanese government. This action by Taiwan aligns with similar measures taken by the United States, which has also imposed restrictions on Huawei and SMIC to limit China's access to critical technologies, especially those related to advanced semiconductors.

This new control measure is expected to impact the global technology supply chain, as Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors. The decision reflects Taiwan's efforts to protect its technological advantages and align with international partners on strategic trade policies.

**Exploring Three Undiscovered Gems in Global Markets**

Recently, global markets have been complex, dealing with increasing tensions in the Middle East and changing trade relations between major economies. Smaller-cap companies, especially those in Asia, often face more challenges during such times. However, these conditions can also reveal hidden investment opportunities.

A closer look at certain sectors and regions suggests that some companies might be undervalued, offering potential for growth. These "undiscovered gems" are typically businesses with strong fundamentals, good management, and promising future prospects, but whose true value is not yet fully recognized by the broader market.

Investors are now focusing on identifying these companies, often by analyzing their financial health, market position, and innovation potential. While the overall market might seem uncertain, carefully chosen investments in these overlooked areas could provide significant returns as their worth becomes clearer.

**UK "Woefully Unprotected" Against Undersea Cable Sabotage by China and Russia**

A new report suggests that the United Kingdom is not adequately prepared to defend against potential sabotage of its undersea cables by China and Russia. The analysis indicates that both China and Russia are increasing their operations targeting these crucial underwater communication lines.

The report, from the China Strategic Risks Institute (CSRI), examined 12 alleged incidents of undersea cable sabotage between January 2021 and April 2025. In 10 of these cases, a suspect vessel was identified, and eight of those were directly linked to China or Russia, either by their flag registration or company ownership. This highlights a significant and growing threat to vital Western infrastructure.
