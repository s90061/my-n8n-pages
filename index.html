            <h1>China's Community Canteens Close Down After Subsidies Stop</h1>
            <p>Community canteens in China, mainly for older people, were very popular at one point. Over 1700 opened across the country starting in 2022. But now, many of them have closed. The main reasons are that these canteens were started as government projects and most were run by outside companies. When the government stopped giving them money, they could not continue. Also, many older people who bought meal cards for these canteens cannot get their money back.</p>
            <p>On October 31, 2022, China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development and Ministry of Civil Affairs issued a notice. It was about starting "complete community" pilot projects. These projects aimed to improve community services. They planned to build kindergartens, service centers for older people, medical centers, and also useful shops. These shops included convenience stores, vegetable shops, canteens, pharmacies, and home service centers. The goal was to give residents "one-stop" services.</p>
            <p>The notice also asked each county-level city and district to choose three to five communities for these "complete community" pilot projects. The plan was to expand this idea across the whole country in two years. These projects were meant to provide many services for people's daily lives, and community canteens were part of this. After this notice, many community canteens began to open all over China. Unofficial numbers show that about 1700 community canteens were set up in about one year after the notice was sent out.</p>
            <p>However, Chinese media reports say that soon after many community canteens opened, they started to have problems with money and not enough customers. This led to many community canteens in places like Beijing, Xi'an, Shenyang, Hangzhou, and Suzhou closing down a lot since last year. Some canteens even closed less than two months after opening.</p>
            <p>For example, in Suzhou, to follow the government's plan, more than 2000 community canteens were opened. These were called "meal points for the elderly." But at least half of them started losing money, and many community canteens simply stopped operating.</p>
            <p>According to reports, when these community canteens first opened, they received special money or cheaper rent from local governments. This made private companies happy to sign up to run the canteens for the communities. But in recent years, local governments have had less money. So, some places stopped giving money to the community canteens. This made it very hard for the people running the canteens to keep going. They could no longer offer cheap food, which made them lose customers, and finally, the canteens closed.</p>
            <p>Community workers have said that some community canteens were created just to "complete tasks from higher up." They did not truly study what older people needed. Even worse, many older people bought meal cards for the canteens. But because the canteens closed, they still cannot get their money back. Their money is completely lost.</p>
            <p>Right now, some community canteens are still open, but they are facing difficulties. They are only barely continuing because they still receive some money. Experts have pointed out four reasons for these problems. First, the taste of the food is not good enough to meet people's needs. It is hard to make food that both older people and younger people like. Also, to save money, many canteens even use "pre-made dishes," which are not popular in China now and make people not want to eat there.</p>
            <p>Second, the food choices are always the same. After a while, people noticed that the canteen always had only a few dishes. This was very boring and not varied. But if they changed the menu often, the costs would increase a lot, making it even harder to run the canteen. Third, even if the food at the canteens was quite cheap, many older people got tired of the limited food options. They preferred to go back to buying food and cooking for themselves, because cooking at home is even cheaper.</p>
            <p>Fourth, most community canteens in China are led by the community but given to private companies to manage. However, these companies often want to make a profit. They care more about getting special offers and money from the government. They rarely put effort into running the canteen well. So, when the government stops giving money, the companies naturally close down.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Coast Guard Ships Enter Kinmen Waters Twice, Taiwan Coast Guard Drives Them Away</h1>
            <p>Four Chinese Coast Guard ships entered the waters near Kinmen two times today, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Taiwan's Coast Guard sailed next to them and made them leave. The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch of the Coast Guard Administration said this is the first time in two years that Chinese Coast Guard ships have caused problems on a Sunday. This happened the day after a special vote called a recall and a referendum, which is different from how things usually happen.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch of Taiwan's Ocean Affairs Council's Coast Guard Administration shared a news report today. It stated that at 8:50 AM today, four Chinese Coast Guard ships with numbers "14608," "14527," "14603," and "14515" sailed into Kinmen waters. They came from the southwest side of Damao Mountain. They turned off their "Automatic Identification System" (AIS), which shows where ships are, and sailed east in a line. Taiwan's Coast Guard saw them and quickly sent patrol boats to deal with the situation. By 11:00 AM, they had made the Chinese Coast Guard ships leave the restricted waters.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch explained that the same four Chinese Coast Guard ships bothered Kinmen waters again at 3:00 PM. Taiwan's Coast Guard patrol boats, which were already nearby, quickly went close to them. They used radios to tell the Coast Guard ships in both Chinese and English to change direction and leave. Taiwan's patrol boats watched the Chinese Coast Guard ships closely as they sailed out of Kinmen's restricted waters by 5:10 PM.</p>
            <p>The Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu branch pointed out that this is the first time in two years that Chinese Coast Guard ships have caused problems on a Sunday. This happened the day after a recall and referendum vote, making the situation different from before.</p>
            <p>The Coast Guard Administration's news report asked China to stop actions like these that harm peace and stability in the area. They warned that these actions might make people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait feel angry. The Coast Guard said it will always have a strong position on enforcing laws, respond fully, and work hard to protect Taiwan's power as a country and keep it safe.</p>

            <h1>Lu Shiow-yen Not Running for KMT Leader, Huang Kuo-chang: Can Discuss 2026 After Result</h1>
            <p>Today, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen announced that she will not run for the leader of the Kuomintang (KMT) party. Huang Kuo-chang, who is the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party (TPP), said he believes Mayor Lu has many reasons for her choice. He respects the way other political parties choose their leaders. He added that after the KMT election results are known, both parties can talk and discuss plans for the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, KMT Chairman Eric Chu publicly asked Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to become the new party leader. But today, Lu Shiow-yen announced her decision. She said that industries are facing a very difficult time right now. She believes she must stay in her current job during this hard period. She used the phrase, "Mom will stay home," to explain that she cannot run for KMT leader.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Huang Kuo-chang went to an event in Sanchong, New Taipei City. When reporters asked him questions, Huang Kuo-chang said that Lu Shiow-yen is a very good political person and has more experience in politics than him. He believes she has many different reasons for her decision. He explained that the central government has handled the high taxes from the United States very badly. This has seriously damaged the tool machine industry in central Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that Lu Shiow-yen is focusing on her city's work and wants to help businesses that make tool machines. He called this "her strong decision to take responsibility." As for the KMT leader election, he respects the democratic process inside other parties. He said the most important thing is for him to do his own job well. He wants to talk and work with others openly and kindly. After the final result of the KMT election is known, both parties can discuss and communicate about their plans for the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>Reporters also asked about a vote (referendum) to restart a nuclear power plant in Sanchong. This vote did not get enough people to agree. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said that spending 1.1 billion New Taiwan dollars on this was wasting public money. Huang Kuo-chang said this shows that the DPP has not really started to think about and understand their mistakes. He believes the "very bad recall vote" that the DPP started was the real waste of public money. He said the large number of votes in this recent referendum clearly shows that the public has rejected the DPP's main idea of a "nuclear-free homeland." The DPP now has no choice but to let go of this idea.</p>
            <p>Talking about changing the Referendum Act, Huang Kuo-chang said he had discussed it with Lo Chih-chiang, who is a senior leader in the KMT group in the legislature. He fully supports Lo Chih-chiang's idea for a bill that would allow referendums to be held together with general elections. This bill would simply go back to how things were before 2019. Members of the TPP also think that the current rules for referendums, which are like a "birdcage" because they make it hard for people to vote, should be changed. Otherwise, if referendums are not held with elections, and then people complain that not enough people voted, it means only the DPP gets to decide everything.</p>
            <p>Also, on August 23, Wu Yi-cheng, who was a TPP candidate for Kaohsiung mayor before, wrote something on social media. He talked about his daughter, who works for a TV station. She asked a question that Huang Kuo-chang called a "stupid question." Wu Yi-cheng tried to make the situation calmer. He also hoped that Huang Kuo-chang would use more wisdom and patience when he talks to the public for the TPP.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that day he did not shout at the reporter at all. He was shouting at what he called the "ridiculous question" that the reporter said an internet user had asked. So, he replied to the reporter by saying, "What kind of stupid question is this?" He meant that the internet user's question was very silly. Wu Yi-cheng is a good political person, and when Huang Kuo-chang visited Kaohsiung, they talked very nicely. Huang Kuo-chang said he will humbly accept advice from older, more experienced politicians.</p>
            <p>Regarding some internet users saying that Huang Kuo-chang's US lawyer license was "cancelled," Huang Kuo-chang said he is now a legislator in Taiwan. How could he pay the membership fees to the American Bar Association? He asked, "Isn't this a very stupid question?" He passed the US bar exam in 1999. Then he continued his studies to get a doctorate, came back to Taiwan to teach, worked at Academia Sinica, and is now a legislator. He asked, "What is the important point of this question?"</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said about people illegally looking for private information about his son, who is not an adult, "I will not participate in this strange behavior." He said this on the first day, he says it today, and if they keep asking about it in the future, he will still say the same thing.</p>
