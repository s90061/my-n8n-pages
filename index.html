            <h1>US-Russia Summit to Happen Soon; Trump Says Ukraine Will Decide on Land Exchange</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 15 â€“ The US-Russia summit is coming soon. Today, US President Trump said that they will talk about exchanging land between Russia and Ukraine. But he added that Ukraine must make its own decision. Trump said his goal for the trip is to get Ukraine to the discussion table. He also said he wants a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine very soon. "If it's not today, I'll be unhappy," he said.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for almost three and a half years. This morning, Trump flew to Anchorage, the biggest city in Alaska. Later, he will have a private meeting with Putin. Their talk will focus on the Russia-Ukraine issue. This will be the first meeting between current US and Russian presidents since 2021.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to reporters on Air Force One, the presidential plane. He said that the meeting will cover the topic of land exchange. But he repeated that Ukraine must decide for itself, and he thinks Ukraine will make the "right decision."</p>
            <p>He said, "I am not here to talk for Ukraine. I am here to get them to the discussion table."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said his meeting with Putin would be "a good meeting." But he stressed that the second meeting is more important. That meeting would be a three-way talk between Putin, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and him. He added, "Maybe some European leaders will also be invited."</p>
            <p>Today, he stressed again that he hopes to see a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine very soon. "If it's not today, I'll be unhappy," he said. His goal in helping with talks is to stop the killing.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked about Russia still attacking Ukraine with drones before the US-Russia summit, Trump replied that maybe Putin thinks this will make him stronger in the talks. But Trump believes this is bad for Putin, and he will bring it up in the meeting.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said that the United States might work with Europe to give security help to Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Says Russia is Still Killing People on the Day of Trump-Putin Summit</h1>
            <p>Anchorage, August 15 â€“ US President Trump and Russian President Putin flew to Alaska today for an important summit. This meeting will test Trump's promise to end the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said that Moscow is still killing people on the very day of the summit.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, both Trump and Putin said they hope the talks will be successful. But Trump warned that if Putin does not give in at all, he might decide the talks have failed just minutes after they begin. The Kremlin, however, said the two leaders are expected to talk for "at least" six or seven hours.</p>
            <p>For Putin, this Alaska summit is the first time he has been on Western land since he ordered a full invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.</p>
            <p>In recent days, Russia has made big gains in the war. This might put Putin in a strong position for any ceasefire talks.</p>
            <p>On his way to Anchorage on Air Force One, Trump spoke to reporters in a hopeful tone. He said, "Both sides have some respect. I think some good results will come out of it."</p>
            <p>Leaders in Europe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be watching every move and word from them closely. Zelenskyy was not part of these talks. He has openly said no to Trump's pressure for Ukraine to give up land that Russia has taken.</p>
            <p>Hours before the Trump-Putin summit started today, Zelenskyy said that Moscow is still killing people and has shown no sign of wanting to end the war.</p>
            <p>In a video he posted online, he said, "Moscow has not given any orders or any signs to end the war... They are still killing people on the day of the talks."</p>
