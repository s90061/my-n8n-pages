            <h1>Argentina's President Milei looks for help, and Trump says he is a great leader</h1>
            <p>Donald Trump, the President of the United States, said today that Javier Milei, the President of Argentina, is a "great leader." President Milei is having problems and is looking for economic and political support from his strong friend, Trump.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Trump's government promised to give Argentina 20 billion US dollars. This money was meant to help Argentina's economy, which is not doing well. But this help did not make the markets feel better. It also did not make people like President Milei more before a very important election.</p>
            <p>When Trump and Milei met outside the West Wing, a reporter asked Trump what he wanted to say to the people of Argentina. Trump replied, "We love them. They have a great leader." After this, both leaders showed a thumbs-up to the cameras and then went inside to eat lunch together.</p>
            <p>Argentina is working hard to avoid another financial crisis. Many people are not happy with President Milei. So, this leader, who used to wave a chainsaw as a symbol, came to get help from his right-wing friend, Trump.</p>
            <p>Trump has said many times in public that he supports President Milei in politics. He also promised a lot of money to help Argentina.</p>
            <p>However, people are also asking questions about Trump. They wonder if this plan to help Buenos Aires (Argentina's capital) fits with his "America First" policy. This policy has made Washington give less money to most other countries.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the markets are still worried about Argentina's situation. President Milei's chances in the election on October 26 have not improved. This election will decide if he can make big changes to cut costs or if he will face problems from lawmakers for the next two years.</p>
            <p>About half of the seats in Argentina's House of Representatives will be chosen again. Also, one-third of the seats in the Senate will change.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Argentina, which has a lot of debt, used more than 1 billion US dollars to keep its money (peso) strong. Most economic experts think this plan cannot work for a long time. This made President Milei's friends in Washington offer financial help.</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, said that Argentina will get 20 billion US dollars. He stated, "Argentina does not have enough cash right now."</p>
            <p>He also said, "The US Treasury is ready to do everything needed to keep the markets stable at any time."</p>

            <h1>World oil prices go down because of trade problems between the US and China, and expectations of more oil.</h1>
            <p>Today, world oil prices dropped. This happened because of two main reasons. First, trade problems between the United States and China are getting worse. This made people less willing to buy things that carry risk. Second, the International Energy Agency (IEA) thinks there will be a lot more oil than needed in 2026.</p>
            <p>The price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, which is for delivery in November, went down by 79 cents. This is a 1.33% drop, making the price 58.70 US dollars for one barrel.</p>
            <p>The price for Brent crude oil, which is for delivery in December, went down by 93 cents. This is a 1.47% drop, making the price 62.39 US dollars for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>Powell hints that the Fed might stop reducing its assets soon, and warns that job growth is much slower.</h1>
            <p>Today, Jerome Powell, who is the head of the US central bank called the Federal Reserve (Fed), suggested that the Fed might soon stop reducing the amount of money it holds. He did not say anything more about what will happen with interest rates in the future. He also warned that new jobs in the United States are growing much more slowly now.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a financial news company, reported that Mr. Powell spoke at an event in Philadelphia. He talked about how the Fed is reducing its money supply, a process called "quantitative tightening" (QT). This means they are selling off more than 6 trillion US dollars worth of things they own.</p>
            <p>Mr. Powell did not give an exact date for when they will stop reducing money. But he said that signs show the Fed is getting close to its goal. This goal is to have "enough money" (reserves) in the banking system.</p>
            <p>In his speech, Mr. Powell said, "Our long-term plan is to stop reducing our money when the amount of money we have is a bit more than what we think is enough. We might reach this point in the next few months. We are watching different signs carefully to make our decision."</p>
            <p>When money is hard to get, the Fed wants to keep a "lot of money" (plentiful reserves) so banks have cash and the economy works well. As things change, the Fed will want to keep "enough money" (ample reserves). This is to stop too much money from being in the market.</p>
            <p>Mr. Powell said, "We have started to see signs that money is slowly becoming harder to get." If the amount of money keeps going down, it could make the economy grow slower. But he made it clear that the Fed does not want to go back to having only about 4 trillion US dollars in its holdings, which was the amount before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.</p>
            <p>About interest rates, Mr. Powell kept his recent opinion. He said that the people who make decisions are carefully watching the job market, which is still quite active. They are also trying to find a balance between making sure there are enough jobs and controlling how fast prices go up.</p>
            <p>He said, "The number of people without jobs in August stayed low. But the number of new jobs created slowed down a lot. This could be because fewer people are starting to work, fewer people are moving here from other countries, and fewer people are looking for jobs. In a job market that is less active and a bit weaker, it seems like there is a higher risk of losing jobs."</p>
            <p>Mr. Powell also mentioned that in September, a group called the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which makes decisions for the Fed, decided to lower the main interest rate by a small amount (0.25%). They did this because of the job situation.</p>
            <p>People think the Fed will lower interest rates two more times before the end of this year. Some other Fed officials agree with this idea. However, Mr. Powell did not say if he thinks this will happen.</p>
            <p>He said clearly, "When we try to find the right balance between our goals for jobs and prices, there is no way to make decisions that has no risks." The FOMC plans to have a meeting about their plans on October 28 and 29.</p>
