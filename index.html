            <h1>Ukraine Plans to Raise Age Limit for Men Leaving Country to 22, to Help Them Study Abroad</h1>
            <p>On August 12, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the government plans to change the age limit for men who are not allowed to leave the country. Currently, this limit is 18 years old. The president wants to increase it to 22 years old. He hopes this change will give more young people the chance to go abroad for study and learning.</p>
            <p>During a forum, President Zelenskyy stated, "There is currently a travel limit of 18 years old at the borders. I suggest increasing this age to 22 years old."</p>
            <p>He explained that this new rule will help young people study in other countries. In the future, they can come back to Ukraine and use what they learned to help their country.</p>
            <p>In addition, President Zelenskyy told the government and the military to make administrative steps simpler. He also announced that it will be easier for people to apply to universities in Ukraine. Ukraine also plans to offer more scholarships next year. More details about these scholarships will be shared within 10 days.</p>
            <p>Under Ukraine's current laws, during wartime, men aged 25 to 60 must join the military if they are called. There are some exceptions, for example, if they have a medical reason or are the only person taking care of their family. Men aged 18 to 24 can join the military if they choose to. However, men aged 18 to 60 are generally not allowed to leave the country because of border controls.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for three and a half years. The Ukrainian army still needs more soldiers. The military continues to use different gentle ways to get young men to join. These ways include a plan called "18 to 24," which offers good rewards. They also hold military training camps and put up many posters. Recently, they changed the law to allow men over 60 to volunteer for the army. But, these efforts have not been very effective overall.</p>
            <p>At the same time, many people in Ukraine try to avoid joining the military. Some even fake documents to show they are studying abroad. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced late last month that they found 14 criminal groups across the country. These groups were helping people avoid military service. Members of these groups included government workers, medical staff, and drivers. Reports say that some of these people took money and made false medical reports. Some drivers of bread factories even helped people cross the border illegally by hiding them in their trucks while delivering bread.</p>

            <h1>US July Consumer Prices Stay Mostly the Same, European Stocks Show Mixed Results</h1>
            <p>New information shows that consumer prices in the United States in July went up less than expected. They also stayed mostly the same compared to the month before. This means that the new taxes on goods (tariffs) put in place by President Trump have not caused a big change in prices. Today, the three main stock markets in Europe had different results at the end of the day.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a small amount, by 18.10 points, which is 0.20%. It closed at 9147.81 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 56.56 points, which is 0.23%. It closed at 24024.78 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 54.90 points, which is 0.71%. It closed at 7753.42 points.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Willow Gets Stronger and Bigger, Kinmen Added to Land Warning</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow is affecting Taiwan. The weather agency said that in the last three hours, Willow has become a bit stronger, and its storm circle has also grown a little. It is expected to hit Taiwan as a medium-strength typhoon. The land warning now includes Kinmen. The storm circle will reach the land in Hualien and Taitung on the morning of August 13.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Agency, Typhoon Willow was at 21.7 degrees North and 124.2 degrees East at 11 PM on August 12. This is about 340 kilometers southeast of Taitung. It is moving towards the northwest-west at 27 kilometers per hour. The strongest winds near its center are 38 meters per second (about 137 kilometers per hour), which is equal to a 13-level wind.</p>
            <p>The weather agency said that Willow got a bit stronger and its storm circle became a little bigger in the last three hours. Its center is now in the sea southeast of Taitung and is moving northwest-west. Its storm circle has started to move into the Bashi Channel and the southeastern sea near Taiwan. It is a danger to Taitung, Hualien, areas south of Miaoli, Penghu, and Kinmen. It is still expected to get a bit stronger.</p>
            <p>Zhu Meilin, a forecaster, said that after late Tuesday night, areas like Lanyu, Green Island, Greater Taipei, and the northeast will start to have rain and wind from time to time.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zhu said that Willow is expected to be close to Lanyu and Green Island from early morning to morning, and the wind and rain will become much stronger. From morning to noon on August 13, it will be close to the southeast part of Taiwan. Around noon, it will land in the Taitung area. It is expected to stay strong or even get stronger. In the evening, it will move out to sea from the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area. So, the whole day will have the most significant wind and rain. There is a chance of rain all over Taiwan, and the eastern part, and areas south of Chiayi, might have heavy rain or downpours.</p>
            <p>Ms. Zhu added that on the evening of August 13, Willow's center will be west of Penghu and then move towards China. It will slowly become weaker. In the evening, the wind and rain on Taiwan's main island will decrease, but Penghu and Kinmen will still have strong wind and rain.</p>
            <p>Also, the weather agency reminded people that temperatures in areas south of Chiayi and in eastern Taiwan will be about 27 to 30 degrees Celsius. Areas north of Yunlin will feel hot and humid, with temperatures above 32 or 33 degrees, because of sinking air on the leeward side. There is a chance of very high temperatures, over 36 degrees, in some parts of Miaoli to Changhua and Kinmen.</p>
