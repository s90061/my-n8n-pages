            <h1>AUBL: Song Xin-hao Scores 29 Points, NCCU Wins Championship Against Beijing Tsinghua University</h1>
            <p>In the Asian University Basketball League (AUBL) held in Hangzhou, China, the NCCU Griffins, the only team from Taiwan, won the championship game today. Song Xin-hao scored 29 points, the most in the game. The team beat Beijing Tsinghua University 82 to 79 to take home the title.</p>
            <p>The AUBL is supported by Joseph Tsai, the chairman of Alibaba Group, who is from Taiwan. The NCCU Griffins had just won their fifth straight UBA college basketball championship this year. They were the only team from Taiwan in the league. They showed their strong skills in the tough competition. In the semi-finals, they beat Etugen University from Mongolia, which led them to the final game against the home team, Beijing Tsinghua University.</p>
            <p>At the start of the first quarter, NCCU's main guard, Song Xin-hao, took charge of the team's offense. Another guard, Xu De-qi, also scored many points. Their foreign player, Popoka, played strongly near the basket. Together, they helped NCCU stay close in points and led by 3 points at halftime.</p>
            <p>After halftime, both teams played strong defense, which made it harder to score. But NCCU still found ways to get points. In the fourth quarter, they even led by 15 points. It looked like they would win easily. However, NCCU then made many mistakes, and the other team scored 11 points in a row. This meant that with only 19.4 seconds left, NCCU's lead was cut to just 4 points, and the game became very close again.</p>
            <p>But with 18.2 seconds left, Lin Zi-hao made two important free throws, securing the win for NCCU. Song Xin-hao also made a key block, stopping the other team from scoring. In the end, NCCU won by 3 points, becoming the champions of this Asian University Basketball League.</p>
            <p>In this game, Song Xin-hao continued his great performance from yesterday, scoring 29 points, getting 12 rebounds, and making 6 assists. He was the most important player for NCCU's victory. Xu De-qi made 4 three-point shots and scored 20 points, with 4 rebounds and 3 assists. Popoka, a strong player near the basket, got 10 points and 11 rebounds.</p>

            <h1>Tamsui Fireworks and Folk Song Concert: Fishermen's Wharf Attracts Over 80,000 People</h1>
            <p>The last event of the "New Taipei Summer Fun at Tamsui Fishermen's Wharf" happened tonight. More than 80,000 people came to enjoy the folk song concert and the fireworks show. New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that after the Danjiang Bridge and Danbei Road are finished, Tamsui will attract even more people to live there.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei Summer Fun event had fireworks and other activities for three weeks. Tonight was the last show. It started with a concert called "Next Stop, Sing Folk Songs Together." Then, at 8 PM, the "Lovers' Bridge" fireworks show lit up the Tamsui River. People started arriving in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih spoke at the folk song concert. He said that when he first started working in New Taipei, Tamsui had about 120,000 people. Now, it has 200,000 people. He added that the Danjiang Bridge will open in March next year. After that, the Bali Light Rail and the second phase of the Tamsui Light Rail will be built. When Danbei Road is also finished, the traffic system will be complete. Tamsui will become an even better place to live, with less traffic, and more people will choose to live there.</p>
            <p>Later, the "Lovers' Bridge" fireworks show started at 8 PM. The city government said the show was inspired by the Qixi Festival's Magpie Bridge, which is a story about lovers. It combined many types of fireworks with lights on the water. Arch-shaped fireworks looked like a bridge for lovers. These connected with bridge-like light beams and moving fireworks to create the picture of lovers walking hand in hand over a bridge.</p>
            <p>The show included 12-inch large fireworks that shot high into the sky. They exploded into large, bright shapes like peonies and dahlias, creating a beautiful "dream flower rain" that fell through the night sky. This showed feelings growing stronger. There were also special "tiger tail" and "thousand-wheel" fireworks on the water, making a huge "thousand flower tree" of lights on the Tamsui River. The whole fireworks show moved from low to middle to high in the sky, creating a very creative and romantic summer celebration.</p>
            <p>The city government estimated that over 80,000 people watched the fireworks from both the Bali and Tamsui sides of the river. Even though there were many people and cars, traffic moved smoothly because the police and MRT staff helped guide everyone.</p>
