            <h1>Shooting at Catholic School in Minnesota, US: 3 Dead, 20 Hurt</h1>
            <p>Officials from the US Department of Justice say that a shooting happened today at a Catholic school in the south of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Three people died, and 20 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that an official, who did not want to be named, also said that the shooter was among those who died.</p>
            <p>The school where the shooting happened is called Annunciation Catholic School. It had just started its new school year two days ago. This private school has about 395 students.</p>
            <p>Police in Richfield, a nearby area, said that a man dressed in black and carrying a rifle was reportedly seen at the school. Local news said that the children were at morning mass when the shooting happened.</p>
            <p>TV pictures from the area showed parents walking with their children, who wore green polo shirts, blue shorts, and skirts. They walked under a yellow police tape to leave the school.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump wrote on social media that he had been told about the shooting. He also said that the FBI had arrived at the school. He asked people to "Please pray with me for those involved in this!"</p>

            <p>At the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan, Taiwanese shooting stars Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu won a bronze medal today. They worked together in the mixed team trap shooting event. In the match for the bronze medal, they beat Qatar with a score of 43 to 37. This is the first medal for Taiwan's shooting team at these championships.</p>
            <p>Yang Kun-pi, who has represented Taiwan three times in the Olympics, competed today with his partner Liu Wan-yu in the mixed team trap shooting. In the three qualifying rounds, both shooters did well. Yang Kun-pi scored 24, 25, and 24 points, only missing two targets. He got the highest score of 73 points in the whole event. Liu Wan-yu improved as she went on, scoring 20, 21, and 24 points. Together, they got 138 points, which put them in 4th place and let them move on.</p>
            <p>They missed the gold medal match by just two points. However, in the bronze medal match against Qatar, Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu showed great strength. In the third round, they both hit all 10 targets, getting a perfect score. This gave them a 6-point lead and set them up to win. Their opponents could not catch up, so Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu won 43 to 37. This also brought the first medal for the Taiwanese shooting team at these Asian Championships.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu have been a team in international competitions for many years. They won a silver medal together at the 2019 Universiade in Naples. After that, they won mixed team events in other competitions, like the Shooting World Cup and the Asian Trap Cup. Now, they have won a bronze medal together at the Asian Shooting Championships.
