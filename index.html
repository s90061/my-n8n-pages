            <h1>Five Groups Trying to Remove Officials Say Taipei City Government Is Not Fair; City Says It Treats Everyone the Same</h1>
            <p>Five groups trying to remove officials said today that the Taipei City Government has made it difficult for them to do their recall activities. They said the city government is not fair. The Taipei City Government, however, said that its departments treat all cases the same way, following the law. It is sad that old issues are being brought up again.</p>
            <p>The groups "Shan Chu Wei Hai," "Chan Chu Hei Xin," "Gang Hu Chu Xiu," "Taiwan Chu Lai Ba," and "Wen Shan Tui Bao" held a joint press conference today at the Koo Kwang-ming Foundation. They accused Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an of not being fair in their recall efforts and not sharing resources fairly. They also showed a complete record of what they say are unfair actions by the government.</p>
            <p>A-mei, a spokesperson for "Shan Chu Wei Hai," said that in early June, their group put up a billboard about the recall on Bade Road, near the KMT party office. On July 14, someone reported it, and it was taken down. At the same time, the group reported that billboards in front of the KMT Taipei City Party Office and other places were also against the rules, just like theirs. The Building Management Office said they would reply by July 9, but they still have not.</p>
            <p>Roger, a spokesperson for "Chan Chu Hei Xin," also said that in March, a friendly group rented Jingqin No. 2 Park from the Parks Department. But the reply said they could not use it because "the same type of event was already planned for the same place in the same month." However, when they checked, there was no such rule. But when KMT lawmaker Hsu Chiao-hsin had people rent 357 community activity centers, the government departments did not check her requests with the same rules.</p>
            <p>Jason, a spokesperson for "Gang Hu Chu Xiu," said that their volunteers who were giving rides to local residents were cursed at by a local leader. He questioned if the lowest-level government workers were being fair. Also, schools were difficult about renting out their places, showing the same unfair treatment.</p>
            <p>Gao Li-cai (Cabbage), a spokesperson for "Wen Shan Tui Bao," said that their group's billboards were reported, and police bothered their workers. They tried to promote their event near an MRT station exit, but station staff sent them away. However, KMT lawmaker Lai Shih-bao did a similar activity but was not sent away. She asked if this was not unfair treatment.</p>
            <p>Wei Wen-hsuan, a deputy spokesperson for the Taipei City Government, said that all related departments, including the Department of Civil Affairs, Department of Education, Parks Department, and Building Management Office, follow the same rules for all cases, whether it is about places or billboards.</p>
            <p>Wei Wen-hsuan said that all the old issues brought up in this press conference had already been answered one by one. The city government feels it is a shame that these explained and cleared cases are being talked about again.</p>

            <h1>TSMC Shares Rise A Lot at the End of the Day; Taiwan Stock Market Goes Up 206 Points, Reaches Over 23,000 Again</h1>
            <p>The National Stabilization Fund continued to support the market, and Taiwan stocks kept going up today. Helped by semiconductor and electronic parts companies, the market rose by over 270 points during the day. It went back above the 23,000-point mark, which gives people confidence. It reached a high of 23,106.43 points. At the end of the trading day, over 7,000 large orders for TSMC were made. The Taiex index closed at 23,042.9 points, up by 206.96 points, which is a 0.91% increase. The total amount of money traded grew to NT$380.128 billion.</p>
            <p>The index for electronic stocks went up by 1.21%, playing a key role in the market's rise. The financial stock index went up by 0.41%, and shipping stocks went up by 0.73%. In traditional industries, tourism, construction, steel, and plastics all went down a little. They fell by 0.3%, 0.26%, 0.15%, and 0.11% respectively.</p>
            <p>For the major electronic stocks, TSMC went up by NT$20, or 1.8%, closing at NT$1,130. MediaTek rose by 1.08%, closing at NT$1,410. Hon Hai (Foxconn) went down slightly by 0.31%, closing at NT$162.5.</p>
            <p>Because there was a shortage of ABF and BT substrate materials, the three main substrate companies â€“ Nanya PCB, Unimicron, and Kinsus â€“ continued to see their stock prices go up with a lot of trading today. Nanya PCB went up by NT$173, reaching its highest point since August last year. Unimicron went up by 2.65%, closing at NT$135.5. Kinsus went up by 3.33%, closing at NT$102.5.</p>
            <p>There are still 18 stocks worth over NT$1,000 each. Aspeed, the most expensive stock, fell throughout the day, closing down by 6.54% at NT$4,860. GUC, the second most expensive stock, rose strongly by 6.82%, closing at NT$3,600. It might benefit from China's plan to make more of its own semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Fubon Securities said that the US government allowing NVIDIA to sell its H20 chips (a simpler version) to China has made the market more confident. Taiwan's stock market increased in price with more trading. The current trends for short-term, monthly, and quarterly averages are all going up, which helps the overall market continue to rise.</p>

            <h1>Germany Spends Record Money on Army Ads; Short Videos Are Key to Attracting Young People</h1>
            <p>Germany is currently making its army much bigger, the most it has grown since World War II. But for the German Federal Ministry of Defence, finding new soldiers is not easy. To get young people to join the army, the German government has spent a record amount of money this year. They are using short videos on social media, talks at schools, and street advertisements to show what army life is like. They hope to fill the empty spots in the army.</p>
            <p>Lately, in central Berlin, at train stations and busy streets, you can often see ads for the German Federal Armed Forces. These ads show young soldiers in camouflage uniforms. Some ads say, "People in uniform also have dreams." Others highlight teamwork and advanced equipment. They use bright colors and interesting short sentences to get the attention of young people.</p>
            <p>In March this year, the German Parliament changed the constitution to allow more spending on defence. This change will help modernize the military. Recently, Chancellor Friedrich Merz publicly stated that Germany needs to become "Europe's strongest army." Defence Minister Boris Pistorius also said that by 2029, Germany should be ready to fight Russia.</p>
            <p>However, not having enough people is the biggest problem for making the army bigger. Official numbers show that the German Federal Armed Forces currently have about 182,000 active soldiers and 49,000 reserve soldiers. This is still a big difference from the 460,000 soldiers needed during wartime. The Ministry of Defence wants to add at least 60,000 active soldiers and increase the reserve force to 200,000.</p>
            <p>To solve the problem of not having enough soldiers, the German Ministry of Defence has been actively advertising to recruit people in recent years. This year, they spent 58 million Euros (about 1.9 billion New Taiwan Dollars) on recruiting. This is 65% more than last year and the highest amount ever spent.</p>
            <p>The Berliner Zeitung newspaper said that the Ministry of Defence uses many different ways to advertise. Besides putting up physical advertisements in public places, they also put a lot of video content on social media platforms.</p>
            <p>Last year, about 41% of the recruiting budget was spent on street advertisements. This included pizza boxes with the army logo, trams painted with camouflage, and light boxes at bus stops. Another 18% was spent on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. They made short videos where soldiers shared their daily lives, showing that army life is varied and modern.</p>
            <p>In addition, the German Ministry of Defence also has a program called "Youth Officers." These are soldiers who visit schools to talk about Germany's and NATO's security policies. Officially, these officers are supposed to "clear up misunderstandings and build understanding." But in reality, they also act as important recruiters for the German Federal Armed Forces in schools.</p>
            <p>One of the most popular "Youth Officers" is David Matei from Stuttgart. He is not only an army captain but also a content creator on TikTok and Instagram with over 370,000 followers. His videos show things like repairing tanks, talking with officers, visiting weapons companies, and filming at NATO and the Munich Security Conference (MSC).</p>
            <p>Some content that Matei posted caused controversy. In one video where he talked with a Ukrainian soldier, the soldier said he only trained for 50 days before being sent to the front line and that he did not want to go to war. Matei responded in a lighthearted way in the video. This led to critics saying he was making war seem like entertainment and not showing how cruel war really is.</p>
            <p>The "German Peace Society â€“ United War Resisters" (DFG-VK), which is one of Germany's oldest anti-war groups, recently strongly criticized the German Ministry of Defence's aggressive recruiting campaigns that target young people.</p>
            <p>Michael Schulze von GlaÃŸer, the group's executive director, said that since Germany stopped its required military service in 2011, the German Federal Armed Forces have been more and more active in recruiting young people, and their methods have become less controlled.</p>
            <p>He directly stated that the military spends tens of millions of Euros on marketing every year, but the actual number of soldiers has almost not grown for many years. Instead, he believes that showing war as an exciting adventure is a very misleading advertising plan.</p>
            <p>The German Ministry of Defence has now suggested changes. They plan that even during peacetime, if there are not enough soldiers, they could start a limited mandatory military service. They also plan to increase the basic pay for those who serve in the military to more than 2,000 Euros per month (about 68,000 New Taiwan Dollars). This is about an 80% increase from the current pay. They hope this will make young people more willing to join the army.</p>
