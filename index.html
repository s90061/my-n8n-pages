US stock markets went down today. This happened because investors were thinking about President Trump's new threats to put tariffs (extra taxes) on goods. Also, big companies will release their financial reports later this month, which made investors careful.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 279.13 points, a 0.63% drop, ending at 44371.51 points. The S&P 500 index lost 20.71 points, or 0.33%, closing at 6259.75 points.

The Nasdaq index, which includes many technology companies, also went down by 45.13 points, or 0.22%, to 20585.53 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index decreased by 11.983 points, or 0.21%, to 5696.293 points.

**Trump Visits Texas After Floods, Ignores Questions About Budget Cuts**

On July 11, President Trump visited areas in Texas affected by severe floods. At least 120 people, including many children, have died. Many people are asking if the government's response to the disaster was good enough.

President Trump and his wife, Melania, flew by helicopter to the Hill Country area in central Texas. They met with emergency workers, families, and officials. A week ago, heavy rain caused rivers to overflow, washing away homes, cabins, RVs, and people.

Trump and Melania arrived in Kerrville, Kerr County, one of the hardest-hit areas, and were met by Texas Governor Greg Abbott.

Rescue efforts are now in their eighth day. Search teams are looking for over 170 missing people, including five girls from a summer camp, among piles of rubble and mud. People are worried that the number of deaths will continue to rise because no one has been rescued alive this week.

Trump did not answer questions about how his plans to cut federal agency budgets might affect disaster relief. He called the flood a "once-in-a-hundred-years disaster" that no one expected.

Trump told NBC News, "After seeing this terrible event, I think you would somehow give a warning. If they saw a lot of water or anything, the alarm would go offâ€¦ but local officials were hit just like everyone else."

After Trump signed a disaster declaration, federal help from FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) began to arrive in Texas over the weekend. However, Trump has not answered questions about FEMA's future. This flood is one of the deadliest disasters in the US recently. It has also made people question Trump's plan to slowly reduce FEMA's role and give states more responsibility.

**Sinner Beats Djokovic to Reach Wimbledon Final, Will Play Alcaraz for Title**

In an exciting men's singles match at Wimbledon today, Jannik Sinner, the current world number one, defeated Novak Djokovic, who holds the record for Grand Slam wins. Sinner won with scores of 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. This is the first time Sinner has reached the Wimbledon final, where he will play against Carlos Alcaraz, who is the defending champion.

The match between Sinner and Djokovic was a major event at Wimbledon this year. Djokovic has reached the Wimbledon final every year since 2018, and Sinner is currently ranked number one in the world.

At the start of the match, Sinner broke Djokovic's serve in the third game. Sinner used very accurate shots from the back of the court, making Djokovic, who is the sixth seed, very tired. Djokovic, who is 38, struggled in the ninth game, and Sinner won the first set on his third chance.

Sinner also started strong in the second set, breaking Djokovic's serve early to lead 2-0 and take more control of the game.

Djokovic had a leg problem at the start of the third set and received a massage. However, he could not stop Sinner's strong play, and Sinner won the match in three straight sets.

Sinner had never reached the Wimbledon final before. In 2023, he lost to Djokovic in the semifinals, and in 2022, he lost to him in the quarterfinals. But he had beaten Djokovic in the 2024 Australian Open and this year's French Open. Today, he won again and will now face Carlos Alcaraz, who is trying to win Wimbledon for the third time in a row.

Sinner lost to Alcaraz in an epic French Open final last month, where he had three chances to win but could not. He is very eager to get his revenge in the Wimbledon final.
