            <h1>Oil Prices Go Up as Market Waits for Trump's Statement on Russia-Ukraine Situation</h1>
            <p>The White House said that US President Trump was not happy after learning about Russia's missile and drone attacks on Ukraine during the night. He will release a statement about it later today. Because of this, oil prices went up after they had fallen earlier.</p>
            <p>About two weeks ago, Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, USA. However, after this meeting between the US and Russia, there was little progress in stopping the fighting between Russia and Ukraine. Last night, Russia attacked Ukraine again. This caused damage to buildings and at least 15 people died.</p>
            <p>Karoline Leavitt, the White House Press Secretary, said: "He (Trump) is unhappy about this news, but he is not surprised. These two countries have been fighting for a long time." Leavitt also told the media that Trump would make another statement about the situation later today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Brent crude oil futures went up by 57 cents, or 0.8%, ending at $68.62 per barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures went up by 45 cents, or 0.7%, ending at $64.60 per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Japan and UK Defense Ministers Talk, Stress Importance of Peace in Taiwan Strait</h1>
            <p>Japan's Minister of Defense, Gen Nakatani, met with the visiting UK Secretary of State for Defence, John Healey, today. They held talks at Japan's Ministry of Defense and released a joint statement. Both ministers said again that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important. They believe this is crucial for the world's success.</p>
            <p>The statement said that the world's security situation is becoming more difficult. The safety and success of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Indo-Pacific regions are all connected. The two ministers highlighted the strong teamwork between Japan and the UK. They also confirmed again their plan to strengthen their Enhanced Global Strategic Partnership. To protect world peace and stability, they will make their defense stronger and improve security cooperation.</p>
            <p>The joint statement mentioned that Japan and the UK will keep and improve a free and open international system based on law. They will also follow the United Nations Charter, which respects countries' independence and borders, and the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Japan and the UK will continue to lead in these areas to help the international community work well.</p>
            <p>Regarding the situations in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, both defense ministers again showed deep worry. They continue to strongly oppose any actions that try to change the current situation by force or threats.</p>
            <p>The joint statement said, "The defense ministers of Japan and the UK again stated that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important for the world's success. Also, they strongly oppose any actions that try to change the current situation by force or threats." The two ministers also strongly criticized North Korea for developing more nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.</p>
            <p>The defense ministers of Japan and the UK repeated that "Russian President Vladimir Putin's illegal, wrong, and unprovoked full attack on Ukraine is a danger to the security of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Indo-Pacific. It clearly breaks the UN Charter. Japan and the UK support Ukraine, which is fighting for its freedom, independence, and whole territory."</p>
            <p>Both defense ministers welcomed Japan's closer relationship with NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) because of its support for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The defense ministers of Japan and the UK also welcomed the British aircraft carrier strike group. This year, it came to Japan as part of "Operation Highmast" in the Indo-Pacific region. They praised the strike group for its important role in keeping the area stable and following international rules. "Operation Highmast" is a joint training exercise with ships from the United States, Australia, Norway, and Spain. This directly helps Japan and the UK work together better in the sea and air.</p>
            <p>In addition, both defense ministers welcomed the British F-35B stealth fighter jet. It landed on the Japanese destroyer "Kaga" for the first time. They also confirmed again that it is important for the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force and the British Royal Navy and Air Force to be able to work together in the future.</p>
            <p>The British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales (hull number R09) arrived at the US Yokosuka Naval Base in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, on August 12. Today, it moved to the Tokyo International Cruise Terminal in Tokyo Port. This is the first time a British aircraft carrier has docked in Tokyo Port since World War II. The carrier is planned to leave Japan on September 2.</p>
            <p>After their meeting and joint press conference, the two defense ministers also went to Tokyo Port to attend a ceremony welcoming the HMS Prince of Wales to Tokyo Port.</p>
            <p>Japan's Minister of Defense, Gen Nakatani, gave a speech and said, "The arrival of the HMS Prince of Wales shows that the security of Europe and the Indo-Pacific region cannot be separated... This sends a very important message for the stability of the region."</p>
            <p>Captain William Blackett of the HMS Prince of Wales spoke to the media and said, "The HMS Prince of Wales is the largest and most modern warship in the British Navy, with advanced technology." He also said, "The HMS Prince of Wales came to Japan after a long journey, and the crew are all very happy. I look forward to the events at Tokyo Port, which will let everyone see how excellent the HMS Prince of Wales is."</p>
            <p>When a CNA reporter asked if the HMS Prince of Wales had passed through the Taiwan Strait on its trip, Captain Blackett did not give a clear answer. He only said, "As captain, I follow orders."</p>
            <p>In June this year, the British Royal Navy patrol ship HMS Spey sailed through the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan praised this action, but China strongly criticized it.</p>
