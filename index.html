            <h1>Ukraine Plans to Raise Age Limit for Men Leaving Country to 22, to Help Them Study Abroad</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Tuesday that the government will raise the age limit for men who cannot leave the country. The current age is 18, but it will change to 22. This change aims to give more young people the chance to study and learn new skills in other countries.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy spoke at a meeting and said, "Currently, there is a rule at the border that stops men aged 18 from leaving. I suggest we change this age to 22."</p>
            <p>He explained that this new rule will help young people go abroad for school. After they finish their studies, they can come back to Ukraine and use what they learned to help their country.</p>
            <p>In addition, President Zelenskyy has asked the government and military to make it easier to get the right papers and to apply to Ukrainian universities. Ukraine also plans to offer more scholarships next year. More details about these scholarships will be announced in 10 days.</p>
            <p>According to current Ukrainian law, during wartime, men aged 25 to 60 must join the army if they receive an order. However, some men do not have to join if they have a special reason, for example, if they have a medical problem or are the only person taking care of their family. Men aged 18 to 24 can join the army if they want to. But generally, men between 18 and 60 years old are not allowed to leave the country.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has now been going on for three and a half years. The Ukrainian army still needs more soldiers. The army is trying different soft ways to get young men to join. These ways include a program called "18 to 24," which offers good rewards, and military training camps. They also put up many posters to encourage people to join. Recently, they even changed the law to let people over 60 join the army if they want to. But these efforts have not been very successful.</p>
            <p>At the same time, many people in Ukraine are trying to avoid serving in the army. Some of them fake documents to say they are studying abroad. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced last month that they found 14 criminal groups across the country. These groups were helping people avoid military service. The people in these groups included government workers, medical staff, and drivers. Reports say that some of them took money, made fake medical reports, and even helped people cross the border illegally by hiding them in bread delivery trucks.</p>

            <h1>US July Price Index Stays Mostly the Same, European Stock Markets Show Mixed Results</h1>
            <p>New information shows that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States for July did not increase as much as expected. It also stayed mostly the same as the month before. This means that the taxes put in place by President Trump did not have a big effect on prices. Because of this, the main stock markets in Europe showed different results today.</p>
            <p>The FTSE 100 index in London went up a little bit, by 18.10 points, which is 0.20%. It closed at 9147.81 points.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 56.56 points, which is 0.23%. It closed at 24024.78 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went up by 54.90 points, which is 0.71%. It closed at 7753.42 points.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Willow Gets Stronger and Bigger, Land Warning Now Includes Kinmen</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow is coming towards Taiwan. The weather agency has announced that Willow got a bit stronger in the last 3 hours, and its storm area also got a little bigger. The typhoon is expected to hit Taiwan as a medium-strength typhoon. The land warning now includes Kinmen. The storm's outer edge is expected to reach the land in Hualien and Taitung on Wednesday morning.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Agency, at 11 PM on Tuesday, Typhoon Willow's center was at 21.7 degrees North and 124.2 degrees East. This is about 340 kilometers southeast of Taitung. It is moving towards the northwest at a speed of 27 kilometers per hour. The strongest winds near its center are 38 meters per second, which is about 137 kilometers per hour, or a level 13 wind.</p>
            <p>The weather agency said that Willow's strength increased slightly, and its storm area grew slightly in the past 3 hours. Its center is now over the sea southeast of Taitung and is moving northwest. The storm's outer edge has already started to move into the Bashi Channel and the waters southeast of Taiwan. It poses a danger to Taitung, Hualien, areas south of Miaoli, Penghu, and Kinmen. The typhoon is expected to get a little stronger.</p>
            <p>Weather forecaster Zhu Meilin said that after late Tuesday night, areas like Lanyu, Green Island, Greater Taipei, and the northeast will start to feel the effects of wind and rain that come and go.</p>
            <p>Zhu Meilin explained that Typhoon Willow is expected to get close to Lanyu and Green Island early on Wednesday morning until noon. At that time, the wind and rain will become much stronger. From Wednesday morning to noon, it will approach the southeastern part of Taiwan. Around noon, it is expected to land near Taitung. Its strength might stay the same or get stronger. By Wednesday evening, it will move out to sea from the Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan areas. Therefore, Wednesday will be the day with the most significant wind and rain. All of Taiwan has a chance of rain, especially the eastern parts and areas south of Chiayi, which might experience local heavy rain or even very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Zhu Meilin also stated that on Wednesday evening, the center of Typhoon Willow will be west of Penghu, and then it will move towards China. Its strength will slowly decrease. In the evening, the wind and rain on Taiwan's main island will become weaker, but Penghu and Kinmen will still have strong wind and rain.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the weather agency reminds people that temperatures south of Chiayi and in eastern Taiwan will be around 27 to 30 degrees Celsius. Areas north of Yunlin will still feel hot and humid, with temperatures above 32 to 33 degrees Celsius. This is because of sinking air on the leeward side. There is also a chance that temperatures in Miaoli to Changhua and Kinmen could reach over 36 degrees Celsius in some places.</p>
