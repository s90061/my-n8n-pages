            <h1>Vietnamese Worker Missing After Swimming in Taoyuan; Firefighters Continue Search</h1>
            <p>The Yong'an team of the Taoyuan City Fire Department said today that they received a report yesterday evening. A Vietnamese worker, Mr. Ruan, went missing after swimming at Yong'an Fishing Port. Firefighters started searching but did not find him. They searched again this morning, hoping for good news.</p>
            <p>Ma Guo-yao, a team leader from the Yong'an team, told reporters that a man called them at 5:13 PM yesterday. Mr. Ruan, a 32-year-old Vietnamese worker, went to Yong'an Fishing Port in Xinwu District with his brother and his brother's wife for the holiday. But Mr. Ruan went into the sea to swim and then disappeared. His brother immediately called the police for help. The fire department sent 21 firefighters, 8 fire trucks, and 2 ambulances to search. They also told the Coast Guard to search at sea.</p>
            <p>Ma Guo-yao said that search teams looked near where Mr. Ruan entered the water, but they did not find him. The Coast Guard also sent a helicopter to help search at the location. But by 8:33 PM, they still could not find Mr. Ruan. Because it was late, they had to go back to base. They went out again this morning at 5:45 AM with the police and Coast Guard to search.</p>
            <p>The fire department also reminded people to be careful when swimming at the beach. People should always watch for changes in the tide. They should know their own swimming ability and not swim alone to prevent accidents. If there is an emergency, people should call 110 or 119 for help right away.</p>

            <h1>Trump Sends California National Guard to Portland; Two States Sue in Court</h1>
            <p>The US Department of Defense said today that President Trump is moving about 200 National Guard soldiers to Portland, Oregon. These soldiers were first in the Los Angeles area, California, and were already working for the federal government. California and Oregon have now gone to federal court together. They want to stop this order to send the soldiers.</p>
            <p>Reuters and Associated Press reported that California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X today. He said, "This is a shocking misuse of law and power. The Trump government is clearly attacking the rule of law itself." He also guessed that about 300 National Guard soldiers would be sent.</p>
            <p>Late today, California joined a lawsuit started by Oregon in federal court. They want to work together to stop the National Guard from being sent to both places.</p>
            <p>Just one night before, a federal judge in Oregon decided to stop Trump from sending Oregon's National Guard to Portland for now. The judge said there was no proof that recent protests there needed the National Guard.</p>
            <p>However, Sean Parnell, a spokesperson for the US Department of Defense, said in an email today. He stated, "By the President's order, about 200 California National Guard soldiers, who are under federal control, have moved from the greater Los Angeles area to Portland, Oregon. They will help federal staff, like those from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Their job is to do public duties, which include following federal law and keeping federal property safe."</p>
            <p>Because the US Department of Defense and California's Governor gave different numbers of soldiers, Reuters asked the California Governor's office. The office replied that 300 soldiers would be sent to Portland, and 200 of them were already on their way.</p>
            <p>According to the updated lawsuit filed today, 300 National Guard soldiers were first in Southern California. They were called to federal service until early November. But recently, leaders in California's military department were told that these 300 people "will soon be sent to Portland."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit says that the President can only use the National Guard in certain situations. These include stopping an invasion, putting down a rebellion, or enforcing federal laws. The lawsuit repeated, "There is no rebellion happening in Portland right now."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit claims that Trump sent these National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June to help with immigration laws. Now, there is no legal reason to send them to Oregon to do other jobs.</p>
            <p>A federal judge on September 2nd had ordered that the Trump government could not use the National Guard to help California fight crime. But this decision is now paused because the government has appealed. So, the soldiers sent to Oregon are still working for the federal government and are still under Trump's command.</p>
            <p>The National Guard is a group of soldiers based in each state. They usually follow their state governor's orders. They only follow the federal government's orders when they are called to federal service.</p>

            <h1>Tainan Water Museum Celebrates 6th Anniversary with 100-Meter Water Slide</h1>
            <p>The Tainan Mountain Garden Waterway Museum will celebrate its 6th anniversary from October 10th to 12th. The event will focus on "water" and will be a carnival combining nature, ecology, and fun. It will feature a giant 100-meter water slide for visitors to enjoy.</p>
            <p>Museum staff told a CNA reporter today that the Waterway Museum has always offered fun and educational activities since it opened. For its 6th anniversary this year, the theme is "water." They will have a three-day summer carnival. Children under 12 years old can enter for free during the event. The museum hopes more visitors will try the big water slide, which is designed like a waterway. While having fun with water, people can also learn how important water is from the idea of "small water drops flowing."</p>
            <p>The museum stated that besides the 100-meter water slide, this event will have play areas for all ages. This means there will be things for different age groups. These include a big inflatable castle and three inflatable pools. These are good for children who are shorter or younger. The existing swimming pools will also be open.</p>
            <p>The museum also mentioned that this anniversary celebration will combine learning about nature with local culture. For example, people can try tree climbing with experts. This lets them see from high up and use their body skills. There will also be a beekeeper experience. This will let visitors learn about bees and how beekeepers work. The museum will also have a creative market. It will have handmade crafts, cultural goods, and food stalls.</p>
            <p>The museum added that there will also be games for families to play together at the event. They will give out flower-shaped balloons and ice cream toys as prizes.</p>
