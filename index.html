Do you throw away food often? Many people do. It's a problem because it wastes money and hurts the environment. Food waste creates gases that warm the planet.

Here are some easy ways to reduce food waste at home. First, plan your meals. Before you go shopping, make a list of what you need. Only buy what you will use. Second, store food properly. Keep fruits and vegetables in the fridge to keep them fresh longer. Third, use leftovers. Turn leftover chicken into soup or salad.

Small changes can make a big difference. By reducing food waste, you can save money and help the environment.

**Work: Taking Breaks for Better Focus**

Do you feel tired at work? Taking breaks is important for staying focused. Many studies show that short breaks can improve your work.

When you take a break, stand up and move around. Walk outside or do some stretching. Avoid checking your phone or emails. Instead, talk to a colleague or listen to music.

Breaks help your brain rest and recharge. When you return to work, you will feel more alert and productive. Try taking short breaks every hour to improve your focus and well-being.

Visiting markets is a great way to support local businesses and connect with people. It's also a fun and interesting way to experience a new culture. So, next time you travel, visit a local market!
