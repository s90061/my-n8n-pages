            <h1>Putin Suggests Keeping Nuclear Weapons Limits, Trump Says It Sounds Good</h1>
            <p>Today, U.S. President Trump said that Russian President Putin's idea to keep limits on nuclear weapons "sounds like a good idea."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last month, Putin said Russia would willingly follow the limits of the 2010 "New START Treaty." This treaty sets the maximum number of nuclear weapons for the two biggest nuclear powers in the world. This would happen if the U.S. also does the same. The treaty will end in February next year.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump about Putin's suggestion as he left the White House, he said, "I think it sounds like a good idea."</p>
            <p>Last week, Russia's Ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow is still waiting for Trump to respond to Putin's offer to keep limits on nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been growing. This is after many times Russian drones flew into NATO airspace, following a meeting between Trump and Putin in Alaska in mid-August. If they can agree on limiting nuclear weapons now, the situation might get better.</p>
            <p>In a video released today, Putin warned that if the U.S. decides to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles, which can hit deep inside Russia, the relationship between Moscow and Washington could completely break.</p>
            <p>He said in the video, "This will ruin our relationship, or at least stop the positive things that have been happening between us."</p>
            <p>Last month, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance said that Washington is thinking about Ukraine's request for missiles that can hit inside Russia, including Moscow. It is still not clear if the U.S. has made a final decision about this.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Head: Military Has Power to Stop Drug Boats in Caribbean</h1>
            <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he has all the power needed for the U.S. military to attack boats in the Caribbean Sea that are believed to be carrying drugs near Venezuela.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hegseth said this in an interview shown today on Fox News Channel. On October 3rd, the U.S. military attacked, killing four people. This was at least the fourth similar action in recent weeks.</p>
            <p>In an interview on "The Sunday Briefing" show, he said, "We have all the necessary authorization. These groups are considered foreign terrorist organizations."</p>
            <p>Hegseth and U.S. President Trump have not yet shown clear proof that the targeted boats were truly carrying drugs. Last week, Trump told Congress that he has decided the U.S. is in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug trafficking groups, but he did not offer new legal reasons for this.</p>
            <p>Hegseth stated, "If you are in our area, in the Caribbean, north of Venezuela, and you want to bring drugs into the United States, you will be a legal target for the U.S. military."</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that the U.S. military's presence in the Caribbean has successfully stopped drug shipments from South America.</p>
            <p>He told reporters at the White House, "No drugs are coming into our waters now. We will think about the next steps."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Hamas Will Be Destroyed if It Doesn't Give Up Control of Gaza</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump recently told CNN that the Palestinian group Hamas will be "completely destroyed" if they do not give up control of Gaza.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, CNN host Jake Tapper sent Trump a message asking what would happen if Hamas kept its power. Trump answered, "Complete destruction."</p>
            <p>After recently talking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the situation in Gaza, Trump shared a 20-point peace plan for Gaza.</p>
            <p>In his message to Trump, Tapper mentioned what U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham had said. Graham believed that Hamas refusing to "give up weapons, keep Gaza under Palestinian control, and link releasing hostages to talks" meant they rejected the plan.</p>
            <p>Trump replied, "We will know soon. Time will tell everything." He expects to know soon if Hamas is truly working for peace.</p>
