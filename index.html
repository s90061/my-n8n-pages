            <h1>Zhou Chun-mi: Vote to Restart Nuclear Power Plant Clearly Unfair to Pingtung People</h1>
            <p>Pingtung County Governor Zhou Chun-mi said today that almost 20 million people in Taiwan will decide the future of the Third Nuclear Power Plant. This plant is in Hengchun Township, Pingtung. There are only about 680,000 people in Pingtung. She feels it is unfair that so many people from outside Pingtung can decide something that affects Pingtung so much. The vote to restart the Third Nuclear Power Plant clearly treats people in Pingtung badly.</p>
            <p>The public vote on "Do you agree that the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue to run after the main government body confirms it is safe?" will happen on August 23. The Citizen of the Earth Foundation held an event called "No Restart for Nuclear Three, Pray for Taiwan" in Pingtung Library tonight. Many groups of people gathered there. Zhou Chun-mi said that people in Taiwan finally agreed on nuclear power, and a law was made in 2025 to stop using nuclear power. But then, two political parties worked together to change the law quickly and roughly.</p>
            <p>She said she cannot accept this bad treatment of Pingtung people. Pingtung is a big farming and fishing area. "If something bad happens at the Third Nuclear Power Plant, will anyone dare to eat food from Pingtung? Will anyone want to visit for tourism?" She asked people to vote "no" in the public vote.</p>
            <p>Zhong Jia-bin, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party who represents Pingtung's first election area, said this public vote is strange. It wastes money and helps politicians who want more power. It is designed to hurt people in Pingtung and Taiwan. He asked everyone to stand firm and vote "no."</p>
            <p>Hsu Fu-kuei, a lawmaker from the Democratic Progressive Party who represents Pingtung's second election area, said that the Legislative Yuan's Education and Culture Committee will visit the Third Nuclear Power Plant on August 20. They will check how ready it is to "continue running." He said this shows they do not care about what people want. They are using nuclear safety for political reasons and not caring about the feelings of people in Pingtung and Hengchun Township.</p>
            <p>Besides Zhong Jia-bin and Hsu Fu-kuei, other Democratic Progressive Party local council members like Liang Yu-tzu, Hong Ming-jiang, and Li Shih-bin also came to the event. They shouted with the people, "No to Nuclear Three vote in Pingtung, no in Taiwan!" and "Protect Pingtung, protect Taiwan, pray for Taiwan!"</p>

            <h1>China Protests as Japanese Leaders Visit Yasukuni Shrine</h1>
            <p>Today marks 80 years since Japan surrendered in World War II. Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries, Shinjiro Koizumi, and others visited Yasukuni Shrine. Liu Jinsong, who leads the Asian Affairs Department at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with Akira Yokochi, a top diplomat at the Japanese Embassy in China. Liu Jinsong expressed strong disapproval to Japan.</p>
            <p>Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries Shinjiro Koizumi, former Minister in charge of Economic Security Takayuki Kobayashi, and former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Koichi Hagiuda (who was a key member of the Abe group) also visited the shrine today.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs shared news tonight on its website. It said that Liu Jinsong met with Akira Yokochi today. He strongly protested to Japan because Japanese politicians visited Yasukuni Shrine.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Embassy in Japan also put out a statement today on its website. A spokesperson for the embassy, whose name was not given, answered questions about Yasukuni Shrine.</p>
            <p>This spokesperson said that Japanese politicians bowing down at Yasukuni Shrine once again shows that Japan has a wrong attitude towards its history of invasion. This makes neighboring countries in Asia and other countries in the world worry even more about Japan's future direction.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said that this year is the 80th anniversary of "The Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." Understanding history correctly is very important for Japan to be accepted by other countries again after the war. It is also the basic political rule for Japan to have good relationships with nearby countries. And it shows if Japan will keep its promise to develop peacefully.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said that the main point of the Yasukuni Shrine issue is whether Japan can truly understand and think deeply about its history of invasion. It is about whether Japan can stick to what it said and promised about history. It is about whether Japan can follow the goals and rules of the United Nations Charter and keep to a path of peaceful growth. This is a very important issue about invasion and not invasion, good and evil, light and dark.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson said that China wants Japan to face and think about its history of invasion. Japan should be careful with what it says and does about historical issues like Yasukuni Shrine. It should completely separate itself from militarism and stay on the path of peaceful development. By doing so, Japan can gain the trust of its Asian neighbors and other countries.</p>
            <p>Kyodo News reported today that Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba did not visit the shrine. Instead, he sent an offering (money for rituals) at his own cost, as the head of the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
