            <h1>Matsu's Only Night Marathon: 600 Runners Start at Dongju Lighthouse</h1>
            <p>The "2025 Matsu Juguang Starlight Marathon," the only running event at night in Matsu, happened this evening on Dongju Island. More than 600 people finished the race with the sea breeze and stars around them. The people who organized the event also gave runners "all-you-can-eat" mussels. The runners said it was very good.</p>
            <p>From 4 PM today, runners for the 7.5-kilometer and 21.7-kilometer races started in front of the Dongju Lighthouse. They ran one circle around Dongju Island for the shorter race and three circles for the longer race. They finished their race as the sun set and the sea wind blew. The organizers also had many special local foods. These included mussels, Dongju tofu, Roselle tea, and eels cooked in fermented rice. This let the runners taste Matsu's local food.</p>
            <p>To welcome the 600 runners from Taiwan and Matsu, the Matsu Defense Command's Yuntai Combat Skills Team began the event. This was before the race started in the afternoon. In the evening, there was a special party for the runners. For the first time, it was held with the Matsu Defense Command's third Yuntai Exercise. During this exercise, there were very loud sounds from guns and bright lights on the sea. Cannons fired and bullets flew, making red and blue lines in the sky. People shouted, "I love our army!" This made everyone very excited.</p>
            <p>Chen Ming-chieh, who is the acting secretary-general of Lienchiang County Government, said that he was happy that runners came to Juguang for this special race. He said they could enjoy Matsu's unique culture through art, culture, and food. Chen Le-li, who is the mayor of Juguang Township, told a reporter that this year, all spots for the race were taken in just four days. This was a new record. He hopes to have the event again next year and make it bigger to bring more runners.</p>
            <p>Here are the results for the "2025 Matsu Juguang Starlight Marathon":</p>
            <p>For the 21.7-kilometer race, the top three men were Lin Zhi-jie (1st), Zhu Zhi-jin (2nd), and Lin Bo-zhao (3rd). The top three women were Liu Su-ya (1st), Zheng Xiu-ru (2nd), and Xu Ling-yu (3rd).</p>
            <p>For the 7.5-kilometer fun race, the top three men were Chen Yong-zheng (1st), Chen Bing-hong (2nd), and Huang Kun-jun (3rd). The top three women were Xu Xiang-lan (1st), Zhou Xiu-juan (2nd), and Chen Yu-jiao (3rd).</p>

            <h1>U18 World Cup: Taiwan Hopes for Better Hitting, Will Play Korea for Third Place on the 14th</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan team for the U18 World Cup baseball competition lost to Japan today. This loss does not change their chance to move forward. Tomorrow, they will play against Korea to try and get third place. The main coach, Liao Hong-yuan, said that the team hit the ball better today. He hopes they will hit even better tomorrow so they can win third place.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, it was decided that Taiwan would play Korea for third place in the U18 World Cup on September 14th. Today, Taiwan played against Japan in the Super Round. The Taiwan team got 7 hits in total, and one was a three-base hit by Cai Sheng-jie.</p>
            <p>Coach Liao Hong-yuan said that the team's hitting felt a bit better when they played against Japan today. He hopes they can do even better in the game for third place.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's first pitcher today was Zhang Yi-an. Then, Lin Jun-xi pitched, and Pasula Taki-Slinian finished the game. All these players are good at both pitching and hitting. Zhang Yi-an and Pasula Taki-Slinian pitched for the first time in this competition today.</p>
            <p>Before this, Zhang Yi-an's fastest pitch was 144 kilometers per hour. Today, he pitched for 1.1 innings. The other team got 6 hits against him, and he gave up 6 runs. Four of these runs were his fault. His fastest pitch today was 139 kilometers per hour. Taiwan lost the game 1 to 9. Zhang Yi-an was the pitcher who lost the game.</p>
            <p>Coach Liao Hong-yuan said that Zhang Yi-an had pitched in a practice game before. But today was his first game in the real competition. His pitching speed was not as high, and he gave up many hits. But the pitchers who came in after him were able to stop the other team from scoring more runs.</p>
            <p>Lin Jun-xi pitched for 2 innings today. He allowed only 1 hit, made 2 batters strike out, and did not give up any runs. His fastest pitch was 145 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>Lin Jun-xi said he felt no pressure when he pitched against Japan. He threw the ball into the strike zone. He thought the Japanese batters would be difficult to get out, and they were. But he just did his best when he was pitching. He also said he was happy to have the chance to play in the World Cup.</p>

            <h1>Mooncake Packaging Problem Causes Mold; SunnyHills Stops Production and Offers Refunds</h1>
            <p>SunnyHills, a well-known company that makes pastries, recently heard from customers that their mooncakes had mold. SunnyHills said that a problem with how the packaging was sealed on a new production line caused this. They have decided to stop making mooncakes this year right away. They are sorry to their customers and will let them cancel orders and get their money back.</p>
            <p>SunnyHills made a public statement. It said that some customers told them recently that their mooncakes were moldy. The company started to look into all the possible reasons for this problem. After looking very carefully many times, they found that the problem was from a mistake in sealing the packaging on their new mooncake making line.</p>
            <p>SunnyHills explained that this problem only happened a few times. But it was during the time when many mooncakes were being sent out for the Mid-Autumn Festival. There was not enough time to find a solution that would definitely fix the problem for all mooncakes. Because they care about their customers, they decided to stop making all mooncakes for this year immediately. They also stopped sending out any mooncakes.</p>
            <p>For customers who already received their mooncakes, SunnyHills said they would give money back to everyone who bought mooncakes. Customers can get a refund if they have their receipt. For orders that have not been sent yet, customers can cancel their order and get their money back. Or, if the customer agrees, they can choose to get other products instead.</p>
