**Global Trade War and Russian Supply Risk Lessen, International Oil Prices Drop**

On July 14th, in New York, international oil prices fell. This happened as President Trump started a global trade war again, but his plan to stop the fighting between Russia and Ukraine did not include new rules for Russian energy exports. West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August went down by $1.47, to $66.98 per barrel. Brent crude oil for September went down by $1.15, to $69.21 per barrel.

**New York Times: High Tariffs Coming, Taiwan, Japan, Europe, India May Still Make Deals**

According to The New York Times, countries like India, the EU, Taiwan, and Japan might still make trade deals with the United States to avoid some new taxes. However, even with deals, US tariffs could still go up a lot. Important industries like semiconductors and medicine might face special tariffs by the end of the month.

The US Treasury Department reported that tariff income for 2025 has reached $100 billion. In June alone, it was $27.2 billion, a record. If tariffs are collected as planned, yearly income could be $300 billion. The Trump administration has sent letters to over 20 countries about new import tariffs starting August 1st. Japan, South Korea, the EU, Canada, and Mexico are among them.

The report also mentioned that the US tariffs could be the highest since 1910, even more than during the Great Depression. Despite this, other governments and companies still hope for lower tariffs through talks. However, it seems the Trump government does not have much time to talk with many trade partners. It looks like President Trump wants to stop foreign goods from being sold in the US with high tariffs, rather than making deals to help the economy.
