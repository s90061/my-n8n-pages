            <h1>"Mazu Circles the Moon Space Station in 2049" Exhibit Open for One Year in Chiayi</h1>
            <p>The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) has launched a special exhibition called "2049 Mazu Orbiting Moon Space Station." It started today at the Chiayi Space Education Center and will be open for one year. It has many interactive experiences to help people imagine and be creative. This will support the growth of future technology and make Mazu travel around the moon.</p>
            <p>NSTC Deputy Minister Chen Bing-yu, National Space Center Education Office Director Zheng Cong-sheng, Chiayi County Deputy Magistrate Liu Pei-tung, and Education Department Director Li Mei-hua attended the opening today. They tried out six interactive art pieces made by artists in the virtual "space station." These include "Frontier Ship - Departure," "False Color Photo Booth," "SpaceLive," "Lunar Space Project - Space Cabin B," "Frontier One," and "After 80."</p>
            <p>Chen Bing-yu said that this exhibition is part of the NSTC's plan to combine chips and humanities. He hopes to use human ideas to help develop chips. He also said that the name "2049 Mazu Orbiting Moon Space Station" is good and meaningful. This is because semiconductor chips are like Taiwan's "mountain that protects the country," and Mazu is also like a "mountain that protects the country."</p>
            <p>Chen Bing-yu said he hopes the artists' works will make everyone imagine what the future world will be like. This will give scientists and engineers ideas for what to develop. He gave an example: Mazu's helper generals, Qianliyan (Thousand-Mile Eye) and Shunfeng'er (Wind-Following Ear), were imagined by ancient people. Now, these things are real. You can pick up a phone and hear sounds and see images from far away.</p>
            <p>Chen Bing-yu said that in the future, Mazu can also travel around the moon. Everyone can also travel with Mazu in space and then come back to Earth. Imagining the future is very important. He hopes everyone comes to the exhibition to imagine what they can do in the future.</p>
            <p>Liu Pei-tung said that developing space technology is very hard, like Yan Sizi crossing the "Black Ditch" in the Ming Dynasty. It needs courage to face difficulties and Mazu's kind blessings. The Chiayi Space Education Center wants to promote science exhibitions and technology education. It hopes to inspire more people with Mazu's protection.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi County Science Education Center said that the special exhibition is also part of the Chiayi County "Science Park x Learning Area" plan. They plan to hold 70 "Chiayi County One-Day Study Tours" to make local students better at technology and think more creatively.</p>
            <p>The "2049 Mazu Orbiting Moon Space Station" exhibit was shown for one week in August at the "Taiwan Contemporary Culture Lab" in Taipei. But Chen Bing-yu said that Chiayi is the main place for the exhibition. It has more things to see, and it will be open for one year.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Financial Watchdog Helps First Taiwan Stock ETF Launch in Japan</h1>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) wants to make Taiwan an important place for managing money in Asia. It is helping Taiwan and Japan offer ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that cross borders. Today, the first Taiwan stock ETF for this purpose started in Japan. Daiwa Asset Management Company is offering it. It is linked to Cathay Securities Investment Trust's Cathay Taiwan Tech Leader ETF (00881). It officially started trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) today. This aims to show Taiwan's influence as a smart technology island.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) President Li Ai-ling attended the listing ceremony at the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. She said that the TWSE is working hard to make its products more international. This supports the government's goal to make Taiwan a center for asset management in Asia. This is the first ETF in Japan that is linked to Taiwan stocks. It gives Japanese investors an easy way to join Taiwan's high-tech industry. It also helps Taiwan and Japan's financial markets work together more.</p>
            <p>Li Ai-ling said in her speech that Taiwan is a smart technology island. Technology stocks, like AI and semiconductors, make up about 72% of its total market value. Because of the fast growth of the AI industry around the world, Taiwan's stock market is doing very well. The main index has reached new highs many times, and the ETF market is also growing.</p>
            <p>She pointed out that Japan's stock market has also grown a lot recently. The TOPIX index has gone up almost 80% since 2020 and more than 10% this year. This shows that both Taiwan and Japan's markets are growing strongly and are very attractive. This cooperation is just the beginning. She hopes that in the future, the two stock exchanges, asset management companies, and other groups will keep working together. This will lead to more cross-border products being listed and help both stock markets grow together.</p>
            <p>The TWSE also visited the Japan Exchange Group and important local companies and groups while in Japan. They learned about the Japanese stock market and ETF development from these exchanges. They also actively promoted the good points of Taiwan's stock market. They shared Taiwan's success in how its ETF market has grown quickly in recent years and how many people are now investing.</p>

            <h1>Fire in Ceiling at Taipei City Hospital; Hospital Will Check All Electrical Safety</h1>
            <p>Taipei police and fire department received a report this morning that a fire happened at Taipei City Hospital Renai Branch. The hospital said that the fire was in a ventilation duct inside the ceiling of a hallway. They quickly moved people out and put out the fire. Now, everything is back to normal. They will check all electrical safety.</p>
            <p>This morning, someone posted on Threads, a social media platform. They said that they were with a family member at Taipei City Hospital Renai Branch for a check-up. Suddenly, they heard an announcement about a fire and needing to leave. Then, they saw all the hospital beds being moved to the main hall, and smoke was coming out. It was surprising.</p>
            <p>The Renai Branch said in a press release that in the morning, staff in the control room saw a fire alarm in a patient ward hallway. They found that a ventilation duct inside the ceiling of the hallway was on fire. Immediately, they followed the usual steps to move patients, caregivers, and staff from nearby wards to safety. At the same time, they put out the fire and told the fire department to check for safety.</p>
            <p>The Renai Branch said that no one was hurt in this event. Operations are back to normal. They have started a full check of electrical safety to make sure patients and all staff in the hospital are safe.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Fire Department received the fire report from Renai Branch at 11:43 AM. When they arrived, the outside of the building looked normal. The person who reported the fire said it had already been put out by themselves. After sending staff upstairs to check, they decided there was no safety problem.</p>
