            <h1>US-Russia Summit Fails to Stop War; Czech Speaker: Trump Did Not Pressure Enough</h1>
            <p>During a meeting in Alaska, US President Trump and Russian President Putin did not agree to end the war. The Speaker of the Czech Parliament, Mark√©ta Pekarov√° Adamov√°, said that Trump did not put enough pressure on Putin. She stated that Trump brought "criminal Putin back to the world stage but got nothing."</p>
            <p>Some Czech politicians also said that Putin does not want peace. Instead, he wants to make Western countries less united and spread his own ideas. They asked Western countries to keep supporting Ukraine.</p>
            <p>On August 15, US President Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. They talked about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. Many people hoped for good results from this meeting, but they did not reach a peace agreement.</p>
            <p>Because of this, Czech Parliament Speaker Adamov√° said on social media that Trump could not put effective pressure and make a basic agreement. She said Trump "brought criminal Putin back to the international stage, but got nothing."</p>
            <p>Adamov√° criticized, "This is not good talking. This is a dangerous gift to the attacker and a hard hit to Ukraine, which is still fighting to live." She said this meeting showed again that Putin does not want peace. For him, war is a way to get attention, and he mostly wants to remove Ukraine from the world map.</p>
            <p>The Czech Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavsk√Ω, said, "I like that Trump is trying to stop the war. He should continue to talk with European leaders and tell them the results, including to Volodymyr Zelenskyy."</p>
            <p>Lipavsk√Ω also said that what Putin said in his press meeting about "the reasons for the conflict" was just nonsense, like what he often says on state TV. "The problem is Russia's desire to control other countries, not Ukraine wanting to live freely. Remember, behind Putin's words, he wants to change the safety rules back to how they were in 1997. At that time, the Czech Republic was not part of NATO."</p>
            <p>Lipavsk√Ω warned that stopping this is very important for the Czech Republic's safety. He said if Putin really wanted peace, he would not attack Ukraine every day.</p>
            <p>The Czech Defense Minister, Jana ƒåernochov√°, said on social media that Russian President Putin is not looking for peace. Instead, he wants to make Western countries less united and spread his messages. She believes the talks did not bring any big steps to end the war in Ukraine. She thinks Western countries should stay united and keep helping Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Czech Deputy Prime Minister Marian Jureƒçka thought the meeting in Alaska was a good thing. But he felt it was sad that Putin clearly does not want peace or to stop the innocent and unnecessary deaths. "If he wanted to, Russia's attacks on Ukraine would stop right away."</p>
            <p>The Czech Minister of Research and Innovation, Marek ≈Ωen√≠≈°ek, had a similar view. He believes Putin does not want peace now; otherwise, he would have already left Ukraine. "Russia wanting to control other countries is a danger we must fight against. It was true yesterday, it is true today, and it will be true tomorrow."</p>
            <p>Zdenƒõk H≈ôib, the chairman of the Pirate Party, also said, "The Russian leader just used Trump to spread lies and to show himself as a talking partner for the US."</p>
            <p>H≈ôib repeated that Russia is the attacker. He said that free countries must continue to ask the Russian leader for an immediate stop to fighting and real talks for peace. If Moscow does not accept this basic request right away, then countries must take economic and military steps that truly hurt the Russian government. He also said, "We must focus on building a strong and united Europe."</p>

            <h1>China to Make Social Insurance Mandatory; Official News Says It Will Help People Spend More</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 16 ‚Äì China will start a mandatory social insurance system on September 1. This has made many businesses and workers worried. Today, the official newspaper, People's Daily, wrote that social insurance is a "basic need for living" for individuals. For companies, it is a "pass to the future." For China, it is a "way to keep society stable" and also a "way to make people spend more money."</p>
            <p>On August 1, China's Supreme People's Court announced a new rule. It says that any agreement between an employer and an employee not to pay social insurance is not valid. If an employer does not pay, employees can end their work contract and ask for money from the company. This new rule will start on September 1.</p>
            <p>After this rule was announced, many small businesses and low-paid workers in China became worried. They are afraid they cannot afford the high social insurance costs. Experts say that in the future, many people might choose "flexible work" or part-time jobs to avoid paying social insurance.</p>
            <p>People's Daily said today that recent talks about "mandatory social insurance for everyone" were confusing. They said it's important to explain things clearly. The article said the Supreme Court's new rule does not create new laws. Instead, it makes the rules clearer for courts across the country. It also said that social insurance has always been mandatory for legal workers, and it does not cover "everyone," but only people who are working.</p>
            <p>The article criticized some online media for using words like "everyone," "mandatory," and "new rule" to get attention. They said this only confuses people and causes problems.</p>
            <p>This People's Daily article gave three reasons to support mandatory social insurance.</p>
            <p>First, for individuals, social insurance is a "basic need for living," not an "extra option." It said some workers are unsure about joining social insurance because they "only think about money now and what they put in versus what they get out, not about the long-term risks." They also worry that companies might find ways around the rules.</p>
            <p>Second, for companies, social insurance is a "pass to the future," not a "burden." It said that making more companies join social insurance will increase costs for businesses, especially small and medium ones. But this is not a reason to avoid paying social insurance.</p>
            <p>The article said that not paying social insurance is against the law. If a company uses this to win by having lower prices, it cannot grow well in the long run, especially now when companies want to "invest in people." Companies must be very careful about following rules. They should not try to save money by not paying social insurance. Instead, they should focus on their strengths and special skills to move to better positions in the industry.</p>
            <p>The article also said that it is important to understand the money problems that small and medium businesses face. The key to solving this is to have more government policies to help these companies.</p>
            <p>The article also said that for the country, social insurance is a "way to keep society stable" and also a "way to make people spend more money." It said that social insurance helps people with medical care, retirement, and unemployment. So, people will not need to save as much money "just in case." Instead, they will spend more money on improving their lives, travel, hobbies, and personal development. The more social insurance helps people, the more it encourages them to spend.</p>
            <p>The People's Daily article finished by saying that social insurance is not the only way to help people have good lives. But doing social insurance well is important right now. August 16, 2025.</p>
