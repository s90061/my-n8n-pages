            <h1>Taichung, Pingtung, Taitung get Heavy Rain Warnings; 9 Other Cities and Counties like Yilan, Hualien need to watch out for Heavy Rain</h1>
            <p>The weather agency updated its heavy rain warning this evening, July 20th. Some areas in Taitung, the Hengchun Peninsula in Pingtung, and mountainous areas of Taichung will have heavy rain or very heavy rain. Nine other cities and counties, like Yilan and Hualien, should prepare for heavy rain. People should be careful of lightning, strong winds, and rivers rising quickly. Low-lying areas should watch out for floods. After many days of rain, people in mountainous areas should be careful of landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration continues to update the heavy rain warning. Because of the outer parts of a typhoon and an area of low pressure, there will likely be strong, short bursts of rain. Today, areas in Taitung County, the Hengchun Peninsula, and mountainous parts of Taichung City will have heavy rain or very heavy rain. There is also a chance of heavy rain in areas from Taoyuan to Taichung, Hualien, Green Island, Orchid Island, Yilan, central Taiwan, and mountainous areas of Pingtung.</p>

            <h1>Tokyo Train Stops Due to Possible Phone Battery Fire</h1>
            <p>This evening, a train on Tokyo's important JR Yamanote Line had to stop suddenly. This happened between Shinjuku Station and Shin-Okubo Station. It seemed like a passenger's phone battery caught fire. Smoke filled the train. The fire was put out quickly, and no one was hurt.</p>
            <p>Japanese news, like NHK, reported that the police said they received a call to 110 (emergency number) around 4 PM local time today (3 PM Taiwan time). The call said, "A phone battery is on fire on the JR Yamanote Line." Luckily, someone quickly put out the fire with an extinguisher, and nobody was injured. Police and fire workers sent a total of 24 vehicles, including fire trucks and ambulances, to Shinjuku Station to wait.</p>
            <p>JR East Japan company stated that the phone battery fire happened inside a train on the "inner loop" (moving counter-clockwise) of the JR Yamanote Line. The train was traveling between Shinjuku Station and Shin-Okubo Station.</p>
            <p>To make sure it was safe, trains on both the "inner loop" and "outer loop" (moving clockwise) of the JR Yamanote Line stopped around 4:10 PM. They started moving again around 5 PM.</p>
            <p>When the event happened, smoke filled the train car. Some passengers got off the train and walked along the tracks. Station staff guided these passengers to Shin-Okubo Station, which was nearby.</p>
            <p>Because of this event, other train lines like the Chuo Line and Saikyo Line also stopped for a short time. However, after checking that everything was safe, trains slowly started running again. The Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo Fire Department are carefully looking into what caused the incident.</p>
