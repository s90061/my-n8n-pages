            <h1>China in Europe Says Working Together Helps Both Sides</h1>
            <p>Before European Union leaders visit China, Cai Run, China's main person in charge of relations with the EU, spoke in an interview. He said that China and Europe working together helps both sides because they have different strengths. He also said that both sides agree on working together with many countries.</p>
            <p>China's Foreign Ministry said that Antonio Costa, the head of the EU Council, and Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the EU Commission, will visit China on July 24. They will meet with China's President Xi Jinping and join China's Premier Li Qiang for the 25th meeting between China and EU leaders.</p>
            <p>Pengpai News shared Cai Run's interview on July 22, just before the EU leaders' visit. Cai Run was interviewed in Brussels in late June. The interview was about 50 years of relations between China and Europe.</p>
            <p>Cai Run said that China and Europe are different in their social systems, ideas, history, culture, and how developed they are. He said these differences are real. But these differences should help them work together, not cause problems or arguments. He said, "We always say that people with the same ideas are partners, and people with different ideas can also be partners."</p>
            <p>He explained that after 50 years, China and Europe have learned many things about their relationship. He said it is important to respect each other's chosen social systems and development paths. It is also important to respect what each other cares about most. He believes that both sides gaining from cooperation is the biggest reason for the relationship to grow. He added, "The main point of China-Europe practical cooperation is that they help each other with their strengths and both win."</p>
            <p>China and Europe both agree on working with many countries. Cai Run stressed that both sides support an international system with the United Nations at its center. They also support a global trade system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) at its center. They believe in a world with many powerful countries and global trade. They also want to work together on things like climate change. Cai Run said that because China and Europe both believe in working with many countries, their relationship is more important for the world.</p>
            <p>Regarding issues like Chinese electric cars going to Europe, Cai Run repeated that trade is a big part of the China-Europe relationship. Since trade is so large and covers many areas, there might be some disagreements. The main thing is to solve these problems by talking and discussing, as the leaders from both sides have agreed.</p>
            <p>"We hope Europe will have a fair and sensible view of China. This is a basic and important step for China-Europe relations," Cai Run said at the end of the interview. He stressed that the EU should see China's growth in the right way. China and Europe are far apart on the map. They do not have arguments about where their land borders are, and they do not have big disagreements. He said their cooperation is much bigger than their competition, and they agree on more things than they disagree on. He added that they are partners, not opponents, and certainly not enemies.</p>

            <h1>Kinmen Prison Starts Farm Work and Electrician Classes, Justice Minister Cheng Ming-chien Says It's a New Start</h1>
            <p>The Fujian Aftercare Association and Kinmen Agricultural and Industrial Vocational High School are working together. They have started classes at Kinmen Prison for farming in screen houses and for indoor electrical wiring. Justice Minister Cheng Ming-chien attended the opening ceremony today. He said that both the electrician and farming classes are "a starting point to change lives."</p>
            <p>Last year, the Fujian Aftercare Association, Kinmen Prison, and National Kinmen Agricultural and Industrial Vocational High School started a training class for indoor electrical wiring. This class helps people get a C-level technical license. Today, they held the opening ceremony for the second session of this class. At the same time, a farm work training class in screen houses also started. Cheng Ming-chien, Mao You-zeng, who is the chairman of the Fujian Aftercare Association, and Lin Hsien-ming, who is the head of the Correctional Agency, were all there.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chien said in his speech that all five students from the first electrician class passed their practical exams and got their licenses. For the second class, 17 people in prison signed up. He said, "This shows that the first class was very good, so many people wanted to join." He added that with the start of the farming class, "I think these are all new starts for people's lives. Teachers from Kinmen Vocational High School and different parts of the prosecutor's office will work together to help everyone."</p>
            <p>Lin Hsien-ming stated that the two main goals of correctional facilities are fair justice and helping people return to society. When people break the law, they go to correctional facilities and are kept separate. In the future, they hope that these people can help their families and society. He said, "We hope the students can calm down and change during this time before they return to society." He shared that one student from last year's indoor wiring class went back to Taipei. The Taipei Aftercare Association helped him find a job. "We hope the training classes will continue to be successful," he added.</p>
            <p>During the ceremony, Cheng Ming-chien gave the C-level indoor electrical wiring license to a student representative who passed the national skill test in 2024. After that, he visited the farm training area in the screen house. He planted a lemon tree, which stands for hope and new beginnings. He also joined other guests in planting peanuts and picking and tasting corn and okra.</p>
            <p>The Fujian Aftercare Association said in a press release that the farm with screen houses is currently using green fertilizer to improve the soil. In the future, it will become a special training center to grow valuable, non-toxic vegetables. This will give students a natural place to work.</p>
            <p>The Fujian Aftercare Association said that both the electrician class and the farm work class help people in prison learn to work and have a healthy mind and body. They also give them professional skills training. This sets a strong foundation for their new lives after leaving prison. The Fujian Aftercare Association follows the idea of "giving a person a fishing rod instead of just a fish." They will continue to offer technical education programs. Through practical training, they will help people improve their skills and feel confident again. This will help them become independent and find stable jobs, bravely starting a new part of their lives.</p>

            <h1>South Korea and U.S. to Hold '2+2' Meeting on July 25 for Urgent Tariff Talks</h1>
            <p>New trade taxes from the United States will start on August 1. South Korea's new Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy and Finance, Goo Yoon-chul, said today that he and Yu Han-ku, the head of trade negotiations, will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington D.C. on July 25. This meeting is called a "2+2 talk."</p>
            <p>According to Yonhap News Agency, Goo Yoon-chul said this after a meeting about foreign economic affairs this morning, where he spoke to the media. He said, "There is not much time left until August 1." He explained that today's urgent meeting was to talk about how to deal with and plan for the coming discussions with the United States.</p>
            <p>This "2+2 talk" is happening three months after South Korea proposed a "July plan" to the U.S. in April. This time, the Minister of Industry, Trade, and Energy will not be there. Instead, the head of trade negotiations and the finance minister will attend together. This is expected to lead to more practical discussions.</p>
            <p>South Korea's Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul and Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun will also travel to the United States as early as this week to meet with U.S. officials.</p>
            <p>Goo Yoon-chul stated that the South Korean government will bring together all important government departments. They will make a detailed plan based on what is best for the country and practical solutions. They will work hard to deal with these trade tax talks. Regarding whether the new trade taxes might be delayed, Goo Yoon-chul said they would try their best to negotiate.</p>
