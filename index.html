            <h1>Taiwan Sea Chart App to Launch on Nov 1st, Can Be Used for Navigation and Diving</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of the Interior announced that a new app called "Taiwan Sea Chart APP" will be available on November 1st. This app is for small fishing boats and other vessels that do not have special navigation systems. These vessels are more likely to have accidents at sea. The app will help with navigation, finding ports and landmarks, and checking sea weather. Divers can also use it to avoid areas where fishing boats travel. It will be free to use for six months, and then the government will decide if there will be a fee.</p>
            <p>Minister Liu Shih-fang explained that many small boats, yachts, and fishing boats do not have electronic sea chart systems. This means they cannot use official Taiwanese electronic navigation maps. This makes them high-risk for accidents at sea.</p>
            <p>Liu Shih-fang said that the plan for the "Taiwan Sea Chart APP" started early last year. It is based on international electronic navigation maps and is made especially for boats without the SOLAS rules. It will be available on both the App Store and Google Play on November 1st. Its main features include navigation, quick search for ports and landmarks, map management, route drawing, and sea weather checks. This will make sea activities safer for everyone.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-cheng, Director of the Land Administration Department, added that the "Taiwan Sea Chart APP" uses global satellite positioning technology. It puts sea charts, sea conditions, and tide information on mobile phones. When there is internet, users can get real-time sea information. Users can also download maps to use when there is no internet. This solves the problem of relying only on the captain's experience or unofficial maps. It also helps small boats, fishing boats, and yachts in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-cheng also said that the app covers the waters around Taiwan, so divers can use it too. The app has special markers that help divers stay away from fishing boat paths. It also shows divers their exact location. If there is an accident at sea, coast guard workers can use the app's information to find and rescue people.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-cheng stated that after the "Taiwan Sea Chart APP" is released, it will be free to use for 6 months. It is mainly for small boats, yachts, and fishing boats. Government and private groups can also use it for things like boat control, investigating sea accidents, disaster prevention, protecting nature, managing coasts, and sea recreation.</p>
            <p>Regarding fees, Lin Chia-cheng said that after the 6-month free trial, they will collect information to decide if they will charge a monthly or yearly fee. However, the main goal is to help fishermen, so the cost will not be too high.</p>

            <h1>Zhao Shao-kang Suggests Protecting Political Parties from Outside Interference in Elections; MAC Welcomes the Idea</h1>
            <p>Zhao Shao-kang, the former chairman of Broadcasting Corporation of China, has suggested changing the law. He wants to stop outside groups from affecting political party elections. The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said they welcome this idea. They believe it would be a big problem if major political party elections were influenced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).</p>
            <p>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) held its regular press conference today, hosted by Deputy Minister Liang Wen-chieh.</p>
            <p>Zhao Shao-kang recently said that the CCP was involved in the Kuomintang (KMT) chairman election. He wants to change the law so that outside forces cannot influence political party elections.</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-chieh replied that the real outside force that threatens Taiwan is the Chinese Communist Party. In the past, the Anti-Infiltration Act was made to stop influence in official elections. Zhao Shao-kang now wants to include party internal elections. Liang Wen-chieh thinks this is "very necessary."</p>
            <p>Liang Wen-chieh believes that if major political parties in Taiwan are influenced, or if their chairman elections are affected by the CCP, it would be a very big problem. It would be even worse if the party chairman was chosen by the CCP. He said, "So, we welcome Mr. Zhao Shao-kang's suggestion."</p>

            <h1>"The Wudan Family: Yang Lien-ying" Book Released with Over 200 Historical Images</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs announced today that a new book, "The Wudan Family: Yang Lien-ying," has been published. It includes more than 200 old pictures and many interviews. Yang Lien-ying, a Peking opera "Wudan" actress, won the Chinese Arts and Literature Award twice. She is also important for continuing the Peking opera Wudan art in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Department of Cultural Affairs held a press conference for the new book. This is the 21st book in their "Traditional Arts Series," which started in 2008. These books help to study, keep, and protect Taipei's important old cultural things.</p>
            <p>The Department of Cultural Affairs said that "The Wudan Family: Yang Lien-ying" tells the story of Yang Lien-ying's life and art. It combines her story with the theater history knowledge of scholar Hsu Ya-hsiang. The book talks about Yang Lien-ying's family, her training in the "Xiao Dapeng" school, her teachers, her performances, how theater groups worked, old customs in the theater world, her teaching, and her thoughts on the theater scene.</p>
            <p>Chen Yu-hsin, Deputy Commissioner of the Department of Cultural Affairs, said that Yang Lien-ying joined Xiao Dapeng at age 8 and had strict training. For the first 30 years, she performed on stage. For the next 30 years, she focused on teaching and sharing her art. She not only passed on Peking opera but also worked with Taiwanese opera, Hakka opera, and dance, showing her ability to combine different art forms.</p>
            <p>Lin Ta-wei, Dean of Academic Affairs at Taipei National University of the Arts, said that the university invited Yang Lien-ying to teach starting in 2018, and students have learned a lot from her.</p>
            <p>Hsu Ya-hsiang said that it took two years to research and write the book. Through Yang Lien-ying's experience as a Wudan, readers can learn about a period and spirit in Taiwan's theater history.</p>
            <p>The Department of Cultural Affairs said that readers can buy the book at bookstores like National Bookstore, Wu-Nan Online Bookstore, Books.com.tw, or Eslite Online Bookstore. The Department of Cultural Affairs has also made all the books in the series available online for free on several e-book platforms.</p>
