A new report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could significantly change the job market in the UK by 2030. Up to 8 million jobs might be replaced by AI technology. However, the report also states that AI could create around 7 million new jobs, meaning a net loss of about 1 million roles.

The study, by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), says that AI will first affect entry-level jobs and part-time positions. These roles often involve routine tasks that AI can easily learn and perform. Examples include customer service, administrative work, and data processing.

Experts believe that the government and businesses need to act now. They should invest in training programs to help workers gain new skills that are not easily automated. This preparation would allow people to move into the new jobs that AI will create, such as roles in AI development, maintenance, and ethical oversight. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition and prevent widespread unemployment.

**More People Are Choosing to Disconnect From Technology**

In today's connected world, many people are deciding to spend less time online and with their devices. This growing trend is often called a "digital detox" or simply "unplugging." It's a quiet but important change in how people live their daily lives.

People choose to disconnect for various reasons. Some feel overwhelmed by constant notifications and social media. Others want to improve their mental health, find more time for hobbies, or connect more deeply with family and friends in person. They might set limits on screen time, turn off notifications, or even take breaks from using smartphones and computers completely.

This movement suggests that people are becoming more aware of how technology affects them. They are looking for a better balance between their digital and real lives. By stepping away from screens, individuals hope to reduce stress, improve sleep, and feel more present in the moment. It shows a desire for a simpler, less distracted way of living.

**Venice Starts Charging Day-Trippers a New Fee**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging day-trip visitors a fee. This new rule began in April 2024 and is part of the city's effort to manage its large number of tourists, especially during busy times. Visitors who come to Venice for just one day must now pay 5 euros.

This fee applies to anyone over the age of 14 who enters the city's old town between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM. People staying overnight in Venice, residents, and some other groups do not have to pay the fee. Visitors are required to book their visit online and get a QR code, which they might be asked to show at certain entry points.

Venice has faced challenges for a long time due to over-tourism, which puts pressure on its small streets, infrastructure, and local life. City officials hope this new charge will help control the flow of tourists and encourage more sustainable tourism. The money collected will also help maintain the city's unique environment and services.`;
