            <h1>WB Boxing World Championships: Gan Jiawei Wins First Round, Moves to Top 32</h1>
            <p>The WB World Boxing Championships started today in Liverpool, UK. Taiwan's good boxer, Gan Jiawei, easily won his first match. He beat Pawel Sulecki from Poland with a score of 5-0 in the round of 64. So, he has moved on to the next round.</p>
            <p>Gan Jiawei, who is a male boxer for the Paris Olympics, competed in the 70 kg category today. He faced Pawel Sulecki from Poland in the first round of 64.</p>
            <p>When the first round began, Gan Jiawei was stronger and attacked many times. He also moved well to avoid his opponent's punches. The judges liked his performance. In the first two rounds, all five judges gave him a perfect score of 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the third round, Gan Jiawei became a bit tired, and his movements were slower. But his opponent also could not score effectively. Gan Jiawei still won the match.</p>
            <p>After the match, his coach Liu Zongtai told the Central News Agency that Gan Jiawei usually feels nervous in his first match. But today, "he did very well. He chose the right times to punch and hit his opponent effectively. It's a good start."</p>
            <p>Liu Zongtai added that Gan Jiawei's energy clearly went down in the third round, and he attacked less. He said they need to change how they manage his energy because the competition is still long.</p>
            <p>The World Boxing (WB) organization is holding its first World Championships. More than 500 boxers from all over the world are competing. However, there are some small problems with how the event is organized. Liu Zongtai said that the warm-up area was messy, which made it hard for boxers to warm up. But he thinks things will get better.</p>
            <p>Also, another Taiwanese boxer, Xu Qiaojun, lost his first match in the men's 55 kg category. He lost 0-5 to a boxer from the Philippines and is now out of the competition.</p>

            <h1>Two People Charged with Fraud: Academia Sinica Says They Were Former Contract Staff and Visiting Scholars</h1>
            <p>Today, the Shilin Prosecutors Office charged two former staff members, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ji, with fraud. They also asked for a serious punishment for them. Academia Sinica's Institute of Physics said that these two people were former contract workers and visiting scholars, not "researchers" as some people thought. The institute will take steps to stop similar problems from happening again.</p>
            <p>The Shilin Prosecutors Office looked into a fraud case involving former staff from Academia Sinica. They found that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Ji, who used to work there, were involved in fake purchases and taking things that were not theirs. They got more than 34.8 million New Taiwan Dollars in money and items. Today, they were charged with fraud and other crimes. The prosecutors are asking for severe punishments for both of them.</p>
            <p>About this case, Academia Sinica's Institute of Physics made a statement today to make things clear. They said that among the 14 people charged in the case, the two linked to the Institute of Physics were former contract staff and visiting scholars. They were not "researchers," as people sometimes call them.</p>
            <p>The Institute of Physics also explained that the title "researcher" at the institute is only for people who are professors.</p>
            <p>The Institute of Physics stated that they fully helped the police and investigators during the investigation. They are very sad that former contract staff and visiting scholars were involved in this case. They will take necessary steps in the future to make sure similar incidents do not happen again.</p>

            <h1>Sugary Drinks Cause Obesity; Healthy Taiwan Encourages Sugar-Free Tea Drinks</h1>
            <p>Taiwan now offers tax-free bottled drinks that have no sugar. However, sugary "hand-shaken" tea drinks are also a big reason for obesity. There are many tea shops everywhere in Taiwan, which is a special sight. Today, the "Healthy Taiwan" promotion committee again asked people to eat less refined sugar. They want to encourage people to choose sugar-free hand-shaken tea drinks.</p>
            <p>The Healthy Taiwan promotion committee had its fifth meeting today. After the meeting, Presidential Office spokesperson Guo Yahuei said that a committee member, Guo Sue-e, who is also a supervisor for the Dietitians Association, talked about promoting sugar-free drinks. She was happy that some companies recently lowered prices for sugar-free drinks. She also encouraged tea shops to offer sugar-free options. The committee hopes people will slowly reduce the amount of refined sugar they eat.</p>
            <p>To live well, you need to move. Jian Wenren, who is the vice president of the Taiwan Health and Sports Alliance, said that health and exercise are important for everyone. Exercise brings people together. It is important to exercise regularly and make it a habit. He suggested starting with walking. He also said we should create paths that use technology and are good for people. He encourages companies to sponsor and name these paths.</p>
            <p>Helping Taiwan's smart healthcare and biomedical industries grow, and making them another "mountain that protects the country," was also a main topic today. Wu Ming-Hsien, the dean of National Taiwan University's College of Medicine, said in the meeting that he hopes Taiwan's new technologies can be used all over the world. Taiwan has good skills, but it does not have its own brand like the semiconductor industry. He suggested that the Ministry of Health and Welfare offer good reasons for companies to invest more and speed up development.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, a reporter asked how the Healthy Taiwan committee will deal with the possible effects of US President Trump's tariff policy on new medicines. Health Minister Shi Chongliang said that there have been reports that the US might increase medicine tariffs to 200%. He said that no final decision has been made yet. Taiwan buys many medicines from other countries, especially new medicines that are still protected by patents. So, Taiwan needs to prepare for the future.</p>
            <p>Shi Chongliang said that the Ministry of Health and Welfare has checked and found that there are hundreds of medicines with patents that are hard to replace. More than 200 of these are basic essential medicines. These medicines cost about 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars from health insurance. The Executive Yuan has approved a special budget of 20 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This money will be used if medicine prices change because of world events. This will help make sure Taiwan has enough medicines through the health insurance drug price adjustment system.</p>
            <p>Shi Chongliang also said that for medicines whose patents have recently ended, the government encourages Taiwan to make its own generic and biosimilar medicines. In the next six years, about 70 medicines will no longer have patents. For medicines whose patents ended within the last five years, the first two generic or biosimilar medicines made in Taiwan that get approval will be sold at the same price as the original brand-name medicine. This plan helps Taiwan make more of its own medicines. It also helps to get medicines from different places and lowers the chance of not having enough medicines.</p>
