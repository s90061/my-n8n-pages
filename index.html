            <h1>Russian-Ukrainian Peace Talks to Restart as Early as July 23; Zelenskyy Hopes for Leader Meeting</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy has said he suggested new peace talks with Russia in Turkey. He hopes this will prepare the way for future meetings between the leaders of both countries. Ukrainian media, citing sources, say the talks might happen as early as July 23 or 24 in Istanbul, Turkey.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram today that Rustem Umerov, who leads the National Security and Defense Council, has offered to meet with Russia. The talks will focus on exchanging prisoners of war, bringing back Ukrainian children who were taken by Russia, and getting ready for a meeting between the two presidents.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy stated, "We all know that truly effective talks can only happen at the level of leaders." But he did not share more details about the talks.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian media "Ukrainska Pravda" quoted a report from the Turkish version of the British "The Independent." It said that diplomatic sources shared that Russian and Ukrainian representatives might meet in Istanbul this week, likely on July 23 and 24. Similar reports were also seen in Ukrainian, Russian, and Turkish media.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also mentioned that they are preparing for at least one prisoner exchange with Russia.</p>
            <p>Dmitry Peskov, the spokesperson for the Russian President, replied today that they are discussing dates for a third round of peace talks with Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Earlier, US President Donald Trump asked Russia to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine within 50 days. If not, he threatened to place "secondary sanctions" on Russia's trading partners.</p>
            <p>However, Peskov said yesterday that Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to discuss peace, but achieving Russia's goals remains the main priority for Moscow.</p>
            <p>In a previous memo from Russia during talks, they repeated their demand for Ukrainian troops to leave all four regions: Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson. Their position remains strong.</p>
            <p>Representatives from Ukraine and Russia had two rounds of talks in Istanbul on May 16 and June 2. Even though they did not agree on a ceasefire, they decided to keep working together on exchanging prisoners and bodies. They have already agreed to release over 2,000 prisoners and exchange about 6,000 bodies.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: Chris Paul Agrees to Sign, Returns to Former Team Clippers for 21st NBA Season</h1>
            <p>The American sports channel ESPN reported today that NBA legend point guard Chris Paul has agreed to sign with his old team, the Los Angeles Clippers. He will play his 21st NBA season, and many believe this will be his last season.</p>
            <p>ESPN said that even though many teams wanted Paul to join, the 40-year-old player chose the Clippers, a team he knows well.</p>
            <p>Paul has been chosen for the NBA All-Star Game 12 times in his career. He played for the Clippers for six seasons from 2011 to 2017. During that time, he was an All-Star five times.</p>
            <p>When he was with the Clippers, Paul played with teammates like Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. They were known as "Lob City" because they often made exciting plays with alley-oop dunks.</p>
            <p>Paul was chosen by the New Orleans Hornets (now the New Orleans Pelicans) as the 4th pick in the first round in 2005. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year that season. In his career, he has made 12,499 assists and 2,717 steals. Both of these numbers are the second highest in NBA history.</p>
            <p>Last season, he played for the San Antonio Spurs and played all 82 regular season games. He became the first player in his 20th season to play all 82 games.</p>
