            <h1>Extra Train Delayed by 16 Minutes Because No New Conductor Showed Up for Work</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 26 (CNA) The first round of recall votes was held today. Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) added an extra train, the 5371, from Qidu to Taitung (new Tze-Chiang Limited Express). When the train arrived at Chaozhou Station, the train conductor could not find anyone to take over. After someone was quickly sent to take over, the train was delayed by about 16 minutes. TRA said they will find out who is responsible.</p>
            <p>Today, people are voting on whether to remove 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is currently suspended. Because more people need to travel, TRA added extra trains for the weekend. This included the 5371 train from Qidu to Taitung today. But it was reported that when the train got to Chaozhou Station, the train conductor could not find anyone to take their place.</p>
            <p>TRA said that the deputy head of the Kaohsiung train crew made a mistake when writing down the date for the extra train. This caused them to forget to assign a conductor. As soon as the train crew found out, they quickly assigned a conductor who was on standby to get on the train and start work.</p>
            <p>Because of this mistake of not assigning a conductor, the train was delayed by about 16 minutes before it could leave. TRA said that the Southern Region Operations Office will review and fix the problem. They will also find out who was responsible and make sure similar problems do not happen again.

            <h1>Uni-President Lions Look at 2 Players to Get Stronger Quickly; Su Tai-an: Foreign Players Being Taken by Other Teams Shows We Choose Well</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 26 (CNA) The Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions baseball team's foreign pitcher, Cristopher Mercedes, was signed by a Korean team. Team leader Su Tai-an said he thanks Mercedes for his help. They had already found two foreign pitchers they liked, but now they will work faster. He added that when foreign pitchers are often taken by other teams, it means the Lions are good at finding talented players.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, after the game, the Lions team suddenly found out that their foreign pitcher, Cristopher Mercedes, was bought by the Korean Heroes team. Also, Joe Wieland clearly decided to retire. Now, the team only has three foreign pitchers: Brock Dykxhoorn, Yohander MÃ©ndez, and Felix Pena.</p>
            <p>Mercedes was with the main team at the Taipei Dome today. Before the game started, he talked to his teammates and hugged them. Team leader Su Tai-an said that it is common for foreign players to be taken by other teams in the middle of the season. This means Mercedes played well and was noticed. Su met Mercedes before the game to thank him. Mercedes helped the Lions win the first half of the season a lot. Mercedes felt sad to leave, and the Lions wished him well.</p>
            <p>When asked why foreign players are often taken by other teams recently, Su Tai-an said that from another point of view, it means the Lions are good at finding players. Su said they had already chosen two foreign pitchers. Before the deadline for foreign players, they will consider any suitable player. Now, they will just speed up their plan to find players. He also quickly had a meeting with the scouting team to find foreign players for Taiwan as soon as possible. (Editor: Chang Ya-ching) 1140726</p>
