            <h1>Kaohsiung City Plans to Renew Old Military Villages Near TSMC</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Government is starting a big project to save and renew the old military villages in the Houduan area of Zuoying District. The Cultural Affairs Bureau said today that these areas are located at the crossings of Zhonghai Road and Junxiao Road, and Haigong Road and Junxiao Road. They are easy to get to and are close to TSMC's factory in Kaohsiung.</p>
            <p>Today, the Kaohsiung City Cultural Affairs Bureau announced that they held a meeting yesterday. This meeting was about finding companies to help with the "Zuoying District Houduan Units 4-7 Urban Renewal Project." Twelve companies attended, and there was a lot of discussion. The first part of this project included three smaller plans, which were successfully given to companies in March this year. These areas cover a total of 11,898 ping (about 39,266 square meters). The total investment for these plans is expected to be up to NT$32.2 billion.</p>
            <p>The Cultural Affairs Bureau explained that to achieve the overall goal, they are now starting the second part of the project. This part includes four plans, and the land area is 17,146 ping (about 56,606 square meters), which is even larger than the first part.</p>
            <p>Mr. Guo Tiangui, the Secretary-General of the Kaohsiung City Government, said that Kaohsiung has the most military villages in Taiwan. He mentioned that while the "live-in and protect" program has helped to bring some of these old homes back to life, there isn't enough money to fix up all of them. So, the city government is using a new idea called "New Era Military Villages." They are asking private companies to help fix up all the main houses. This plan will help develop housing, cultural activities, transportation, and businesses in these areas.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang Wencui, the Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, said that the areas for this new project are well-shaped. New public facilities are being built nearby, such as a community center next to Wei 6th Road, a new 20-meter road on Wei 6th Road, a park where old military village buildings used to be, and public parking. Last year, the Ministry of Culture approved NT$900 million for renewing military villages. The work to fix up houses and improve the environment has already begun.</p>
            <p>The areas for this project are at the intersections of Zhonghai Road and Junxiao Road, and Haigong Road and Junxiao Road. The areas have good transportation and are close to the TSMC Kaohsiung factory, Zuoying HSR station, and National Freeway 10. The Cultural Affairs Bureau stated that this project was announced on September 3rd and will end on December 31st. Companies can form groups to bid for the project, and investors are welcome to join.</p>

            <h1>US Cancels Visas for Foreigners Who Mocked Conservative Figure Kirk's Death</h1>
            <p>The U.S. State Department announced today that it has canceled the visas of at least six people who "celebrated" the death of conservative figure Charlie Kirk. The department stated, "The United States is not required to welcome foreigners who wish for Americans to die." The State Department also shared screenshots of posts. One person from Argentina wrote that Kirk spread hateful ideas and "deserved to go to hell."</p>
            <p>During his life, Charlie Kirk was very good at using social media to share conservative ideas with many followers. Today, after U.S. President Donald Trump gave Kirk the "Presidential Medal of Freedom," which is the highest award for a civilian, the State Department used social media platform X to show several screenshots. These screenshots showed comments mocking Kirk's death.</p>
            <p>The screenshots included a person from South Africa making fun of Americans who were sad about Kirk's death. Another person from Mexico wrote, "Some people deserve to die, and the world would be better if some people died." The State Department said it will continue to find visa holders who celebrate Kirk's death. They added, "Foreigners who enjoy being guests in America while celebrating the death of an American citizen will be sent out of the country."</p>
            <p>CNN reported today that the State Department's actions to cancel or refuse visas because of comments about Kirk's death have made some people wonder if this goes against the right to free speech protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p>
            <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in September that they "have indeed refused" visas for those who "celebrated" Kirk's death. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau also said that he had told consular officers to watch social media for comments that "praise, justify, or make light of" Kirk's death.</p>
            <p>Conor Fitzpatrick, a lawyer for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), released a statement this afternoon. He said that the Trump administration must stop punishing people simply for their opinions. He added, "The Supreme Court has clearly stated that non-citizens also have the right to free speech."</p>
            <p>Harold Hongju Koh, who was a legal advisor for the U.S. State Department during the Obama administration, told CNN in September that the rules for canceling visas are "very unclear." He questioned what these rules are and who decides when to use them.</p>
            <p>Koh asked, "This is a use of diplomatic power to punish. Where is the line? What if next time they decide that criticizing the president can also be a reason to refuse a visa?"</p>
            <p>However, Taylor Budowich, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff, believes that people are free to speak their minds. He said, "But sometimes, if you don't have anything nice to say, it's best to say nothing at all. Some people should remember that saying."</p>
