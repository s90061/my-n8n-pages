The Chinese Embassy in South Africa has told Chinese women living there to be careful. This is because several Chinese women have been kidnapped in different parts of South Africa recently. The embassy said women should try not to go out alone.

The embassy said that since June, many kidnappings of Chinese women have happened in areas like Gauteng and Eastern Cape. The kidnappers often attack on weekends, when women are traveling or closing their shops. This puts their lives and money at great risk.

The embassy also stated that crime in South Africa is getting worse, and violent crimes against Chinese people might not get better soon. They asked Chinese people to be more careful. They specifically told Chinese women to avoid going out alone. They also suggested using location trackers or emergency buttons so police can find them quickly if they go missing. The embassy had already warned Chinese tourists about serious crimes like kidnapping on June 25th.
