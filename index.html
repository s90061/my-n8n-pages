**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%A5%A8%E5%83%B9%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train ( êµ¬ê°„è»Š) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.

**SEMICON Taiwan Upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week"**

<a href="https://tw.stock.yahoo.com/news/semicon-taiwan-%E5%8D%87%E7%B4%9A-%E5%9C%8B%E9%9B%9B%E5%8D%8A%E5%B0%8E%E9%AB%94%E5%91%A8-201000087.html">News Link</a>

The global semiconductor industry's annual event, "SEMICON Taiwan 2025," officially started on the 17th. Marking its 30th anniversary, SEMI, the International Semiconductor Industry Association, announced that the exhibition will be upgraded to "International Semiconductor Week." Meanwhile, against the backdrop of the US-China tech war, with Trump pressing allies to bring companies back with high tariffs, major manufacturers like TSMC face even greater pressure to invest in the US. In the future, semiconductor companies will be forced to "pick sides," and supply chains will accelerate regional reorganization. Semiconductors have shifted from being commercial goods to strategic assets, with decision-making moving from "market efficiency" to "national security resilience."

With "Leading with Collaboration. Innovating with the World." as the theme for SEMICON Taiwan 2025, this year marks the debut of International Semiconductor Week. Key international forums will be held on September 8th and 9th, followed by the exhibition from September 10th to 12th. Cao Shi-lun, SEMI Global Chief Marketing Officer and President of SEMI Taiwan, stated that in the first quarter of 2025, global semiconductor equipment shipments reached $32.05 billion, a 21% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by the growing demand for artificial intelligence, cloud computing, high-performance computing, and edge computing applications, showing strong growth momentum.

However, he also stated that the industry faces challenges like supply chain restructuring and geopolitical issues. The US government is using methods such as equipment embargoes (ASML), talent cut-offs (US experts), and supply chain decoupling, forcing companies to "pick a side." Semiconductor industry professionals believe that with accelerated regional reorganization of supply chains, they need to re-evaluate production and investment plans to deal with policy risks and geopolitical uncertainties.

Regarding ongoing semiconductor tariffs, relevant industry players noted that according to Section 232 of the Commerce Department's regulations, after the Commerce Secretary initiated an investigation on April 1st this year, a report must be submitted within 270 days, meaning it will be released by December 27th at the latest. The US President then has 90 days after receiving the report to make a decision, which means the semiconductor tariff deadline will fall around March 27th next year. However, the actual situation may vary due to political considerations or the complexity of the investigation.

Diversifying operations is the best approach. TSMC, as the leading wafer foundry, is increasing its investment in the US to meet customer demand. Industry players stated that geopolitical factors are driving supply chain independence, which helps support demand for semiconductor equipment. In addition, the demand from AI/HPC applications is driving the adoption of advanced manufacturing processes (GAA), the growth of HBM demand, and the development of advanced packaging technologies, which will also increase investment in semiconductor equipment.
