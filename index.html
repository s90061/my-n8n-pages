            <h1>US Puts 15% Tax on Goods from Europe; Taiwanese Business Owner in France Says Things Are Clearer Now, Businesses Start Again</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Tseng Ting-hsuan, Paris, August 2nd) The United States and Europe recently made a trade deal. This deal will lower taxes on goods from Europe sent to the US to 15%. Mr. Tsai Kuo-tai, a Taiwanese businessman who started his company in France 35 years ago, told CNA that the deal is okay. He said it is good because now the rules are clear, and people know what to expect. He felt "a sigh of relief." Businesses are now very busy. Many plans and deals that were stopped before are now starting again.</p>
            <p>Earlier, US President Donald Trump said he would put a 15% tax on goods from Europe. This is much less than the 50% or 30% tax he had said before. Many parts of the agreement are still not final. But for businesses in Europe, this news is good. Before, they were worried and unsure because of the very high taxes. This new decision helps them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai Kuo-tai is an important leader in a group for Taiwanese businesses around the world. He moved to France in the 1970s to study and has stayed there for over 50 years. His company, Victor France, began in 1990. It mainly sells special machines called "machine tools" from a company in Taiwan. His company has been open for 35 years.</p>
            <p>On August 2nd, he spoke to reporters online. He said that business has been very uncertain recently. His company's sales were much lower. Businesses in France were also very worried.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai said, "The French Prime Minister, Francois Bayrou, said this was a sad day for France. But overall, even if we are not completely happy, it is still okay. Now things are very clear and steady. Everyone knows what to do next. We can also guess what will happen."</p>
            <p>He shared that after the news came out, businesses in France started to work again. He saw this right away: usually, French people go on vacation in August, so it's a calm month. But now, businesses are busy. "Many plans and deals that were on hold are now moving forward. Many projects need to be looked at and talked about before people go on holiday. So, this is generally a good thing for France."</p>
            <p>Important details are still being discussed by both sides. But now, businesses know what to expect again. They have stopped worrying and waiting. Many projects are starting again. He said, "I feel better now. We finally got through a big problem we had since the start of this year."</p>
            <p>Victor France brings machines from Taiwan to France. Most of its customers are French companies. The taxes on machines from Taiwan that come to France are still low. So, this new tax rule will not change how much his company pays. This means that Taiwanese businesses selling goods from Taiwan to Europe are not directly affected much.</p>
            <p>However, there are still other effects that are not direct. Mr. Tsai thinks that if goods from Taiwan going to the US have a 20% tax, then other Taiwanese companies might start selling more in Europe, because Europe has a big market. This could also make companies from Korea and Japan sell more in Europe. This would make it harder to compete.</p>
            <p>To deal with more competition, Mr. Tsai and other Taiwanese business owners in Europe have a plan. They will sell "high-quality products" to earn more money. They will also work on making their "technical services" better. He said, "We will not try to have the lowest prices. We will try to make our products better, make our machines work better, and give better service."</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai said that the 15% tax affects different businesses in different ways. He thinks that car-making companies will have a bigger problem because of competition from the US. "But for things like makeup and expensive goods, companies already make a lot of money. Sometimes, they can also easily ask customers to pay more."</p>
            <p>Most businesses in France are small or medium-sized. If these businesses will ask customers to pay more, pay the cost themselves, or share the cost with US companies, depends on what they sell and how the market changes. If products from Europe are very popular, "then customers in the US will definitely pay more, and prices in the US will be high."</p>
            <p>Mr. Tsai thinks that Trump's taxes have at least two big effects on Europe. First, about 20% of goods made in Europe are sold to the US. So, if taxes go up, it will be harder for European products to compete.</p>
            <p>Second, China faces high taxes from the US. So, China might sell many cheap products in Europe. This could hurt local businesses in Europe. But he also said that Europe has a plan for this. They will create a group to stop China from selling too many cheap products.</p>
            <p>When talking about the future of Europe, Mr. Tsai sounded hopeful. He said Europe is still strong in many areas, like technology, airplanes, transport, education, and making new things.</p>
            <p>He said, "Even though the US is very strong, it cannot always get its way when it argues with Europe. So, both sides must keep finding ways to agree." He believes Europe still has power. "I think Europe will become stronger each time there is a problem." (Edited by Tien Jui-hua) August 3rd, 2025.</p>

            <h1>US Expert Says Trump's Changing Views on Russia-Ukraine Show He Might Do the Same for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hou Tzu-ying, Washington, August 2nd) The war between Russia and Ukraine has not ended. US President Trump's opinion has recently changed. He now believes that Russia is stopping peace. He now supports Ukraine. Experts in the US think that Trump might use this same changing plan for the relationship between Taiwan and China. He might be tough at times and then make deals at other times.</p>
            <p>Richard Bush, who used to lead the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and now works for a group called the Brookings Institution, and Ryan Hass, another expert from the same group, wrote an article yesterday. They talked about what happened with the recent votes to remove members of Taiwan's parliament.</p>
            <p>On July 26, votes to remove 24 lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) party did not succeed. Mr. Bush and Mr. Hass wrote about this in an article called "Taiwanâ€™s recall vote: Implications for Taiwan, China, and the United States." They said the results mean Taiwan's government is still split, just like it was before these votes. Even though the attempts to remove the lawmakers failed, it looks like the KMT party is doing well. But it is still too early to know if they will keep doing well.</p>
            <p>From Washington's view, the article said that if Taiwan's politics stays stuck and stops money from being put into national safety, the US will worry about Taiwan's ability to protect itself. But if the failed votes to remove lawmakers make politicians focus on winning people's support by showing who can best keep peace across the Taiwan Strait, this could make Taiwan's politics calmer. Washington would be happy about this.</p>
            <p>From China's view, the article said that China was probably relieved when the votes to remove lawmakers failed. Taiwan's ruling party, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), might find it hard to pass new laws, like spending much more money on defense. China will try to make President Lai Ching-te and other DPP leaders look bad. They want to make people support them less and get more people to support leaders who want to be closer to China.</p>
            <p>The article looked at the time until Taiwan's big election in 2028. It said China will not put too much pressure on Taiwan. This is because China does not want to make people who might support the KMT party angry. China will most likely use a smart plan that has two parts.</p>
            <p>The article said that if China puts more pressure on Taiwan, people in Washington will ask Trump to help Taiwan. If Trump wants to show he is "strong and determined," he might agree to help Taiwan a lot. This would keep things balanced in the Taiwan Strait. This help could include selling more weapons to Taiwan, showing more US military ships and planes near Taiwan, and having more important meetings between the US and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>However, the article also said that if Trump is trying to make a trade deal with China, he might think it is necessary to change how the US usually deals with Taiwan. He might do this to make progress on trade with China.</p>
            <p>But the article said it is probably not a simple choice for Trump between looking tough or making deals. The situation might make him switch between these two ways. His recent change in how he deals with Ukraine shows this. This means he might also use the same changing plan for the relationship between Taiwan and China.</p>
            <p>The article said that Trump thinks being hard to predict is good for his plans. This means he and his main helpers need to clearly understand what is best for the US in the long term. The most important thing is to keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>Trump had earlier thought that Ukraine's President Zelenskyy was stopping the war with Russia. He even shamed him in public at the White House. But now, Trump believes that Russia's President Putin is the real problem. So, Trump now supports President Zelenskyy. (Edited by Chang Chih-hsuan) August 3rd, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Bloomberg Says OPEC+ Agrees to Pump 548,000 More Barrels of Oil Each Day in September</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Riyadh, August 3rd, news from other places) A person from OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries and their friends, said that the group has generally agreed to produce a lot more oil in September. They are trying to sell more oil in the market again.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that this person said Saudi Arabia and its partners plan to agree today, in an online meeting, to produce 548,000 more barrels of oil every day in September.</p>
            <p>This new decision to make more oil means OPEC+ is changing its goal a lot. Before, they wanted to keep oil prices high. Now, they want to make more oil.</p>
            <p>This change will help control the prices of oil and gasoline. It will make them less affected by political problems around the world and by how much oil people need at certain times of the year. This also helps drivers around the world a little, and it is a win for US President Trump. But this might also mean there will be too much oil in the world later this year.
