            <h1>Guyana's President says he won reelection and will focus on sharing oil money.</h1>
            <p>The President of Guyana, Irfaan Ali, a country in South America, announced today that he has won reelection. He will start his second term in office. His main goals are to use the recently found oil to make the country rich and to fix problems with neighboring Venezuela.</p>
            <p>News agencies AFP and Reuters reported that the People's Progressive Party (PPP), which is the party in power in Guyana, won more than twice as many votes as its closest rival in the national election. This strong win means President Ali can stay in power and his party will have most seats in parliament.</p>
            <p>According to the election committee's count, the PPP received a total of 242,451 votes in yesterday's election. They won the most votes in 8 out of the country's 10 election areas. The election committee has not yet confirmed how many seats each party will get in parliament.</p>
            <p>Ali, who is 45 years old, said, "The numbers are very clear... We have won by a lot, and we are ready to lead the country forward."</p>
            <p>This election was to choose 65 members of parliament and a new government. A main topic during the election was how the country would share the large amount of money it gets from oil.</p>
            <p>Since the end of 2019, when ExxonMobil started taking oil from the sea, Guyana, a country with 800,000 people, has made about 7.5 billion US dollars from selling oil and related payments. This has made Guyana one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>

            <h1>Fubon Life sells bonds overseas for the first time, raising US$650 million to strengthen its finances.</h1>
            <p>Fubon Life announced today that it has successfully sold bonds outside of Taiwan for the first time. On September 3rd, through its fully owned company in Singapore, Fubon Life Singapore Pte. Ltd., it set the price for US$650 million (about NT$20 billion) worth of special company bonds. This is to keep improving its financial situation and get ready for a new system called TW-ICS in 2026. This bond sale helps the company get money from more different places.</p>
            <p>After other insurance companies like Cathay Life, Nanshan Life, and Shin Kong Life, Fubon Life's board decided in April this year to set up a special company (SPV) in Singapore, owned 100% by Fubon Life. This company is expected to sell bonds to raise money and make its finances stronger. The first investment for setting up this company is expected to be US$40 million. People see this as the start of a trend for insurance companies to raise money overseas.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life announced in a press release today that this is its first time setting the price for US$650 million worth of special company bonds in the overseas market. These bonds will last for 10.25 years and include an option for the company to buy them back after 3 months. The price was set at 120 basis points (1.2%) above the 10-year US government bond rate. The bonds offer a return of 5.469%, with an interest rate of 5.45%.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life Singapore Pte. Ltd. is the company selling these bonds, and Fubon Life is the guarantor. Fubon Life promises to pay back all the money and interest for these bonds when they are due, without any conditions. This is the first time a Taiwanese insurance company has sold US dollar bonds in the international market that have a "par call" option. This option allows the company to buy back the bonds up to three months before they are due. This helps lower the cost of interest if the company can get new financing earlier.</p>
            <p>Fubon Life stated that selling these bonds overseas helps it find more ways to get money. The money raised from this sale will be used to make Fubon Life's financial structure stronger, increase its own capital, and improve its capital adequacy ratio (a measure of its financial health).</p>
            <p>During a time when international stock and bond markets were stable, and mild inflation data made people think the US central bank might lower interest rates, Fubon Life held meetings with investors in Singapore and Hong Kong for two days, starting on September 1st. On September 3rd, the bonds were successfully priced. In the end, investors wanted to buy over US$1.9 billion worth of bonds, which is almost three times more than what was available.</p>
            <p>Looking at where the investors came from, 86% were from the Asia-Pacific region, and 14% were from other areas. In terms of who invested, 82% were investment funds or asset management companies, 11% were insurance or pension funds, and 7% were banks, private banks, and others.</p>
