Nvidia, a top company that makes computer chips, recently announced very strong financial results for its first quarter. This news caused its stock price to jump by nearly 10% and helped increase the value of other technology companies in the stock market. The companyâ€™s revenue, which is the money it earned, reached $26.04 billion. This was much higher than the $24.65 billion that financial experts had predicted.

Nvidia also gave a positive forecast for its next quarter, expecting revenue of $28 billion. This is more than the $26.8 billion that analysts had thought. The company is experiencing huge demand for its powerful chips, especially those used for artificial intelligence (AI). These chips are essential for building and running AI systems, and companies are buying many of them.

Despite concerns from some investors about the rapid growth of AI, Nvidiaâ€™s CEO, Jensen Huang, stated that the demand for AI technology is still very strong. He said that companies are investing in AI to become more competitive and efficient. Nvidia's success shows the continued strong interest and investment in AI technology across many industries.

**The New Workplace Trends: 'Quiet Quitting' Leads to 'Quiet Firing'**

In recent years, new phrases have become popular in the workplace, like "quiet quitting." This term describes employees who do only what their job requires, without extra effort or enthusiasm. They might do this to avoid burnout or to achieve a better work-life balance. However, a new trend called "quiet firing" is now being discussed, where employers subtly encourage an employee to leave.

Quiet firing happens when a manager reduces an employee's responsibilities, stops giving them chances for promotion, or excludes them from important projects. They might also give less feedback or ignore requests for training and development. This behavior can make employees feel undervalued and unmotivated, eventually leading them to look for a new job or resign.

Experts say that both quiet quitting and quiet firing show a lack of clear communication between employees and managers. Instead of addressing issues openly, both sides use indirect methods. This can create a difficult and unproductive work environment. To improve, companies need to encourage open discussions, provide regular feedback, and offer clear paths for career growth to keep employees engaged and motivated.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day Tourists to Manage Crowds**

The historic Italian city of Venice has started charging a new entrance fee for day-trippers. This fee, which costs 5 euros (about $5.40), is being introduced to help manage the very large number of tourists visiting the city, especially during peak times. The fee is part of a trial that will last for 29 busy days between April and mid-July. Visitors arriving between 8:30 AM and 4:00 PM must pay the fee and show a QR code as proof.

The goal of this new system is to encourage visitors to avoid the busiest periods and to make Venice a more sustainable place to live and visit. Local residents, people staying overnight in Venice hotels, and children under 14 are among those who do not have to pay. Tourists who arrive without a ticket could face fines ranging from 50 to 300 euros.

Venice has struggled with over-tourism for many years, which puts a strain on its infrastructure and can negatively affect the daily lives of its residents. City officials hope this trial will help protect the unique charm of Venice and ensure a better experience for both tourists and locals in the long run. Many cities around the world are watching Venice's experiment closely as they also deal with the challenges of managing large numbers of tourists.`;
