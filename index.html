        const text = `**The Great Resignation May Be Over, But Worker Power Isn't**

The so-called "Great Resignation," a period marked by a large number of people leaving their jobs, seems to be slowing down. However, experts believe that this doesn't mean workers have lost their influence in the job market.

Even though companies are now less desperate to hire, employees still have options. Many are focusing on finding jobs that offer better pay, more flexibility, and a stronger sense of purpose. They're no longer willing to accept poor working conditions or unfulfilling roles.

This shift in power is driven by several factors, including a shortage of skilled workers in some industries and a growing awareness of work-life balance. The pandemic forced many people to re-evaluate their priorities, leading them to seek out jobs that align with their values. Companies that want to attract and keep talented employees need to understand this and offer competitive compensation packages, opportunities for growth, and a supportive work environment.

**AI-Powered Art Raises Questions About Copyright and Creativity**

The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the art world, allowing anyone to create stunning images with just a few text prompts. However, this new technology raises important questions about copyright and the very definition of creativity.

AI image generators like DALL-E 2 and Midjourney can produce realistic or surreal artwork based on user instructions. While this opens up exciting possibilities for artistic expression, it also creates legal and ethical dilemmas. Who owns the copyright to an image generated by AI? Is it the user who provided the prompt, the company that created the AI, or is it something entirely new?

These questions are still being debated by legal experts and artists alike. Some argue that AI-generated art should be considered derivative work, while others believe it should be protected under copyright law. As AI continues to evolve, it is important to have a clear framework that protects both the rights of artists and the public's access to creative works.

**Sustainable Tourism: A Growing Trend for Conscious Travelers**

More and more travelers are looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact and support local communities when they go on vacation. This growing interest in sustainable tourism is driving changes in the travel industry.

Sustainable tourism involves making responsible choices that minimize harm to the environment and benefit the local population. This can include staying in eco-friendly hotels, using public transportation, supporting local businesses, and respecting the local culture.

Travel companies are responding to this demand by offering more sustainable travel options, such as carbon-neutral flights and eco-tours. By making conscious choices about where they travel and how they spend their money, travelers can help to protect the planet and support the communities they visit.
