            <h1>Fishing Boat in Keelung's Badouzi Caught Fire; 6 Crew Members Jumped into Sea to Escape</h1>
            <p>A 56-ton fishing boat named "Jin De Cai" from Shen'ao, New Taipei City, caught fire tonight at Keelung's Badouzi fishing port. The fire was very strong, and thick black smoke went high into the sky. Firefighters got the fire under control around 10 PM. All six crew members on the boat jumped into the sea to escape and thankfully no one was hurt. The reason for the fire is still unknown.</p>
            <p>The Keelung City Fire Department received a report at 9:32 PM that a fishing boat was on fire about 200 meters from the shore. They quickly sent 12 different vehicles and 24 firefighters to help. When the firefighters arrived at the parking lot next to the Keelung District Fishermen's Association, they saw the whole boat was on fire, with black smoke rising to the sky. They immediately started spraying water to put out the fire.</p>
            <p>Firefighters continued to spray water, and the fire got smaller around 10 PM. However, because the boat was burning so strongly, it was hard to tie it with ropes, so it drifted away from the shore. This made it difficult for firefighters to put out the fire effectively. The Coast Guard sent fire-fighting boats to help and pulled the fishing boat closer to the shore. Working together, the Coast Guard and firefighters got the fire under control at 10:43 PM. They are now dealing with the remaining small fires.</p>
            <p>The captain, Mr. Luo, said that after they finished unloading the fish, he was moving the boat to tie it up when he saw a lot of smoke and fire coming from the cabin. To stop the fire from spreading to other fishing boats, he quickly moved the boat away from the shore. The six crew members on board jumped into the sea to escape, and luckily, no one was hurt.</p>

            <h1>Men's Asia Cup Basketball Team Returns to Top 8; Taiwanese-American Adam Hinton Honored to Represent Taiwan</h1>
            <p>With Adam Hinton scoring a team-high 18 points, Taiwan's men's basketball team beat Jordan 78-64 in a special game today. This win means Taiwan is back in the top 8 of the Asia Cup for the first time in 12 years. Adam Hinton, who is part Taiwanese and part American, said he is very proud to play for Taiwan on the world stage.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team, led by captain Chen Ying-chun, wanted to get back into the top 8 after losing badly to Jordan in the last Asia Cup. They also added the "Hinton brothers," Adam and Robert, who are part Taiwanese and part American. This made the team much stronger. They beat the strong team from the Philippines in their first group game, which put them in second place and into the special game.</p>
            <p>In this special game, their opponent was Jordan again. But this time, Adam Hinton scored 18 points, the most in the game. Captain Chen Ying-chun also scored 15 points, got 5 rebounds, and made 4 assists, including two important three-point shots in the fourth quarter. Also, "New Taiwanese" Kao Po-kai got 9 points, 12 rebounds, and blocked 7 shots to protect the area under the basket. Finally, after 12 years, they got their revenge for the loss three years ago and returned to the top 8 of the Asia Cup.</p>
            <p>Adam Hinton, called "Super Dan" by some, spoke to reporters after the game. He said the main reason for their win was that everyone worked together. He praised Kao Po-kai as a "rebounding monster" who helped Taiwan get many rebounds. He also said that Captain Chen Ying-chun made several important three-point shots. "He shot from places like Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard would, which was very important for this win," Hinton said.</p>
            <p>When foreign reporters asked how he started playing for Taiwan, Adam Hinton said his mother was one of the biggest reasons. He also said he is truly honored to play for Taiwan, especially playing with his brother Robert on the world stage. "I couldn't ask for more," he said. "This moment feels like a dream come true."</p>
            <p>Next, Taiwan's team will play against strong opponent Iran to try and get into the top 4. Head coach Gianluca Tucci said it might be a very tough game. He added that when playing a very confident team, they must stay humble and try to limit what the opponent can do. "We will get ready like we did for the Philippines game, and I believe the players are also looking forward to and excited for the next game," he said.</p>
