            <h1>Rain Hits Central and Southern Taiwan; Alishan Highway to Close at Night for Safety</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Huang Qiaowen, Taipei, July 30) Heavy rain has fallen in central and southern Taiwan because of a southwest air current. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Highway Bureau announced today that parts of Provincial Highway 18 in Alishan Township, Chiayi County, will be closed at night as a precaution. These parts are from Fushan to Alishan and from Chukou to Fushan.</p>
            <p>The Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan Regional Office of the Highway Bureau released a press statement. It said that due to the outer parts of Typhoon Bamboo Grass and the southwest air current, there has been heavy rain for several days in Alishan Township, Chiayi County. This rain might cause landslides, falling rocks, and trees to fall, which could be dangerous.</p>
            <p>To keep drivers and travel safe, the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan Regional Office of the Highway Bureau stated that Provincial Highway 18 from 68.5K to 88K (Fushan to Alishan) in Alishan Township, Chiayi County, will close at 6 PM tonight as a safety measure.

            <h1>Taiwan Mobile Starts "Planting Happiness with Electricity" Project; Jamie Lin: 16% of Power is Green Energy</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chiang Ming-yen, Taipei, July 30) Taiwan Mobile announced its "2025 Planting Happiness with Electricity" project today. This project uses green energy combined with public fundraising to help society. Taiwan Mobile's General Manager, Jamie Lin, said that 16% of Taiwan Mobile's power now comes from green energy. He also said that the company will make its network stronger against disasters and will set up more satellite communication. Taiwan Mobile also supports setting up "disaster roaming" services.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile announced today that it is working with everyone again to start the "2025 Planting Happiness with Electricity" project. This project uses green energy and public fundraising to turn sunlight into real help for charity.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile explained that this year's fundraising will start on August 1. They plan to raise NT$4.5 million within 61 days to build 189 solar panels. These panels will have a total power of 92.61 kWp. In 20 years, they expect to produce over 2.15 million units of green electricity and earn about NT$7 million. This will make the help given 1.54 times bigger.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile's General Manager, Jamie Lin, said that Taiwan Mobile now uses about 16% green energy. They plan to use 100% green energy by 2040 and have zero net carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile announced before that it has invested in Fubon Energy with Ho-Ming Energy and Fubon Life Insurance. The total investment is NT$11 billion, and Taiwan Mobile owns 10% of it. They will build energy storage facilities that can hold 354 MW of power. Because there is not enough supply from other companies, they will invest more. The platform will grow bigger in the future, making investments happen faster.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Environment's "Plan to Increase Investment in Green Growth and Net-Zero Industries" listed Taiwan Mobile as the only corporate venture capital investor among the first 12 partners.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused many network outages in southern Taiwan. This made many people worry about how strong communication networks are. Taiwan Mobile said they are happy to see and will actively support plans like building strong cell towers, putting cables underground, and adding satellite cars.</p>
            <p>Jamie Lin added today that over 10% of cell towers were affected by broken cables, and over 10% of equipment failed during the typhoon. They will try to put cables underground, but this would not have helped much with the problems caused by this storm. Taiwan Mobile is happy about "disaster roaming" being set up. Lin mentioned that there are three networks in the country that should support each other and be available in special situations.</p>
            <p>"Disaster roaming" means that in an emergency, users of any local telecom company can use services from other telecom companies directly, without needing to apply or set anything up.</p>
            <p>Regarding the phone market, Lin Dongmin, Taiwan Mobile's Chief Business Officer for personal users, said that sales of Samsung foldable phones, for example, more than doubled compared to last year. Also, the total number of phones sold in the first six months of this year has been growing. This year is also the start of AI smart glasses, and AI is very popular. Also, the making of original design manufacturer (ODM) and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products is mature. Taiwan Mobile sees great potential in the Taiwanese market and will be part of it.</p>
            <p>Also, Jamie Lin explained that he led a group to visit Google before. He said that he hopes to bring the "Taiwan Tongues" project into Google's Gemini training. This would help traditional Chinese to be better used in AI language models. Other collaborations are something to look forward to.</p>
            <p>The IMA Information Managers Association started the "Taiwan Tongues" project late last year. They are actively building a database of Taiwanese language. This is not only so that Taiwanese AI models can understand Taiwanese, but also so that open-source language models around the world can understand the Taiwanese language.</p>
            <p>Also, regarding satellite plans, he pointed out that Taiwan Mobile worked with Lynk Global, a satellite communication company, before. They tested space base station technology. This allows phones to connect directly to low-orbit satellites to send text messages and make voice calls. Taiwan Mobile will continue to work with international companies in this area.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Mobile has also invested in about 30 new companies so far. In recent years, they have invested in gaming companies like M.E. Entertainment and Japanese entertainment content company REMow. Other areas they are interested in include AI, Web3, and smart devices like smart glasses. (Edited by Chang Ruoyao) July 30, 2025.</p>
