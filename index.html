            <h1>Trump Says He Might Run for President Again, Claims Americans Like His Tariff Policy</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 5 (Central News Agency) â€“ US President Donald Trump was asked today if he wanted to run for president again. First, he said, "Maybe not." But then he changed his mind and said he hoped to run again. He also said that American people are happy with his government's tariff policy and the trade agreements Washington made with other countries.</p>
            <p>Trump, who returned to the White House earlier this year, spoke on the phone in an interview with CNBC's Squawk Box. He mentioned that in last year's US election, he got the most votes ever in Texas. He said, "This is a record, and they say it won't be broken unless I run again."</p>
            <p>When the host asked if he wanted to run for election again, Trump first said, "Maybe not." But then he changed his mind and said, "I hope to run." He also said that American people like the Trump government's tariff policy. They also like the trade agreements the US has made with other countries. These agreements stop other countries from taking advantage of the US.</p>
            <p>He repeated that for many years, many countries have taken too much from the US. He said, "Whether they are friends or enemies, friends are worse."</p>
            <p>Before this, in March, Trump told NBC News that he was serious about seeking a third term as president.</p>
            <p>Trump was first the US President from 2017 to 2021. He returned to the White House earlier this year. The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution says that no person can be president more than two times. To change the Constitution, two-thirds of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the states must agree. Most people think it is unlikely that this will happen.</p>
            <p>Also, last week, Trump confirmed a tariff policy that he had delayed. This policy aims to make trade fair, as he believes the current global trade system is not fair to the US. The updated US tariffs on nearly 70 countries range from 10% to 41%. For Taiwan, the tariff rate is 20%. The new tariffs are expected to start officially on August 7.</p>
            <p>A list of facts released by the White House names the countries and regions that have made agreements with the US: the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The New York Times reported that these countries promised to buy a lot of US energy and airplanes, invest more in the US, and make it easier for US farm and factory products to enter their markets. </p>
