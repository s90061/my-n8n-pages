  <h2>Taiwan and UK Sign Agreements in 3 Areas for Trade Partnership</h2>
  <p>After almost two years of talks, Taiwan and the United Kingdom have signed agreements in three areas for their Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP). These areas are digital trade, energy and net-zero emissions, and investment. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said today that they are happy to see a new step forward in trade between Taiwan and the UK. They will work with different government departments to build new trade cooperation based on shared values.</p>
  <p>The UK representative in Taiwan, Ruth Bradley-Jones, and Taiwan's representative in the UK, Yao Chin-hsiang, signed these agreements today. Douglas Alexander, a UK minister for business and trade, was present to witness the signing. The agreements are part of the ETP, which was signed in November 2023. This ETP is the first official trade agreement between Taiwan and a European country, which is very important.</p>
  <p>MOFA said that the relationship between Taiwan and the UK has grown a lot recently. In June, a UK Royal Navy ship, HMS Spey, sailed through the Taiwan Strait. The UK also released its "Strategic Defense Review" and "National Security Strategy," which show their concern for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. On June 26, the UK's first "Trade Strategy" after Brexit stated that the UK will continue to make its trade partnership with Taiwan stronger under the ETP.</p>

  <h2>Asian Stocks Rise with US Stocks Reaching New Highs; Investors Watch US Tariff Deadline</h2>
  <p>Asian stock markets mostly rose today, following new record highs in the US stock market. At the same time, investors are closely watching efforts by different countries to make trade deals with Washington before the US tariff deadline on July 9.</p>
  <p>The US dollar became weaker because people expect the US to lower interest rates more. Investors are also paying attention as President Trump's big tax cut plan will be voted on in the Senate. Some experts worry that this plan could add trillions of dollars to the US national debt.</p>
  <p>On June 27, the US stock indexes S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached their highest points ever. The market is hopeful that governments can avoid the tariffs that Trump planned to start in April but delayed until July 9 for talks.</p>
  <p>Officials from Japan and India have stayed longer in Washington to continue discussions, increasing hopes that these two big economies will reach agreements.</p>
  <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on June 27 that "some countries have given us very good deals, but they might not all be finished by next week." This comment made people hope that the tariff deadline might be moved again. He also said, "We have 18 important trade partners... if we can sign agreements with 10 or 12 of them, and we have 20 more important partnerships, I think we can finish trade deals before Labor Day on September 1."</p>
  <p>However, Trump said last weekend that he does not think he will extend the deadline. He told Fox News Channel, "I don't think I need to do that." After the US stocks reached new highs on June 27, most Asian stocks also went up today. Stock markets in Tokyo, Sydney, Seoul, Wellington, and Bangkok all closed higher. However, Hong Kong and Taipei stock markets closed lower.</p>
