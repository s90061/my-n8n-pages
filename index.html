US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on 14 countries. He said these tariffs will start on August 1st and there will be no delays. Trump had first introduced these tariffs in April, which caused some problems in global money markets. He then paused them for 90 days, allowing countries to talk with the US to get lower tariff rates.

Now, with the pause ending on July 9th, Trump has sent letters to leaders of 14 countries, including Japan and South Korea. These countries will face new tariffs between 25% and 40% starting August 1st. Japan and South Korea, important trade partners, will have a 25% tariff. Trump wrote online today that the tariffs will definitely start on August 1st and this date will not change. He said there will be no delays.

However, when asked if this was the final decision, Trump said that it was, but if countries call with different ideas that he likes, they could change things. He also said that August 1st is mostly set, but not 100% final if countries want to talk about other ways to handle it.

**Texas Floods Kill Over 100 People Due to Flash Floods, Climate Change, and No Warning System**

More than 100 people, including many children, have died in recent floods in Texas, USA. Experts say that natural disasters often become tragedies because of human choices. This situation in Texas is a clear example.

The severe impact of this storm was made worse by several reasons:

*   **Flash Flood Alley:** A scientist explained that the Texas Hill Country is known as "Flash Flood Alley." Warm air from the Gulf of Mexico rises over hills and cliffs, cools quickly, and causes heavy rain. The ground here is thin and can't absorb much water, so the water quickly runs off into many streams. This means water levels can rise very, very fast, sometimes in minutes or hours. On July 4th, for example, the Guadalupe River near Camp Mystic went from 1 foot to 20 feet high in less than 90 minutes. This amount of water can carry away people, cars, and even buildings.

*   **Need to Adapt to Climate Change:** Warmer air holds more water, which means more intense rainfall. The rain during this flood was more than twice the usual amount for the month. A new study found that this flood's weather conditions cannot be explained by natural changes alone. A climate scientist from Oxford University said that climate change is already affecting us, so we must learn to live with it. She also said we need to reduce pollution and fund research and warning systems for climate change.

*   **No Warning System:** Even though officials in Kerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, had considered using flood alarms and digital alerts for years, there was opposition. They wanted to replace the old informal system where camp staff warned other camps by radio. Some residents also did not want to use federal money linked to the previous government. After the disaster, a woman whose daughter almost went to Camp Mystic started a petition. She wants the governor to approve a modern warning system. She believes that a 5-minute siren could have saved all the children.
