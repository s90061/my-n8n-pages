            <h1>Nvidia's Financial Report Is Better Than Expected, But Stock Price Falls After Hours</h1>
            <p>Nvidia shared its financial results and future predictions after the stock market closed today. Both were better than what experts thought. But after trading hours, the company's stock price went down. This happened because investors are worried about too much spending on AI chips and that Nvidia's business in China might stop growing.</p>
            <p>News agencies like AFP and Reuters reported that Nvidia made 26.4 billion US dollars in profit in the second quarter. This is about 806.8 billion New Taiwan dollars. Its sales reached a new high of 46.7 billion US dollars. This good performance is because big technology companies need a lot of Nvidia's chips for their AI data centers.</p>
            <p>Nvidia also expects its sales for the current quarter to be around 54 billion US dollars, plus or minus 2%. This is more than the average expert prediction of 53.14 billion US dollars. Nvidia believes that companies offering cloud services will need many of its chips. This is because they are building more systems to make powerful AI work.</p>
            <p>Nvidia also said that its predictions for today do not include any planned shipments of its H20 chips to China.</p>
