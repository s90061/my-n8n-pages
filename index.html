            <h1>Italian Actress Barbara Ronchi's New Film About a Difficult Marriage, Her Real-Life Boyfriend Plays a Bad Guy</h1>
            <p>Italian actress Barbara Ronchi plays a writer with a troubled marriage in her new movie, "Ten Minutes of Freshness." But in real life, she has been with Alessandro Tedeschi, who plays the bad guy in the film, for many years. This creates an interesting difference between the movie and their real lives.</p>
            <p>According to the film company, Barbara Ronchi has a good education, but her acting career did not start well. After her first movie, "Miele," nothing much happened for a while. Her acting career only started to get better after she acted in "Sweet Dreams," which was chosen to open the "Directors' Fortnight" at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
            <p>The "bad guy" in Barbara Ronchi's movie is played by Alessandro Tedeschi, who she has lived with for 14 years. Their relationship outside of work is stable. She once shared how they fell in love: one Christmas Eve, they went out to walk their dog, and she forgot her keys. They were locked out, but Tedeschi joked, "This will be the best night of our lives." Barbara Ronchi felt he was the right person for her and "as important as bread."</p>
            <p>"Ten Minutes of Freshness" will be shown in Taiwan starting September 5th.</p>

            <h1>Chou Tien-chen Beats British Rising Star in Straight Games, Enters Badminton World Championships Last 16</h1>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen, Taiwan's top male badminton player, won his second-round match today at the World Badminton Championships in France. He beat British rising star Ethan Rose 21-14, 21-12. He is now in the last 16 and will play against Japanese player Kenta Nishimoto next.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen is currently ranked 6th in the world. He won a bronze medal at the World Championships in 2022. Even though he is 35 years old, he is still playing very well in international badminton. This season, he has reached the semi-finals twice in BWF Super 1000 tournaments and was a runner-up at the Indonesia Open.</p>
            <p>For this World Championships in France, Chou Tien-chen got to the second round without playing because Czech player Jan Louda withdrew. Today, he played against Ethan Rose, a 22-year-old British player ranked 107th in the world. They had never played each other before.</p>
            <p>In their first match, Chou Tien-chen started strong in the first game. He quickly took a 5-0 lead. Even though Rose managed to tie the score for a moment, Chou Tien-chen quickly responded with 10 points in a row. He made the gap bigger and won the first game 21-14.</p>
            <p>Chou Tien-chen kept his good form in the second game, leading almost the whole time. After the technical break at 11-5, he continued to get more points ahead. He won the game 21-12, finishing the match in just 32 minutes. He successfully moved into the men's singles last 16 and will now play Kenta Nishimoto from Japan to try and get into the quarter-finals.</p>
            <p>Besides Chou Tien-chen, other Taiwanese players, Lin Chun-yi and Lee Chia-hao, who are known for their powerful left-hand shots, also played in the men's singles. Lin Chun-yi, the 12th seed, will play against Alwi Farhan, a rising star from Indonesia and a World Junior Champion. Lee Chia-hao will challenge China's good player Weng Hong-yang.</p>

            <h1>Opposition Parties Push to Change Law: No Parole for Life Sentences; Legislature to Hold Public Hearing</h1>
            <p>Today, the Legislative Yuan's Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee discussed changes to the Criminal Code about life sentences. While the KMT and TPP parties want quick changes, the DPP party thinks more discussion and supporting measures are needed. In the end, Wu Tsung-hsien, a KMT legislator and the meeting's chairman, decided to hold a public hearing first to hear opinions from everyone.</p>
            <p>The Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee of the Legislative Yuan today scheduled discussions on proposed changes to parts of the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. For the rules about life sentences in the Criminal Code, different political parties have suggested a total of eight versions.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, when explaining his proposal, said that because the use of the death penalty has become very limited, and courts can no longer really give death sentences, people are now worried about how life sentences work. However, in the past, life sentences in the justice system only existed on paper and were not really used. From 2013 to 2022, 657 people who were given life sentences were released on parole. On average, they spent 17.9 years in prison. This makes life sentences seem meaningless and hurts people's trust in fairness and justice.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang pointed out that the Taiwan People's Party's proposal has two main points. First, it would change the usual minimum time for parole for a life sentence from 25 years to 30 years. Second, courts could decide that a person with a life sentence cannot get parole at all. He said that Taiwan's parole system has long been decided by government officials who are not neutral. This has led to unfair parole decisions and many cases of corruption, with even legislators getting involved in individual parole cases. He asked for a complete review of the parole system.</p>
            <p>KMT legislator Wu Tsung-hsien said in his proposal explanation that the Constitutional Court's ruling No. 8 in 2024 is like ending the death penalty in practice. However, statistics show that 60% of people released on parole commit crimes again. The government should think about how to fix the difference between death sentences and life sentences. His proposal divides life sentences into three levels. The first level means no parole for life. The second level means parole can only be requested after serving 40 years. The third level is the current 25 years. He stressed that for defendants who have committed terrible crimes that make everyone angry, if they cannot be given the death penalty, they should be in prison forever.</p>
            <p>DPP legislator Wu Szu-yao said during questioning that she supports a system of life imprisonment. However, she is against making changes too quickly. She believes there should be a version from the Executive Yuan, and a public hearing should be held. Also, supporting rules must be in place before the changes start. Besides preventing wrongful convictions, it is also important to stop criminals from avoiding punishment. It is also important to create different levels for the parole system for life sentences. Therefore, the Criminal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, Court Organization Act, and Prison Act should all be changed. In addition, DPP legislators Shen Fa-hui and Chen Pei-yu also said that a public hearing should be held first for this issue.</p>
            <p>Minister of Justice Cheng Ming-chien said in his report that the Ministry of Justice agrees with the goal of the legislators' proposals regarding parole and making life sentences stricter or lighter. He supports changing the law to clearly state terms for life imprisonment for serious crimes, especially violent ones, to stop illegal acts and protect social justice. The Ministry of Justice has already written a draft of changes to the Criminal Code regarding parole and has sent it to the Executive Yuan for review.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chien stated that the key changes in the draft include adding a rule that there will be no parole for serious crimes like intentional murder or attempted murder if they are sentenced to life imprisonment or a fixed-term imprisonment of over 10 years. This will make the Criminal Code more effective. Also, the draft clearly states that if a person with a life sentence has their parole taken away, they must serve the rest of their life sentence, not a fixed remaining prison time.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ming-chien emphasized that the Ministry of Justice has prepared draft changes to the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure. These drafts also explain how the old and new laws will apply. After the Executive Yuan approves them, they will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>After the questioning ended, Wu Tsung-hsien said that because many legislators suggested holding a public hearing to get opinions from all sides, he decided to review the issue again at a later time and hold a public hearing first.</p>
