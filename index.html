            <h1>China Steel keeps prices the same for August to help other companies get orders.</h1>
            <p>China Steel announced today that its prices for August will not change. The company said that the world's steel business is facing many problems and is very difficult. Companies that use steel to make products are buying less because of exchange rates and taxes. To make customers feel more confident, China Steel will keep prices steady and offer different plans to help these companies get more orders.</p>
            <p>China Steel said that the United States is telling other countries about new tax rates, which makes the market clearer. This helps to make things less uncertain. Currently, people are not very confident about buying or investing worldwide. But slowly, people will start to buy more things again. In Taiwan, things are quite stable. The government changed its forecast for economic growth this year slightly, from 3.14% to 3.1%.</p>
            <p>In the steel market, prices for raw materials like coal and iron are mostly stable. Iron ore stays around 95 to 100 US dollars per ton, and coking coal is around 175 to 180 US dollars per ton.</p>
            <p>After the United States raised taxes on steel and aluminum to 50%, the price of hot rolled steel there is still around 1000 US dollars per ton. In Europe, prices for hot rolled steel went down by 40 to 50 US dollars per ton in the last month because of summer holidays.</p>
            <p>In Asia, steel prices are still low. Vietnam's Formosa Ha Tinh Steel lowered its new hot rolled steel price by 9 US dollars per ton. In China, the Tangshan area has rules to make less steel, and people inside China are buying steadily, so there is not a lot of steel stored there. Baosteel, a big steel company in China, raised its prices for flat steel products by 100 Chinese Yuan (about 410.1 New Taiwan Dollars) per ton for August. This might help the steel market get better.</p>
            <p>China Steel said that the global steel business is facing many difficulties, and the market is hard. Companies that make products from steel are careful about buying because of currency exchange rates and taxes. To keep their customers confident, China Steel decided to keep prices the same for all its monthly products in August.</p>
            <p>Feng Hsin Steel, a company in central Taiwan that makes steel bars, also announced its prices on July 14. The prices for steel bars and scrap metal both went down by 200 New Taiwan Dollars per ton. The price for shaped steel products went down by 400 New Taiwan Dollars per ton.</p>

            <h1>TSMC speeds up work at US factories in Arizona to make many chips.</h1>
            <p>TSMC, a company that makes computer chips, said today that it is making the second factory in Arizona start working faster, by a few months. It is also thinking about making the third factory start working faster. TSMC wants to build a very big group of chip factories in Arizona. This will help them meet the needs of customers who make smartphones, AI products, and powerful computers.</p>
            <p>Today, TSMC had a meeting with people who invest in the company. Mr. C.C. Wei, the chairman and president, shared the latest news about their plans around the world. He said that the first factory in Arizona began making 4-nanometer chips in the last part of 2024. The quality of these chips is as good as the chips made in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wei also said that the second factory will use 3-nanometer technology. Its construction is now finished. Because customers need chips quickly, TSMC is working to start making chips there a few months earlier than planned.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wei mentioned that the third factory will use 2-nanometer and A16 technologies. Since there is a lot of demand for products related to artificial intelligence (AI), they are thinking about making this factory start production faster.</p>
            <p>He said that the fourth factory will use 2-nanometer and A16 technologies. The fifth and sixth factories will use even newer technology. The plans for building and starting these factories will depend on what customers need.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wei explained that these plans will allow TSMC to grow into a very large group of chip factories in Arizona. This will help them provide chips for smartphones, AI, and powerful computing uses for their customers.</p>
            <p>Besides the six chip factories, Mr. Wei said that TSMC also plans to build two new places for advanced chip packaging and a research center. This will help to make the AI supply chain complete. When all these plans are finished, about 30% of their 2-nanometer chips and other more advanced chips will come from the Arizona factories. This will make Arizona an independent place in the United States for making advanced chips.</p>
            <p>For their work in Japan, Mr. Wei said that the first factory in Kumamoto, Japan, which makes special kinds of chips, started working at the end of 2024. The building of the second special chip factory will start later this year. This depends on whether the local roads and services are ready.</p>
            <p>In Europe, Mr. Wei said that TSMC is building a factory for special chips in Dresden, Germany, just as planned, and it is going well. When this factory starts making chips will depend on what customers need and what the market is like.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wei also said that TSMC plans to build 11 chip factories and 4 advanced packaging factories in Taiwan in the coming years. They are preparing to build many 2-nanometer chip factories in the Hsinchu and Kaohsiung science parks. This is to meet the strong and continuing demand from their customers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wendell Huang, the chief financial officer of TSMC, said that as the factories in Kumamoto and Arizona make more chips, the company will earn a little less profit from these factories outside Taiwan. He expects that from 2025 for the next five years, making chips overseas will first make their profit margin lower by about 2% to 3% each year. Later, this effect will grow to 3% to 4% lower.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei City practices for emergencies and air attacks.</h1>
            <p>New Taipei City had an emergency drill today to prepare for air attacks. An air raid alarm went off at 1:30 PM. Police and people from the civil defense quickly stopped cars. Busy roads became empty right away. They also showed people where to go to be safe. Everyone practiced very seriously.</p>
            <p>The "New Taipei City Urban Resilience (Air Defense) Exercise" happened this afternoon. Before the practice, New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-ih and others first went to the Tucheng District Office to hear a report. When the alarm sounded, police and civil defense workers quickly stopped traffic. This made Jincheng Road next to the office empty very fast.</p>
            <p>After that, Mayor Hou Yu-ih took people to see how to get to safe places at Tucheng MRT Station and a big supermarket called Dalian General Market in Tucheng. Then, they drove to Tucheng Junior High School to watch a practice of sheltering people. The people taking part in the drill were very serious during the practice.</p>
            <p>Mayor Hou Yu-ih said that the goal of the emergency drill is to make everyone better prepared for air attacks. It also checks if the government can react well to disasters. More importantly, it reminds people to be ready for danger even when things are peaceful. By doing these drills, people learn more about risks and are always ready. This helps them deal with any kind of disaster.</p>
