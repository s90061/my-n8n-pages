            <p>A car fell about 100 meters into a valley on Provincial Highway 21 in Nantou today. This happened when the driver was going downhill at the 123-kilometer mark. The Nantou County Fire Department sent 10 vehicles, 17 firefighters, and 15 volunteer firefighters to the scene. They rescued all four people, who were awake and were sent to the hospital.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the Nantou County Fire Department received a report from the police. A car had fallen into a valley near the 123-kilometer mark of Provincial Highway 21 in Sinyi Township. The person who reported it said the car was stopped by trees, about 200 meters down. Four people were inside the car. They were awake and not bleeding much. The third team and the Yushan, Sinyi, Shuili, and Sun Moon Lake fire squads went to help.</p>
            <p>The Fire Department said that when the Yushan squad's ambulance arrived, they could not see the car because of the difficult land. After looking more, they found the car about 100 meters down. The area was very steep. When the Yushan volunteer firefighters arrived, they used their skills to make a path to the car. They then helped the four people get out.</p>
            <p>The Fire Department also said that rescue workers set up a rope system on the road. Firefighters and volunteer firefighters pulled the injured people up to the road after 5 PM.

            <h1>Asian Junior Baseball Championship: Taiwan Wins 8th Title in History, Beats Japan Again with Over 5,000 Spectators</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's team played against Japan again in the final game of the Asian Junior Baseball Championship today. It was a game where both teams' pitchers played very well. Pitcher Ko Shao-Chieh played with confidence, finishing all 7 innings without letting the other team score. Chen Po-Yu hit a key triple in the 6th inning, which helped Taiwan score. Taiwan won 3-0, winning the championship for the second time in a row and getting their 8th title in history.</p>
            <p>The final game of the Asian Junior Baseball Championship was held at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. 5,163 people came to watch. Taiwan had beaten Japan in the last semi-final game yesterday, and they kept their good performance in today's final match.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's pitcher Ko Shao-Chieh started the game. In the first inning, he walked a batter, then allowed a hit, and then walked another batter. This meant Japan had players on all bases. But Ko Shao-Chieh quickly calmed down. He made the Japanese batters hit a fly ball to third base and a fly ball to right field for outs. Then, he struck out another batter to get the third out. Taiwan did not let Japan score.</p>
            <p>After the first inning's difficult situation, Ko Shao-Chieh pitched better and better. In the 2nd and 3rd innings, he did not let any Japanese batters get on base. In the bottom of the 4th inning, after one out, he walked a batter. Then, because of a mistake by a teammate in defense, Japan got an infield hit and had players in scoring positions. But Ko Shao-Chieh was not too affected. He made the batters hit ground balls for outs, and Taiwan did not let Japan score.</p>
            <p>Neither team scored any points in the first 5 innings. Taiwan broke the tie in the top of the 6th inning. After two outs, Chen Rui-Hsin got a hit first. Hu Kuan-Wei then walked to a base. Chen Po-Yu hit a triple, which brought in 2 runs.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team started another attack in the top of the 7th inning. Huang Zi-Chi got a hit. Then, he moved forward with a sacrifice bunt. Tseng Yi-Che got an infield hit, and Chiang Chin-Cheng added another hit. This gave the team one more important run.</p>
            <p>Ko Shao-Chieh pitched all 7 innings. He only allowed 4 hits, struck out 4 batters, and walked 3 batters, but he did not let Japan score any runs. He played a great game without letting the other team score and stopped the Japanese batters. He was a big reason for the team's win.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team has always done well in the history of the Asian Junior Baseball Championship. This year, they won for the second time in a row and got their 8th title. The top two teams in the Asian Junior Baseball Championship get to play in next year's U15 World Baseball Championship.</p>

            <h1>Spain Wildfires: 4 Dead, 350,000 Hectares Burned in Almost Two Weeks</h1>
            <p>Virginia Barcones, the head of Spain's civil protection and emergency services, said today that the wildfires across the country this month are almost under control. These fires, which burned large areas, have caused 4 deaths.</p>
            <p>Barcones told Spanish national television (TVE) that "the wildfires that are still burning are fewer, and the end is much closer."</p>
            <p>However, she said that the fires still burning are "unpredictable." She added, "We still need to make a final effort to finish this terrible situation."</p>
            <p>According to the European Forest Fire Information System, 350,000 hectares of land in Spain have burned down in the past two weeks. Spanish firefighters have been fighting these fires for several weeks with help from other European Union countries.</p>
            <p>The northern and western parts of Spain were hit the hardest. This includes the regions of Castile and Leon, Extremadura, and Galicia. The wildfires started during a two-week heatwave when temperatures across the country went above 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>This fire emergency not only showed the effects of climate change but also highlighted trends that make Spain's countryside more likely to suffer from fires.</p>
            <p>The Castile and Leon region has faced problems for a long time, such as people moving away, an aging population, and less farming and animal grazing. These activities used to help clear flammable materials from forests, but now they have greatly reduced.</p>
