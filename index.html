            <h1>Huang Hsiao-wen Easily Beats Young Japanese Boxer, Moves to Last 16 in World Boxing Championship</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese boxer Huang Hsiao-wen won her match today at the WB World Boxing Championship. She was in the Round of 32 for the 54 kg category. Huang, who is 28, fought against 20-year-old Japanese boxer Kokufu Shimarin. Huang showed her long arms and more experience, winning 5-0. She now moves on to the Round of 16.</p>
            <p>Huang celebrated her 28th birthday on August 31. Today, she had her first match at the World Boxing (WB) Championship in Liverpool, UK. She faced the new Japanese boxer, Kokufu Shimarin.</p>
            <p>Huang is 175 cm tall, which is about half a head taller than her opponent. Her long arms also gave her a big advantage. From the start of the first round, she used quick steps and left punches to break her opponent's defense. She hit her opponent's head many times. Four judges gave Huang 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the second round, Huang attacked even more strongly. She used strong combination punches, so her opponent could not fight back. Huang also kept a good distance, not letting her opponent get close. By the end of the second round, all five judges had given Huang 10 points.</p>
            <p>The third round was very one-sided. Kokufu Shimarin's energy clearly went down. This gave Huang more chances to attack. In the end, Huang won the match 5-0 without any doubt.</p>
            <p>Her coach, Liu Zong-tai, said in an interview that Huang was very decisive in this match. Her timing for punches was good, and she did not hesitate. Also, she had more experience than her opponent. The whole match was under her control.</p>
            <p>After moving to the Round of 16, Huang Hsiao-wen will fight against Yesugen Oyuntsetseg from Mongolia. They fought before in the WB Year-End Championship final last year. Huang won that match 4-1 and took home the gold medal.</p>
            <p>In other news, another Taiwanese boxer, Lai Chu-en, also had his first match today. He was in the Round of 64 for the men's 60 kg category. He unfortunately lost 0-5 to Junmilardo Ogayre from the Philippines and was eliminated.</p>

            <h1>Trump Sends National Guard, Washington D.C. Asks Federal Court to Stop It</h1>
            <p>The government of U.S. President Trump sent National Guard soldiers to Washington D.C. Today, Washington D.C. sued to stop this. This action might make the relationship worse between the Republican president and the Democratic leader of D.C.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Brian Schwalb, the Attorney General for Washington D.C., filed a lawsuit. He wants a federal court to order the Trump government to stop sending the National Guard to D.C. He says it is against the constitution and several federal laws.</p>
            <p>This week, a federal judge in California said that using the National Guard to fight crime is illegal. This lawsuit in D.C. could cause another legal problem for Trump's plan to give the military a bigger role inside the country.</p>
            <p>Schwalb wrote on X (a social media platform): "Armed soldiers should not do police work on citizens in the United States." He also said that using the military to take over Washington D.C. goes against local self-government and basic freedoms, and it must stop.</p>
            <p>Last month, Trump sent the National Guard to D.C. He said this was to "bring back law, order, and public safety." He also put the D.C. police department under direct control of the federal government.</p>
            <p>Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said that the President has the legal right to send troops. This is to protect federal property and help with law enforcement.</p>
            <p>Jackson said in a statement: "This lawsuit is just another try to stop the President's effective efforts to fight violent crime in D.C. It will hurt the people who live and visit D.C."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit from D.C. says that sending the National Guard to keep order in the streets without Mayor Muriel Bowser's approval breaks the "Home Rule Act." This act gives the capital city the right to govern itself.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit also states that the National Guard soldiers sent to Washington must follow the "Posse Comitatus Act." This federal law puts strict limits on what the military can do for law enforcement inside the country.</p>
            <p>In June, Trump also put the California National Guard under federal control. He sent the National Guard to Los Angeles, even though California Governor Gavin Newsom did not agree.</p>
            <p>On September 2nd, a federal judge in California decided that it was illegal to use the military to protect federal agents who work on immigration and drug cases.</p>

            <h1>Mexico Supports Local Businesses, May Add Taxes on Goods from Countries Without Trade Deals</h1>
            <p>Mexico's President, Claudia Sheinbaum, said today that Mexico is thinking about adding more taxes on goods brought in from countries that do not have trade agreements with Mexico. This includes China.</p>
            <p>These new taxes would be part of something called "Plan Mexico." This plan aims to help businesses in Mexico. This is happening because U.S. President Donald Trump added taxes on some products that Mexico sends to the U.S.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Sheinbaum said in a regular press conference today, "We are thinking about specific tariffs (taxes)." She added that these taxes would apply to countries that have not signed trade agreements with Mexico, such as China.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum did not say which products or types of businesses might be affected.</p>
            <p>Mexico is the second-largest economy in Latin America. It is a member of the "United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement" (USMCA). This agreement was made during Trump's first time as U.S. President. It replaced the "North American Free Trade Agreement" (NAFTA) in 2020.</p>
