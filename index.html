            <h1>China Starts Mandatory Social Insurance, Affecting Small Businesses and Workers</h1>
            <p>Starting this September, China is making social insurance mandatory. Social insurance is meant to help people in retirement, but this change is making both ordinary people and small businesses worried. Reporters in Beijing and Shanghai talked to people and experts to understand how this mandatory social insurance will affect society. They also interviewed experts to find out about the problems and solutions related to it.</p>
            <p>From the first day of this month, China has started making social insurance mandatory. This means that old agreements where companies and workers did not pay or paid less are no longer valid. Experts say this will greatly increase the cost of hiring people. Small and medium-sized businesses and workers with low salaries will be affected the most. Everyone is watching how strictly the rules will be followed and if the courts can handle many new legal cases.</p>
            <p>On August 1st this year, China's Supreme People's Court announced new rules called "Interpretation II." These rules say that any agreement between an employer and an employee not to pay social insurance is not valid. If an employee ends their work contract because of this, they can ask their employer for money. These rules started on September 1st, showing that mandatory social insurance payments are now very important.</p>
            <p>Even though China's "Labor Law" already said that "companies and workers must join social insurance and pay the fees by law," an expert from Shanghai said that many companies did not follow these rules fully in the past. Some companies did not pay, and some paid less. It was common for them to pay only the lowest amount. If companies must now pay the full amount, their costs for hiring people will go up a lot.</p>
            <p>Social insurance has five parts: basic old-age insurance, basic medical insurance, unemployment insurance, work injury insurance, and maternity insurance. Employers and employees share the cost for the first three. Employers pay for the last two. Xu Jin, a financial journalist in China, said that if all social insurance is paid, companies will pay about 30% to 40% of an employee's salary before tax. Individuals will pay 10.5% to 22.5%. Mr. Zhang, a Taiwanese person who worked in Shanghai for six years, earned 23,000 Chinese Yuan (about 98,800 Taiwan Dollars) before tax at the end of 2023. He had to pay over 3,000 Yuan for social insurance each month, which was 13% of his salary.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhang said that he did not pay social insurance during his first three years in Shanghai. Later, he found out that his income was higher without social insurance, and he had to pay more tax at the end of the year. So, he started paying social insurance. He said, "Even though I didn't want to, social insurance is a protection for people by law, so there's nothing I can do."</p>
            <p>Paying social insurance is a heavy burden for people with low salaries. Social insurance has a "payment base," and this base is different in different cities and provinces. For example, in Shanghai in 2024, the lowest payment base is 7,384 Yuan. This means that even if a person earns only 5,000 Yuan a month, they still have to pay social insurance based on the 7,384 Yuan amount.</p>
            <p>Before the new rules started, a reporter visited a restaurant in Shanghai. An employee there said, "This kind of job usually doesn't have social insurance." However, this employee earned 5,500 Yuan a month, worked 10 hours a day, and had only one day off each week. This left him no energy to think about social insurance. He said, "I'll leave when they find someone new."</p>
            <p>The situation was similar in Beijing. A reporter visited several restaurants there that had "help wanted" signs. One boss said that the salary was 5,000 Yuan, and the restaurant would not help with social insurance; employees had to pay it themselves. If an employee wanted the restaurant to pay social insurance, their salary would be lowered by over 2,000 Yuan.</p>
            <p>Companies pay a larger part of social insurance than employees. The new rules also affect companies. Some companies are choosing to hire retired people to avoid paying the old-age insurance, which is the biggest part of social insurance.</p>
            <p>Li Renxiang, the general manager of Hanbang Management Consulting Company, said that a possible solution for companies right now is to use temporary staffing agencies to hire workers. This helps them avoid paying social insurance. However, the number of temporary workers cannot be more than 10% of all workers. This means 90% of hiring costs still cannot be avoided, so this solution has limited use. Companies could also move to provinces or cities where the social insurance payment base is lower. For example, in Jiangsu in 2024, the base is 4,879 Yuan, which is 2,505 Yuan lower than Shanghai.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhang said he had heard that some companies report lower salaries and pay part of the salary as a bonus. Another way is to connect their social insurance payments to a branch company in a province with a lower social insurance base. This helps them pay less for social insurance.</p>
            <p>Li Renxiang believes that in the future, to save money on staff, companies might reduce the number of permanent jobs. Instead, they might use more automatic systems or hire outside companies to do work.</p>
            <p>Another expert in economics and law from Shanghai also said that China currently has a lot of pressure in the job market. Even if companies do not lower salaries, they might give smaller raises or even close down. This will lead to more people losing their jobs. He said, "This will definitely affect the market."</p>
            <p>The expert also mentioned that in the past, government departments were not very strict about companies paying social insurance. If a small company did not pay social insurance and an employee complained, the human resources department might not force the company to pay if they saw the company was not doing well financially.</p>
            <p>Li Renxiang said that in places like Guangdong, the government used to ignore companies not paying social insurance or paying only the minimum amount. Because of this, many former employees are now going back to court to sue their old companies.</p>
            <p>Wen Zhuoyi, a professor at the Education University of Hong Kong who has studied China's social system for a long time, said that China now has a problem with an aging population and fewer children. To make sure the financial system can keep going, strict law enforcement is a possible way forward.</p>
            <p>The Shanghai expert in economics and law mentioned earlier said that there are about one million social insurance disputes each year. In the past, courts thought that social insurance problems were for government departments to handle, so they usually did not take these cases. But the Supreme People's Court's "Interpretation II" means that the justice system will now get involved in social insurance disputes. So, a key question is whether the courts can handle such a large number of cases.</p>

            <h1>Man Runs Over Girlfriend Who Lay on Car Hood During Argument, Held in Custody</h1>
            <p>On the 6th, Mr. Wang and Ms. Wu had an argument. Mr. Wang wanted to drive away, but Ms. Wu lay on the car's hood to stop him. Mr. Wang did not stop and drove away. This caused Ms. Wu to fall and be dragged under the car, which led to her severe injuries and death. The Nantou police quickly caught Mr. Wang within three hours of the event. The prosecutor's request to hold him was approved.</p>
            <p>Today, the Nantou Police Department said that around 8 PM on the 6th, they received a call. It was reported that a woman was lying on the hood of a car at the crossing of Zhonghua Road and Zili 1st Road in Nantou City. It seemed to be a dispute between a man and a woman. Police officers arrived and found the 32-year-old Ms. Wu lying on the road. The police first thought she had been run over by a car. They quickly called an ambulance to take Ms. Wu to the hospital. She died from her serious injuries that evening.</p>
            <p>The Nantou Police Department stated that after checking security cameras, they found the suspect was 43-year-old Mr. Wang. Mr. Wang and Ms. Wu were in a relationship. After they argued, Mr. Wang wanted to drive away. Ms. Wu ran out of the house and lay on the car's hood to stop him. Mr. Wang ignored her and drove forward. This made Ms. Wu fall to the ground and be dragged under the car. But Mr. Wang did not get out to check and drove away faster.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wu was dragged, which caused clear scrapes and bruises on her face, left chest, and left stomach. Her right leg had a very bad broken bone. She died after being taken to the hospital. The police knew Mr. Wang had escaped to Taichung City. They quickly told the Nantou District Prosecutor's Office about the case. They sent officers to Taichung City that night to find him. Three hours after the event, Mr. Wang was caught on Gongyuan Road in Taichung City, and the car involved was taken. Evidence showed that Ms. Wu's torn clothes and hair were stuck under the car.</p>
            <p>The police said that the facts of the case are clear. After questioning, Mr. Wang was sent to the Nantou District Prosecutor's Office yesterday for investigation on suspicion of murder, and the police asked for him to be held. The prosecutor and a forensic doctor checked the body yesterday. Last night, the Nantou District Court approved the request to hold Mr. Wang.</p>

            <h1>Teacher's Day Holiday: Highway Rules, Ramp Closures, and Free Tolls - All You Need to Know</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Freeway Bureau said today that for the Teacher's Day long weekend, there will be special traffic rules. These include closing some highway ramps, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) rules, and changes to toll fees. They also reminded drivers to pay full attention and not drive when tired on the highways. This way, drivers can react quickly if something unexpected happens.</p>
            <p>This year, the Teacher's Day long weekend is from September 27th to 29th. The Freeway Bureau expects many cars on the highways during this holiday as people travel. So, they have planned traffic control measures for busy directions each day. These include traffic lights at ramps and opening road shoulders for driving.</p>
            <p>For ramp closures: On September 27th and 28th mornings, some southbound entry ramps for National Freeways 1 and 5 will be closed for certain hours. On September 28th and 29th afternoons, some northbound entry ramps for National Freeways 1 and 3 will be closed for certain hours.</p>
            <p>On September 28th and 29th afternoons, there will be HOV rules for northbound traffic on National Freeway 5. Also, during the holiday, there will be one standard toll rate, different toll rates for National Freeway 3, and no tolls from 12 AM to 5 AM.</p>
            <p>The Freeway Bureau said that cars on highways travel very fast. If drivers get distracted or are tired, their attention will be lower, and accidents might happen. This can not only slow down traffic behind them but also cause more accidents. They remind all drivers to pay full attention and not drive when tired on highways. This way, drivers can react in time to sudden events and lower the chance of accidents.</p>
