<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8838105">https://udn.com/news/story/7266/8838105</a>

Wu De-rong, a professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, said today that a tropical storm might form east of the Philippines this week. This is based on the latest forecast from Europe's weather model (ECMWF). The model shows that two small tropical storms could form near Guam and south of Okinawa later in the week. However, both are expected to move northeast and away from Taiwan.

Wu De-rong also looked at the European ensemble model (ECMWF) for Saturday, July 5th. It shows a low chance of a tropical storm from the sea southeast of Japan to near Taiwan. This means the model is not very sure about the exact location. The highest chance (50%) for a storm is focused on the area east of Okinawa and southeast of Japan, which means it is less likely to affect Taiwan. The latest American model (GEFS) also shows different paths, like scattered flowers. Wu De-rong said we should keep watching as these models might change.

For the coming days, Wu De-rong said it will be sunny with some clouds in most areas, and the weather will be hot. In the afternoon, there might be short rain or thunderstorms in the mountains, and some nearby flat areas might also get heavy thunderstorms with lightning, strong winds, and sudden heavy rain. People should check the latest weather warnings from the weather agency. Today's temperatures will be 24 to 37 degrees Celsius in the north, 23 to 37 in the central and southern parts, and 22 to 36 in the east.

Wu De-rong added that the latest model shows less moisture from tomorrow until Saturday. Most areas will be sunny, with only a small chance of short rain or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon. The weather will be like summer, with strong UV rays, so people should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. Tomorrow, Tuesday, and Friday, some areas might even reach this year's highest temperatures.

**Double Sixth Festival and Tiger God's Birthday! Sun Your Seals at This Time for Good Luck, One Big Taboo Can Bring Bad Luck**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7268/8838095">https://udn.com/news/story/7268/8838095</a>

June 30th (Monday) is the sixth day of the sixth lunar month, which is the "Double Sixth Festival" and also the birthday of the Tiger God. Folk expert Liao Da-yi said that on this day, the Jade Emperor comes down to inspect the world, making it the best time to ask for more money and good fortune. People can sun their seals during the day to improve their wealth. Also, on the Tiger God's birthday, you can pray to the Tiger God to change your luck and avoid bad people. However, a big no-no on this day is scolding others, as it could bring bad luck to yourself.

Liao Da-yi explained that the Double Sixth Festival is when the heavenly gates open and the Jade Emperor comes down to bless people. It's also the birthday of the Tiger God, who is known as the "General of the Lower Altar." This year is a special "leap sixth month" in the Year of the Snake. Since the snake is the sixth animal in the Chinese zodiac and "six" sounds like "smooth" in Taiwanese, the Double Sixth Festival on the sixth day of the sixth month means "everything goes smoothly." This makes it a very powerful day for seeking wealth and changing bad luck.

If you feel like you've lost money or your business hasn't been doing well in the first half of the year, you can "sun your seals" between 7 AM and 1 PM on the Double Sixth Festival. Place your company seals or personal seals with the engraved side facing up, pointing east, and let them sunbathe for 15 minutes. Remember to put your hands together and tell the Jade Emperor your wishes for stronger good luck.

If you want to receive even more positive energy, you can also stand in the sun for 15 minutes without a hat, in addition to sunning your seals. To avoid heatstroke, it's best to do this between 7 AM and 9 AM. Also, since the Jade Emperor is visiting, it's very important to control your temper and not speak badly to others. Doing so could harm your own luck.

Liao Da-yi also mentioned that because the sixth day of the sixth lunar month is the Tiger God's birthday, and the Tiger God can ward off evil, attract wealth, and protect homes, people can offer duck eggs and raw pork when praying to the Tiger God. Sincerely wish the Tiger God a happy birthday and ask for protection from bad people, and for help in finding good people and changing your luck. Don't forget to exchange some small change with the Tiger God for "money water" to increase your wealth.

Furthermore, Liao Da-yi said that if people want help from the Jade Emperor or other gods, they must first work hard themselves, as "heaven helps those who help themselves." You need to build a good foundation to succeed. And remember, "you must give to receive." On this day, you can gain good karma by donating blood or money, which will attract positive energy and help your prayers for a smooth and successful second half of the year.

**114th Departmental Exam Push / Large Recall, Nuclear Power May Appear in Civics Exam; Learn to Refine Answers to 15 Characters for Key Questions**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/124514/8838092">https://udn.com/news/story/124514/8838092</a>

The 114th academic year departmental exams will take place on July 11th and 12th. UDN is publishing a series of reports to help students review key points before the exams.

Civics questions often connect to current events. Lee Chia-hong, a civics and social studies teacher at Taichung Municipal Wenhua Senior High School, said that students should pay close attention to the recent large recall movements in the Legislative Yuan. This includes related election and recall systems, as well as Taiwan's government structure. In the departmental exams, mixed questions (written answers) are crucial for getting good scores. Long answer questions and questions that require understanding charts are especially important. Before the exam, students should practice describing specialized terms in law, economics, and politics in 10 to 15 characters. This will help them write precise answers for the written questions.

Lee Chia-hong noted that while the civics departmental exam covers material from high school years one to three, volumes one to five, past exams show that almost 50% of the questions come from the elective volumes (upper and lower). So, in the final push, students should focus on the elective content first, and then review the high school year one and two material covered in the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT) to make sure they don't miss important points.

Lee Chia-hong explained that the civics elective courses in the upper and lower volumes go deeper into civics topics. Key areas often include Chinese political systems, Chinese economic development in politics, and monetary policy and fiscal policy in economics. In law, important topics are the constitutional interpretation system, civil law, and criminal law. He advises students to review the elective content first, then combine it with the GSAT review, organizing it by topic. For example, when reviewing civil law in the elective course, students should also review the civil law content from the GSAT to build a complete understanding.

Current events are also very important for the departmental exam. Lee Chia-hong analyzed possible current event questions in civics from three main areas: politics, economics, and international affairs.

For economics questions, besides traditional important concepts like supply and demand, government intervention, and national income accounts, students need to connect recent global events like the trade war started by Trump and US tariffs to international trade and WTO issues in economics. The expansion of TSMC's investment in the US, which came from the trade war, and its impact on cross-strait relations and the global economy, also need special attention. Basic concepts of monetary policy and fiscal policy, as well as inflation and deflation, are also frequently tested.

Regarding politics questions, Lee Chia-hong believes that students must pay attention to the large recall movements resulting from conflicts between the two main political parties in the Legislative Yuan. This includes related election and recall systems and Taiwan's government structure. The case of a Chinese internet celebrity being expelled for "unification by force" statements can be linked to questions about the limits of freedom of speech and balancing rights in the constitution. The fact that Taiwan's nuclear power has officially been reduced to zero can be linked to referendums and related topics.

Hot topics in international affairs include the war between Israel and Iran, and the impeachment and new presidential election in South Korea after President Yoon Suk-yeol declared sudden martial law. Lee Chia-hong suggested that since South Korea's government system has some similarities with Taiwan's, students should pay attention to these comparisons.`;
