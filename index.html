            <h1>Tainan Police Stop Fake Virtual Currency Investment Scam, Seize Over NT$10 Million, Arrest 16 People</h1>
            <p>The Shanhua Branch of the Tainan City Police Department announced today that they have stopped a group of people who were running a fake virtual currency investment scam. They arrested 16 people and took over 10 million NT dollars in cash and Tether (a type of virtual currency). The arrested people have been sent to court.</p>
            <p>The Shanhua Branch said today that the police learned about people being tricked by fake virtual currency investments. After investigating and gathering evidence, police teams searched and arrested people in New Taipei City, Tainan City, and other areas. They arrested 16 people in total.</p>
            <p>The police also took about 7 million NT dollars in cash and more than 100,000 Tether. The total value of what they took is over 10 million NT dollars. They also seized phones and fax machines used in the scam.</p>
            <p>The police stated that investing in virtual currency has become popular in recent years. Scam groups not only told victims to invest in stocks, but also said that "virtual currency has high leverage and can bring big profits quickly." They even worked with bad virtual currency businesses to trick people into buying virtual currency with their money. When people could not take out their profits, they realized they were scammed. People should be very careful about fake investment scams.</p>

            <h1>TikTok's US Business May Go to an Investor Group; Oracle and Others to Own Over 80%</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people who know about the matter, that TikTok's business in the United States will be controlled by a group of investors. This is part of an agreement between the US and China that is almost finished. The investors include Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal said that sources told them about the agreement. It was discussed by US and Chinese representatives this week in Madrid. A new US company will be created to run TikTok's US business. US investors will own about 80% of the company, and Chinese investors will own about 20%.</p>
            <p>The new company's board of directors will mostly have American members. One person on the board will be chosen by the US government.</p>
            <p>The talks about TikTok are just one part of the difficult trade discussions between the US and China. Both sides also need to deal with other hard issues, such as the future of Nvidia's exports to China. Politicians from both main US parties are worried about TikTok's security. This is because many young Americans use the app.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal also reported, citing sources, that current TikTok users in the US will need to move to a special US app that TikTok is already making and testing. This new app will be built again by TikTok's engineering team. It will use technology from its parent company, ByteDance, to create the recommendation algorithm for content.</p>
            <p>Oracle, a big US tech company, is a long-time partner of TikTok. It will manage user data in Texas. Silver Lake, a private equity firm, and Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm, are well-known investors in technology.</p>
            <p>The details of the plan are still being discussed and may change. US President Donald Trump signed a new order today. It extends the deadline for TikTok until December 16. This is the fourth time he has done this.</p>
            <p>ByteDance's current owners, including Susquehanna International Group, KKR, and General Atlantic, will also be owners in the new company. Together, they will own about 80% of the shares. The amount owned by Chinese investors will be less than 20%. This is to follow a US law passed last year. That law requires ByteDance to sell TikTok's assets in the US, or TikTok will be banned in the US.</p>
            <p>Officials from both the US and China will carefully check the details of this deal. They are still concerned about possible national security risks.</p>

            <h1>AIDC Teams Up with Thunder Tiger to Develop Medium-to-Large Drones</h1>
            <p>AIDC announced today that it is officially working with Thunder Tiger Technology. They will both put effort into developing the new generation T-400 medium-to-large unmanned helicopter. This will make Taiwan's drone supply chain more independent. The work, from development to making many units, will all be done in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Thunder Tiger's T-400 is a medium-to-large unmanned helicopter. Its main rotor is 4 meters wide. It can be used for defense spying, carrying goods over long distances, looking for fish far out at sea, and checking offshore wind turbines. This drone will meet needs for both defense and public use.</p>
            <p>AIDC pointed out that Thunder Tiger is leading the design, manufacturing, and assembly of the T-400. AIDC will help quickly with important issues during development. These issues include looking at the aircraft's body structure, reducing vibrations, and managing heat. This will make sure the product works very well and is very reliable. Both companies will work together to make the design better, improve performance, and create all functions. This will make the drone's performance as good as similar medium-to-large unmanned helicopters in Europe and America.</p>
            <p>AIDC stated that the company has been in aircraft manufacturing for many years. It has a lot of experience in research, production, testing, and combining different systems. Thunder Tiger has skills in drone design and testing. In recent years, it has actively worked on developing medium-to-large unmanned vehicles and has achieved good results. Both companies are part of the Taiwan Excellent Drone International Business Opportunity Alliance (TEDIBOA). This partnership will bring together the strengths of both companies and add to their power. It will make Taiwan's drone supply chain more independent, from development to mass production, all rooted in Taiwan. This will create a "resilient" drone industry.</p>
            <p>AIDC stressed that the partnership is now at the prototype stage. AIDC is using all its main skills to help Thunder Tiger develop faster. It is also planning a system for making many units by itself. This will make sure the quality of future products and the supply chain are stable. This will help them get market chances in the future.</p>
