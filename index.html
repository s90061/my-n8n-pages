            <h1>People look at the second half of Taiwan stocks. Cathay Financial Holdings: Nearly half predict a high point of over 24,000 points.</h1>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings released a survey on national economic confidence in July. The survey asked people about their ideas for the highest and lowest points of the Taiwan stock market in the second half of the year. The survey showed that 47% of people think the Taiwan stock market will go higher than 24,000 points in the second half of this year. Also, 52% of people think the lowest point of the Taiwan stock market in the second half will be below 20,000 points.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings released its July National Economic Confidence Survey today. The survey showed that people are still feeling more positive about the economy, and they are more willing to buy expensive things. The index for buying expensive things went up to 2. The index for buying long-lasting goods stayed the same at negative 19.6. The desire to buy a house went down a little to negative 47.6, and the desire to sell a house also went down to negative 29.4.</p>
            <p>The survey showed that there is less uncertainty about government rules. International stock markets are going up and down, but they are generally going up. People feel more positive about the Taiwan stock market for a short time. The optimism index for Taiwan stocks went up to 4.9, and the risk preference index became better at 5.5.</p>
            <p>For the special question, the survey asked people what they expect for the highest and lowest points of the Taiwan stock market index in the second half of this year. The survey showed that 31% of people think the highest point for Taiwan stocks in the second half will be between 23,000 and 24,000 points. Next, 22% of people think the highest point will be below 23,000 points. Only 14% of people expect the highest point to be over 26,000 points. Overall, 47% of people believe the highest point for Taiwan stocks in the second half will be over 24,000 points.</p>
            <p>As for the lowest point, the survey showed that 32% of people think the Taiwan stock index will go below 19,000 points in the second half. Next, 22% of people think the lowest point will be between 20,000 and 21,000 points. 20% of people expect the lowest point to be between 19,000 and 20,000 points. In total, 52% of people think the lowest point for Taiwan stocks will be below 20,000 points.</p>
            <p>For the overall economy, the government statistics office estimated in May that Taiwan's economy will grow by 3.1% in 2025, and inflation will be 1.88%. The survey showed that 64% of people think economic growth this year will be less than 3%, and 62% think inflation this year will be more than 2%. In general, people expect the economy to grow less than the government office predicts for 2025, and they expect prices to rise more.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings said that the survey was done from July 1st to 7th. They sent emails with questions to members of Cathay Life Insurance's official website and clients of Cathay United Bank. They received 11,439 good answers.</p>

            <h1>China's housing market problems cause a chain effect: A big decoration company in Guangzhou closes down.</h1>
            <p>According to news, a big home decoration company in Guangzhou called "Liang Jia Ju" has gone out of business. This happened because of problems in China's housing market. The company had over a hundred stores. It suddenly closed last week because it had more debt than money. The company's owner also fell from a building and died.</p>
            <p>The Sing Tao Daily reported today, sharing what mainland Chinese media said. Last Friday, a notice about closing the business was shared online in mainland China. The notice said that "Liang Jia Ju" had been losing money for a long time because of the real estate industry's problems. It had more debts than money and could not continue to operate. So, the company decided to close down starting that day.</p>
            <p>Videos online showed that many customers and suppliers went to "Liang Jia Ju" stores last week to complain. Some people also called the police for help.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the police confirmed that Zeng Yu-zhou, who started "Liang Jia Ju," fell from a building in Guangzhou's Tianhe district and died early on July 17. The first investigation shows that this event was related to "personal reasons."</p>
            <p>The report shared information from mainland Chinese media. "Liang Jia Ju" was started in 2001. Its main office is in Guangzhou, and its stores are in big shopping centers in southern China.</p>
            <p>Zeng Yu-zhou was known as the "decoration principal" in the home decoration industry. He used to be a member of the 10th Guangzhou Political Consultative Conference, a regular member of the Guangzhou Federation of Industry and Commerce, a vice president of the Guangdong Chain Association, an honorary president of the Guangdong Home Building Materials Chamber of Commerce, a vice president of the Guangdong Building Decoration Materials Association, and an executive president of the Guangdong Home Chamber of Commerce.</p>
            <p>Some Chinese internet users said that Zeng Yu-zhou had a lot of influence in the building decoration industry. His death and the closing of "Liang Jia Ju" "show that an era has ended. The bad general situation and the fall after the real estate market grew too much means many people will also suffer."</p>

            <h1>The two biggest ETFs, 0050 and 0056, give out dividends. Their prices go up and down.</h1>
            <p>The two biggest Taiwan stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by total money, Yuanta Taiwan 50 (0050) and Yuanta High Dividend (0056), both gave out dividends today. In the morning, 0050's price went down after giving out dividends for a short time. 0056's price started higher and recovered some of the dividend amount.</p>
            <p>0050 gives out dividends twice a year. Today, it gave out NT$0.36 for each share. This is the first time 0050 has given out dividends since it was split and listed again in mid-June, so many people are watching it closely.</p>
            <p>0050 is an ETF that follows the market value. As TSMC's stock price went up a lot and then rested, 0050's price was below its starting point this morning, showing a temporary drop after dividends were given. However, after TSMC's positive news conference last week, its stock price had already gone up a lot. 0050's price also went over NT$50 last week, which was the highest price since it was split. Last Friday, it closed at NT$51.45. Compared to its price of NT$47.16 when it was listed again on June 18, it has gone up more than 9% in less than a month.</p>
            <p>0056, which gives out dividends every three months, also gave out dividends today. It gave out NT$0.866 for each share. This is lower than the NT$1.07 it gave out each quarter in the past four quarters. This is the first time the dividend has been lowered in about one and a half years.</p>
            <p>0056's stock price started higher this morning, reaching a high of NT$34.89, which is up NT$0.16. It has recovered about 18% of the dividend amount.</p>
            <p>0050 and 0056 are currently the top two Taiwan stock ETFs in terms of total money. According to information from the Taiwan Stock Exchange, there are currently four Taiwan stock ETFs with over NT$400 billion in total money. 0050 is first with NT$664.4 billion. 0056 is second with NT$478.3 billion. Cathay Sustainable High Dividend (00878) is close behind with NT$447.3 billion, and Fubon Taiwan Select High Dividend (00919) is also close with NT$410.2 billion.</p>
