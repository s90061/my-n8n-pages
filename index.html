The US economy is currently strong, with rising stock markets, stable prices, and low unemployment. President Trumpâ€™s big tax cuts are also expected to help businesses and the economy grow.

However, experts are starting to see potential problems. The US economy shrank a bit earlier this year because more goods were imported and people spent less money. Also, Trumpâ€™s taxes on goods from other countries are a big worry, especially if no agreements are made by July 9.

In addition, strict rules on immigration could lead to fewer workers in some important jobs, which might make wages go up. If Trump decides to put higher taxes on imported goods again, some experts believe the US economy could face a difficult time later in the year.

**Police Arrest Mastermind in Colombian Candidate Shooting**

Police in Colombia have arrested another person involved in the shooting of presidential candidate Miguel Uribe. This man, Elder Jose Arteaga Hernandez, is believed to have hired a 15-year-old to carry out the attack.

Miguel Uribe was shot three times on June 7 during a campaign event in Bogota, the capital city. Two of the shots hit his head, and he is still in the hospital with serious injuries. Police say Arteaga Hernandez planned everything about the attack.

So far, five people have been arrested in the case, including the young shooter. The teenage boy told police he was paid more than US$4800 (about NT$140,000) by a local drug dealer to shoot Uribe.

**Typhoon Danas Approaches Taiwan, Heavy Impact Expected Today**

Taiwan's weather agency has issued warnings for Tropical Storm Danas, covering both sea and land areas. The typhoon is expected to move north, passing west of Taiwan through the Taiwan Strait. Today, July 6th, will be the most impactful day for the island.

The land warning has been expanded to 15 counties and cities, including Hsinchu and Miaoli. Heavy rain warnings are also in effect for 19 regions. Due to the typhoon, schools and offices are closed today in several southern cities like Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung.

All domestic flights for July 6th have been cancelled, and some public transport and events have been changed. Even the first day of a major government exam has been postponed. People are buying more vegetables, causing prices in Taipei markets to rise by 17%.
