            <h1>German Chancellor Says Meeting Between Putin and Zelenskyy Unlikely, Calls Russia's Kyiv Attack "True Face"</h1>
            <p>Germany's Chancellor Merz said today that a hoped-for meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy "clearly" will not happen now.</p>
            <p>Merz, standing next to French President Emmanuel Macron, told reporters that the cabinets of Germany and France will talk about the war in Ukraine. This is "because Zelenskyy and Putin clearly will not meet, which is different from what US President Trump and Putin agreed on last week in Washington."</p>
            <p>Merz also said that Russia "showed its true face" in its recent night attack on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. This attack caused at least 17 deaths.</p>
            <p>Merz wrote on social media platform X that the European Union (EU) office building in Kyiv was also damaged in this attack. He said this "shows that the Russian government is becoming more and more reckless."</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Player Sung Chia-hao Returns to First Team After Knee Surgery</h1>
            <p>Sung Chia-hao, a Taiwanese pitcher for Japan's Rakuten Golden Eagles baseball team, was moved to the top team today. He had surgery on his right knee before this season. He started playing practice games in the second team on August 23rd. He has not played in the top team this season yet. Today, Rakuten will play against the Nippon-Ham Fighters, and Sung might play his first game.</p>
            <p>Sung Chia-hao had surgery on the outer meniscus of his right knee before this season. Because of this, he could not start playing at the beginning of the season. Doctors thought it would take 6 months for him to return. On August 23rd, he played his first practice game in the second team. He pitched for 0.1 innings, giving up 2 runs (1 earned run). His fastest pitch was 151 kilometers per hour. Then, on August 26th, he pitched for 1 inning in relief in the second team, getting three outs with no runs given up. His fastest pitch was 149 kilometers per hour.</p>
            <p>The Rakuten Golden Eagles team changed their player list today. They moved pitcher Sung Chia-hao and infielder Koutaro Komori to the top team. They also sent pitcher Tomohiro Matsui to the second team. The Rakuten Golden Eagles will play against the Nippon-Ham Fighters in Hokkaido today. Sung Chia-hao might play his first game in the top team this season.</p>
            <p>Last year, Sung Chia-hao played 41 games in Japan's top league, pitching 39.2 innings. He won 1 game, lost 2, and had 17 holds. He also struck out 22 batters, and his ERA was 3.18. In his career in Japan's top league, he has played 338 games and has 120 holds.</p>

            <h1>Silergy Expects Less Than 20% Revenue Growth This Year Due to Weaker Customer Demand</h1>
            <p>Chen Wei, the chairman of Silergy-KY, a company that makes power management chips, said today that their income this year will likely be more than last year. However, customers are not buying as much as expected. So, the growth might not reach 20%.</p>
            <p>Silergy-KY held an online meeting for investors this afternoon. Chen Wei said that the company's performance in the third quarter will be similar to or a little better than the second quarter, just like in previous years. Things like new energy, cars, and servers, optical modules, and storage for AI data centers will have more demand than in the first half of the year.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei also said that the demand for power management chips is improving after a difficult time. However, the trade war has made the market weaker, and customers are being careful with their production. This means demand is lower than expected. This could stop the company's income growth from reaching 20% this year.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei noted that how their sales are spread across different markets in the third quarter should not change much. Sales prices are stable. He expects the gross profit margin to be between 52% and 54%.</p>
            <p>Chen Wei said that even though customers have urgent orders now, there is still a lot of uncertainty. Silergy-KY does not plan to raise product prices like other companies. Instead, they will try to get a bigger share of the market.</p>
            <p>Regarding progress in AI servers, Chen Wei stated that Silergy-KY has made progress in special chips called ASICs. But customers are still getting ready to produce them in large amounts. So, these products will only contribute a small amount to this year's income. He expects them to contribute about 5% of the income next year.</p>
