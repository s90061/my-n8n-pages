            <h1>Boy Rescued in Mountain Accident; Grandfather and Female Hiker Pass Away</h1>
            <p>Today, a mountain accident happened in Kalakolakan Mountain, Xinyi Township, Nantou County. A 70-year-old man and a 63-year-old woman mountain climber were rescued and brought down the mountain, but they showed no signs of life. An 8-year-old boy, who was with them, had signs of hypothermia, but his condition was stable. He is now in the hospital for treatment and observation.</p>
            <p>At noon today, the Nantou County Fire Department received a call. The 8-year-old boy, his grandfather, and another female hiker started their climb on August 8th from Hualien County. They planned to hike the Southern Three Peaks and come down on August 17th from Dongpu, Xinyi Township, Nantou County. During their trip, they faced a typhoon and were exposed to cold for a long time. It seemed they became too weak. The Fire Department believed the hikers were in danger and the place was far away, so they immediately asked for a helicopter to help.</p>
            <p>The National Airborne Service Corps sent a helicopter, and it arrived at Kalakolakan Mountain in the afternoon. The helicopter landed to help the old man, the female hiker, and the boy get down the mountain. After that, they were taken to the hospital by ambulance. However, the old man and the female hiker showed no signs of life before reaching the hospital and sadly passed away despite rescue efforts. The boy had signs of hypothermia, but his condition was stable. The details of what happened still need to be checked.</p>
            <p>The Fire Department asks people to be very careful because mountain weather can change quickly. It is important to prepare well before going. They suggest that you should think about your own ability and not try to climb routes that are too difficult for you. Also, carry a satellite communication device. This can help you quickly share your location in an emergency, which saves important rescue time.</p>

            <h1>Famous Chef Andr√©s Visits Gaza, Leads World Central Kitchen to Give One Million Meals Daily</h1>
            <p>Madrid, August 16th ‚Äì Chef Jos√© Andr√©s, a famous Spanish-born chef, recently went to Gaza. He visited his food aid organization, "World Central Kitchen," to support his team. He asked for more help to reach a goal of providing one million meals every day. This is to quickly solve the hunger problem in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s, who is 56 years old, was born in northern Spain. He built a successful food business in the United States. In 2010, after the big earthquake in Haiti, he started World Central Kitchen (WCK). Its main office is in Washington, D.C. The group focuses on helping people who are hungry because of natural disasters or wars. They give food to people in affected areas and war zones, especially fresh, hot meals. Since the conflict between Israel and Palestine started, World Central Kitchen has given over 145 million meals to people in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Providing help in Gaza is very hard and has many rules. In April 2024, seven workers from WCK were killed in an attack by the Israeli army, which stopped their help for a short time. However, World Central Kitchen continues to send food by land, sea, and air. They have built four large temporary kitchens in southern and central Gaza. They have also created a network of community kitchens led by Palestinians. With the help of local groups, they have expanded food delivery to northern Gaza.</p>
            <p>World Central Kitchen said that they currently provide about 200,000 meals in Gaza every day. But this year, they are cooking much less food because food supplies are often stopped or limited.</p>
            <p>According to El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper, Jos√© Andr√©s, the founder of World Central Kitchen, visited Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on August 14th. He visited the temporary kitchens that WCK built there. He went to encourage the local team and volunteers who help people.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s asked for much more help for Palestinians. He promised to work hard to quickly make more food. His goal is to increase the daily number of meals to one million, which is more than ever before. This is to stop the hunger problem in Gaza from getting worse.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s also visited a bakery and two aid centers. He saw how the local teams still tried hard to cook meals, even though hunger was spreading and there was not enough help.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s wrote on Instagram that his feelings were hard to explain. He said, "How can we feel so much passion and joy to feed people, but also feel so much pain from seeing hunger?"</p>
            <p>He asked for more support. He said that because of this, World Central Kitchen must become bigger. Providing one million meals daily means: five large temporary kitchens, 100 community kitchens and bakeries, over 100 trucks for supplies, a steady supply of fuel and food, safe land routes for transport, and clean drinking water.</p>
            <p>He said, "Gaza is almost starving. The world should not look away."</p>
            <p>Besides Gaza, Andr√©s also visited Israel. He went to the place where the Nova Festival was attacked by Hamas. He paid his respects to the victims and their families there.</p>
            <p>The war between Israel and Palestine started on October 7, 2023. On that day, Hamas attacked southern Israel. About 1,200 people died, and 251 people were taken hostage. After this, Israel started a large attack on the Gaza Strip, which is controlled by Hamas. Israel promised to destroy Hamas. According to the Gaza Health Ministry, more than 60,000 Palestinians have died in this war so far.</p>
            <p>During his visit, Andr√©s also said that "World Central Kitchen stands with humanity, providing food to people." He asked for people to show kindness and care for both Palestinians and Israelis. He also begged for "the release of Israeli hostages, a ceasefire to end the war, and an end to all cruelty and suffering."</p>
