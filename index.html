            <h1>Woman Walking Dog Without Leash Causes Accident; Motorcyclist Falls and Gets Hurt in Taoyuan</h1>
            <p>The Guishan Police Station in Taoyuan City announced today that on the night of October 9th, a woman named Zhan was walking her dog. She did not use a leash for her dog. The dog suddenly ran into the road, causing a motorcyclist, Mr. Liu, to fall. Police and emergency services arrived to help. Mr. Liu had not been drinking alcohol and suffered several scrapes, but his life was not in danger. Both parties will discuss how to pay for the damages.</p>
            <p>The Guishan Police Station in Taoyuan City reported that at 11:41 PM on October 9th, an 18-year-old motorcyclist, Mr. Liu, was riding his regular motorcycle straight on Guangrong Road in Guishan District. Suddenly, a dog ran across the road. Mr. Liu quickly braked to avoid hitting the dog, which made him and his motorcycle fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>The Guishan Police Station stated that when police arrived, they quickly helped Mr. Liu with his injuries. Police tested him for alcohol, and the result was 0. Emergency workers checked him and found he had many scrapes, but his life was not in danger. After looking into the accident, they found that Ms. Zhan was walking her dog late at night without a leash. This caused the dog to run wildly in the road and caused the accident. The Guishan Police Station will handle the case according to the law.</p>
            <p>The Guishan Police Station said that the motorcyclist has not yet filed a complaint about injuries. Both sides are still talking about how to pay for the damages from the accident. The police ask everyone to use a leash when walking their dogs outside. This will stop dogs from getting scared and running around, which can cause traffic accidents.</p>

            <h1>"Tide Style Lukang" Music Festival Attracts Large Crowds; Changhua County Government Asks People to Use Shuttle Buses</h1>
            <p>The Changhua County Government is holding the "Taiwan Design Expo." As part of this event, the "Tide Style Lukang" music festival is happening today and tomorrow in Lukang Township. Many music fans are expected to come. The county government is asking everyone to use the shuttle buses more often. They have also asked bus companies to add more buses so visitors don't have to wait a long time.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Design Expo" started yesterday and will continue until October 26th. The Changhua County Government's Department of Transportation released a press release today. It said that on the first day, including trial runs, over 440,000 people visited the three main exhibition areas. Many people said there were not enough shuttle buses. The county government quickly contacted the bus companies to fix this problem. They added more buses for transportation and improved their planning to prevent visitors from waiting too long.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation said that the best way to visit the Taiwan Design Expo is to download the "Changhua Go APP." This app has complete information about transportation. It also tells people to use special shuttle buses and public transport to get to each exhibition area. This helps to reduce traffic jams in the city. For the "Changhua Exhibition Area," people can park at the Taihua shuttle bus stop parking lot and then take a shuttle bus. For the "Changnan Exhibition Area," people can park at the Yixinyuan parking lot or the parking lot behind the exhibition center. From there, they can walk or take a shuttle bus to the exhibition areas easily.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation stated that the "Tide Style Lukang" music festival is being held today and tomorrow at the Lukang Stadium. Popular artists like Crowd Lu, 911, Amazer, Mixer, and TRASH are performing. Many music fans are expected to come to Lukang. The department also asks people to use the shuttle buses to avoid crowded roads and enjoy the "Tide Style Lukang" and the exhibition halls.</p>

            <h1>CPBL Post-season Challenge Series: Rakuten Monkeys Change Batting Order, Hope Song Chia-hsiang and Pedro Fernandez Play Well Again</h1>
            <p>The Chinese Professional Baseball League's Rakuten Monkeys team is playing an important game in the post-season challenge series today. They have changed their batting order. Head coach Koo Kim-boon-yee said, "This should be our best lineup right now." The starting pitcher, Pedro Fernandez, will play with young catcher Song Chia-hsiang. They hope to do as well as they did in the regular season.</p>
            <p>Pedro Fernandez was the best pitcher for wins and strikeouts in the CPBL this year. He is trying to keep the series going.</p>
            <p>Koo Kim-boon-yee said that he hopes Song Chia-hsiang plays with the same feeling as he did in the regular season. He should not try to do more than he can. Song Chia-hsiang and Pedro Fernandez worked well together in the second half of the season, and the coaching staff saw good things from them.</p>
            <p>The CPBL post-season challenge series has a "best of three wins" format. The Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions, who won the first half of the season, already have one win. They won the first game yesterday and are now close to winning the series. The second game will be tonight at the Monkeys' home stadium, Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. All 18,000 tickets were sold out before the game, so there will be a full crowd.</p>
            <p>The Monkeys have to win this game, so they changed their batting order. Chen Chen-wei (left fielder) will be the first batter. Cheng Chin, who was the ninth batter and center fielder yesterday, will be the second batter today. The main batters will be Lin Li (right fielder), Lin Hung-yu (designated hitter), and Liang Chia-jung (third base). Lin Tzu-wei (second base) will start as the sixth batter. Lin Cheng-fei will be the seventh batter (shortstop). Song Chia-hsiang will be the eighth batter, and Yu Te-lung will play first base as the ninth batter.</p>
            <p>Koo Kim-boon-yee said he had been thinking about the batting order since yesterday. He believes this starting lineup is the best the team can do right now.</p>
