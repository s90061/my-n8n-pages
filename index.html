            <h1>Zelenskyy: Ukraine Plans to Sell Drones to USA, Buy Weapons from USA; Talking with Trump</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy told the "New York Post" that he and US President Trump are thinking about a deal. In this deal, the US would buy drones from Ukraine, and Ukraine would buy weapons from the US.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that his recent talks with Trump were about an agreement. This agreement would help both countries make their air technology stronger.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ukraine's drones have been tested in war. They can travel up to 1300 kilometers into Russia and hit targets.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy spoke to the "New York Post" on July 16. He said, "Americans need this technology. You need to have it in your military supplies."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy stated that drones are a very important weapon. They have helped Ukraine defend itself from Russia's invasion for more than three years.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy noted, "We are ready to share this experience with our partners in the US and Europe." He also said that Ukraine is talking about this with Denmark, Norway, and Germany.</p>

            <h1>Bali District Office Says No Anti-Recall Flyers Were Put Inside Recall Notices</h1>
            <p>People in Bali District, New Taipei City, said that recall notices had flyers against the recall inside them. The Bali District Office said late tonight that checks showed this was not true. They said it might be a misunderstanding because other groups were giving out flyers at a similar time. The office also said it acts fairly in politics.</p>
            <p>Cheng Yu-en, a New Taipei City council member from the Democratic Progressive Party, wrote on Facebook tonight. She said a person from Pitou Village in Bali District complained. They received a recall notice with a flyer from Legislator Hung Meng-kai of the Kuomintang party, which was against the recall.</p>
            <p>Lin Chao-chieh, the head of Bali District, spoke to CNA. He said he watched the office staff put together the recall notices and voting papers. He said, "There were definitely no anti-recall flyers put inside."</p>
            <p>Lin Chao-chieh also said that the head of Pitou Village picked up the notices at 2:30 PM today. They started giving them out around 3:00 PM. He understood that volunteers for Hung Meng-kai gathered at a local temple around 4:00 PM to give out their flyers. This might have caused the confusion.</p>
            <p>Hung Meng-kai said that it is normal to give out flyers to get public support before an election, especially at an important time, to promote against the recall. He said that volunteers walked house to house to deliver all the flyers in that area.</p>
            <p>The Bali District Office released a statement late tonight. They said that after checking with village heads, neighborhood heads, and community leaders, there were no flyers put inside. Also, recently, different villages have been sending out voting notices. If groups who support or oppose the recall give out flyers at the same time as the village and neighborhood heads, then voting notices and flyers might appear in mailboxes together. They asked people not to make a big deal out of it on purpose.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Bali District Office stated that it will always be fair in politics. They said that voting notices will never have flyers put inside or attached.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Election Commission said that the Election Commission and all election staff in New Taipei City will always be fair. If there is clear evidence of wrongdoing, they will definitely investigate it carefully.</p>
