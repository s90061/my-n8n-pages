Netflix has started sending emails to subscribers in the United States who are sharing their accounts with people outside their households. This marks the streaming giant's latest attempt to boost revenue by tackling widespread password sharing.

The company estimates that over 100 million households are using shared passwords, impacting its ability to invest in new content and improve its service. Subscribers are now being offered the option to add "extra members" to their accounts for an additional monthly fee.

Alternatively, users can transfer their profiles to a new, separate account. Netflix hopes these measures will encourage more people to pay for their own subscriptions, ultimately increasing its profits in the competitive streaming market. This follows similar crackdowns in other countries, with varying degrees of success. How this change impacts customer satisfaction remains to be seen.

**Electric Vehicle Sales Surge Globally, Challenging Traditional Automakers**

The global market for electric vehicles (EVs) is experiencing rapid growth, putting pressure on established car manufacturers to adapt. Sales of EVs have increased dramatically in the past year, driven by factors such as government incentives, growing environmental awareness, and improvements in battery technology.

China remains the largest EV market, followed by Europe and the United States. Tesla continues to dominate the EV landscape, but traditional automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, and Ford are investing heavily in EV production to catch up.

The transition to electric vehicles presents both opportunities and challenges. Automakers must invest billions in new manufacturing facilities and battery production. The availability of charging infrastructure and the cost of batteries remain key barriers to wider adoption. Despite these challenges, the future of the automotive industry appears to be electric.

**Iceland's Tourism Sector Rebounds After Pandemic Slump**

Iceland's tourism industry is showing strong signs of recovery after being severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of international visitors to Iceland has increased significantly in recent months, approaching pre-pandemic levels.

This resurgence is attributed to the easing of travel restrictions, increased vaccination rates, and Iceland's reputation as a safe and desirable destination. The country offers stunning natural landscapes, including glaciers, volcanoes, and the Northern Lights, which attract tourists from all over the world.

While the recovery is welcomed by the tourism sector, there are also concerns about the impact of overtourism on the environment and local communities. Sustainable tourism practices are becoming increasingly important to ensure the long-term viability of Iceland's tourism industry.
