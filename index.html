            <h1>Central Election Commission: Nuclear Power Plant Referendum Cost NT$1.14 Billion, 31 Legislator Recall Cases Cost NT$400 Million</h1>
            <p>The Central Election Commission (CEC) announced today the costs for the 31 recall cases for legislators and one referendum to restart Nuclear Power Plant No. 3. These events took place on July 26 and August 23. Because the referendum and recall cases happened at similar times, they could save money. The referendum cost about NT$1.14 billion, and the 31 recall cases for legislators cost about NT$402.8 million.</p>
            <p>Today, August 23, recall votes for several Kuomintang (KMT) legislators were counted. These included Luo Ming-tsai, Lin Szu-ming, Yen Kuan-heng, Yang Chiung-ying, Chiang Chi-chen, Ma Wen-chun, and Yu Hao. All 32 recall attempts, which also included 24 KMT legislators and the suspended Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an on July 26, were rejected.</p>
            <p>Regarding the referendum to restart Nuclear Power Plant No. 3, there were 4,341,432 votes in favor. This was more than the 1,511,693 votes against. However, the "yes" votes did not reach the necessary 5,000,523 votes, which is 1/4 of all eligible voters. So, the referendum did not pass.</p>
            <p>The CEC explained that they had first thought each regional legislator recall case would cost about NT$16 million to NT$20 million. But because the referendum on August 23 and the recall elections on July 26 and August 23 overlapped, they were able to reduce costs.</p>
            <p>The CEC stated that the referendum to restart Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 used about NT$1.14 billion. The 24 legislator recall cases on July 26 cost about NT$345.8 million, and the 7 legislator recall cases on August 23 cost about NT$57 million.</p>
            <p>The CEC also said that the recall case for Kao Hung-an on July 26 cost about NT$31.01 million. According to the law, this money is part of the local government's budget. This means the Hsinchu City Government had to pay for this, not the central government.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang: We Will Continue to Work Together on Policies That Benefit the Nation, No Matter Who Becomes KMT Chairman</h1>
            <p>Today, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu asked Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to take over his role as party chairman. Tonight, Taiwan People's Party (TPP) Chairman Huang Kuo-chang said that no matter if Eric Chu, Lu Shiow-yen, or other good leaders become KMT chairman in the future, he hopes the KMT and TPP can continue to work together. This cooperation should be on policies and laws that help the country and its people, without focusing on party differences.</p>
            <p>Tonight, Huang Kuo-chang held a press conference with TPP officials. They discussed the results of the Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 restart referendum and the recall cases for seven KMT legislators.</p>
            <p>Regarding Eric Chu's request for Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen to become the KMT chairman, Huang Kuo-chang said he respects how other parties choose their leaders through their own democratic processes.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang stated that the TPP respects and wishes the best for whoever will become the next KMT chairman. He also believes that the KMT will follow its own rules to choose the best person.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the TPP hopes that in the future, no matter who leads the KMTâ€”whether it is Eric Chu, Lu Shiow-yen, or another talented personâ€”they can keep working together. They should focus on policies and laws that help the country and its people, moving forward without party disagreements.</p>
            <p>Tonight, President Lai Ching-te said that Premier Cho Jung-tai will stay in his job, but the government team will make "four changes." Huang Kuo-chang criticized this, saying that President Lai's words and actions are very different. For example, Premier Cho Jung-tai only presented the central government's budget for next year this week. This budget did not include more pay for volunteer soldiers or changes to police and firefighter pensions. Huang Kuo-chang said this shows no respect for laws that the Legislative Yuan has already passed. He asked, "How can this improve the way the government and lawmakers work together?"</p>
            <p>President Lai also said at the press conference that talks between different parties could be better. Huang Kuo-chang responded that Ker Chien-ming, the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the Legislative Yuan, made communication difficult during talks by speaking for a long time without saying much. Also, Kung Ming-hsin, the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, did not attend the Internal Affairs Committee meeting. Huang Kuo-chang questioned how these actions could improve how the government and lawmakers work together.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang also criticized that the DPP's political involvement in the legal system is very clear. Yet, President Lai still told the public that "politics has not affected the legal system." Huang Kuo-chang announced that the TPP will create an investigation committee in the Legislative Yuan next session, which will be their most important task.</p>

            <h1>Executive Yuan: Government Changes Starting Next Week to Make Policies More Effective</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te said today that he has asked Premier Cho Jung-tai many times to stay in his role. The President hopes they can work together to protect the country's important tasks. Tonight, the Executive Yuan announced that Premier Cho Jung-tai will make changes as President Lai has asked. These changes include making adjustments to the government team, changing the order of policies, improving how the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan work together, and making the country's finances stronger. Also, the Executive Yuan will start to change some government officials next week. This is to make sure policies feel more effective to the public.</p>
            <p>President Lai spoke tonight at the Presidential Office about the results of the Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 restart referendum and the seven recall cases for legislators. He also answered questions from reporters. He said that after the recall votes on July 26, Premier Cho Jung-tai offered to resign many times. But right now, trade talks between Taiwan and the United States are not finished, and recovery work after typhoons and heavy rain is still happening. Also, this year there is an extra budget and special budgets, and next year's central government budget is being looked at by the Legislative Yuan. Many important national policies also need to continue to be carried out smoothly. So, President Lai hopes that Cho Jung-tai will continue in his job and take on these big responsibilities to protect the country's key tasks.</p>
            <p>President Lai also said that to meet what people expect and to protect the country's key tasks, the ruling government team will make "four changes." These changes include adjusting the team, changing the order of policies, improving how the Executive Yuan and Legislative Yuan work together, and making the country's finances stronger. These changes will make the team work better and make policies feel more effective.</p>
            <p>Tonight, Lee Hui-chih, a spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, told media groups that after July 26, Cho Jung-tai told President Lai that he wanted to take political responsibility. He felt that the government needed big changes and faster, bigger reforms to meet what people expected. However, tasks like rebuilding after the typhoon and floods, dealing with trade talks with the US, and continuing to support industries, along with the extra budget for 2025, the special budget for the Daanas Typhoon and making the country more resilient, and next year's central government budget are all important current jobs for the Executive Yuan. All of these must be finished on time and sent to the Legislative Yuan to be reviewed. Today's national voting went well, and after it was done, President Lai should fully think about changes to government officials. This is to respond to what the public wants and to make reforms happen faster.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said that President Lai wants Cho Jung-tai to stay in his job and protect the country's important tasks. To keep the government stable and move the country forward, Cho Jung-tai has agreed to make the four changes that President Lai asked for. He will start changing government officials next week. In the future, the team will focus on the economy first, people's lives first, helping those who are disadvantaged first, and young people first. These will be their main tasks. The future team will work better and make policies feel more effective.</p>
