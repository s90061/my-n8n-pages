            <p>Taiwan Nichia announced today that Mr. Dai Chen-chia, who was a Managing Director, has been promoted. He is now an Executive Director. This makes him the highest-ranking Taiwanese manager in the Nichia group. Mr. Dai Chen-chia is now the third most important person at Taiwan Nichia, after the President and Vice President.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Nichia explained in a press release that the position of Executive Director is very important in Japanese companies. It is just below the President and Vice President.

            <h1>New Taipei Woman Beat Her Partner and Burned Her Face, Leading to Death; She Had Also Hurt Her 4 Years Ago</h1>
            <p>In February this year, a woman named Luo from New Taipei City used a billiard cue to hit her partner's head. She also used a lighter to burn her partner's face, causing her death. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office has charged Ms. Luo with causing death by injury. In court, Ms. Luo admitted to all the bad things she did. Investigations show that Ms. Luo had hurt the victim, Ms. Qiu, four years ago. This was not the first time she was violent.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo, who is 34 years old, and Ms. Qiu were partners. They lived together in a rented apartment in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei City. On February 4th this year, around 1 AM, Ms. Luo first pushed Ms. Qiu with her hands. Ms. Qiu fell and hit her head on the ground. After Ms. Qiu became unconscious, Ms. Luo moved her to the bed. While moving her, Ms. Qiu's head hit something again.</p>
            <p>Ms. Luo then used a billiard cue to hit Ms. Qiu's head and body. After that, she used a lighter to light tissue paper and other things that burn easily. She used the fire to burn Ms. Qiu's face, head, and shoulders. This caused a lot of bleeding at the back of Ms. Qiu's head and a broken bone (occipital bone) on the left side of her head. In the end, Ms. Qiu died from brain damage.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office recently charged Ms. Luo with causing death by injury. Yesterday, the New Taipei District Court held a hearing to prepare for the trial. Ms. Luo admitted to all the crimes mentioned above.</p>
            <p>Also, investigations showed that Ms. Luo had hurt Ms. Qiu many years ago. In February 2021, the two had an argument. Ms. Luo used a wine bottle and an ashtray to hit Ms. Qiu. She also grabbed Ms. Qiu's head and hit it against a wall. This caused injuries to Ms. Qiu's head. At that time, the prosecutor charged Ms. Luo with assault. However, the charges were dropped after both women reached an agreement.</p>
