            <h1>Japan's Upper House Election: LDP and Komeito Lose, Focus on Who Will Lead After Ishiba</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, July 20, Central News Agency) In Japan's Upper House election, the ruling parties, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, could not get more than half of the seats. The LDP now faces a difficult situation: it is a "minority ruling party" in both the Upper and Lower Houses. This is the first time in its 70-year history. The head of the LDP, Shigeru Ishiba, does not plan to step down. However, it will be hard for him to handle the intense political situation. People are watching closely to see who will take over after Ishiba.</p>
            <p>Today, Japan's Upper House election votes were counted. News reports based on exit polls suggest the LDP will get 33 seats. This might be even lower than its worst result ever, which was 36 seats in 1989. Komeito is expected to get 8 seats. Together, the ruling group will have 41 seats. This is much less than the number needed to have more than half the seats in the Upper House. It is also less than Prime Minister Ishiba's goal of 50 seats.</p>
            <p>The Japanese Upper House has 248 seats in total. Members serve for 6 years, and half of the seats are re-elected every 3 years, which means 124 seats. This election was to choose 125 seats: 74 from election districts, 50 from party lists, and 1 extra seat from Tokyo. If the LDP and Komeito did not win 50 seats in this election, they would not keep more than half of the seats in the Upper House.</p>
            <p>Around 10 PM tonight, Ishiba was asked by NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) if he would resign if his parties did not get more than half the seats in the Upper House. Ishiba said that the LDP is still the "biggest party in the Upper House and has a duty to the country." This meant he had no plans to resign.</p>
            <p>The ruling parties, LDP and Komeito, are now in a tough spot, not having more than half the seats in either the Lower or Upper House. Ishiba will discuss this with Komeito leader Tetsuo Saito tomorrow, then hold a press conference. Whether Ishiba's cabinet resigns or not, the political situation will surely be very tense.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported that the biggest question in politics after the LDP's loss in this Upper House election is "whether Prime Minister Ishiba will stay or go." Last October, the LDP, led by Ishiba, lost in the Lower House election. Now, losing again in the Upper House election usually means he should resign.</p>
            <p>However, some within the LDP say, "Ishiba will not resign." Ishiba himself said tonight that he would continue to "be responsible for the country."</p>
            <p>People generally believe that trade talks between Japan and the U.S. are still happening. Ishiba thinks this is a "national crisis" and he needs to be responsible for the country and continue governing. But there has never been a time when an LDP leader lost two national elections in a row and did not resign. So, there might be calls for Ishiba to step down from inside the LDP.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri Shimbun also mentioned that Sanae Takaichi, a former Minister for Economic Security and a possible person to replace Ishiba, said on July 18 while campaigning for an LDP Upper House candidate, "I have decided to make the LDP stand tall again, and I will fight." This was seen as a sign that if the LDP lost this Upper House election, she would push for Ishiba to resign and take his place.</p>
            <p>The special session of the Diet (parliament) that will set up the Upper House election is likely to start on August 1. If Shigeru Ishiba resigns, the LDP will have to hold an election for its new leader. After a new leader is chosen, they must be approved as Prime Minister by the Diet. All these election dates need to be planned.</p>
            <p>Before the special session of the Diet begins, the LDP will need to choose someone to take over after Ishiba. Different groups (old factions) within the party will work together to decide this.</p>
            <p>The report also looked at the chance of former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida becoming Prime Minister again. In Nagata-cho (the political center), secret talks have already begun about what will happen if Ishiba steps down. The first idea is for "former Prime Minister Kishida to come back."</p>
            <p>Besides Sanae Takaichi, other people who might replace Ishiba include Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi, former Minister for Economic Security Takayuki Kobayashi, and Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato. For now, Kishida seems to be the strongest candidate. Kishida is 67 years old. If he gets support from former Prime Minister Taro Aso, who still leads a group (the Aso faction) in the LDP, it would be very helpful for him.</p>
            <p>Also, another important point in this Upper House election is that the ruling group might "add more parties." The LDP and Komeito group lost in the Lower House election and now also in the Upper House election, failing to get more than half the seats. This will make it hard for the parliament to work. They will need support from opposition parties to pass budgets and laws.</p>
            <p>It is thought that the LDP and Komeito want to work with the Japan Innovation Party and the Democratic Party for the People. However, Yoshimura Hirofumi, the leader of the Japan Innovation Party and the governor of Osaka, has clearly said, "We are not thinking about joining the ruling group."</p>
            <p>Kazuya Shimba, the Secretary-General of the Democratic Party for the People, said tonight that they "are not thinking about joining the LDP-Komeito ruling group." The Democratic Party for the People wanted to get 16 seats in this election. With the seats they already have, they would have 21 seats in total, which means they could propose budget bills and other laws by themselves.</p>
            <p>The Yomiuri newspaper reported that the LDP and Komeito could use a "secret plan." This plan would be to support Yuichiro Tamaki, the leader of the Democratic Party for the People, to become Prime Minister, and form a "LDP-Komeito-Democratic Party for the People ruling group." This has happened before in Japanese politics. In 1994, the LDP, the Social Democratic Party, and the New Party Sakigake formed a ruling group, and Tomiichi Murayama, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, became Prime Minister.</p>
            <p>The report said that political reporters from big news companies are watching for statements or secret meetings by "key figures in Nagata-cho." For the LDP, these key figures are former Prime Minister Taro Aso, former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, and Secretary-General Hiroshi Moriyama. For the Democratic Party for the People, they are party leader Yuichiro Tamaki and Deputy Leader and Diet Affairs Committee Chairman Motohisa Furukawa.</p>
            <p>Another media person said, "The Sanseit≈ç (Party of Consciousness) movement is also important this time. Japanese politics is facing big changes, and the Constitutional Democratic Party might also propose a no-confidence vote against the cabinet." (Edited by Wei Shu) 1140720</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Flash Wolves Team Wins World Championship at APL Arena of Valor Super Professional League</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 20, Central News Agency) In the APL Arena of Valor Super Professional League held in Bangkok, Thailand, Taiwan's team, Flash Wolves (FW), won the championship today. They came back from being down 0-2 to win 4-2 against Thailand's team, EA. This is their second world championship in five years.</p>
            <p>The APL Arena of Valor Super Professional League has a total prize of 500,000 US dollars (about 14.7 million New Taiwan dollars). Flash Wolves is led by captain YuXiang (Xia Yuxiang). The team also includes NaiLiu (Wang Zixiu) as the Dark Slayer Lane player, Zhan (Zhan Zherui) as the Jungler, Zhenzhe (Cai Zhengze) as the Mid Laner, and WeiZ (Lin Weizhe) as the Support player. As the champions of the GCS Spring Professional League in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, they went directly to the main competition.</p>
            <p>After passing the Swiss-system stage, Flash Wolves moved to the knockout rounds. They kept winning games. In the semifinals, they beat Thailand's BRU (Buriram United Esports) team, who were the runners-up last time. This earned them a spot in the final game first. However, Flash Wolves expected a tough match today against EA (EArena), the champions of Thailand's RPL Summer Professional League, in a best-of-seven series.</p>
            <p>At the start of the match, Flash Wolves could not stop their opponents in the first two games and fell behind 0-2. But Flash Wolves did not give up easily. They started to catch up from the third game and slowly got their rhythm right. This helped them get to a winning position. In the important sixth game, Flash Wolves showed how strong they were. They took down their opponent's main tower in less than 10 minutes. This win made them world champions again, just like in 2020. They also won 200,000 US dollars (about 5.9 million New Taiwan dollars) as prize money. (Edited by Huang Ming-hsi) 1140720</p>

            <h1>Hsinchu Recall Groups Campaign, Hold Forums; Blue and White Factions Rally Against Recall</h1>
            <p>(Hsinchu City, July 20, Central News Agency Reporter Lu Gang-jun) Recall groups in Hsinchu City today teamed up with members of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to campaign on the streets. They also held a discussion with a retired military officer to encourage people to vote "yes" for the recall. Meanwhile, the Kuomintang (KMT) held a rally in Hsinchu City. Legislative Yuan Speaker Han Kuo-yu and other KMT politicians spoke there, asking people to vote "no" against the recall.</p>
            <p>The recall votes for Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-an (currently suspended) and KMT Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien will be held on July 26. Today, both sides‚Äîthose who want the recall and those who oppose it‚Äîtried to get people to vote by campaigning on streets, holding discussions, and organizing rallies.</p>
            <p>Dai Chen-po, who is leading the "Hsinchu Dual Recall" effort, told Central News Agency that this morning, they went to Shibajian Mountain with the Hsinchu City Council's DPP group to ask for votes. In the afternoon, they held a discussion on the topic "Opposing Communism Becomes the Biggest Common Goal." They invited "Eagle Dad" Hsu Po-yueh, a retired military officer, to speak. He talked about the meaning of the recall movement from a national security point of view.</p>
            <p>During the discussion, Hsu Po-yueh said that the KMT is too friendly with China and selling out Taiwan, going against its original ideas. He said this recall is not just a choice between "true KMT members against fake KMT members." It is also a holy fight to protect the Republic of China and stop China from influencing Taiwan. He believes this recall might affect Taiwan's future for the next hundred years.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chieh, the spokesperson for the Hsinchu Dual Recall, said that Mayor Kao Hung-an was found guilty of corruption in the first trial and sentenced to 7 years and 4 months in prison. This has made Hsinchu City's government approval ratings low for three years in a row. Legislator Cheng Cheng-chien has proposed many laws in the Legislative Yuan that harm the constitution. He is also suspected of breaking national security laws, anti-infiltration laws, anti-corruption laws, and taking public money for himself. Both of them, she said, deserve to be recalled.</p>
            <p>On the other side, Cheng Cheng-chien and Kao Hung-an spoke in front of a shopping center in the afternoon. Cheng Cheng-chien said that he worked in the parliament to get more money for Hsinchu City from the government. He found it strange that the recall group said they were "afraid of causing problems for the Hsinchu City government." Kao Hung-an said that many people still do not know they need to vote "no to the recall" to oppose it. She asked everyone to go out and vote.</p>
            <p>In the evening, the KMT held a rally called "Against Bad Recalls, Protect Hsinchu" at the Hsinchu Ambassador Hotel. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, Nantou County Magistrate Hsu Shu-hua, Legislative Yuan Speaker Han Kuo-yu, and others came to support. They asked people to vote to support Kao Hung-an and Cheng Cheng-chien on July 26.</p>
            <p>Lu Shiow-yen said she came to Hsinchu because she does not agree with the ruling party causing trouble by starting "recalls without good reason." Hsu Shu-hua said that the DPP has seen Hsinchu City as its own area for a long time and is using these big recalls to remove people who disagree with them.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu spoke at the rally and said that Taiwan took 30 years to become a mature democracy. If the DPP uses government resources to get rid of opposing parties, it will become a joke to other countries. He asked people to strongly support Cheng Cheng-chien so he can keep checking the government in parliament and get money for Hsinchu City. He also asked people to support Kao Hung-an, so the DPP does not control Hsinchu City's government. (Edited by Li Hsi-chang, Huang Ming-hsi) 1140720</p>
