On July 2nd, a family of five was found dead in their home in Fengyuan District, Taichung. A colleague of the father, Mr. Wang, noticed he had not come to work for several days and became worried. They called the police, who went to the house with the local village chief. Inside, they found Mr. Wang, his wife, and their three children (two daughters and a son) had died. A brazier was also found at the scene.

Police believe no one else was involved. They reported the case to the prosecutor for further investigation. It is understood that a suicide note was found. Friends and family said that Mr. Wang, who worked in a factory, had recently talked about wanting to end his life. When he did not come to work for two days without asking for leave, his colleagues checked on him and found the tragic scene.

The police stated that there were no signs of a struggle or forced entry at the scene. They suspect the deaths were related to financial problems. The case has been reported to the Taichung District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

**Han Kuo-yu: Taiwan's Democracy and Freedom Trembles After Peng Jen-sheng's Wife Dies**

The wife of former Taipei Deputy Mayor Peng Jen-sheng passed away after falling from their home in Kaohsiung. Today, Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu said that Taiwan's democracy and freedom, which it was once proud of, has been greatly shaken again. He hopes that everyone can work to keep the hard-won justice in the legal system, treat the kindness of Taiwanese people well, and help save the values of Taiwan, which are now in danger.

During a court hearing on the Jinghua City case on July 1st, former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je and Weiking Group chairman Shen Ching-ching were questioned. Former Taipei Deputy Mayor Peng Jen-sheng was also called to testify. Before appearing in court, Peng was told his wife had died from a fall and cried loudly.

President Han Kuo-yu posted on Facebook early today, saying that with Mrs. Peng's sad passing, Taiwan's once-proud democracy and freedom has been greatly shaken again.

He added that legal investigations are crucial for maintaining justice in society. When handling important cases, they should be well-prepared. If there is enough proof of a crime, the case should be investigated and brought to court quickly. This way, both sides can present their arguments fairly, and the court can make a just decision.
