            <h1>Trump Asks Thailand and Cambodia to Stop Fighting, or No Trade Deals</h1>
            <p>The fight between Thailand and Cambodia has now been going on for three days. Today, former US President Donald Trump said he talked to Hun Manet, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, and the acting Prime Minister of Thailand. He asked them to stop fighting. He also said that the US is talking about trade with both countries. If they keep fighting, the US will not make a trade deal with either of them.</p>
            <p>News reports from other countries say that the long-term border problem between Thailand and Cambodia became a serious fight on July 24th. Both sides used warplanes, big guns, tanks, and soldiers on the ground. This fight is the most violent between them in many years. At least 33 people have died, and many more are hurt.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump is visiting Scotland now. Today, he wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, that he talked with Hun Manet, Cambodia's Prime Minister. They talked about ending the "war" with Thailand. After that, he also talked with Phumtham Wechayachai, Thailand's acting Prime Minister. He asked him to stop fighting to end "this war" too.</p>
            <p>Trump said that the US is already talking about trade with both Thailand and Cambodia. But if the two countries keep fighting, the US will not want to make a deal with either of them.</p>
            <p>After talking to Thailand's acting Prime Minister, he wrote online again. He said they had a "good talk." Both Thailand and Cambodia want to stop fighting and have peace right away. Then he told this message to Cambodia.</p>
            <p>Trump said he is "trying to make this difficult situation simpler." This fight has caused many people to die or get hurt. It made him remember the past fight between Pakistan and India.</p>
            <p>Trump had said before that Pakistan and India agreed to a full ceasefire after the US helped them.</p>

            <h1>All Attempts to Remove Officials Failed; Tung Tzu-hsien Says He Is Calm</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 26th â€“ The first group of attempts to remove officials from their positions did not succeed. Tung Tzu-hsien, the chairman of Pegatron, who had openly supported these attempts before, said tonight, "This is a win for Taiwan's democracy." He also shared that he has felt very calm from last night until today and was not worried about the voting.</p>
            <p>Today, people voted on whether to remove 24 KMT lawmakers and Hsinchu Mayor Kao Hung-an, who is currently suspended from her job. All these attempts failed. KMT lawmaker Fu Kun-chi announced by himself around 5:46 PM that his removal attempt had not passed.</p>
            <p>Tung Tzu-hsien, the chairman of Pegatron, is from Ruisui Township in Hualien. Recently, he said he supported removing Fu Kun-chi. He also claimed that the Hualien County Government stopped money meant for earthquake relief. This caused the county chief, Hsu Chen-wei, and Fu Kun-chi to strongly deny his claims and sue him for saying bad things. Both sides argued about where the money went and who was responsible, but they did not meet in person.</p>
            <p>About the removal attempts not passing, Tung Tzu-hsien only said, "Congratulations, this is a victory for Taiwan's democracy. Through this vote, the public has become more mature."</p>
            <p>Tung Tzu-hsien shared that he felt very calm from last night until today. He watched baseball and listened to music. He was not worried about the voting.</p>
