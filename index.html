            <h1>New Taipei Girl's Day: Female Students Explore Tamsui and Experience Being Peking Opera Actresses</h1>
            <p>The "New Taipei Girl's Day" Tamsui historical walk took place today. The Social Affairs Department said that this event helps children and teenagers learn about gender equality. They can bravely try different things and learn about strong women and their achievements in Tamsui's history. This is done through cultural walks and opera experiences.</p>
            <p>The city's Social Affairs Department said that October 11th is "Taiwan Girl's Day." New Taipei City has also made this day "New Taipei Girl's Day." To celebrate this day, the "Sea Light Legacy, Peking Opera Girls" event was held in Tamsui today.</p>
            <p>The Social Affairs Department said that "New Taipei Girl's Day" has been happening for 13 years. It hopes to teach gender equality from a young age and help people respect differences. Director Li Mei-chen said that everyone, no matter their gender or job, can show their strength in life. We should respect each other and support women's power.</p>
            <p>The event invited female students from Zhengde Junior High School, Tamsui Junior High School, and Tamsui Commercial and Industrial Vocational High School. At the Tamsui Customs Wharf, a place that trains Peking opera talent, Mr. Pan Chun-jen, the head of the Huaya Opera Arts Education Promotion Association, showed a special Peking opera skill called "qiao gong" (fake feet). This skill is unique to female roles.</p>
            <p>Pan Chun-jen is a man, but he plays female roles in Peking opera. He learned "qiao gong" to show how women move in a light and graceful way, with great skill. This makes the stage performance very dramatic. He shared his story of bravely following his dream of being an opera performer. He studied art, but a university professor inspired him to love Peking opera. He then combined his painting skills with Peking opera to show the true beauty of traditional Eastern art.</p>
            <p>Pan Chun-jen mentioned that the famous "Hua Dan" actress Li Qiu-gui (Li Guang-yu) was his first teacher. She helped him start his dream in Peking opera. He invited students to try on costumes, sing, and make hand gestures. He also told the students to bravely follow their dreams. He said, "If I can bravely follow my dream, you can too."</p>
            <p>Local council members also spoke at the event. City council member Chen Wei-jie from the KMT party joked that because most of his family are men, he understands how hard women work. City council member Cheng Yu-en from the DPP party told the female students to protect themselves while chasing their dreams. She said it is important to set clear boundaries for their bodies.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Police Get Ready for Heavy Traffic Before Mid-Autumn Festival Holiday, Start Work Early</h1>
            <p>Taipei City's Department of Transportation said that police officers and traffic volunteers started work early this evening. This is because many people might drive home for the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. The traffic at the intersection of Keelung Road and Roosevelt Road was normal. This intersection changed to a new design five days ago. The traffic was similar to the last two days.</p>
            <p>The Gongguan roundabout at Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road in Taipei City changed to a new straight intersection design on September 29th. The next day, which was the first workday, there was heavy traffic during both morning and evening rush hours. This made many people unhappy.</p>
            <p>Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said yesterday that in the past two days, traffic has returned to normal speeds, like it was before the change. He told departments to keep improving the road design and traffic lights. He also said they must be ready for the evening rush hour today, before the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.</p>
            <p>At 6 PM today, a reporter rode a motorcycle from Taipei City Hall along Keelung Road. The reporter followed the speed limit and did not weave through traffic. It took about 15 minutes to reach the Roosevelt Road intersection. This was faster than the 20 minutes it took at the same time on the 1st and 2nd of the month. The line of cars waiting at the red light was still around the entrance of Lane 114, Section 4, Keelung Road, just like on the 1st and 2nd.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung, the head of Taipei City's Department of Transportation, said that traffic police started their duty at major intersections at 4 PM. This was to prepare for possible heavy traffic before the holiday. So far, he said, traffic is similar to the last two days, except for more cars going from Fuhe Bridge towards Yonghe. Department staff drove three test runs starting around 5 PM, and the travel times were also similar to the previous two days.</p>
            <p>He also said they will continue to watch traffic and change traffic light times. They will also stay in touch with New Taipei City to respond quickly if anything unexpected happens.</p>

            <h1>Tang Chia-hung Wins Gold in All-Around Gymnastics at National Games, Jokes He's Tired After Competition</h1>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung, also known as the "King of Cats" in the gymnastics world, won a gold medal today at the Yunlin National Games. He competed in men's artistic gymnastics all-around. He got a total score of 78.598 points, beating other good athletes. After the competition, he laughed and said, "I am really tired."</p>
            <p>The Yunlin National Games will take place from October 18th to 23rd. However, artistic gymnastics started early this week because it was at the same time as the World Championships on October 19th. Today was the second day of the competition. Tomorrow will be the last day, with only the men's and women's individual events.</p>
            <p>Today, the men's artistic gymnastics all-around competition was held. Athletes competed in six different events: floor, pommel horse, rings, parallel bars, vault, and horizontal bar. Tang Chia-hung, who is from Taipei City, got 13.300 points in the rings event. This score helped him get a big lead over the other athletes.</p>
            <p>However, in the horizontal bar event, which he is usually best at, he only scored 12.566 points. Among the eight athletes in the final, he even scored less than Chuang Chia-lung from New Taipei City.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung told a CNA reporter that he was very tired. Yesterday was the qualification round for the all-around event, and there was also a team competition. Today, he competed in the all-around final again. When he finished, he felt completely exhausted.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung laughed and said, "The last time I did all six events in the all-around was at the World Gymnastics Championships in 2022. It's been three years since then, so it was a very good experience to compete again."</p>
            <p>He added that when he went to Japan for training in mid-July, he focused on training for the all-around event. He believes that this early training helped him to finish both the qualification round and the final in just two days.</p>
            <p>However, Tang Chia-hung also said that for the World Gymnastics Championships on October 19th, he will only compete in the horizontal bar event. He said, "I want to do well with the new difficult moves on the horizontal bar first. I will take a break from the all-around for now."</p>
