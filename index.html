            <h1>Airspace Attacked: Unknown Drones Seen at Denmark's Largest Army Base</h1>
            <p>Denmark's police said that unknown drones were seen again at night over their biggest army base. In recent days, many drones have been seen in Denmark. The authorities call this a "hybrid attack."</p>
            <p>These mystery drones first appeared in Denmark's skies on September 22. Since then, many airports in the country of Scandinavia have closed.</p>
            <p>A police officer told AFP that something happened around 8:15 PM last night and lasted for several hours. They saw one or two drones flying over and near the Karup air force base.</p>
            <p>The police could not say where the drones came from. He said, "We did not shoot them down." The police are working with the army to find out more about these events.</p>
            <p>The Karup air force base uses the same runways as a regular airport. The airport closed for a short time during the event. But no business flights were affected because no planes were flying at that time.</p>

            <h1>High Temperatures in Northern Taiwan, Rain and Thunder in Central and Southern Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Tomorrow is the second day of the long weekend for Teacher's Day. The Central Weather Administration said today that it will be very hot in some parts of Taiwan. In Taipei, New Taipei, and Taoyuan, and in areas near mountains south of Taichung, temperatures could go above 36 degrees Celsius. This is because of high pressure from the Pacific Ocean. Also, there might be rain and thunder in the afternoons in central and southern Taiwan, and in mountains everywhere.</p>
            <p>A weather expert, Zeng Zhao-cheng, told CNA that the weather will be mostly good for the next week. Tomorrow's weather will be like today's. It will be mostly sunny or partly cloudy. Places like Keelung's north coast, eastern Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula might have a little bit of rain. Central and southern Taiwan, and all mountain areas, might have rain and thunder in the afternoons.</p>
            <p>About the temperature, Zeng Zhao-cheng said that tomorrow, the highest temperatures will be about 32 to 35 degrees Celsius in most places. But in Taipei City, New Taipei City, Taoyuan City, and areas near mountains south of Taichung, it could be hotter than 36 degrees Celsius in some spots.</p>
            <p>Zeng Zhao-cheng also said that after September 29, the high pressure from the Pacific Ocean will get a bit stronger. It will be sunny or partly cloudy everywhere. Western Taiwan and all mountain areas will have rain and thunder in the afternoons.</p>
            <p>From September 30 to October 3, the weather will be sunny or partly cloudy. Southern Taiwan and all mountain areas will have rain and thunder in the afternoons. On the morning of September 30, western Taiwan, especially near the coast, might have some short rain.</p>
            <p>Zeng Zhao-cheng mentioned that on October 4, a low-pressure system will pass by Taiwan from the south. This means there will be more moisture in the air. Areas like Hualien, Taitung, and the Hengchun Peninsula will have short, local rain. Other areas will be sunny or partly cloudy. Southern Taiwan and all mountain areas will have rain and thunder in the afternoons.</p>
            <p>About the two typhoons in the Pacific Ocean, Zeng Zhao-cheng said that Typhoon Bolaven is moving towards Vietnam. Tropical Storm Kiko is east of Japan and is expected to move northeast over the sea. Neither typhoon will cause much trouble for Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Hsieh Su-wei and Partner Win First Game at China Open</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's tennis player Hsieh Su-wei and her partner won their first game in the China Open. They played against Chan Hao-ching and her partner. Hsieh and her partner from Latvia, Jelena Ostapenko, won the match 5-7, 6-4, 11-9. They came back to win after losing the first set.</p>
            <p>The China Open is a big tennis competition for women in Beijing. Hsieh Su-wei and Jelena Ostapenko are a good team and they played together again after the Wimbledon tournament in July. They were the 4th ranked team in the women's doubles. But in their first match, they played against Chan Hao-ching, who is also from Taiwan, and her Chinese partner, Jiang Xin-yu.</p>
            <p>Hsieh and Ostapenko played together again after two months. In the first part of the game, they had a very close match with the other team. After 8 games, both teams had won one game when the other team was serving, so the score was 4-4. But the team from Taiwan and Latvia could not win the set when they had a chance. Then, the other team won their serve again. So, Hsieh and Ostapenko lost the first set 5-7.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Su-wei and Ostapenko had to win the next set. They played better in the second part of the game. After 8 games, both teams were still tied at 4-4. But the team from Taiwan and Latvia won a very important game when the other team was serving. They won the set 6-4, which gave them a chance to win the whole match.</p>
            <p>In the last tie-break game, both teams played very closely again. The score was tied 8 times. But Hsieh Su-wei and Ostapenko played strongly at the end. They got the first chance to win the match. Even though Chan Hao-ching and Jiang Xin-yu stopped them from winning once, Hsieh and Ostapenko still won the match 11-9. Now, they are in the round of 16 for women's doubles.</p>
