            <h1>Trump maintains 10% tariff on Australia; Canberra: goods more competitive in US sales</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Canberra/Wellington, August 1, foreign news report) Australia's Trade Minister, Don Farrell, said today that the White House has confirmed that no other country has a lower matching tariff than Australia. This means that US President Donald Trump will keep the 10% basic tariff on Australian goods.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that after Trump kept the lowest 10% tariff rate for Australia, Farrell said that Australian products might become more competitive in the US market. This will help businesses sell more goods to other countries.</p>
            <p>Trump has increased import taxes on 69 countries that the US trades with. These taxes will range from 10% to 41% and will start in 7 days. For example, many Canadian goods will have a 35% tax, Brazilian goods will have a 50% tax, and goods from New Zealand, Australia's neighbor in the South Pacific, will have a 15% tax.</p>
            <p>Farrell told reporters, "This decision, along with all the tariff changes for other countries, means that Australian products are now more competitive in the US market."</p>
            <p>"We will help all businesses that sell goods to other countries to use this chance well and sell more."</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Farrell said in a statement, "Even though we are in the best position under the new US tariff system, we will still ask for all tariffs to be removed, as per our free trade agreements."</p>
            <p>Australia is one of the few countries with which the US often has a trade surplus. Australian officials often talk about this when they have trade talks with US officials.</p>
            <p>Data from the U.S. Trade Representative's Office shows that in 2024, the US earned 17.9 billion US dollars more from trade with Australia than Australia earned from the US. This is a 1.6% increase from 2023.</p>
            <p>Last week, Australia made it easier to bring in US beef. This might make trade talks between Australia and Trump go more smoothly. However, Australia's Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, said that this decision was planned a long time ago and is not connected to any trade talks.</p>
            <p>The US has raised its tariffs on New Zealand, Australia's neighbor, from 10% (announced in April) to 15%.</p>
            <p>New Zealand's Trade Minister, Todd McClay, said in an interview with Radio New Zealand, "The first step is to talk directly with them, and we have had many conversations. In fact, this has been very helpful."</p>

            <h1>Co-op Bank approved by Japan's Financial Services Agency to set up Tokyo branch, deepening Northeast Asia presence</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Ai, Taipei, August 1) To grow its business in the Asia-Pacific region and make its plans for regional markets stronger, Taiwan Cooperative Financial Holding Company said today that its subsidiary, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, received approval from Japan's Financial Services Agency on July 31 to open a branch in Tokyo. This branch is expected to officially start operating in the fourth quarter of 2025. It will be the bank's first branch in Japan and its 27th location overseas.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Cooperative Bank pointed out that Japan is a very important international financial center with many well-known trading companies and businesses. It is also a main place for raising money. The Tokyo branch will be a key center for the bank to develop its business in Northeast Asia. It will also help with the trend of supply chains becoming more local. The bank will follow Taiwanese businesses investing in Japan to take advantage of Japan's new business opportunities. It will help companies build a strong financial base there.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Cooperative Bank explained that its overseas branches are across four continents: Europe, America, Asia, and Australia. It continues to open more branches to complete its global plan. The bank follows the strategy of "global planning, regional management, and local roots." It offers financial services to Taiwanese businesses nearby. Also, it uses its expert experience to support local businesses to grow. Following the idea of "using resources where they are found and giving back to that place," it provides professional and stable financial services to local customers.</p>

            <h1>Trump pushes for White House renovation, will spend 200 million USD to build banquet hall</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 31, foreign news report) White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said today that US President Donald Trump is starting a renovation project for the White House. He also plans to build a banquet hall there.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Karoline Leavitt stated the cost to build the banquet hall, 200 million US dollars (about 6 billion New Taiwan dollars), will be paid for by Trump himself and other donors who wish to remain unnamed.</p>
            <p>Leavitt said, "For 150 years, presidents, government officials, and White House staff have always hoped to have a large space for events within the White House area."</p>
            <p>Leavitt said that this banquet hall, which can hold 650 people, is expected to start being built in September and will be finished during Trump's current term in office.</p>
            <p>The banquet hall is being built to host important events for leaders from other countries who visit. Right now, these events sometimes have to use tents set up on the White House lawn.</p>
            <p>According to the model of the banquet hall released by the US government, the building will be white and have columns. Its look will be similar to the main White House building. It will take the place of the East Wing, which is usually used as the office space for the US First Lady.</p>
