            <h1>Mid-Autumn Festival: 20% Discount on Postage for Care Packages to Soldiers on Outlying Islands</h1>
            <p>To show respect to the soldiers who protect places like Kinmen, Matsu, Dongyin, Wuqiu, Nansha, and Dongsha Islands, Chunghwa Post announced today a special offer. From September 18th to 26th, people can send care packages for the Mid-Autumn Festival with a 20% discount on postage.</p>
            <p>Chunghwa Post said in a press release that during this special period, packages containing clothes, daily items, and food that does not spoil easily, sent to these soldiers, will get an 80% discount on postage. Other special fees, like for insured mail, are not included.</p>
            <p>However, this discount does not apply if you send packages using special convenience boxes/bags, iPost boxes for pickup, self-pickup services, or if you send many items to one place.</p>
            <p>To keep packages safe, Chunghwa Post asks people to use strong postal boxes or their own strong boxes. Make sure the package is well-sealed and safe to send.</p>
            <p>Chunghwa Post also reminds senders to use a pen that doesn't fade. Write the recipient's special mailbox number for their service area (do not write the name of the military unit or its number), postal code, and the recipient's name on the package. If the package contains food, please write 'Food' on the cover. This helps the post office handle it with special care.</p>

            <h1>Wang Ting-yu Not Charged After Posting Trip Details on Facebook; Accused of Leaking Secrets</h1>
            <p>In 2018, Wang Ting-yu, a politician from the Democratic Progressive Party, went to France with the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee. He posted about his trip on Facebook. Someone accused him of sharing state secrets. But after looking into it, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office said that the trip's details were not officially classified as secret. So, Wang Ting-yu will not be charged.</p>
            <p>The Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee of the Legislative Yuan had an overseas trip from July 23 to 31, 2018. During this trip, Wang Ting-yu wrote posts on Facebook. He wrote things like: 'Military inspection secret trip, leaving soon, see you in ten days,' 'First day of national defense secret inspection in Europe,' and 'Now at a military base in eastern France, about to take the high-speed rail back to Paris.'</p>
            <p>A person reported that Wang Ting-yu had shared the locations and details of this trip with many people. They said he broke laws like the National Security Information Protection Act, which is about leaking state secrets, and the Criminal Code, which is about sharing secret information that is not about national defense.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office asked the Legislative Yuan and the Navy Headquarters of the Ministry of National Defense for documents. They wanted to know if the trip had any official secret classification. The Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee only replied repeatedly that 'the second agenda for the 9th term, 5th session overseas trip was arranged based on the instructions of committee members Wang and Lu.'</p>
            <p>The Navy Headquarters clearly stated, 'Our military did not take part in the Foreign Affairs and National Defense Committee's trip to France in July 2018. Therefore, we do not have any secret classifications or document numbers to provide for this case.'</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office decided that the trip's details were not classified as secret under the National Security Information Protection Act or other laws. It was also not a national defense secret. So, what Wang Ting-yu did was not against the law about leaking non-defense secrets. Because of this, they decided not to charge him.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Warns Users About Music Editing Apps: Charged After '0-Dollar Limited Time' Offer</h1>
            <p>Some people signed up for an AI music editing app that said it was '0 dollars for a limited time.' But later, they were charged NT$6990. The Legal Affairs Department in Taipei has received more than ten complaints about this. They said that these apps are often run by foreign companies. This makes it hard to talk to them and solve problems. So, customers should be careful because there is a risk when using these apps.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Legal Affairs Department shared some news. Lately, many AI music editing apps have become popular. They often use the trick of '0 dollars for a limited time' to get people to download them. Some people said they downloaded an app for free because of this offer. But later, they were charged NT$6990. When they checked reviews from other users, they found out many people had the same problem. They felt like they were cheated.</p>
            <p>Consumer protection officers in Taipei said these apps use cheap offers, like '0-dollar downloads' or 'free trials,' to get people interested. After downloading, if users want to use more features, they have to pay extra. If they do not cancel their subscription before the free trial ends, the app automatically renews and charges them. They get charged through their credit card or phone bill.</p>
            <p>The officers also said that if you don't want to continue paying, just deleting the app is not enough. You must cancel the subscription properly during the trial period. This will help you avoid problems. So far, the Legal Affairs Department has received more than ten similar complaints about subscriptions.</p>
            <p>The Legal Affairs Department looked at the reasons for these complaints. They found that these apps hide the rules for automatic renewal in their terms of service. This means that when the contract ends, it renews automatically without the customer saying yes again. Also, it is very difficult and confusing to cancel the service. Customer service is hard to reach or does not help solve the problems. This creates many arguments between customers and the app companies.</p>
            <p>The Legal Affairs Department noted that some of these apps have their terms of use and privacy policy only in English. Many people do not read them carefully before agreeing and using the app. They also do not remember to cancel their subscription before the deadline. Because of this, they are charged for no reason and lose money.</p>
            <p>Consumer protection officers explained that these apps often have ongoing contracts. The companies include rules for automatic renewal and automatic charges. Money is taken directly from credit cards or phone bills. Because most of the app makers are from other countries, it is hard to solve problems through talks in Taiwan. This means there is a high risk for customers in these deals.</p>
            <p>If people have questions about these purchases, they can check the Taipei City Legal Affairs Department's consumer protection website. Or they can call the consumer service hotline at 1950 or the citizen hotline at 1999 (then dial 7812) to ask for help.</p>
