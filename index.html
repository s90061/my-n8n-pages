            <h1>Hollywood Starts Free Speech Group Again, Upset with Trump</h1>
            <p>More than 550 famous people in Hollywood, including Oscar winner Jane Fonda, started a free speech group again today. This group was first formed during the Cold War. They warned that the Trump government is trying to stop people from speaking against them.</p>
            <p>News reports say that over 550 Hollywood stars relaunched the "Committee for the First Amendment" today. This group was started during the "Red Scare" period of the Cold War.</p>
            <p>Hollywood stars like Natalie Portman, Sean Penn, and Anne Hathaway signed up to restart the "Committee for the First Amendment."</p>
            <p>Famous African-American director Spike Lee and Aaron Sorkin, who created the TV show "West Wing," also joined.</p>
            <p>They said in a statement today: "This committee was first created during the McCarthy era. That was a dark time when the government tried to stop and hurt American citizens for their political beliefs. That same power is back now. It is our turn to stand together and protect our rights given by the Constitution."</p>
            <p>Eighty years ago, Jane Fonda's father, Henry Fonda, along with Lucille Ball, Humphrey Bogart, Frank Sinatra, and Judy Garland, started the "Committee for the First Amendment." They fought against McCarthyism.</p>
            <p>In the early Cold War, Joseph McCarthy, who was a U.S. Senator at that time, led an "anti-communist" effort. He used unfair methods to find communists or people who supported communism in the country, including people in Hollywood and the arts.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Jane Fonda wrote a letter to her Hollywood friends, asking them to join the restarted "Committee for the First Amendment." This letter was shared with CNN.</p>
            <p>She wrote: "I am 87 years old. I have seen wars, unfair treatment, protests, and boycotts. I have been praised, and I have been called an enemy of the country. But I can tell you: this is the most scary time in my life."</p>

            <h1>U.S. Government Shut Down: About 750,000 Workers Will Not Get Paid</h1>
            <p>The problem with the U.S. government being shut down continues. Today, the Senate voted against a plan to end the budget disagreement between President Trump and Democrats in Congress. This means efforts to quickly end the government shutdown failed. About 750,000 government workers will not get paid.</p>
            <p>Because President Trump and Congress members could not agree on how to keep the government running, money for the government ran out. Many federal departments and agencies stopped working at 12:01 AM today.</p>
            <p>Democrats in the Senate asked for health care money for people with low incomes to continue. So, they refused to help the Republican Party, which is the main party, pass a bill already approved by the House of Representatives. This bill would have allowed the government to work again for a few weeks to give time for talks.</p>
            <p>About 750,000 government workers will have to take unpaid leave. This means they are forced to take time off and will not get paid until they can return to work.</p>
            <p>Important workers, like those in the military and border control, might have to work without pay. Some might not even get their salaries next week.</p>
            <p>The House of Representatives, which is led by Republicans, passed a short-term money bill. It aimed to keep the government running until late November. This would give more time to plan a long-term budget.</p>
            <p>But the Senate needed 60 votes to send the bill to President Trump to sign. Democrats said they would not help pass the bill if Republicans did not agree to budget cuts, especially in health care.</p>

            <h1>U.S. Government Buys Shares in Big North American Lithium Company to Rely Less on China</h1>
            <p>America's biggest lithium mining company, Lithium Americas, said today that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has bought shares in the company, getting a 5% ownership. U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said this is important to reduce China's strong position in the lithium market.</p>
            <p>According to reports, Lithium Americas, which is based in Vancouver, Canada, is developing one of the largest lithium mines in the world in northern Nevada, U.S.A.</p>
            <p>Reports say the U.S. Department of Energy now owns 5% of Lithium Americas. It also owns 5% of the company's Thacker Pass lithium mine project in Nevada.</p>
            <p>Based on Bloomberg News and Associated Press, this project is the biggest lithium deposit in the U.S. It is a joint project between Lithium Americas and General Motors.</p>
            <p>The Thacker Pass lithium project is seen as very important. It will help the U.S. depend less on China for lithium. Lithium is a key material used to make high-tech batteries for cell phones, electric cars, and renewable energy.</p>
            <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement that the agreement with Lithium Americas makes the local supply chain stronger. This helps the U.S. rely less on other countries for important minerals.</p>
            <p>Wright told Bloomberg TV yesterday that this is a necessary step to balance China's strong position in the lithium market.</p>
