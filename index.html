            <h1>Central and Local Governments Work Together to Protect Penghu's Ocean Resources</h1>
            <p>The Minister of the Ocean Affairs Council, Guan Bi-ling, said today in Penghu that the lives of Penghu residents are closely connected to the ocean. The ocean is very important and its contributions cannot be ignored. The central government and the local government are working together. This shows their strong decision to protect ocean resources together.</p>
            <p>Today, Guan Bi-ling arrived in Penghu. In the afternoon, she visited County Magistrate Chen Guang-fu. They talked a lot about protecting the ocean, keeping the ocean environment clean, making sure the sea is safe, and keeping the natural balance for a long time. This meeting showed that the central government and local government will work together to protect ocean resources.</p>
            <p>Chen Guang-fu said that Penghu is surrounded by the sea and has very special ocean resources. For example, the Taiwan Bank is about 8800 square kilometers large. The ocean is not just where Penghu people live; it is also very important for tourism and for managing things in a way that helps for a long time. He thanked the Ocean Affairs Council for always helping Penghu. This help includes checking water quality, protecting sea turtles, bringing back natural homes for animals and corals, planting sea grass, and teaching about the ocean. All these things have greatly improved Penghu's ability to manage its ocean.</p>
            <p>Guan Bi-ling pointed out that the ocean's help is very important and cannot be ignored. The lives of Penghu people are very connected to the ocean. She praised Penghu for its hard work and good results in cleaning beaches, removing ocean trash, and protecting the environment. However, because new rules about government money will start next year, the central government's budget will change. She hopes that local governments can continue to put more effort into ocean matters. The central government will also keep giving needed help and resources. They will all work together for the goal of a healthy ocean for the future.</p>

            <h1>Sung Sheng-jui Hits Home Run After Giving Teammates a "Heads-up," Thanks Coach for the Chance</h1>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui of the CTBC Brothers baseball team hit a home run in a game on August 3rd. He came in to play later in the game. He shared that before the game, he joked with his teammates. He told them that if he didn't hit a home run when he went to play, it would be because he had done heavy weight training before the game. He has hit 4 home runs in his last 6 games, showing he is playing very well. He thanked his head coach for giving him chances even when he was not in good form, which helped him learn from his mistakes and get better.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui of the CTBC Brothers baseball team is playing very well lately. From July 27th to 30th, he hit home runs in three games in a row. On August 3rd, in the game against the Rakuten Monkeys, he did not start. He went in to play defense in the 6th part of the game. In the 7th part, he hit a solo home run. This was his 8th home run of this season.</p>
            <p>Before today's game, Sung Sheng-jui spoke to reporters and started by saying he had a "funny story." He said that on August 3rd, before the game, he knew he wasn't going to start. So, he went to the weight training room to lift weights. His coach even asked him, "You have a game today, why are you doing weights?" Sung Sheng-jui said he thought of it as a warm-up. He also "warned" his teammates beforehand. He told them that if he came into the game later and didn't hit a home run, he would have a reason: it was because of the weight training.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui also said that at the beginning of July, he wasn't playing well and didn't know why. Wang Wei-chen and Chiang Kun-yu helped him by watching and seeing if anything was different from before. He kept trying different things, and now he is getting better and better.</p>
            <p>Including today's game, Sung Sheng-jui has played in all 77 games this season. He said that he is still getting used to adjusting himself for playing every day, but he also told himself to keep going. He also thanked head coach Keiichi Hirano. The coach gave him chances to start even when he was not playing well before. By going through failures, he learned from them and now knows how to adjust himself better.</p>
            <p>Talking about what is different this season, Sung Sheng-jui said that he planned to gain weight during the off-season. He also hired a trainer and learned many things at a training center in the United States. Taking in and using that information helped a lot. His mindset is also different. He thinks positively to find problems and does not think too much about a few failures. He faces each turn at bat with a stable mindset.</p>
            <p>Keiichi Hirano once said that his first choice for the leadoff hitter (the first batter in the game) was Sung Sheng-jui. Sung Sheng-jui also said that of course he hopes he can do this job. But this year, his ability to choose which pitches to hit is not very good. He hopes to quickly improve his "plate discipline" (knowing when to swing at pitches) even more.</p>

            <h1>Foreign Investors Buy NT$11.4 Billion for 2nd Straight Day, Focus on Server Stocks</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market today went up by 281.65 points, closing at 23660.59 points. Foreign and Chinese investors bought 11.488 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of shares. This is the second day in a row they have bought more shares than they sold. They mainly bought server-related stocks. Wistron was bought the most, with 20,800 shares. MiTAC and Hon Hai also had a lot of shares bought, with 19,200 and 13,300 shares respectively.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taiwan stock market strongly went up by more than 200 points. Electronic stocks led the increase. Money went into cooling system stocks, robot stocks, and smaller companies. The stock market index closed at 23660.59 points, up by 281.65 points, which is a 1.2% increase. It stayed above all the important average lines. The total money exchanged in trades was 367.844 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Today, individual investors bought 4.525 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of shares. Investment trusts bought 3.982 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of shares. Foreign and Chinese investors bought 11.488 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of shares. Together, the three main types of investors bought a total of 19.995 billion New Taiwan Dollars worth of shares.</p>
            <p>Looking at the list of stocks foreign investors bought the most, the top 10 were: Wistron (20,800 shares), Taiwan Business Bank (20,400 shares), MiTAC (19,200 shares), Hon Hai (13,300 shares), Innolux (13,300 shares), Yuanta Taiwan Dividend Plus ETF (0056) (12,300 shares), Quanta Computer (12,100 shares), Evergreen Aviation Technologies (8,058 shares), Fubon Taiwan Select High Dividend ETF (00919) (7,914 shares), and AU Optronics (7,740 shares).</p>
            <p>Investment trusts bought a lot of financial stocks. The top 10 they bought included: CTBC Financial, First Financial, Taishin Financial, Mega Financial, Cathay Financial, E.SUN Financial, Fubon Financial, MiTAC, Yuanta Financial, and E.SUN Financial.</p>
            <p>Cai Ming-han, an assistant manager at Cathay Securities Corp., said that last Friday, bad economic news from the U.S. caused the U.S. stock market to fall sharply. But after thinking about it, the market saw the weaker economic news as a good thing, meaning there might be more chances for interest rates to go down. This made the U.S. stock market go up, and the Taiwan stock market followed.</p>
            <p>Cai Ming-han explained that as the Taiwan stock market went up today, electronic stocks were the main reason. Also, because the risk in the market went down, smaller companies and the stock market for smaller companies also went up more. This shows that the market's rising trend has not changed. Even though the results of the MSCI index changes will be announced next week, these changes will only start at the end of the month. So, they will not have a big effect on the stock market in the short term.</p>
