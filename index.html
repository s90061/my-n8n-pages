Starlux Airlines announced today that it will stop using paper books and magazines on its planes. Instead, they will use a new online reading app called JX Reader, which they made with PressReader. This change starts on July 1st.

JX Reader has over 7,000 newspapers and magazines from all over the world, in many languages and about different topics. Passengers can download what they want to read on their phones or tablets. You can download content from 48 hours before your flight until 24 hours after. You can read it even when you are offline.

Starlux Airlines is working to be more eco-friendly. They use sustainable airplane fuel (SAF) for new planes, starting with 5%, and plan to use more each year. They also use recycled materials for things like blankets on the plane. For food, they work with a Michelin chef and use local ingredients. This helps reduce carbon pollution and waste. On the ground, they use electric cars and solar panels to save energy.

**Foreign Investors Stop Buying for 4 Days, Sell Many Yuanta FHC Shares**

Today, the Taiwan stock market went down by 324.06 points and closed at 22256.02. Foreign investors sold NT$3.122 billion worth of stocks, ending their four-day buying period. They had bought a total of NT$132 billion over those four days.

Foreign investors sold the most shares of Yuanta Financial Holding Company, over 85,000 shares. They also sold a lot of Fubon Financial, Inventec, Hon Hai, and Innolux shares. On the other hand, foreign investors bought the most shares of Acer, followed by Chang Hwa Bank, Cathay Financial Holding, Nanya Technology, and Taiwan Mobile.

Experts say there are three main reasons for the market drop. First, there's some uncertainty about US tariffs from former President Trump. Second, it's the end of the second financial quarter, so big investors are changing their holdings. Third, the Taiwan dollar's value is changing, which could mean less profit for companies that export goods. However, the US stock market is still strong, so the Taiwan market might go up again soon.

**Is the Gap Between Rich and Poor Getting Bigger? Taiwan's Finance Ministry Says Taiwan is Better Than Some Countries**

Taiwan's Ministry of Finance said today that in 2023, Taiwan's Gini coefficient per person was 0.272. This number is lower than that of China, Japan, South Korea, the United States, France, and Germany. The Gini coefficient is a way to measure how evenly money is shared. A smaller number means money is shared more equally. So, Taiwan's money is shared more equally than in many other countries.

The Ministry shared information from income tax forms for 2023. About 6.88 million people filed taxes. The lowest 5% of earners had an average income of NT$43,000, while the highest 5% had an average of NT$5.408 million.

However, the Ministry also said that this tax information doesn't include all income, like government help or tax-free money. So, it's not the best way to really know about the wealth gap. It's better to look at information from the government's statistics office for that. Compared to other countries, Taiwan's Gini coefficient (0.272) is better than many, but a little higher than the Netherlands (0.257).
