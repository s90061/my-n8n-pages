            <h1>Wildfires Spread in Spain's Picos de Europa, Famous Santiago Pilgrimage Route Closed</h1>
            <p>(Leon, Central News Agency, August 18th) Wildfires have been burning for many days in Spain. Today, they spread to the southern part of the Picos de Europa mountains. The Spanish government has announced that some parts of the famous "El Camino de Santiago" (St. James's Way) are now closed. This old pilgrimage path brings many visitors every year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that St. James's Way connects France with Santiago de Compostela, a city in western Spain. People believe that the remains of St. James are buried there. The government of the Castile and Leon region has closed about 50 kilometers of the route between Astorga and Ponferrada. They have also told climbers not to put their lives in danger.</p>
            <p>Highways and train lines near St. James's Way are also closed. Thousands of travelers come to this old pilgrimage route every summer.</p>
            <p>In the past few weeks, there have been about 20 wildfires in the Galicia and Castile and Leon regions. A heatwave lasting 16 days has made the fires worse. The fires have burned over 115,000 hectares of land.</p>
            <p>Spain's Defense Minister, Margarita Robles, told Cadena Ser radio: "We have not seen fires like this in the last 20 years. These big fires show signs of climate change and strong heatwaves."</p>
            <p>She said that thick smoke made it hard for helicopters and planes to fight the fires.</p>
            <p>The Spanish army has sent 1,900 soldiers to help put out the fires.</p>
            <p>One firefighter died when his fire truck crashed on a forest road near Espinoso de Compludo village. Now, a total of four firefighters have died.</p>
            <p>Spain's Interior Minister said that since June, 92 people have been investigated for starting fires, and 27 people have been arrested.</p>
            <p>Southern Europe is having one of its worst wildfire seasons in 20 years. Spain is one of the countries most affected.</p>
            <p>According to the Institute for Nature and Forest Conservation (ICNF), wildfires have burned 155,000 hectares of land in Portugal this year so far. This is three times more than the average for the same time from 2006 to 2024. About half of this land burned in the last three days.</p>
            <p>Robles said that the situation will likely not get better unless the heatwave, with temperatures up to 45 degrees Celsius, cools down tonight or tomorrow.</p>
            <p>This heatwave is the third hottest since Spain's national weather agency started tracking temperatures in 1975. Most of the country is on high alert for wildfires.</p>

            <h1>Chiang Wan-an: If the President Asks Tong Zixian to Form a Cabinet, It Will Be a New Start for Talking</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, Central News Agency, August 18th) Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said today that last year he invited Tong Zixian, the head of Pegatron, to give a speech. After seeing the recent meetings about whether the Third Nuclear Power Plant should keep running, he truly believes President Lai Ching-te should ask Tong Zixian to form a cabinet. If the President is willing to do this, it will be a new start for talking in Taiwan, Chiang Wan-an said.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an wrote on Facebook that last year, when Tong Zixian spoke at a city meeting about "Industry Development and World Situations," he already guessed the big problems Taiwan's industries would soon face. At that time, Chiang Wan-an told his colleagues, "We should find someone like him to form a cabinet."</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an said that after watching the public meetings about whether the Third Nuclear Power Plant should continue operating, he truly feels that President Lai should invite Mr. Tong Zixian to form a cabinet.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an also asked everyone to go and vote. He asked them to vote for Taiwan's energy plan and to vote "yes" for extending the life of the Third Nuclear Power Plant. This vote, he said, is actually a vote of no confidence in the Democratic Progressive Party and the President.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an stated that since the big recall election, trust between the ruling party and the opposition has been broken many times. If the President is willing to ask Tong Zixian to form a cabinet, he believes it will be the beginning of new talks in Taiwanese society.</p>
