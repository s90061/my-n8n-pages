            <h1>China's Minister of Industry Meets Apple CEO Cook, Hopes Apple Will Grow in China</h1>
            <p>China's Minister of Industry and Information Technology, Li Lecheng, met with Apple CEO Tim Cook in Beijing today, October 15. Minister Li hopes that Apple will continue to work deeply in the Chinese market and join in China's new industrial development.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cook is visiting China. According to a message on China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology's WeChat account on October 15, Minister Li Lecheng met with Cook and his team in Beijing today. They talked about how Apple is growing in China and how they can work more together in electronics and information technology.</p>
            <p>Minister Li said that China has a very big market and a complete industry system. This means there are many chances for investment and spending. China will keep opening up to foreign businesses. It will also work hard to make industries smart and make smart products. This will create a good business environment for Apple and other foreign companies.</p>
            <p>Minister Li stressed that he hopes Apple will continue to grow in the Chinese market. He also wants Apple to actively join China's new industrial progress and work with other Chinese companies in the supply chain to create new things together.</p>
            <p>According to what the Chinese government shared, during the meeting, Mr. Cook thanked the Chinese government for supporting Apple's growth in China. He said that Apple will keep investing more in China and improve their cooperation. This will help both sides grow and benefit.</p>
            <p>According to a report from The Paper on October 14, Mr. Cook's public schedule in China started on October 13. First, he visited "THE MONSTERS 10th Anniversary Exhibition" in Shanghai. In the evening, he appeared on Apple's Douyin live stream. On October 14, he visited Lilith Games in Shanghai.</p>
            <p>Apple's Chief Operating Officer, Sabih Khan, who started his job in July, also came to China with Mr. Cook.</p>
            <p>Mr. Khan said that over the past five years, Apple has invested more than 1 billion Chinese Yuan (which is over 4.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars) in its research labs in Shenzhen and Shanghai. These labs are still getting bigger. These investments help create new and valuable things for users in China and all over the world.</p>

            <h1>Fengyuan High School's Safety Officer's Punishment Cancelled; Taichung City Government Says Mediations Cannot Be Reviewed by the Same Department</h1>
            <p>A student at Fengyuan High School in Taichung sadly ended their life after being bullied. The school's safety officer was punished with a demerit, but this punishment has been cancelled. This happened because the school used the wrong rules to give the punishment. The safety officer went to court, and they reached an agreement to remove the demerit. Now, the Taichung City Government has ordered that from now on, when government offices and schools try to resolve issues through mediation, the same office that first gave the punishment cannot decide if they accept the outcome.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung City Council's Civil Affairs Committee held a meeting. City council members from the Democratic Progressive Party, Hsieh Chih-chung, Chang Yu-yen, Huang Shou-da, and Wang Li-jen, asked questions about the Fengyuan High School bullying case. They pointed out that the school used the wrong rules for punishments. The safety officer, Mr. Huang, filed a lawsuit and settled the case, leading to his demerit being removed. However, the Education Bureau, which is in charge, did not know about this.</p>
            <p>Director of the Legal Affairs Bureau, Li Shan-chih, explained that the school believed Mr. Huang, the safety officer, disciplined the student wrongly. Because safety officers are hired staff and have a contract with the school, the school should have punished him according to their contract. But instead, they wrongly used the Public Officials Performance Evaluation Act. Mr. Huang then asked for a review, but the review committee said it wasn't an official administrative decision, so they did not handle it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li Shan-chih added that Mr. Huang later filed a lawsuit. The judge thought the school used the wrong rules and suggested that both sides agree to a settlement. The school (Fengyuan High School) was the one who gave the punishment, and the safety officer was the one who complained. Only these two parties would know about the agreement. The Education Bureau was not directly involved, so it did not receive any notice. For important events, schools should report to the department in charge.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Chih-chung said it was ridiculous that for such a serious school safety incident, Fengyuan High School only sent a staff member from the human resources office to the mediation meeting. Li Shan-chih believes that after the settlement and the original punishment is removed, the school should give a new punishment using the correct rules.</p>
            <p>Wang Li-jen said that this problem only came out a year later. He noted that many people are now talking about it. He also said that some teachers who are not doing their job well might try to use this legal method to cancel their punishments from schools. He asked the city government to fully investigate if other people are also trying to cancel their punishments this way.</p>
            <p>Deputy Mayor Lai Shu-hui replied that the Education Bureau did not receive any report from the school. She explained that the system for settlements and mediations in administrative lawsuits is new, put in place after a law change. Judges use it to reduce the number of lawsuits. The city government has now asked all its offices and schools that when they have mediations or settlements, the original office that gave the punishment cannot decide whether to accept the result.</p>

            <h1>Thanking Disaster Relief Heroes: Puyan Shunze Temple to Give Out 5,800 "Shovel Superhero" Hats</h1>
            <p>Shunze Temple in Puyan, Changhua, wants to thank all the kind volunteers from Taiwan who helped with disaster relief in Guangfu Township, Hualien. So, the temple has made special "Shovel Superhero" hats. People can get one of these limited edition hats for free. They just need to sign up online first and then show photos of themselves helping at the disaster site. The temple plans to give out 5,800 hats.</p>
            <p>A lake blockage at Mata'an Stream in Hualien broke, causing a lot of damage to Guangfu Township. Many "shovel superheroes" from different places came to help. Staff from Shunze Temple told CNA today that they made these special "Shovel Superhero" hats to thank all the volunteers and disaster relief heroes for their selfless help. The hats have "Shovel Superhero, Go Hualien!" written on them and a picture of a shovel. This makes them very special.</p>
            <p>The temple said they will give out the hats on October 18, 19, 24, 25, 26, and November 1, 2, 8, 9, from 9 AM to 5 PM. People should first send a message on Facebook to sign up, giving their name and the date they want to pick up the hat. Then, they need to go to the service desk in the main temple and show a photo of themselves helping at the disaster scene. After that, they can get a "Shovel Superhero" hat for free.</p>
            <p>In 2019, a Norwegian triathlon athlete named Gustav Iden won a world championship in Nice, France. He became famous because he was wearing a hat with "Shunze Temple" written on it. Because of this, the Shunze Temple hat is now called the "Champion Hat."</p>
