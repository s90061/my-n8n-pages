<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7333/8837358">https://udn.com/news/story/7333/8837358</a>

China‚Äôs aviation authority has banned passengers from bringing power banks without a 3C mark on flights, starting today. According to media reports and traveler experiences, signs and security checks at different airports vary. Some check at least twice, while others remind passengers many times before the main check.

This year, there have been many cases of power banks (also called 'charging treasures' in China) and other lithium battery products catching fire or smoking on planes in China. On June 26, China's aviation authority issued an urgent notice. From June 28, passengers cannot bring power banks that don't have a 3C mark, have an unclear 3C mark, or are recalled models on domestic Chinese flights.

A reporter from 'Hong Kong 01' visited Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport in Gansu on June 27. They found that almost every power bank carried by travelers was checked separately. Airport staff said that from June 28, local power banks without a 3C mark cannot be used on domestic flights. However, they are allowed for flights outside mainland China (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). Also, if a power bank is made and bought overseas, it can be taken on any flight in or out of mainland China.

The 'Beijing News' reported on June 28 that Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport Terminal 2 has put up signs about the 'new power bank rules' in clear places, like the security entrance, check-in areas, and security lanes. These signs tell passengers which power banks they cannot bring on planes.

At the security entrance of the terminal, there is a 'power bank self-discard bin.' This is to remind passengers to check if their power banks follow the new rules. If not, they can choose to leave them, or have family take them, or send them by mail. This helps avoid going into the security area and then having to leave. Airport staff said that by only 8 AM on June 28, they had already collected three large baskets of power banks that passengers chose not to bring.

Hubei's 'Changjiang Cloud News' interviewed Ms. Deng, who checked in at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport this morning. She said that after checking her luggage, passengers must first go through a special security check for power banks before entering the regular security area for flights. All power banks in bags will be checked. If there is no 3C mark, they will be taken away. If they pass the check, they will get a 'checked' sticker.

Another Chinese internet user who flew from Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 3 today shared their experience. They saw new signs at the check-in counter. On the way to security, staff held up signs to remind people. When putting items on the tray for security, staff checked them. After going through the X-ray machine, someone checked again. In total, there were 5 reminders.

**Many important people showed up! Bezos‚Äôs 3-day ‚ÄúVenice Wedding of the Century‚Äù created over 30 billion NTD in economic benefits**

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV host, held a 3-day wedding celebration in Venice this week. Many important guests from movies, finance, and entertainment came. Reuters collected details about this 'wedding of the century,' including its grand features and the amazing economic benefits it created.

Wedding Cost: On June 24, Luca Zaia, the head of the Veneto region (where Venice is), told the media that Bezos and Sanchez's wedding invited around 200 to 250 guests. The cost is expected to be about 40 to 48 million Euros (around 1.4 to 1.68 billion New Taiwan Dollars). Italy's tourism ministry also released a study on June 27. It estimated that the whole wedding's effect on the local economy reached 957 million Euros (about 33.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars). Of this, 896 million Euros (about 31.4 billion New Taiwan Dollars) came from how much media attention it got. The rest came from direct or indirect spending for the event. For example, hotel and venue costs were about 28.4 million Euros (about 1 billion New Taiwan Dollars), and transportation and other services cost about 17.6 million Euros (about 620 million New Taiwan Dollars).

Venice Wedding Venues: The wedding celebration started on the evening of June 26. It took place in the cloister of the Madonna dell'Orto Church in the Cannaregio area of Venice. This old church has many great works by the 16th-century painter Tintoretto. On June 27, the couple exchanged rings on San Giorgio Maggiore Island, across from St. Mark's Square. Matteo Bocelli, the son of Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, sang at the ceremony. The main party on June 28 was at the 'Arsenale,' which was once a famous shipyard for the Republic of Venice. Many news outlets reported that Lady Gaga and Elton John would perform at the evening party.

Who Attended?: Ivanka Trump, daughter of former US President Trump, and her husband Jared Kushner were among the first guests to arrive in Venice on June 24. Later, dozens of other top celebrities arrived. These included Bill Gates, recently single actor Orlando Bloom, NFL legend Tom Brady, the Queen of Jordan, American TV star Oprah, and reality TV star Kim Kardashian and her sisters. Bezos and Sanchez arrived in Venice by helicopter on June 25.

Where Guests Stayed: To welcome the wedding guests, many luxury hotels in Venice were fully booked. These included the Cipriani Hotel on Giudecca Island and the St. Regis Hotel near St. Mark's Square. Bezos and Sanchez stayed at the famous Aman Venice hotel. Their room overlooked the Grand Canal, and one night cost at least 4,000 Euros (about 140,000 New Taiwan Dollars). This hotel was also where American actor George Clooney married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014.

Bezos and Sanchez's Charity Donations: Bezos and Sanchez announced they would donate a total of 3 million Euros to three organizations in Venice. Each organization will get 1 million Euros (about 105 million New Taiwan Dollars). These are CORILA, a group that studies the lagoon's environment, the local UNESCO office, and Venice International University.

**Lai Ching-te: Citizens Start Big Recall, DPP Must Join**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8837330">https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8837330</a>

President Lai Ching-te, who is also the head of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), said at the party's national congress today that citizens are starting a big recall movement, and the DPP must support them. They must work together to protect the country. After Lai Ching-te spoke, DPP representatives and officials in the audience shouted, 'Big recall, big success!'

Lai Ching-te pointed out that the DPP has always supported what society agrees on to protect Taiwan's sovereignty. Now, China's threats to Taiwan's democracy have caught the country's attention. However, the government's defense budget and national security laws are being blocked by the opposition parties.

Lai Ching-te said that in this situation, the people of Taiwan feel a new strength for national safety. Not only have 'Bluebirds' (a protest movement) appeared, but citizens have also started a big recall movement. The DPP must join them and take on the responsibility of protecting the country.

Lai Ching-te stated that democratic leader Huang Hsin-chieh once loudly told the public, 'Everyone, walk forward with me, walk towards freedom, walk towards democracy.' He also wants to tell all of Taiwan's democratic partners to follow in the footsteps of past democratic leaders, make democracy stronger, and build a better Taiwan for the next generation.`;
