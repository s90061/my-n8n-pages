            <h1>OPEC+ Agrees to Increase Oil Supply, Oil Prices Fall</h1>
            <p>Today, international oil prices went down. This happened because traders were thinking about two things. First, the group of oil-producing countries (OPEC+) agreed to pump a lot more oil. Second, the United States threatened to punish India for buying oil from Russia. This second point helped reduce worries that there would be too much oil on the market.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which is for delivery in September, dropped by $1.04. It is now $66.29 per barrel. The price of Brent crude oil from the North Sea, which is for delivery in October, fell by 91 cents. It is now $68.76 per barrel.</p>

            <p>Today, all four main stock indexes on Wall Street went up. Investors bought stocks when prices were lower. They did not worry about the economy in the United States. Instead, they focused on the chance that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates.</p>

            <h1>Trump Criticizes India for Buying Russian Oil, India Says It Is Unfair</h1>
            <p>The Indian government said today that the United States and the European Union are unfairly targeting India. This is because India buys oil from Russia. India said it will protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>President Donald Trump said he would make import taxes on India higher. This is because India buys a lot of oil from Russia and then sells it for a big profit. India's government spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, said in a statement that acting against India is "unfair and unreasonable."</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Just like any big economy, India will do everything needed to protect its country's interests and economic safety."</p>
            <p>India started buying a lot of Russian oil after Russia attacked Ukraine. Before this, Europe was the main buyer, but they stopped buying. This gave Russia a market to sell its oil.</p>
            <p>But India said today that it "started importing from Russia because its usual oil suppliers sent their oil to Europe after the war began."</p>
            <p>India also said that the United States "actively told India to import this kind of oil to help keep the world's energy market stable."</p>
            <p>India also said that the European Union and the United States are being unfair because they still trade with Russia. Mr. Jaiswal said, "The truth is, the countries that criticize India are the ones that allow their own trade with Russia."</p>
            <p>The statement explained that Europe trades with Russia not only for energy but also for fertilizers, minerals, chemicals, steel, and machines. For the United States, it continues to buy uranium for nuclear power and palladium for electric cars from Russia, as well as fertilizers and chemicals.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Mr. Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social. He wrote that India is "buying a lot of Russian oil" and selling it for "huge profits."</p>
            <p>Trump also wrote, "Because of this, I will greatly increase the import taxes India has to pay to the United States." He did not say exactly how much the taxes would be.</p>
            <p>Currently, the United States has a 10% tax on goods from India. This tax is expected to go up to 25% on August 7th. Last month, the EU and the UK tried to make Russia's oil cheaper to put more pressure on Russia to stop the war in Ukraine.</p>
