            <h1>Taiwan Men's Basketball Team Loses Closely to Poland, Misses Best Record at Universiade</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 24, Central News Agency reporter Chen Jung-chen) Today, Taiwan's men's basketball team played in the 9th to 12th place playoffs at the Universiade in Rhine-Ruhr, Germany. Hsu Te-chi scored 17 points, the most for his team, and had 5 assists. However, Taiwan still lost closely to Poland, 87 to 89. This means they cannot break their best record in the team's history.</p>
            <p>In the last Universiade in Chengdu, China, Taiwan's men's basketball team got their best result ever, finishing 11th. This time, the team is still led by team captain Yu Ai-che, who plays abroad. Other players from Taiwan's professional league, like Lin Hsin-kuan and Chen Fan-po-yen, are also on the team. But in the group stage, they only won one game, so they could not get into the top 8. Luckily, after a big win against India yesterday, Taiwan's men's basketball team moved on to the 9th to 12th place playoffs.</p>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's men's basketball team played against Poland. They tried hard to get into the 9th or 10th place playoffs and make a new best record for the team. They started well in the first quarter. But their shooting accuracy went down in the second quarter. Taiwan's team was behind by 2 points at halftime.</p>
            <p>After the break, the game was still very close. Taiwan's team stayed close in points. At the start of the fourth quarter, they made a 9-3 run and took the lead again. Even though Poland caught up later, Li Yun-chieh and Sung Hsin-hao made shots from outside right before the end. This helped Taiwan's team tie the score and have a chance to play in overtime.</p>
            <p>However, when they were behind by 2 points, Hsu Te-chi took the last shot but did not make it. So, Taiwan's men's basketball team lost closely to Poland. They will not be able to get their best team record. Next, they will play against Latvia for 11th place. If they lose that game, they will finish 12th in this Universiade.</p>
            <p>In this game, five players from Taiwan's men's basketball team scored ten points or more. Hsu Te-chi scored the most with 17 points, also getting 5 assists and 2 steals. The shooter Li Yun-chieh played for less than 12 minutes but scored 14 points very well, including 4 three-point shots. Captain Yu Ai-che showed he could do many things, giving 10 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 3 steals. (Editor: Chen Yen-chun) July 24, 2025.</p>

            <h1>After US Rules Tighten, British Media Says $1 Billion in Nvidia Chips Still Go to China</h1>
            <p>(Hong Kong, July 24, Central News Agency) The British newspaper "Financial Times" reported today that over three months after the United States made chip export rules stricter, advanced artificial intelligence chips from NVIDIA, worth at least 1 billion US dollars (about 29.3 billion New Taiwan dollars), still went into China.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times report used sales contracts, company papers, and information from many people who knew about the situation. It said that NVIDIA B200 high-level processors, which are not allowed to be sold to China, are very common in China's growing black market for US chips.</p>
            <p>NVIDIA told Reuters that using smuggled products to build data centers is not good, either for technology or money. This is because NVIDIA only gives help and support for products that are officially allowed.</p>
            <p>Last week, NVIDIA said that the US President Donald Trump's government removed the rules about sending chips like H20 out of the country. After this, NVIDIA was allowed to keep selling these chips to China. These rules were put in place in April this year.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times report made it clear that within three months after the export rules started, Chinese sellers in Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces sold NVIDIA B200 processors, as well as H100 and H200 processors, which are under rules.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not answer requests for comments right away. Reuters could also not check the Financial Times report by themselves. (Translator: Hung Chi-yuan / Editor: Chen Yen-chun) July 24, 2025.</p>
