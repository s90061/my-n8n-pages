            <h1>Bora Pharma's CDMO Business Grows, Half-Year Earnings Per Share Reach NT$19.5</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals has released its financial report for the first half of the year. Its total income was NT$9.347 billion. Because its CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) business grew, the company's net profit was NT$2.016 billion. This is an 11.9% increase from last year. The company's earnings per share (EPS) were NT$19.5, which is almost twice the company's initial capital.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharma announced today that its CDMO business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year, reaching over NT$5.01 billion. This growth includes internal orders and is due to more production capacity and new types of medicines. However, during a period of combining different parts of the company, there were delays in production at its sterile injection factory in Maryland, USA, and its Zhunan factory in Taiwan. This slowed down their progress. But this problem got better in June, and delayed orders will be filled soon. The company has a clear view of its orders and strong long-term demand.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharma said that it continues to invest more in its CDMO business around the world. The company recently added a new production line in Canada for filling high-performance skin medicines. This will allow them to produce these orders faster, in larger amounts, and with more flexibility. This will help the Canadian factory grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injection production line in Maryland, USA, is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. Starting in 2026, the AST isolated filling system's automatic lines will gradually begin to operate. Also, in the first half of this year, clinical trial customers at the Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, became closer, long-term partners. Many drug companies have started to sign contracts because they want to use the benefits of manufacturing in the USA.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheng Bao-hsi, the chairman of Bora Pharma, said that the CDMO business has gained 8 new customers this year. Most of these new customers are being handled by the Maple Grove factory, which focuses on manufacturing in North America. This year, new orders totaling US$138 million have been added. The new orders are mainly for the Canadian factory and the sterile drug factory. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was part of the integration from the TaiFu Biologics merger, has started working. The plan to increase production by 2000 liters has led many US drug companies that are in the later stages of development to ask about it.</p>
