            <h1>Indonesian Parliament Members' Housing Allowance Debate: Legitimacy and Public Opinion Differ</h1>
            <p>In Indonesia, a big protest has started because of the housing money for members of parliament (MPs). People are discussing if this money is fair. Those who support it say that new MPs do not get free places to live anymore, and many of them come from other cities. So, they should get money to help them. But people who are against it say the money is too much and not fair to ordinary people.</p>
            <p>The government says they are giving this new money because current MPs do not get free housing from the government like before. So, they should get money. They also said that many MPs are not from Jakarta, the capital city. When they work in Jakarta, they have to pay for their own place to live.</p>
            <p>Elisabeth Kramer, who works at the University of Sydney, wrote that many people became angry when they heard about the housing money. One reason is that the amount is very high, 50 million Indonesian Rupiah (about 93,280 New Taiwan Dollars). This is much more than what most Indonesian people earn. So, people think it is a waste of taxpayers' money.</p>
            <p>Because of the pressure, Sufmi Dasco Ahmad, a vice-speaker in the parliament, explained on August 26th that the money is only for one year, from October 2024 to October 2025. He also said it can only be used for housing. He disagreed with people who said it was a pay raise. But this explanation did not stop people from being angry.</p>
            <p>Critics say that politicians do not understand what normal people care about. Also, they say there is no clear way to see how politicians decide to spend government money, and no clear way to hold them responsible.</p>
            <p>A website called Kok Bisa compared how long it takes for politicians and normal people to buy a house. The results showed that with a politician's salary, it only takes 2 years and 1 month to buy a house. But for someone earning the minimum wage, it takes 38 years and 7 months to buy a house. Also, politicians do not pay their own income tax; the government pays it for them.</p>
            <p>People also want to know how the parliament first decided on the amount of money for the housing allowance. The Speaker of Parliament, Puan Maharani, defended the decision. She said they thought about it carefully and considered "the situation and prices in Jakarta."</p>
            <p>Two groups against corruption in Indonesia, "Indonesia Corruption Watch" and "Indonesian Institute," focused on how much politicians already earn. They said that politicians already get paid very well, so public money should not be used to pay for their housing.</p>
            <p>A group called "Forum Indonesia for Budget Transparency" (Fitra) thinks that politicians actually earn about 230 million Indonesian Rupiah (about 429,331 New Taiwan Dollars). In comparison, data from the Indonesian Statistics Bureau (BPS) showed that in August 2024, an average manager in Jakarta earned about 14,329,826 Indonesian Rupiah per month (about 26,750 New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Because politicians earn much more than the average salary in Jakarta, people say they do not deserve such high pay. They also say politicians are very far from understanding the lives of ordinary Indonesian people.</p>
            <p>Online discussions criticizing this decision mostly talk about how public money should be used correctly. They also say that Indonesian people, as taxpayers, should have a say in how much politicians are paid.</p>
            <p>Kramer pointed out that Indonesian people are used to politicians not meeting their hopes. This can be seen from the many corruption stories that the news often shows. But the housing money made people especially angry because they can easily compare it to their own income.</p>
            <p>Kramer stressed that more and more people are asking for politicians to be responsible and open to the public. This shows that society is not happy with the current situation. If this problem is not solved well, there could be more protests in the future.</p>

            <h1>Chinese Photographers and Makeup Artists Arrested in Hong Kong for Illegal Work</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong police recently arrested eight photographers and makeup artists from mainland China. They were working illegally in Hong Kong. The police believe these people contacted customers in Hong Kong using social media. Then, they came to Hong Kong especially to offer paid services.</p>
            <p>A high-level officer from Hong Kong's Immigration Department announced today that they had found people posting on social media, offering photography and makeup services. So, they pretended to be Hong Kong customers and got in touch with these people.</p>
            <p>The Immigration Department said that in an operation last week, they arrested four photographers and four makeup artists from mainland China. They also arrested two local people. The government charged seven of them, and two people have already been sent to prison.</p>
            <p>It was said that the photographers from mainland China mostly took pictures for customers in popular scenic places after coming to Hong Kong. They charged between 300 Hong Kong dollars (about 1,170 New Taiwan Dollars) and 2,000 Hong Kong dollars for each job. The makeup artists rented hotel rooms to offer their services to customers.</p>

            <h1>Portugal Lisbon Funicular Derailment Accident: No Taiwanese Group Tourists Affected</h1>
            <p>Today, Taiwan's Tourism Administration said that no travel agencies have told them about any Taiwanese tourist groups being affected by the bad accident in Lisbon, Portugal. A ground funicular train went off its tracks there, causing many deaths and injuries.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the yellow ground funicular train, called "Gloria Funicular," had an accident. It is one of Lisbon's most famous landmarks. It overturned near Liberty Avenue, and this caused 15 people to die and 18 people to get hurt.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the Tourism Administration told the media that they have not received any reports from travel agencies about affected tour groups. They also contacted the Taipei Economic and Cultural Center in Portugal, and it has not received any news about affected tour groups either.</p>
            <p>The Tourism Administration said it will continue to watch the situation and respond when needed.</p>
