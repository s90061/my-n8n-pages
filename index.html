        const text = `**Which Chipmakers Are at Risk if US Revokes China Waivers?**

The United States might cancel special permissions that allow global chipmakers to send American technology to China. This action could significantly impact certain chip companies, especially those dealing with advanced technology for AI and data centers. If these waivers are removed, major companies with large sales in China, such as Intel, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, could see a decrease in their income. This move would intensify the technology competition between the US and China, pushing chipmakers to change their supply chains and business plans.

**US Added Over 1,000 New Millionaires a Day Last Year, UBS Report Says**

According to a report from UBS, wealth grew at an unusually fast rate last year in the United States. Over 379,000 people became new U.S. dollar millionaires, which means more than 1,000 people became millionaires every day.

This indicates a significant increase in wealth concentration in the U.S. during the past year. The report highlights a trend where a large number of individuals achieved millionaire status, showing strong economic growth in certain sectors.

**Taiwan Adds Chinaâ€™s Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List**

Taiwanâ€™s Commerce Ministry has added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list. This decision is part of ongoing trade and technology tensions with China.

The move means that certain advanced technologies and products can no longer be sold to these Chinese companies without special permission from the Taiwanese government. This action by Taiwan aligns with similar measures taken by the United States, which has also imposed restrictions on Huawei and SMIC to limit Chinaâ€™s access to critical technologies, especially those related to advanced semiconductors.

This new control measure is expected to impact the global technology supply chain, as Taiwan is a major producer of semiconductors. The decision reflects Taiwan's efforts to protect its technological advantages and align with international partners on strategic trade policies.
