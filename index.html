            <h1>Russian Foreign Ministry: Visa-Free Travel for Chinese Tourists is Moving Forward</h1>
            <p>On September 29, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that Russia and China are working to allow Chinese tourists to visit without a visa. China started a trial period on September 15, allowing Russian citizens to visit for 30 days without a visa. Russian President Putin had previously said that Russia would do the same for Chinese citizens.</p>
            <p>According to Russia's Sputnik news agency on September 29, Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated that Russia and China are discussing removing visa requirements for Chinese tourists. Government departments from both countries are in contact. Zakharova said about the progress: "This work is being handled by departments from both countries, and a decision will be announced when it is finished."</p>
            <p>On September 2, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, announced that China would start a one-year trial on September 15, 2025, allowing Russians to visit for 30 days without a visa. Russian citizens with regular passports can enter China without a visa for business, tourism, sightseeing, visiting family and friends, exchanges, or transit, as long as their stay is not more than 30 days.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun said that with the leaders of China and Russia guiding the way, relations between the two countries remain strong. China cares a lot about making travel easier for people from both countries and supports more interactions between their citizens. This helps to build a "comprehensive strategic partnership for a new era between China and Russia." At that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting China.</p>
            <p>Later, on September 4, Putin said that Russia would do the same for Chinese citizens regarding visa-free travel. He said, "Please tell the Chinese leaders, our friends, and President Xi Jinping, that Russia will definitely respond to this friendly action in the same way, and we will also implement the same policy."</p>
            <p>Russian media also reported that since China started its trial visa-free policy for Russians, the number of Russians wanting to travel to China has increased by 50%. Popular places to visit include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sanya, and Harbin.</p>

            <h1>After Visiting Tibet and Xinjiang, Xi Jinping Says All Ethnic Groups Should Join the "Chinese National Family"</h1>
            <p>After Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping visited Tibet and Xinjiang, a Party magazine called "Qiushi" will publish his speech tomorrow. In the speech, he says that the creation of a "Chinese national community" is "a natural trend and a historical certainty." He adds that all ethnic groups can have a better future only if they keep uniting and "willingly join the 'Chinese national family'."</p>
            <p>Xinhua news agency reported that this article, titled "The Formation and Development of the Chinese National Community is What People Want, a Natural Trend, and a Historical Certainty," comes from Xi Jinping's speech on September 27 at the "National Conference on Ethnic Unity and Progress." Xi Jinping had just visited Tibet in late August and Xinjiang in late September, and he attended the 60th and 70th-anniversary celebrations of the two autonomous regions' governments.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that the Chinese nation is a great nation with over 5,000 years of civilization. He stated that all ethnic groups in China "together opened up the vast territory of the motherland, together built a unified multi-ethnic country, together wrote a brilliant Chinese history, together created a splendid Chinese culture, and together developed a great national spirit."</p>
            <p>He declared that the formation and development of the "Chinese national community" is "what people want, a natural trend, and a historical certainty." He said that all ethnic groups are connected by blood, which is the historical basis for the "Chinese national community." The Chinese nation is the result of long-term interactions and blending of all ethnic groups. He believes that only by "constantly uniting and blending, and willingly joining the Chinese national family, can all ethnic groups have a better future."</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping also said that all ethnic groups share the same beliefs, which is the inner strength that created China as a unified multi-ethnic country. He stressed that a unified multi-ethnic China was "built by all ethnic groups together," and it must also be "maintained, strengthened, and developed by all ethnic groups together." He claimed that all ethnic groups "share a common culture," which is the cultural reason for "the Chinese nation to create a diverse and unified civilization."</p>
            <p>He stated that the bright Chinese culture was created by all ethnic groups together. To achieve "new greatness in socialist culture," it is important to "constantly increase acceptance of Chinese culture and continually improve cultural exchange and integration among all ethnic groups."</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that all ethnic groups depend on each other economically, which is a strong force for the Chinese nation to build a unified economy. He believes that only by "constantly joining the larger national development" and improving economic exchange and cooperation can all regions and ethnic groups better help the country's economy grow and better achieve their own economic development.</p>
            <p>He declared that all ethnic groups feel close to each other, which is a strong bond for the idea of "the Chinese nation as one family." He said that all people from different ethnic groups should value this greatly, and keep making the "socialist ethnic relationships of equality, unity, mutual help, and harmony" stronger. This will build a stronger human foundation for the "Chinese national community."</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping emphasized that in China, "all ethnic groups have a common home, which is China; all have a common identity, which is the Chinese nation; all have a common name, which is Chinese people; and all have a common dream, which is to achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation."</p>

            <h1>Cloud Gate's "Wanderer Project": Liao Chialin and 5 Other Young Creators Chosen</h1>
            <p>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre's "Wanderer Project" is now in its 19th year. With support from the Acer Foundation and its chairman, Stan Shih, this year six young creators, including designer Liao Chialin, have been chosen. They will each start their in-depth journeys in 2026.</p>
            <p>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre announced today that these six award winners are all under 30 years old. They work in various fields such as video, music, architecture, fiber art, contemporary art, and outdoor design. Their project ideas cover natural healing, ethnic cultures, art creation, and environmental issues. This shows how sensitive the younger generation is to life and land, and their bravery in exploring new things.</p>
            <p>One of the selected participants is Liao Chialin, a designer who had brain tumor surgery at age 22 and found her body's strength again through hiking. She will travel to New Zealand to record how mountains heal, with her project titled "The Body is a Healing Mountain." Yang Kaiting, co-writer and producer of the TV series "Life Cleaners," will go to Mongolia and Turkey to collect sounds from shamanic rituals and Sufi whirling dances, starting a journey of artistic exploration across cultures.</p>
            <p>Artists Shih Tzuting, travel brand owner Liu Chanlun, fiber artist Teng Shaochen, and architect Lin Hsinyu will each connect with the land in their own ways. Their projects range from using industrial waste to weaving in nature, and from island culture to mining landscapes. Together, they show the diverse interests of this year's wanderers.</p>
            <p>Stan Shih, Chairman of the Acer Foundation, who calls himself an "old wanderer," remembers how his mother let him "wander" north for a month when he was in high school. "Around 1961, going from Lukang to Taipei was a big deal!" Shih believes that "wandering means constantly entering unfamiliar areas, which makes your mind work, brings new ideas, and helps you do more valuable things for society."</p>
            <p>Cloud Gate stated that young people should travel and face new situations to broaden their view of the world and build their creativity for the future. Cloud Gate thanks the Acer Foundation for more than 10 years of continuous support for the "Wanderer Project." Since 2004, the project has helped 174 young people explore different cultures and places, opening up possibilities for even more young people.</p>
