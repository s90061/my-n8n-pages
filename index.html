            <h1>Hualien County Government Rescues Baby Masked Palm Civet, Sends for Professional Care to Help Return to Nature</h1>
            <p>A mother masked palm civet likely died after being hit by a car in Hualien City. A baby masked palm civet was found alive at the scene. Workers from the county's Animal and Plant Disease Control Center took the baby animal to a safe place. Today, it was sent to the Yewan Wildlife Rescue Center for care. After they check its health, it will be released back into nature at the right time.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Government's Agriculture Department said today that on the evening of September 15, they received a report from the city office. They found a masked palm civet mother that seemed to have died after being hit by a car near the intersection of 16gu Avenue and Zhongyang Road in the city. There was also a living baby animal. Workers from the Animal and Plant Disease Control Center took the baby civet that night. For two days, they checked the area around but did not find any other baby animals.</p>
            <p>Because the baby animal still needs milk and special care, the county's Agriculture Department quickly started rescue actions. Today, a special person took the baby masked palm civet to the "Yewan Wildlife Rescue Center" in Chishang, Taitung. It will get medical care, food, and training to live in the wild. This will help the baby animal grow safely. Later, after they check its condition, it will go back to nature.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Shu-wen, the head of the Agriculture Department, said that masked palm civets are medium-sized wild mammals native to Taiwan. They live in mountains, hills, and farms. They are very important for keeping the balance of nature. However, in recent years, many animals have died on roads. Animals being hit by cars is now one of their biggest dangers.</p>
            <p>She added that October 4th is "World Animal Day." She reminds people to drive slowly and be careful when they are in mountain areas, farmlands, or near rivers. This will help fewer wild animals get hit by cars when they accidentally go onto roads.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou-Huang De-rong, the director of the Hualien County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center, asks everyone to protect wild animals. But he also reminds people to be careful about diseases that can spread between animals and humans. The risk of rabies is still high in Hualien County. People must follow "two don'ts and one do": Don't abandon your pets, don't touch, catch, or keep wild animals, and do take your dogs and cats to get vaccinated every year.</p>
            <p>For the second half of the year, rabies vaccination services will be offered in Wanrong Township (October 27th to 31st) and Zhuoxi Township (November 4th to 21st). People can bring their pets to get vaccinated. For more details on dates, times, and places, you can check the Hualien County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center's official website or Facebook page, or ask your local government office.</p>

            <h1>Lee Jae-myung's First 100 Days: TIME Magazine Interview Reveals Challenges in Korea-US Trade Talks</h1>
            <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung has been in office for a little over 100 days. Today, an interview with him was published in "TIME Magazine" from the United States. The article praised Lee Jae-myung's good diplomacy when he met with former US President Donald Trump in late August. But it also showed the problems he faced in trade talks between Korea and the US.</p>
            <p>TIME Magazine reported that Lee Jae-myung showed great diplomatic skill at that time. He gave President Trump a golf club made just for him with his name on it. He also gave him two cowboy hats with "Make America Great Again" (MAGA) written on them, and a model of a "turtle ship" which is a symbol of Korea's shipbuilding history. When Trump said he liked Lee Jae-myung's pen, Lee also gave it to him.</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung also said good things about the new decorations in the White House Oval Office, the rising stock market, and Trump's diplomatic abilities.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting between the leaders of the US and Korea, there was some worry. Hours earlier, Trump had posted on "Truth Social," a social media site, "What is happening in South Korea?" He also suggested that the investigation into former President Yoon Suk Yeol seemed like a "purge or revolution." Lee Jae-myung's team was worried that they might face a sudden diplomatic "surprise attack," like Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
            <p>However, their meeting ended up being friendly. Trump even said Lee Jae-myung was "a very good person." Of course, Lee Jae-myung also brought a huge amount of money, 500 billion US dollars, in addition to gifts and praise. This also helped. Besides the 350 billion US dollars of investment that the US and Korea had already agreed on, Lee Jae-myung announced another 150 billion US dollars investment in the US. This included Korean Air buying Boeing airplanes worth 50 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>But later, Lee Jae-myung faced tough questions about the 350 billion US dollar investment fund: Was all the investment in cash? Who would lose money if the investments failed? Lee Jae-myung said that the US's demands were so strict, "If I accepted, I would be impeached! So I asked the US negotiation team to suggest a more reasonable alternative."</p>
            <p>TIME Magazine pointed out that because the US and Korea still disagreed on these matters, Lee Jae-myung might have focused on praising Trump's earlier diplomatic successes with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He also asked Trump to talk to North Korea again. Professor Naomi Ike from Hokkaido University in Japan said, "Lee Jae-myung might be trying to make Trump pay less attention to trade and investment by talking about the North Korea issue."</p>
            <p>The leaders of the US and Korea seem very different. Trump was born rich, while Lee Jae-myung's gambling father was so poor he couldn't buy crayons. Trump has been sued many times for problems with workers' rights, while Lee Jae-myung, as a lawyer for workers' rights, was happy to take bad companies to court. Trump supports conservative ideas, and Lee Jae-myung's Democratic Party believes in liberal and progressive ideas.</p>
            <p>Even so, Lee Jae-myung believes he can build a good relationship with Trump. This is because both of them had unusual lives growing up and a strong desire to succeed.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Democratic Party was not very warm towards the US, and was unfriendly towards Japan, their former colonizer. They also preferred to have good relations with China.</p>
            <p>However, before Lee Jae-myung visited Washington D.C. in late August, he visited Tokyo first. He said that the world's situation has changed a lot. "We cannot go back to the old way of relying on the US for safety and on China for money."</p>
            <p>According to TIME Magazine, Lee Jae-myung said that Korea can be a "bridge" between powerful countries that don't get along. He also said, "Our democracy and free market values are built on the alliance between the US and Korea."</p>
            <p>He also mentioned, "But because we are close to China, and because of our shared history, money, and people going back and forth, we cannot completely cut ties with China. So, we need to manage our relationship well. I believe the Western world should understand this."</p>
            <p>About North Korea, Lee Jae-myung supports a policy of talking to Kim Jong Un's government in a careful way. This is to make North Korea stop making nuclear weapons and get some of the restrictions against them removed.</p>
            <p>He said, "If we tell North Korea to stop, will they stop their plans? I believe that if we continue to put pressure on them now, then... North Korea will keep making more nuclear bombs."</p>
            <p>Lee Jae-myung also said, "About the North Korean nuclear issue, we often think there are only two choices: accept North Korea's nuclear weapons, or make them get rid of all of them. But I think there is a middle way... We can talk with North Korea to stop its nuclear and missile plans."</p>

            <h1>Man Dies After Penile Enlargement Surgery; Tri-Service General Hospital Clarifies Dr. Ding Was Not a Head Doctor</h1>
            <p>Recently, a man sadly died after having surgery to make his penis larger. News reports said that "Dr. Ding, the surgeon, used to be a head doctor at Tri-Service General Hospital." The hospital quickly said tonight that, after checking, there has never been a doctor with that name on their list of head doctors.</p>
            <p>A 50-year-old man had surgery to make his penis larger at a cosmetic clinic on Jinzhou Street in Zhongshan District, Taipei City. After the surgery, he stopped breathing and his heart stopped. He died there. Today, the police told the prosecutor to come and check the body. The police then sent Dr. Ding, the surgeon, to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office. He is being investigated for causing death by being careless.</p>
            <p>Tri-Service General Hospital released a statement tonight to make things clear. They said that news reports about Dr. Ding being a head doctor at their hospital are wrong. They checked, and Dr. Ding has never worked as a head doctor at Tri-Service General Hospital. The hospital wanted to correct this mistake to protect its good name.</p>
