            <h1>Central and Local Governments Work Together to Protect Penghu's Ocean</h1>
            <p>Guan Bi-ling, who is in charge of the Ocean Affairs Council, said in Penghu today that the lives of Penghu people are closely linked to the ocean. The ocean gives a lot, and we cannot ignore it. The central government and local government are working together. This shows they are determined to protect ocean resources.</p>
            <p>Ms. Guan arrived in Penghu today. In the afternoon, she met with County Mayor Chen Guang-fu. They talked a lot about protecting the ocean, keeping the ocean clean, ocean safety, and keeping nature healthy forever. This meeting showed that the central and local governments want to work together to protect the ocean's resources.</p>
            <p>County Mayor Chen Guang-fu said that Penghu is surrounded by the sea. It has special ocean resources. For example, the Taiwan Shoal covers about 8800 square kilometers. The ocean is not just where Penghu people live. It is also very important for tourism and for keeping things going in the long term. He thanked the Ocean Affairs Council for always helping Penghu. This help includes checking water quality, protecting sea turtles, helping homes for animals and coral grow again, planting seagrass, and teaching about the ocean. All these things have really made Penghu better at managing its ocean.</p>
            <p>Ms. Guan pointed out that the ocean gives a lot and we cannot ignore it. The lives of Penghu people are closely linked to the ocean. She praised Penghu's efforts in beach cleaning, removing trash from the ocean, and protecting sea life. She also noted how well these efforts have worked. However, because new financial rules will start next year, the central government's budget will change. She hopes that local governments will continue to spend more on ocean matters. The central government will also keep giving the help and resources needed. Together, they will work for the goal of a healthy ocean that lasts forever.</p>

            <h1>Sung Sheng-jui Hit a Home Run After a "Warning," Thanks Coach for the Chance</h1>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui from the CTBC Brothers team hit a home run when he came in as a substitute player on August 3rd. He said that before the game, he told his teammates a "warning." He said if he didn't hit a home run later, it would be because of his weight training. He has hit 4 home runs in his last 6 games, showing he is playing very well. He thanked his coach for giving him chances even when he was not playing well. This helped him learn and grow from his mistakes.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui from the CTBC Brothers baseball team has been playing very well recently. From July 27th to 30th, he hit home runs in three games in a row. On August 3rd, in the game against the Rakuten Monkeys, he did not start the game. He joined the game in the 6th inning to play defense. In the 7th inning, he hit a solo home run. This was his 8th home run this season.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui spoke to reporters before today's game. He started by saying he had "something funny to say." He said that on August 3rd, before the game, he knew he would not start. So, he went to the weight training room to lift weights. His coach even asked him, "You have a game soon, why are you lifting weights?" Sung Sheng-jui said it was like a warm-up. He also gave his teammates a "warning" beforehand. He told them that if he came into the game later and didn't hit a home run, he would have an excuse: it was because of his weight training.</p>
            <p>Sung Sheng-jui also mentioned that at the beginning of July, he was not playing well. He didn't know what the problem was. Wang Wei-chen and Chiang Kun-yu helped him by watching. They tried to see if anything was different from before. He kept trying things, and now he is playing better and better.</p>
            <p>Including today's game, Sung Sheng-jui has played in all 77 games this season. He said that he is still not fully used to playing every day. But he told himself to keep going. He also thanked the head coach, Hirano Keiichi. The coach kept giving him chances to start even when he was not playing well before. By going through failures, he learned from them. He now knows how to adjust better.</p>
            <p>Talking about the differences this season, Sung Sheng-jui said that he planned to gain weight during the off-season. He also hired a trainer and learned many things at a training center in the United States. Taking in and using this knowledge helped him a lot. His mindset also changed. He now thinks positively to find problems. He does not think too much about a few failures. He faces each time at bat with a steady mindset.</p>
            <p>Hirano Keiichi once said that Sung Sheng-jui was his first choice for the lead-off hitter position. Sung Sheng-jui also said that he definitely hopes he can do well in this role. However, his ability to choose pitches this year is not very good yet. He hopes to quickly improve his "plate discipline."</p>

            <h1>Foreign Investors Buy NT$11.4 Billion for Second Day, Focus on Server Stocks</h1>
            <p>Taipei stocks went up by 281.65 points today, closing at 23660.59 points. Foreign and Chinese investors bought NT$11.488 billion worth of shares. This is the second day in a row they have bought more than they sold. They mainly bought server-related stocks. Wistron was bought the most, with 20,800 units. Inventec and Hon Hai also saw large buys, with 19,200 and 13,300 units respectively.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market rose strongly by over 200 points today. Electronic stocks led the increase. Companies that make cooling systems, robots, and smaller companies also received a lot of money from investors. The main index ended the day at 23660.59 points, up 281.65 points, which is a 1.2% increase. It stayed above all its moving average lines. The total amount of money traded was NT$367.844 billion.</p>
            <p>Today, self-trading brokers bought NT$4.525 billion, investment trust companies bought NT$3.982 billion, and foreign and Chinese investors bought NT$11.488 billion. All three types of major investors bought a total of NT$19.995 billion.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 stocks foreign investors bought, they were: Wistron (20,800 units), Taiwan Business Bank (20,400 units), Inventec (19,200 units), Hon Hai (13,300 units), Innolux (13,300 units), Yuanta High Dividend (0056) (12,300 units), Quanta (12,100 units), Asia Air Survey (8,058 units), Fuh Hwa Taiwan Equity Selected High Dividend (00919) (7,914 units), and AU Optronics (7,740 units).</p>
            <p>Investment trust companies bought a lot of financial stocks. The top 10 stocks they bought included CTBC Financial Holding, First Financial Holding, Taishin Financial Holding, Mega Financial Holding, Cathay Financial Holding, E.SUN Financial Holding, Fubon Financial Holding, Inventec, Yuanta Financial Holding, and E.SUN Financial Holding.</p>
            <p>Cai Ming-han, an assistant manager at Cathay Securities Investment Consulting, said that last Friday, bad economic news from the United States made US stocks fall sharply. But after thinking, the market saw the weaker economic data as a good sign because it increased the chance of interest rates being cut. This made US stocks go up again, which also made Taiwan stocks rise.</p>
            <p>Cai Ming-han explained that today, as Taiwan stocks went up, electronic stocks were the main reason. Also, because the risk in the market went down, smaller companies and the stock index for smaller companies also started to go up. This shows that the market is still in a strong upward trend. Even though the results of the MSCI index changes will be announced next week, these changes will only take effect at the end of the month. So, they will not affect the stock index much in the short term.</p>
