British inflation unexpectedly increased in August, reaching 6.7%, according to official figures. This is bad news for people hoping the Bank of England will soon cut interest rates. The increase, from 6.4% in July, surprised economists who predicted a further fall. Core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, also remained higher than expected at 6.2%.

This makes it more likely that the Bank of England will keep interest rates at their current level, or possibly even raise them again, in an attempt to control prices. High interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can slow down economic growth. The latest inflation figures will likely cause concern for households and businesses already struggling with the rising cost of living. The energy price cap is expected to rise again soon, which will probably push inflation even higher in the coming months. The government is under increasing pressure to find ways to support people and businesses through this difficult period.

**New Zealand Launches World's First Climate Change Curriculum for Schools**

New Zealand is introducing a new climate change curriculum in schools, making it the first country in the world to do so. The curriculum will be implemented across all year levels, from primary school to high school. It aims to give students the knowledge and skills they need to understand and respond to the challenges of climate change.

The curriculum will cover topics such as the science of climate change, its impacts on New Zealand and the world, and possible solutions. Students will also learn about climate justice, the role of individual actions, and how to advocate for change. The government hopes that this initiative will empower young people to become climate-literate citizens who can contribute to a sustainable future. Teachers will receive training and resources to help them deliver the curriculum effectively. The move has been welcomed by environmental groups and educators, who believe it is essential to prepare the next generation for the climate crisis.

**Bali Cracks Down on Misbehaving Tourists with New Guidelines**

Bali, a popular tourist destination in Indonesia, is introducing new rules for visitors to try and prevent disrespectful behavior. The guidelines include a list of "dos and don'ts" designed to protect the island's culture and environment. Tourists are now being told to dress respectfully when visiting temples and other holy sites, and to avoid using offensive language or gestures.

The new rules also address environmental concerns, such as littering and damaging coral reefs. Tourists are asked to dispose of their waste responsibly and to avoid touching or stepping on coral. The local authorities have said that they will be monitoring tourist behavior more closely and will issue warnings or fines to those who break the rules. These measures follow several incidents of tourists behaving badly, which have caused anger among local residents. The aim is to ensure that tourism benefits the local community and does not damage the island's natural and cultural heritage.
