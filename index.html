            <h1>Gandhi Photo Exhibition Opens in Taichung; India Hopes for More Understanding</h1>
            <p>A photo exhibition called "Exploring the Legend of Mahatma Gandhi" started today in Taichung at the National Public Information Library. Vinayak Prataprao Chavan, who is the Deputy Representative of India in Taiwan, spoke at the opening. He said that Gandhi's idea of "getting freedom without violence" was very important for India to become independent. He added that this idea is similar to Taiwan's values of democracy, human rights, and peace. He hopes this event will help both sides understand each other more.</p>
            <p>The India-Taipei Association announced today that they held the opening ceremony for the photography exhibition. This is to remember Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on October 2. Vinayak Prataprao Chavan, the Deputy Representative of India in Taiwan and Deputy Director-General of the India-Taipei Association, and Ma Hsiang-ping, the Director of the National Public Information Library, gave speeches. Lin Hui-fen from the Taichung City Government International Affairs Committee and Liao Hsiao-jou, the principal of Datong Elementary School in Taichung's West District, also attended.</p>
            <p>Chavan said in his speech that Gandhi's idea of "getting freedom without violence" was a main reason for India's independence. He also said it matches Taiwan's strong belief in democracy, human rights, and peace. He explained that both India and Taiwan have many different groups of people. Both countries think it is important for citizens to be strong. They also speak for peace and fairness in the world. He said this event is not only a cultural celebration but also a key way for India and Taiwan to understand each other better, based on their "shared values."</p>
            <p>Ma Hsiang-ping said she really respects Gandhi's spirit of peace and non-violence. She believes this spirit is very important today because society is often troubled. She felt very honored to work with the India-Taipei Association for this exhibition. She hopes that people who visit can look at the pictures, books, and items to think about Gandhi's ideas and remember them.</p>
            <p>The India-Taipei Association explained that the "Exploring the Legend of Mahatma Gandhi" photography exhibition is happening from October 1 to 29 at the National Public Information Library in Taichung. It shows many valuable photos. These pictures show Gandhi from when he was a child, through his time leading the independence movement, until his last moments. The exhibition also includes old photos of Gandhi with important world leaders. These pictures show how Gandhi's ideas influenced the world and helped people from different countries talk to each other.</p>
            <p>The India-Taipei Association also said that they are working with Datong Elementary School in Taichung's West District. They are holding a "Gandhi Children's Painting Competition" with the theme "Living Together in Harmony." The first prize was won by Wang Yi-hsuan, a sixth-grade student from Datong Elementary School. Her painting showed injured soldiers and farmers shaking hands. It also showed people from different countries caring for each other. This painting means peace, working together, and caring for people across countries.</p>
            <p>The India-Taipei Association also announced that the "Diwali" festival will happen on October 24. It will be in front of the Taichung City Government building. Diwali is also called the "Festival of Lights." It means that light wins over darkness and good wins over evil. This idea is similar to Gandhi's spirit. They hope that these cultural events will help Taiwanese people learn more about Indian culture. They also want to make the connection between India and Taiwan stronger through their cultures and shared values.</p>

            <h1>"Zero Day Attack" Books Are Out; Director Hopes Bad Predictions Don't Come True</h1>
            <p>The TV show from Taiwan, "Zero Day Attack," is very popular and will finish soon. Today, in Taipei, the original script and a novel based on the show were launched. The director, Luo Jing-ren, said he hopes the show and the book will only be like old papers. He hopes that none of the bad things that the books talk about will ever happen in real life.</p>
            <p>Luo Jing-ren spoke at the event. He said that since the show started, some unexpected things have happened. He thought it was just a show for fun. He thought people would either like it or not like it. But then, a very strong voice appeared. This voice said, "Do not watch this show, you cannot watch it." They said the show was causing fights, problems, and making people angry. This made him feel very surprised.</p>
            <p>Luo Jing-ren said that this third kind of voice is very strange. He believes people in Taiwan should pay attention to it and think deeply about it.</p>
            <p>Cheng Hsin-mei, the producer of "Zero Day Attack," also spoke. She said the main reason for making this show was to stop war from happening. She hopes Taiwan will not become a place for war. She explained that the show and novel look at many human things. Especially, they show how China uses secret ways to get into Taiwan and uses people's weaknesses to control them. She said, "If we can learn something important from this story, maybe we can stop war from happening. This is what everyone who worked on this show wants."</p>
            <p>Shita Akio, who is the head of the Indo-Pacific Strategic Think Tank, suggested people read this book. He said that it is very important to know about dangers. He said the show helps Taiwanese people understand what they need to protect. He mentioned a Chinese saying that means "always be ready to die, but always try to live." He believes that right now, the most important thing is to work together to keep Taiwan's democracy and freedom safe, by always being aware of possible dangers.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from Hei Ti Culture, the novel based on "Zero Day Attack" was written by four new writers: Heidi, Li Yi-hsuan, Si Xuan, and Fu Ling-zi. They used different parts of the TV show as inspiration. They wrote short novels that talk about the danger of war, leaving home, wanting money, and people's struggles. These stories show the inner feelings of Taiwanese people when two strong powers are facing each other.</p>
            <p>The original script book for "Zero Day Attack" includes the final scripts for all 10 episodes. It also has discussions from when it was made and explanations from experts. It tells the story of how the show was created in a real way. This helps readers understand this story about "what happens if Taiwan is in trouble." It also shows how the creators kept the story exciting and critical, even with pressure from politics, culture, and the media.</p>

            <h1>PChome and Uni-President Work Together; Online Shopping Points Can Be Used in Many Stores</h1>
            <p>Last year, Uni-President Enterprise bought shares in PChome Online. Now, PChome 24h Shopping has said it will work closely with Uni-President Group's OPENPOINT program. This means you can now use OPENPOINT points to pay for things on PChome. This connects PChome to Uni-President's big group of 19 million members. This is happening as the busy online shopping time for "Double 11" (November 11) is coming. PChome thinks there is a good chance to grow using member points.</p>
            <p>Experts in shopping said that this partnership connects members from two very big shopping places. For Uni-President, adding PChome to its member system makes its point program stronger. It also means people can use their points in more places. For PChome, joining Uni-President's member system will make people shop more often and stay loyal. This is good for both companies.</p>
            <p>PChome 24h Shopping mentioned that in Taiwan, member points are a very important part of shopping and online sales. It is believed that more than half of people in Taiwan have different types of points. Every year, points worth more than NT$50 billion are given out.</p>
            <p>In June and July this year, PChome worked with uniopen PRIMA members, who pay for a special service. They gave these members special offers and P-coin codes to try. Data from those two months showed that 80% of these members used the offers. This showed that connecting different point systems has a lot of good possibilities.</p>
            <p>PChome 24h Shopping said it has more than 13 million members. It has also created its own online shopping point system. Besides linking P-coins with banks, they also work with phone companies to offer point discounts. They continue to make points more useful and make members more connected to different ways of using them.</p>
            <p>PChome 24h Shopping explained that Uni-President's OPENPOINT is a very successful point system in Taiwan. They believe that uniopen members are very loyal, and PChome offers many different and easy ways to shop online. By connecting these two big groups of millions of members, they hope to share points. They also want to give customers services that combine online and in-store shopping. They hope this will help sales grow even more.</p>
