            <h1>US Commerce Secretary: If China Blocks TikTok Sale, US Will Ban It</h1>
            <p>The US Commerce Secretary, Howard Lutnick, said today that TikTok must stop working in the United States if China does not approve its sale. About 170 million people in the US use this app.</p>
            <p>Lutnick also said on CNBC news that the United States must control the computer code, called an algorithm, that makes TikTok work.</p>
            <p>In June, former President Trump gave ByteDance, a Chinese company, 90 more days to sell TikTok's US part. This new deadline is September 17. It was the third time he delayed stopping the popular app.</p>
            <p>Lutnick explained, "China can own a small part, or ByteDance, the current owner, can keep a small part. But mainly, Americans will have control, own this technology, and control the algorithm."</p>
            <p>"If China agrees to the deal, it will happen. If they do not agree, then TikTok will be stopped. These decisions will be made soon," he added.</p>
            <p>TikTok did not give a comment right away.</p>

            <h1>France Will Recognize Palestine, Making It 142 Countries Globally</h1>
            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced today that France will officially recognize the State of Palestine in September. He will make this announcement at the United Nations General Assembly. This decision will make France the most important European country to recognize Palestine.</p>
            <p>Macron wrote on social media platforms X and Instagram: "I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine. This shows our long-standing promise to help achieve a fair and lasting peace in the Middle East. I will officially announce this at the UN General Assembly in September."</p>
            <p>According to news from AFP, 142 countries, including France, now recognize Palestine as a state. This is happening even though Israel and the United States strongly disagree with it.</p>
            <p>Macron also wrote: "The most important thing right now is to stop the war in Gaza and protect people."</p>
            <p>Hussein al-Sheikh, who works with Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas, thanked Macron for his decision.</p>
            <p>Sheikh said: "This position shows that France follows international laws and supports the Palestinian people's right to choose their own future and create their own independent country."</p>
            <p>However, Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Yariv Levin criticized France's action. He called it "a bad mark on France's history" and "direct help to terrorism."</p>

            <h1>Global Oil Prices Go Up by About 1% as US Oil Stocks Fall and Supply Worries Grow</h1>
            <p>Today, the price of oil around the world went up by about 1%. This happened because the amount of crude oil stored in the United States decreased. Also, people are worried that Russia will send out less gasoline. These two reasons were stronger than the news that Chevron, a big oil company, will get permission from the US to start producing oil again in Venezuela.</p>
            <p>Reuters news reported that the price for Brent crude oil went up by 67 cents, or 0.98%, ending the day at $69.18 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>The price for US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil went up by 78 cents, or 1.20%, ending the day at $66.03 for one barrel.</p>
