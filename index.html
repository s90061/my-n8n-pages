            <h1>US will not give visas to Palestinian officials for UN meeting</h1>
            <p>The United States said today that it will not give visas to members of the Palestinian Authority who want to go to the United Nations General Assembly in September. France is leading efforts to officially recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>This is an unusual step. It shows that the Trump government supports the Israeli government even more. The Israeli government strongly does not want Palestine to become a country. It also tries to link the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank with Hamas, an enemy group in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The US State Department said in a statement: "Before the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Marco Rubio refused to give and also took back visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority."</p>
            <p>The State Department said: "The Trump government has made it clear that holding the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority responsible for not keeping their promises and harming the chances of peace is good for our national security."</p>
            <p>When Trump faced legal problems after leaving office, he used the word "lawfare" to describe his situation. The State Department is now using this word. It says that Palestine is fighting a "lawfare" by complaining about Israel to the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.</p>
            <p>The State Department asked the Palestinian Authority to stop "trying to get one-sided recognition for a made-up Palestinian state."</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority sent out a statement through its official news agency, WAFA. It said that the Palestinian Authority "asks the US government to think again and take back this decision." It also said this action "clearly breaks international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement."</p>
            <p>Gideon Saar, Israel's Foreign Minister, wrote on X (a social media platform). He thanked the Trump government "for this bold move, standing with Israel again."</p>

            <h1>Super Micro Computer stock falls 5% after saying its money controls are weak</h1>
            <p>Super Micro Computer, a company that makes special computers for AI, said again that it still has problems with how it controls its money reports. Today, its stock price fell by almost 5% during trading in the US market.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Super Micro told this in official documents on August 28. It said that problems that are not fixed could "negatively affect" how the company reports its business results on time and correctly.</p>
            <p>In its yearly report up to June 30, Super Micro repeated a similar statement it made in its quarterly report in May this year. The company also said it is working to fix these problems.</p>
            <p>Last year, Super Micro, which is in San Jose, California, missed the deadline to hand in its yearly financial report in August. Then, in October, Ernst & Young, an accounting company, stopped being its auditor. They had worries about how the company was managed and how open it was.</p>
            <p>Super Micro gave in its delayed yearly report earlier this year.</p>
            <p>Today, Super Micro's stock fell sharply during trading. If it keeps falling, more than 1 billion US dollars of the company's value, which is about 26 billion US dollars, will disappear.</p>
            <p>Dell, another company that competes with Super Micro, also saw its stock price drop by about 10% today. This happened because making AI servers is expensive and there is more competition. These problems made the positive predictions for AI technology less strong.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy wants top leaders to discuss Ukraine's safety next week</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy today asked allied countries to quickly make talks about Ukraine's safety guarantees a meeting for leaders. At the same time, defense ministers from EU countries promised to train Ukrainian soldiers inside Ukraine if there is a ceasefire agreement.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Kyiv is working with other countries to try and stop the war with Russia, which is now in its fourth year. They also want to make sure partner countries promise to protect Ukraine from any future attacks.</p>
            <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he expects to continue talks with European leaders next week. He wants them to promise to protect Ukraine in a way similar to NATO. He also said that US President Donald Trump should be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>He said, "We must make this plan clear to everyone." He also said he wants to tell Trump "our thoughts."</p>
            <p>Trump met with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders separately earlier this month. But these diplomatic efforts to stop Russia's full invasion have not achieved much yet.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy also talked about a deadline set by Trump. Trump recently said that if Russian President Vladimir Putin does not agree to a one-on-one meeting with Zelenskyy, he will decide to put new measures on Russia.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Kaja Kallas, a top EU official for foreign affairs and security, said that EU defense ministers met today in Copenhagen. They showed "wide support" for making the EU's military training mission bigger to include training inside Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Trump seems more willing to support Ukraine's defense against Russia. He said that Europe must take more responsibility for making Ukraine safer.</p>
            <p>Kallas wrote on X: "The EU has already trained over 80,000 Ukrainian soldiers. We must be ready to do more."</p>
            <p>Russia has always been against any NATO troops being in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said he hopes that the parliaments of allied countries will approve security guarantees. He also talked about an agreement from 1994 where Kyiv gave up its nuclear weapons for security guarantees. He said this agreement was not enough to stop Russia.</p>
            <p>He said: "We want security guarantees that are legally binding. We do not want another Budapest Memorandum."</p>
