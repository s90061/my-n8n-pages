            <h1>Xingda Power Plant Fire: Taipower Apologizes, Says Power Supply Not Affected</h1>
            <p>A fire started at the Xingda Power Plant in Kaohsiung on Monday night around 8 PM. Taipower said that the fire was in a new power unit that was being tested. This unit is still under construction.</p>
            <p>Taipower added that the fire was likely caused by a leak of natural gas. The fire is now out, and all workers at the plant are safe. The company is very sorry for the fire and will look into what caused it. They will also review their safety rules to stop similar accidents from happening again.</p>
            <p>Taipower assured everyone that this fire will not stop the plant's other power units from working, and it will not affect the power supply for this year.</p>
            <p>The Deputy Mayor of Kaohsiung, Lin Chin-Jung, and other local government leaders went to the site. The Kaohsiung Environmental Protection Bureau tested the air and found no problems with air pollution.</p>

            <h1>Xingda Power Plant Fire: Premier Cho Jung-tai Asks for Steps to Stop It from Spreading</h1>
            <p>On Monday night, around 8 PM, a fire started at the Xingda Power Plant in Kaohsiung. Taipower believes that natural gas leaked, causing the fire. Premier Cho Jung-tai has told the Fire Department and Taipower to take immediate action to stop the accident from getting worse.</p>
            <p>Taipower explained earlier that the fire likely happened when a new unit, called "Xingda Power Plant Gas Unit No. 2," was being tested. There was a natural gas leak, which caused the fire. Firefighters were called right away to help. The fire has now been put out, and all staff at the power plant are safe. Taipower will carefully investigate why the fire started.</p>
            <p>The government's executive branch said on Monday night that Premier Cho Jung-tai asked the Fire Department and Taipower workers to quickly put safety measures in place.

            <h1>Shortage of Epilepsy Medicine: Normal Supply Expected by December</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced that a medicine for epilepsy, called "Neurontin Capsules 100mg," is temporarily hard to get. This is because the company that makes it has had delays in its supply chain. Currently, the medicine is being given out in a controlled way, but it should be fully available again by December this year.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, the Ministry of Health and Welfare's FDA shared information about the shortage of "NEURONTIN CAPSULES 100MG" (License No. 022823) from Viatris Pharmaceuticals. This information was for doctors and clinics to know.</p>
            <p>Shen Tsai-ying, who leads the Republic of China Pharmacists Association, said to the media today that Viatris Pharmaceuticals announced the medicine shortage in early August. She noted that the medicine has not been available since August. She knows that two other Taiwanese companies make the same medicine. However, if there are only three companies in total, and one has a shortage, it can affect patients. She believes the government should check all medicine licenses and the number of companies making them to ensure medicine supply is always strong.</p>
            <p>According to the National Health Insurance Administration, about 15 million doses of this medicine were used in 2023. Yang Bo-wen, a senior specialist from the FDA's Pharmaceutical Division, told the Central News Agency on Monday evening that this medicine is approved to help treat partial epileptic seizures in adults and children aged 3 and older. It also treats nerve pain after shingles. The FDA was told by the medicine's license holder about the supply problem. The medicine is now being supplied in a limited way, and they expect it to be back to normal supply in December this year.</p>
            <p>Yang Bo-wen said that after looking at the medical situation, there are two other medicines with the same main ingredient, form, and strength available in Taiwan. The FDA has asked these companies to make more of their medicine, and they will start supplying it soon. Also, doctors can choose to use the same medicine with a different strength, depending on what the patient needs. This should meet the needs of patients.</p>
