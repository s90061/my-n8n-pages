<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - China Airlines, Taiwan's national carrier, is delaying the retirement of some of its older aircraft. This is because Boeing has been slow in delivering new 787-9 jets. The airline's newly appointed chairman suggested that Boeing might have to pay compensation for these delays.

China Airlines, founded in 1959, is currently updating its fleet. Last year, the airline ordered new long-haul planes, worth nearly $12 billion, from both Boeing and Airbus. China Airlines also ordered 24 Boeing 787s, including 18 787-9s and six of the larger 787-10s, for regional and some longer routes.

Chairman George Kao stated that the plan to replace older Airbus A330s and Boeing 737-800s with 787-9s and A321neos is affected by slow deliveries, especially for the 787-9s. "We are currently very affected. Some aircraft that were planned to be retired, or returned at the end of their lease, will remain and have their leases extended," he told Reuters during an interview at the airline's headquarters in Taoyuan, Taiwan's main international airport.

Boeing has not given China Airlines a firm date for the 787-9 delays, but has indicated that deliveries will "basically" start by the end of 2025. Kao, who began his career as a flight attendant and became chairman in March, added that the contract includes provisions for compensation if Boeing is responsible for the delays, such as issues in the supply chain. Boeing did not comment on the matter.

Other airlines are experiencing similar problems. Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), recently called the predictions of aircraft delivery delays throughout this decade "unacceptable."

Despite these issues, Kao remains positive about expansion. He mentioned that the more fuel-efficient 777-9s and A350-1000s ordered last year will allow for more flights to destinations like New York and London. He also noted that a new third terminal at Taoyuan airport is expected to open its first section later this year, which will greatly improve the travel experience.

Kao also hinted at adding more aircraft for Mandarin Airlines, a subsidiary that mostly flies domestic routes with ATR-72 turboprops. Mandarin Airlines is being restructured to focus on regional routes from southern and central Taiwan with new jet aircraft. He stated that discussions with aircraft lessors are underway to support Mandarin Airlines' growth.

China Airlines faces competition from long-standing rival EVA Air and the rapidly expanding Starlux Airlines, which recently ordered 10 more A350s. Kao believes that while Taiwan's local market is small, transit traffic, which all three airlines are targeting, is sufficient to support three full-service airlines. He highlighted Taoyuan airport's convenient location for connecting the Pacific to Asia, and its advantages over other regional hubs like Seoul's Incheon (too large), Tokyo (expensive landing fees), and Hong Kong (political issues).
