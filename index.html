The Chinese government recently announced a new air route, W121, that starts from July 6th. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) strongly criticized this decision. They said it shows China's controlling way of doing things. MOFA asked the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other countries to tell China to talk with Taiwan about the route.

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) explained that China has broken an agreement from 2015 three times. This agreement stated that any new air routes must be discussed between both sides. China's actions change the current situation and make the area less safe.

MOFA added that according to ICAO rules, any changes to air routes must be discussed with nearby flight control areas. Taiwan's flight control area is next to the M503 route that W121 connects to. However, China did not talk to Taiwan about this change. MOFA believes this shows China's bad plan to change the situation in the Taiwan Strait without permission.

**12 Turkish Soldiers Die from Gas in Iraqi Cave**

Recently, Turkish soldiers went into a cave in northern Iraq. They were looking for the bodies of their fellow soldiers who were killed by Kurdish fighters some years ago. During this search, 12 soldiers died because they breathed in methane gas. At first, eight soldiers were reported dead, but this number has now gone up.

This sad event happened at a sensitive time. Turkey is currently talking with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to stop the fighting that has been going on for many years. The conflict between the PKK and the Turkish government started in 1984 and has caused over 40,000 deaths.

The Turkish Ministry of Defense said that the soldiers were trying to find the body of a soldier killed in May 2022. The cave was once used as a hospital. The Ministry announced on social media that four more brave soldiers died because of the methane, bringing the total to 12. The source of the methane gas in the cave was not explained.
