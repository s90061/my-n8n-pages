**Politician Chiang Chi-chen Reports Online Threats to Police**

Chiang Chi-chen, the Deputy Speaker of Taiwan's Parliament, has reported an online threat to the police. Someone wrote on Facebook that they wanted to "behead" him. Chiang said he strongly condemns this violence. He is worried that recent political conflicts are making society more divided and that these threats are not what Taiwan used to be like.

The threatening message was posted in a Facebook group.

Chiang Chi-chen said in a statement that he has told the police and that he is against any violent threats. He believes in free speech but not when it includes threats of violence.

He explained that the message was posted in a group called "Professor Tsai Ting-kuei - Free Taiwan Party (Free Party) Support Group." It directly called for him to be "beheaded" and also included rude and untrue things about him. He said this kind of talk goes too far and is not allowed in Taiwan.

Chiang Chi-chen thinks that this act might be against laws about threatening people, saying bad things about them, and trying to remove public officials from their jobs. He wants the police to investigate quickly. He also asked everyone to be calm and respect different political opinions.

He also said that the current large political movement is causing a lot of anger and division in society. He is very concerned about the threats against him as a high-ranking official, saying it is not the Taiwan he knows.

Chiang Chi-chen repeated that he supports free speech and people's rights, but he will not accept threats to personal safety. He also asked President Lai Ching-te if this is what he means by "national unity" and "precious civic power."
