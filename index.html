            <h1>Cheng Li-wen, a Former Member of the Green Party, Becomes the Leader of the Kuomintang.</h1>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen, who used to be a lawmaker for the Kuomintang party, has become the new leader of the party. She started her political career with the Democratic Progressive Party, which is often called the Green Party. Later, she left that party and joined the Kuomintang. She has held many important roles in politics. This time, she was a surprise candidate, known for her strong and fighting spirit. She won against other candidates, like Hau Lung-bin, who used to be the mayor of Taipei. Her win is a big surprise in Taiwan's politics.</p>
            <p>The results of the Kuomintang party leader election are now known. Cheng Li-wen, a former Kuomintang lawmaker, won. She beat other candidates, including Hau Lung-bin, who was the mayor of Taipei, and Lo Chih-chiang, who is a Kuomintang lawmaker. She is now the new leader of the Kuomintang. She is also the second woman to be chosen as party leader by direct votes from party members, after former leader Hung Hsiu-chu.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was born in Yunlin and grew up in Tainan. When she was a university student at National Taiwan University, she studied law. During that time, she was part of the Wild Lily Student Movement. After finishing university, she joined the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). She worked for the DPP as a National Assembly member and the Deputy Director of the DPP Youth Department. However, in 2002, she commented on a case called the "Tu Hsing-che ear-licking incident." Because of her comments, the DPP stopped her from doing party activities. So, Cheng Li-wen decided to leave the party.</p>
            <p>After Cheng Li-wen left the DPP, she stayed away from politics for a while. On March 27, 2004, a group of parties called the "pan-blue camp" gathered to protest the unfair presidential election. Cheng Li-wen was the host of this event, which showed she was now supporting the pan-blue side. Later that same year, she ran for a lawmaker position in Kaohsiung City, but she did not win.</p>
            <p>However, Cheng Li-wen is a good speaker, a sharp host, and she can explain her ideas clearly. Because of these skills, Lien Chan, who was the leader of the Kuomintang at that time, noticed her. In 2005, she was asked to join the Kuomintang party. After that, she worked as the head of the Kuomintang's Culture and Communications Committee and as a spokesperson. In the 2008 lawmaker election, the Kuomintang chose her as a party-list lawmaker, and she won. But in 2012, she ran for a local lawmaker position in Taichung City and lost to Ho Hsin-chun from the DPP.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen was brave and joined elections in areas that were hard to win. This showed her as a strong fighter, which is not common for the Kuomintang. After she lost the lawmaker election, Chen Chun, who was the Premier at that time, asked her to be the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan. She earned a lot of trust from important government leaders.</p>
            <p>In 2014, Cheng Li-wen stopped being the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan. She then started working in media and hosted TV shows. In the 2020 lawmaker election, Wu Den-yih, who was the leader of the Kuomintang then, chose her to be a party-list lawmaker for the 10th Legislative Yuan. She won again and went back to the Legislative Yuan. After that, she became the party whip for the Kuomintang in the Legislative Yuan.</p>
            <p>During the 10th session of the Legislative Yuan, the COVID-19 pandemic started all over the world. After Cheng Li-wen became the party whip, she became a very strong speaker for the party. She asked many tough questions and often stood at the forefront to argue and speak out for her party.</p>
            <p>For this Kuomintang party leader election, Cheng Li-wen was a surprise candidate. She visited many local communities and showed a strong, fighting style that was different from most traditional Kuomintang members. Many people from the military, government, and education fields supported her. In the end, she beat her opponents and became the leader of the party.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen has successfully become the party leader. But she is not from the usual Kuomintang background. The Kuomintang is a very complex party with strong local groups. It will be a challenge for her to manage the party and work carefully with the Taiwan People's Party. Her biggest test will be to help the Kuomintang win power again in 2028. This challenge has just begun.</p>
