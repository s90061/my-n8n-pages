Shuanghong, a big company that makes cooling parts, announced its June sales today. Sales were NT$1.676 billion, which is 3.4% more than in May. However, it's 0.9% less than June last year. This is the first time their yearly sales have dropped since March 2024. This happened because there were not enough liquid cooling parts.

Shuanghong's sales have been growing fast this year. This is because NVIDIA released its GB200 AI servers, which use liquid cooling. From February to April, Shuanghong's monthly sales grew by over 50% compared to last year. So, when Shuanghong announced that June sales were lower than last year, it got a lot of attention.

Shuanghong said that their June sales were not as good as they hoped for three main reasons. First, they didn't have enough parts for liquid cooling, so they couldn't ship products on time. This problem should be fixed in the third quarter. Also, sales were very high last year because of orders from an American client, so this year's numbers look lower by comparison. Finally, the New Taiwan dollar got much stronger against the US dollar, which also affected sales.

**Eurostar Train Breaks Down, Over 800 Passengers Stuck for 9 Hours**

Today, the Eurostar company said that a train from Brussels, Belgium, to London had to stop in northern France. This was due to a technical problem. More than 800 passengers were stuck on the train for nine hours.

Reuters reported that because of the problem, the air conditioning and toilets on the train didn't work. The company said they started a "long and complex" process to move the passengers to another train.

A Eurostar spokesperson said that the broken train lost power and stopped this morning between Lille and Calais in northern France. The spokesperson also said that passengers were given water, and the train doors were opened to let air in.

Some passengers posted on social media, complaining about the delay. They also said that Eurostar did not communicate well with them. In late June this year, another Eurostar train also had to stop because cables on the tracks in northern France were stolen.

**Former Legislator Lee Te-wei Must Pay NT$600,000 Each to Hsueh Jui-yuan and Chou Jih-hao for Accusing Them of Helping Medigen**

Former KMT legislator Lee Te-wei accused Hsueh Jui-yuan, who was the Minister of Health and Welfare at the time, and Chou Jih-hao, the head of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), of unfairly helping the Medigen vaccine company in 2022. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office closed the case because there wasn't enough evidence. Hsueh and Chou then asked for NT$2 million each from Lee. Today, the Taipei District Court decided that Lee Te-wei must pay NT$600,000 to each of them. This decision can still be appealed.

In 2022, Lee Te-wei held a press conference at the Legislative Yuan. He questioned if the CDC helped Medigen by writing a report about the vaccine's effectiveness. After that, Lee went to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office to report Hsueh Jui-yuan and Chou Jih-hao for favoritism. The prosecutors investigated but closed the case due to a lack of evidence.

Hsueh Jui-yuan and Chou Jih-hao believed that Lee Te-wei harmed their reputation without checking the facts. They felt that Lee did this only for his own political gain. They said that their reputation was badly damaged, and they suffered a lot emotionally. So, they filed a civil lawsuit at the Taipei District Court, asking Lee Te-wei to pay them NT$2 million each.
