**TRA Fares Rise for First Time in 30 Years: 26.8% Increase, Taipei to Zuoying Surges to NT$975**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E9%90%B530%E5%B9%B4%E9%A6%96%E6%BC%B2%E5%83%B9-%E7%A5%A8%E5%83%B9%E6%BC%B226-8-%E5%8F%B0%E5%8C%97%E5%88%B0%E5%B7%A6%E7%87%9F%E9%A3%86975%E5%85%83-101334223.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) fares are set to increase across the board for the first time in 30 years, with an average hike of 26.8%! The Tze-Chiang Limited Express from Taipei to Xinzuoying will now cost NT$975, and Taipei to Taitung will see an increase of NT$153. Local train ( êµ¬ê°„è»Š) fares from Taipei to Banqiao will rise from NT$15 to NT$22, and luggage and parcel fees will increase by an average of 36%. TRA has also revised its refund policy for delays; if a train is delayed by more than 10 minutes, passengers can apply for a refund within one year without a handling fee. Transportation scholars point out that if the High-Speed Rail follows suit with a price increase, the only reason would be to control demand through pricing. While TPASS (Taiwan Pass) will not be directly affected, the government's subsidy amount will increase, adding to the financial burden.
