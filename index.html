            <h1>Republican Party Chairman Chou Ke-chi Sentenced to 3 Years for Bribery in Petition Drive; Prosecutors Arrest Him and Send Him to Prison</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 30 (CNA) Chou Ke-chi, the chairman of the Republican Party, registered to run for vice president in 2023. During the petition drive, he was suspected of giving cash bribes to more than 20 people. Both the first and second courts sentenced him to 3 years in prison and a fine of 2 million NT dollars. Today, the Supreme Court rejected his appeal, making the judgment final, and told prosecutors to stop him from escaping.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office said that they told the police to arrest Chou Ke-chi tonight. He will be sent to prison according to the law.</p>
            <p>According to the judgment from the Taipei District Court (first trial), Chou Ke-chi and a man named Lan wanted to run together for the 16th president and vice president. In 2023, they applied to register with the Central Election Commission by collecting signatures. After paying a deposit, the Central Election Commission announced them as candidates for the 16th president and vice president who needed signatures.</p>
            <p>On October 21 and 22, 2023, Chou Ke-chi held campaign events and set up tables for collecting signatures. He told staff to ask people to sign the petition. Besides giving out items like rice wine and toothbrushes, he also allegedly gave 200 NT dollars to people who signed. More than 20 people in total received money.</p>
            <p>In the first trial, Chou Ke-chi was sentenced to 3 years in prison and a fine of 2 million NT dollars for breaking the law against giving bribes in presidential and vice presidential elections. The case went to appeal, and the Taiwan High Court heard it in the second trial. During the second trial, Chou Ke-chi asked to stop the trial and asked for a constitutional interpretation.</p>
            <p>The second court believed that the rules about giving bribes in presidential and vice presidential elections were not against the constitution. They also thought that the first court's judgment was correct in facts, law, and sentencing. So, they rejected the appeal and kept the original judgment. After another appeal, the Supreme Court today rejected it, making the entire case final. Prosecutors were also told to stop him from escaping.</p>
            <p>Also, Chou Ke-chi is suspected of taking money from the Chinese Communist Party to hold events for the Republican Party, protest, and promote political influence in Taiwan. He is accused of breaking the Anti-Infiltration Act. In June this year, the Taipei District Court sentenced Chou Ke-chi to 2 years in prison for this. This case is now being heard by the High Court in the second trial. (Edited by Yang Chao-yen) 1140730</p>
