Microsoft has decided to postpone the release of its Recall feature and will make it an optional setting following significant security concerns. Recall, which is designed to take snapshots of users' activities on their PCs, has raised worries about potential privacy risks. Initially set to be a key feature in the new Copilot+ PCs, Recall will now be rolled out as a preview in the Windows Insider Program in the coming weeks. This delay will allow Microsoft to gather feedback and ensure the feature meets its high standards for security and privacy. The company emphasized its commitment to protecting customer data and is taking the necessary steps to address the concerns raised by security experts and users alike. Making Recall opt-in gives users more control over whether they want to use the feature and share their data.

**Article 2: Apple faces EU antitrust charges over app store rules**

Apple is facing antitrust charges from the European Union over its App Store rules, which regulators say restrict competition in the music streaming market. The EU claims that Apple's rules prevent developers from informing users about cheaper subscription options available outside the App Store. This practice, according to the EU, is unfair and limits consumer choice. The charges could result in a hefty fine for Apple, potentially up to 10% of its global annual revenue. Apple has defended its App Store policies, arguing that they ensure a safe and secure platform for users and provide developers with valuable tools and resources. However, the EU's investigation highlights the ongoing scrutiny of tech giants and their business practices.

**Article 3: Global chip shortage expected to ease in second half of 2025**

The global chip shortage, which has affected numerous industries from automotive to consumer electronics, is expected to ease in the second half of 2025. Increased production capacity and reduced demand in some sectors are contributing to this positive outlook. Major chip manufacturers have been investing heavily in expanding their facilities to meet the growing demand for semiconductors. While some supply chain challenges remain, experts predict that the availability of chips will improve significantly in the coming months. This easing of the shortage should help to stabilize production costs and reduce lead times for many products.
