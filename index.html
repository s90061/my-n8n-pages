            <h1>Chinese Man Smuggled Son into Taiwan to Find a Way, Ran Out of Money and Gave Himself Up; Prosecutors in Taoyuan Charge Him</h1>
            <p>Song Yuan-kun, a 41-year-old man from China, thought Taiwan was rich. In May, he took his 17-year-old son on a rubber boat from Fujian to secretly enter Taiwan to find a new life. When they ran out of money, they turned themselves in to the police. Prosecutors in Taoyuan have charged Song Yuan-kun with breaking the Immigration Act. His son's case will be handled by the juvenile court.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office stated in their charge paper that both Song Yuan-kun and his son are from mainland China. On May 15th, around 6 AM, they took a small inflatable rubber boat with an outboard motor, which they bought from the Chinese shopping website Pinduoduo, to come to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The charge paper also said that they started their journey from the coast of Junshan Town, Pingtan County, Fujian Province, which is about 68 nautical miles from Taiwan's coast. On May 15th, around 5:30 PM, they arrived at the beach next to the Guanyin Liquefied Natural Gas Plant in Guanyin District, Taoyuan City. This is how they entered Taiwan illegally.</p>
            <p>The charge paper mentioned that on May 16th, around 8 AM, the two went to the Guanyin Police Station of the Dayuan Branch, Taoyuan City Police Department, to ask for help. That is when the whole situation became known. Police found a fuel can, New Taiwan Dollars, and toiletries in their boat.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that Song Yuan-kun and his son are from Yunnan, China. Song Yuan-kun worked as a laborer. He thought Taiwan was rich and wanted to bring his son, who works in hairdressing, to Taiwan to study. On the day they left, they traveled from a village in Yunnan to Fujian to pick up the rubber boat, then went to the coast. After arriving in Taiwan, they used a UnionPay card to withdraw money for dinner. They turned themselves in the next day because they had no money left.</p>
            <p>Police investigated if their reason for coming to Taiwan was to get military information. Both the father and son took lie detector tests, and both passed. This means they likely did not come to spy or to claim territory.</p>
            <            p>The charge paper stated that Song Yuan-kun broke the Immigration Act. His case was finished today, and he was charged. Because Song Yuan-kun's son is a minor, his punishment might be more severe under the Children and Youth Welfare and Rights Protection Act. Any tools they used to enter Taiwan illegally will be taken by the law.</p>

            <h1>Black-faced Spoonbill Wetland-Friendly Seafood: National Park Agency Helps Fishermen Affected by Disaster to Sell Products</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Taiwan. Today, the National Park Agency of the Ministry of Interior held an event at Yuanshan Huabo Park in Taipei. It was called "Taijiang Eco-Friendly Black-faced Spoonbill Brand Product Exhibition." The goal was to help fishermen from Cigu sell their seafood. These products have the Black-faced Spoonbill brand approval and wetland certification. This means they are good for the environment and support long-term use.</p>
            <p>The typhoon and heavy rains afterwards caused a lot of damage to farms. Today, the National Park Agency held the "Taijiang Eco-Friendly Black-faced Spoonbill Brand Product Exhibition" at Yuanshan Huabo Park in Taipei. They invited five eco-friendly fish farms from the Tainan coastal area that were badly hit by the typhoon. These include Cigu Nanwan Seawater Eco-Aquaculture Farm, Yuti Eco-Aquaculture Farm, Guanteng's Fish, Huang Fen-xiang Eco-Aquaculture Farm, and fishermen who raise clams and shrimp. These fishermen came north to sell their products. The first round of products sold out quickly, around 11 AM, and new products were brought in by 12 PM.</p>
            <p>Many important people attended the event today. These included Wang Cheng-chi, the head of the National Park Agency, Chen Chen-jung, the deputy head, and Hsieh Wei-sung, the head of Taijiang National Park Management Office. Also there were business partners for ESG (Environment, Social, and Governance): Kenichiro Yazumi, the chairman of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd., and Kao Li-hsueh, the general manager of CTBC Financial Holding Co., Ltd.</p>
            <p>Wang Cheng-chi spoke and said that in the past, people thought national parks only cared about protecting nature. But now, it's about the government, fishermen, and businesses working together to support eco-friendly farming. Also, Taijiang National Park is the only wetland park, so they are also promoting a wetland label. This means the more than 30 kinds of seafood promoted today have both the Black-faced Spoonbill brand approval and the wetland label. The Ministry of Interior's wetland label shows that products from wetlands are made in an environmentally friendly and smart way.</p>
            <p>Wang Cheng-chi said the typhoon caused a lot of damage to Cigu. But Taiwanese people are strong even after difficulties. He believes the fishermen will keep working hard, and the government and businesses will actively help them.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Wei-sung said that Taijiang National Park started a plan for eco-friendly habitat farming in 2020. At that time, only 3 fishermen participated, covering an area of 10 hectares. Now, there are 20 fishermen, covering over 200 hectares. Promoting eco-friendly practices is not just an idea; it's about protecting their home together with the fishermen. A good environment naturally helps produce delicious seafood.</p>
            <p>The Taijiang National Park Management Office of the National Park Agency has signed agreements with Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd., Quanyi Electronics Co., Ltd., and CTBC Financial Holding Co., Ltd. These agreements are for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) cooperation. They will work together to protect the habitat of the Black-faced Spoonbill. Kenichiro Yazumi said that the Black-faced Spoonbill brand shows that protecting nature and economic activities can happen together. He thanked everyone for making sustainability not just a dream, but something that is happening now.</p>
            <p>Kao Li-hsueh also said that since May, CTBC Financial Holding and its five companies have been working on a plan to protect the Taijiang habitat and endangered species. She hopes people will buy high-quality seafood that is farmed in an eco-friendly way and produced locally. This helps reduce carbon pollution and is good for the environment.</p>
