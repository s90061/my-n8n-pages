            <h1>US Confirms First Human Case of Screwworm Disease; Patient Traveled from Central America</h1>
            <p>The US Department of Health and Human Services announced today the first human case of New World screwworm disease in the United States. This case is related to travel from a country where the disease is present.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Andrew G. Nixon, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in an email to Reuters that the Maryland Department of Health and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) investigated the case. The CDC confirmed on August 4 that it was a New World screwworm (NWS) disease case. The patient had traveled back from El Salvador.</p>
            <p>Reuters also reported earlier that sources from the beef industry said last week that the CDC confirmed a New World screwworm disease case in Maryland. This patient had visited Guatemala.</p>
            <p>The New World screwworm is a parasite that eats cattle and other warm-blooded animals.</p>
            <p>Nixon did not comment on the debate about where the infection came from. He only said that the risk to public health in the United States is "very low."</p>
            <p>The US government has not found any New World screwworm cases in animals this year.</p>
            <p>The US government and people in the industry have different ideas about where this human case came from. This might cause more worry for ranchers, beef producers, and livestock owners who are already careful about possible infections in the US. This is because screwworms have moved north from Central America and southern Mexico.</p>
            <p>More than a week ago, government officials, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, went to Texas. They announced plans to build a facility there to kill screwworms to fight the disease.</p>

            <h1>U18 Hsu Shu-cheng: From Fearing the Ball to a Great Shortstop, Inspiring Kinmen Players</h1>
            <p>Hsu Shu-cheng, a shortstop for the U18 World Cup baseball team, is the first player from Kinmen to join the national youth baseball team in 32 years. His first coach, Wu Zhi-wei, saw Hsu Shu-cheng go from being afraid of the ball to being called a "power-hitting shortstop." Coach Wu said he felt proud and hopes Hsu Shu-cheng's story will encourage baseball players in Kinmen.</p>
            <p>The U18 World Cup baseball tournament will start on September 5 in Okinawa, Japan. After two training periods, Taiwan's team announced its 20 chosen players on August 20. Shortstop Hsu Shu-cheng is one of the important players. He is the first youth baseball player from Kinmen since Yang Chung-liang 32 years ago.</p>
            <p>Taiwan team's head coach, Liao Hung-yuan, has often said that Hsu Shu-cheng has a promising future. Coach Liao once said that Hsu Shu-cheng has great natural abilities, good body movement, and smooth throwing. Even though he is not big, he has good power. He could become a "power-hitting shortstop" and might even play baseball overseas.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-cheng played baseball in Kinmen during his elementary and junior high school years. His first coach, Wu Zhi-wei, told a reporter that when he coached Hsu Shu-cheng in elementary school, he saw that he had good body movement and a lot of potential. He was also very obedient and willing to do what the coach told him. Even though he was quite thin, he worked very hard. "He became a good player by working hard," Coach Wu said.</p>
            <p>Coach Wu, who used to be an infielder, shared a memory he will never forget. Hsu Shu-cheng was very afraid of the ball at first. "When the ball came, his head would move away when he tried to catch it," Coach Wu said. But Coach Wu saw his potential and tried to help him improve. After they got money to buy a pitching machine, they practiced for more than a year. Slowly, he overcame his fear.</p>
            <p>When Hsu Shu-cheng started fifth grade, his defense became steady. Coach Wu kept teaching him about strict and solid throwing and catching in the infield. Now, Hsu Shu-cheng has steady skills at shortstop. Coach Wu sees the good results and feels happy that Hsu Shu-cheng has received such good comments.</p>
            <p>Coach Wu has stayed in touch with Hsu Shu-cheng. He knows that Hsu Shu-cheng is seen as having the potential to play overseas. He keeps telling him to take care of his body because his baseball career is still long. Coach Wu and another coach, Huang Kuo-wei, have worked hard to help Kinmen baseball. They hope to make baseball popular in Kinmen again. Coach Wu also said that Hsu Shu-cheng's example will be a great encouragement for players in Kinmen.</p>

            <h1>Evergreen and Starlux Airlines Offer Business Class Upgrades for Soldiers on Armed Forces Day</h1>
            <p>After China Airlines said it would give free business class upgrades to active soldiers on Armed Forces Day, September 3, Evergreen Airlines and Starlux Airlines also announced today that they will offer special upgrades. On Armed Forces Day, soldiers on some international flights will get free business class upgrades.</p>
            <p>China Airlines announced today that active soldiers flying on regional international flights from Taiwan on Armed Forces Day will get special check-in and free business class upgrades if seats are available. This is to thank all military branches for their hard work and protection of the country.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Airlines also announced on its website today that it will offer upgrades on Armed Forces Day. Active soldiers flying on Evergreen and Uni Air international flights from Taoyuan, Songshan, or Kaohsiung on September 3 will have a chance to get a free business class upgrade.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Airlines stated that this upgrade offer is only for flights from Taoyuan, Songshan, and Kaohsiung airports to Asian areas that have two classes of service. However, certain flights will not be part of this offer. These include Bangkok flights BR75/BR67/BR211/BR201, Singapore flights BR215/BR225, Jakarta flight BR237, Ho Chi Minh flights BR391/BR395, and Shanghai flight BR712.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Airlines explained that active soldiers can take part in this offer by showing their military ID at the Evergreen Airlines ticket counter at the departure airport to be checked and registered. More details can be found at the ticket counter at the departure airport on the day of the event. Also, starting from September 3, the current offer of "priority boarding for active soldiers" will be made bigger. Now, one family member with a family card can also get priority boarding with the soldier.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines also started a similar offer. Starlux Airlines said that to celebrate Armed Forces Day on September 3, they will offer active soldiers free business class upgrades if seats are available on that day. Active soldiers flying on Starlux Airlines' two-class service flights (A330/A321neo aircraft) from Taiwan on that day can show their military ID when checking in to register. They will then have a chance to get a free business class upgrade if seats are open.</p>
            <p>Also, Starlux Airlines said that starting from September 3, active soldiers and one family member traveling with them can show their military ID and family card when boarding. They will both get priority boarding service on all flights leaving from Taiwan.</p>
