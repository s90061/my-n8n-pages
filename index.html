            <h1>More Violence at Taiwan Railway, Two Stations Lack Railway Police Becoming Unsafe Spots</h1>
            <p>Violence keeps happening at Taiwan Railway (TRA) stations. The Taiwan Railway Labor Union said today that since late July, Keelung Station has been disturbed every day by homeless people. They have hit and verbally attacked station workers. Homeless people have even followed workers home after their shift. Even though workers reported these incidents to the police many times, the police dealt with it, but the homeless people came back and continued to cause trouble. This has made all the station workers feel very tired. Reporting to the police clearly doesn't work, so they really need long-term security guards to keep the station safe.</p>
            <p>The union said that in recent years, several attacks on station workers have happened at TRA. But the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has still not made any improvements to station or train safety, as required by the Railway Act. Keelung Station is close to Keelung Port, and cruise ships often stop there. Also, a new route from Keelung to Ishigaki Island will open in September. This means more travelers will use Keelung Station, so there should be enough police to keep it safe.</p>
            <p>However, the union pointed out that among all the important stations in the northern area, Keelung Station and Wanhua Station are the only two that do not have railway police located there. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has ignored this problem for a long time, making these places unsafe. Even though the Taiwan Railway Company held a press conference to say they would enforce rules strongly, they did not hire security guards or ask for railway police to be placed at these stations.</p>
            <p>The union stated that neither the Ministry of Transportation and Communications nor the Taiwan Railway Company has done their job to protect their employees' safety. This has also put passenger safety and service quality at risk. They have failed badly. The union has already helped the Keelung Station staff to report these acts of harm at their workplace. They are asking the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Taiwan Railway Company to come up with long-term solutions. They also ask the Ministry of the Interior to put special police teams at important places, add more police stations, and have Taiwan Railway hire security guards to fix these unsafe areas.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Digital Affairs Supports APEC Declaration, Hopes to Build Sustainable Digital Systems Together</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) announced today that Minister Huang Yen-nan led a group to the APEC Digital and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ministerial Meeting. There, they joined representatives from 21 economies, including South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT. They released the first declaration for digital and AI ministers. This declaration asks all countries to work together to create a digital system that everyone can trust, is safe, and can last for a long time.</p>
            <p>MODA stated that Minister Huang Yen-nan led a group to the APEC Digital and AI Ministerial Meeting from August 4 to 6, Korean time. The meeting's main topic was "Digital and AI Transformation for Inclusive Prosperity and Sustainable Growth." During the meeting, MODA and ministers or representatives from 21 economies together released the first APEC declaration on digital and AI.</p>
            <p>MODA explained that the declaration focuses on topics like using AI, changing to digital ways, working together on cybersecurity, including everyone in digital access, and building digital networks. These points fit very well with MODA's goals of "strongly fighting fraud," "making digital systems stronger," and "growing the digital economy."</p>
            <p>Minister Huang said that this meeting was a good chance to show Taiwan's digital strength. It also allowed Taiwan to tell other economies how it "helps digital and AI innovations to solve social and economic problems" and "makes digital connections stronger for everyone."</p>
            <p>Minister Huang spoke about how Taiwan's AI system is built on three main ideas: "encouraging new ideas," "safety and trust," and "fairness for everyone in society." He also said that being open and having many different groups involved are very important. Everyone at the meeting liked these ideas.</p>
            <p>Minister Huang pointed out that during the meeting, Taiwan's group talked deeply with digital ministers or representatives from other economies. They discussed important topics they all cared about, such as AI development, computer security, digital strength, and new digital ideas. This helped to build a base for working together more in the future.</p>
            <p>In addition, Minister Huang also went to the "Global Digital and AI Forum," which was organized by South Korea and the World Bank. There, he and representatives from other countries talked about future challenges and ways to work together on AI and digital development.</p>
            <p>Minister Huang said that this trip was very successful. It showed Taiwan's ability and promise as a trusted digital partner in the Asia-Pacific area. It also made Taiwan's role in working with other countries stronger. In the future, Taiwan will continue to work more closely with countries in the region. It will help develop digital industries like AI, computer security, using data, and the next generation of communication. Taiwan will also keep showing its digital strength and its wish to work with other countries.</p>
