        const text = `**AI Set to Transform Jobs and Boost Economy, Experts Say**

Recent reports suggest that artificial intelligence (AI), especially generative AI like ChatGPT, will bring huge changes to the global economy and the job market. Experts believe AI could add trillions of dollars to the world's economy in the coming years. This growth will come from AI making businesses more efficient and helping people do their jobs better.

However, these changes mean that many jobs, especially in office settings, will be greatly affected. While AI is unlikely to replace all jobs, it will change how many tasks are done. This means employees will need to learn new skills to work alongside AI tools. Companies are advised to invest in training their staff, preparing them for a future where AI is a common part of the workplace. The goal is to use AI to improve productivity and create new opportunities, rather than just cutting jobs.

**Four-Day Work Week Gains Popularity as Companies See Benefits**

The idea of working just four days a week is becoming more popular around the world. Many companies are now trying out this new work schedule, hoping to improve employee well-being and productivity. Early results from these trials have been mostly positive, encouraging more businesses to consider the change.

Supporters of the four-day work week say it leads to happier employees, less stress, and a better balance between work and personal life. Some studies even show that workers are more focused and efficient when they know they have a longer weekend. This can result in the same amount of work being completed in fewer days. However, this model might not suit every industry, and some worry it could lead to longer, more tiring days during the four-day work period. Despite these challenges, the four-day work week is leading a significant discussion about the future of traditional work structures.

**Airlines Increase Investment in Sustainable Fuels for Greener Travel**

The travel industry is working hard to reduce its environmental impact, and a key part of this effort is investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF is a type of jet fuel made from alternative sources like used cooking oil, agricultural waste, or even certain types of plants. It is seen as a way to significantly lower carbon emissions from flights, making air travel more environmentally friendly.

Many major airlines worldwide are now committing to using more SAF in the future. They are signing agreements with producers and investing in new technologies to make SAF production more widespread and affordable. While SAF is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuel and only available in small amounts, experts believe it is essential for the long-term sustainability of air travel. This push for greener fuels shows the industry's dedication to tackling climate change and offering travelers more responsible choices.`;
