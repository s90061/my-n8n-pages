        const text = `**Ma Xingrui Leaves Xinjiang Leader Role: Hong Kong Media Says He Might Get a Less Important or New Important Job**

Ma Xingrui is no longer the Communist Party leader in Xinjiang, China. This news came after a meeting of high-level party officials. He is 66 years old and used to work in the aerospace industry.

Hong Kong media believes there are two possibilities for his next job. First, he might get a less important role, like previous Xinjiang leaders. Second, he could get a new, very important leadership position. This would mean that the central government is making new big changes.

The new Party leader for Xinjiang is Chen Xiaojiang.

**NSO Season Ends with "The Flying Dutchman" Opera Concert**

The National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) will perform the opera "The Flying Dutchman" to end their season. Jun MÃ¤rkl, the music director, chose this opera. He said the story of the Flying Dutchman, who searches for a place to call home, is a good fit for Taiwan because Taiwan is known for being friendly.

The NSO often ends its season with an opera. MÃ¤rkl explained that the chorus, or group of singers, will have a bigger role in this show. They will not only sing but also act. The show will feature well-known singers like Simon Bailey from Germany and the UK, Iwona Sobotka from Poland, and Mika Kaneko from Japan.

Simon Bailey, who plays the main character, described the opera with three important words: "rhythm," "emotion," and "power." The opera, written by Wagner, talks about women helping others and also deep ideas about God. You can see "The Flying Dutchman" on July 11 and 13 at the Taipei National Concert Hall.

**New Taipei City Uses AI for Recycling, Increases Recycling Rate by 13%**

New Taipei City's Environmental Protection Department is using new technology to help the environment. They are using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to reach their goal of having "zero emissions," which means putting no harmful gases into the air. They have started a special group to plan actions against climate change.

The city is using AI in smart traffic systems and in recycling plants. This has helped them recycle 13% more materials. At the recycling plants, AI robots can automatically sort different types of recyclable waste using cameras and special light. This makes the work easier for the cleanup staff.

The first AI recycling plant is in Wugu District. It also teaches people about how recycling works. New Taipei City hopes to become a smart city and achieve its "zero emissions" goal by the year 2050.
