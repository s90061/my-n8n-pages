            <h1>Trump Says Ending Many Wars; Not Getting Nobel Prize Would Be "Insult" to America</h1>
            <p>Donald Trump, the President of the United States, believes he has stopped many wars. Today, he said that if he does not win the Nobel Peace Prize for this, it would be an "insult" to America.</p>
            <p>Trump has always wanted to win this award, which will be announced on October 10. He tried to get the award for himself again today, after sharing his peace plan for the Gaza area yesterday.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke in front of many high-ranking American military officers. He said, "Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not. They will give the prize to someone who has done nothing."</p>
            <p>"I tell you, this would be a big insult to our country. I don't want it, I want our country to get this award."</p>
            <p>"Our country deserves the award because we have done something that has never been done before."</p>
            <p>Trump, who is a Republican, has always felt upset that Barack Obama, a former Democratic president, won the Peace Prize in 2009.</p>
            <p>In his speech today, he said again that since he returned to the White House in January this year, he has solved seven wars.</p>
            <p>Trump said that if his Gaza plan, which he announced with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House yesterday, works well, "then we will have solved eight wars in eight months. This is amazing."</p>
            <p>Hamas has not yet replied to this plan.</p>
            <p>However, in Oslo, Norway, where the Nobel Peace Prize winner is chosen, most people think Trump has almost no chance of winning this year.</p>
            <p>Oeivind Stenersen, a historian who studies the Nobel Peace Prize and wrote a book about it, told Agence France-Presse, "This is completely unbelievable."</p>
            <p>The Norwegian Nobel Committee also said that Trump's strong campaigning will not affect them.</p>
            <p>Kristian Berg Harpviken, the committee's secretary, recently told Agence France-Presse, "Of course, we see that some candidates get a lot of attention from the media. But this does not actually change the discussions within the committee."</p>
            <p>The Trump government recently listed seven wars he said he ended peacefully. These include Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
            <p>However, even though Trump quickly took credit for some of these changes, like announcing a ceasefire between nuclear countries India and Pakistan in May this year, many of his statements are only partly true or not true at all.</p>
