            <h1>Bangkok Building Collapsed in Earthquake; 23 People, Including Business Tycoon, Charged</h1>
            <p>A tall building in Bangkok fell down when a big earthquake happened in Myanmar in March. Today, prosecutors in Thailand have charged 23 people involved. One of them is a very rich construction businessman, Premchai Karnasuta.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the 30-story building fell just seconds after a strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake on March 28. That earthquake caused thousands of deaths.</p>
            <p>This building was supposed to be for the Thai audit office. It was the only building in Bangkok that fell during that earthquake. 89 people died there, and most of them were construction workers.</p>
            <p>The sudden fall of the building started a legal investigation. The Office of the Attorney General in Thailand said that the case has been sent to the criminal court. A decision is expected in a few months.</p>
            <p>In a statement, the Office of the Attorney General said, "Investigators agreed to charge 23 people and companies because of bad work and fake papers."</p>
            <p>The list of charges includes 16 people and 7 companies. It also names people who represent some of the charged companies, including one construction company and a Chinese building company.</p>
            <p>Before this, investigators from the Ministry of Justice looked into the quality of the building materials used at the site.</p>
            <p>Premchai Karnasuta, who is the head of Italian-Thai Development Plc, a large construction company in Thailand, is also charged. If he is found guilty, Mr. Premchai, who is 71 years old, could go to prison for up to 10 years and pay a fine of 200,000 Thai Baht, which is about 6,000 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Italian-Thai Development Plc is one of the top construction companies in Thailand, and it is also among those charged by the prosecutors.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu: Israel Plans to Fully Control Gaza Militarily</h1>
            <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today that Israel plans to have full military control over the Gaza area. This statement comes even with more and more people at home and abroad criticizing the war in the Palestinian area, which has caused much destruction for almost two years.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Netanyahu was asked on Fox News if Israel would take over Gaza. He said, "We plan to do this. We don't want to keep it. We want to have safe borders. We don't want to rule there. We don't want to be the governing group there."</p>
            <p>He also said that Israel wants to give control of this land to Arab armies.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu spoke to Fox News today before he met with a small group of important ministers. They were going to talk about the military's plan to control more of Gaza.</p>
            <p>Polls show that most Israelis want the war in Gaza to end with an agreement. This agreement would help free the people who are still being held hostage by Palestinian armed groups led by Hamas.</p>
