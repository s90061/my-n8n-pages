The Coast Guard Administration announced today that the government has approved a new payment for Coast Guard staff working late at night. This extra pay will start on July 1st. Staff will get NT$100 for each hour they work between midnight and 6 AM. This applies to officers from the Fleet Branch and Special Duty Corps who are on duty.

The Coast Guard said in a press release that the head of the Ocean Affairs Council, Kuan Bi-ling, understands that Coast Guard officers work hard day and night, no matter the weather. They protect national security and keep the seas safe, especially with more threats from China. So, since March this year, she has been trying to get this extra pay for them.

After many talks, the government and other groups have agreed to support this. The Coast Guard explained that the new payment for working late at night was approved on June 30th. If officers work outside their base between midnight and 6 AM and cannot rest, they will get NT$100 per hour. They can start getting this extra pay from July 1st. This plan is for officers in the Coast Guard's Fleet Branch and Special Duty Corps. It covers duties like sea patrols, keeping order at sea, and rescue missions in the sea and near the coast, or other duties done outside their base. The Coast Guard believes this will make their officers feel more motivated. It shows that their hard work and the danger of their night duties are valued. The Ocean Affairs Council is working hard to improve their pay and benefits.
