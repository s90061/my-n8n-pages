            <h1>CPBL All-Star Game: Former MLB Stars Wang Chien-Ming and Kuo Hong-Chih Play Before Home Run Derby</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Yang Chi-fang, Taipei, July 20) The CPBL All-Star Game is happening today at Taipei Dome. Before the Home Run Derby, two former Major League Baseball (MLB) star players, Wang Chien-Ming and Kuo Hong-Chih, played in a charity game. Kuo Hong-Chih hit a home run in the end. He shared that the bat he used was a gift from Jonathon Long, a mixed-heritage player.</p>
            <p>It's the second day of the CPBL All-Star Game. Before the Home Run Derby finals, there was a charity game. Wang Chien-Ming threw the ball, and Kuo Hong-Chih hit it. At first, Kuo Hong-Chih missed the ball, but in the end, he successfully hit the ball over the fence for a home run. Kuo Hong-Chih happily threw his bat and ran around the bases. This was a rare moment for former MLB stars to play against each other.</p>
            <p>After hitting the home run, Kuo Hong-Chih laughed and said, "The pitcher did most of the work. Wang Chien-Ming threw the ball right where I wanted it. I believe he rarely makes such a mistake in his career. It was the right time to meet the right batter, and then things went wild."</p>
            <p>About missing the ball at first, Wang Chien-Ming said, "He swung too hard because he wanted to hit a home run so much." Kuo Hong-Chih replied, "Actually, I rarely miss the ball in my career. The first time I missed was for senior Wang Chien-Ming."</p>
            <p>Kuo Hong-Chih said he was very nervous after getting an invitation from CPBL Commissioner Tsai Chi-chang. "The commissioner told me about this special task, which made me restless. I had many thoughts and was afraid I would disappoint the commissioner if I didn't hit it out." But Kuo Hong-Chih also said he was very happy to play at Taipei Dome for the first time. "Playing with Wang Chien-Ming on the field is a dream for many people."</p>
            <p>Kuo Hong-Chih shared that the bat he used was given to him by Jonathon Long, a talented baseball player from the Chicago Cubs in the US, who has both Taiwanese and American background. Kuo Hong-Chih explained, "I went to the US with Tsai Chi-chang before to ask Long if he wanted to play for the Taiwan team in the World Baseball Classic. I told him I was going to be in a home run derby, and he gave me a bat. It's very meaningful to hit a home run in Taiwan with his bat."</p>
            <p>Seeing that baseball in Taiwan is getting better, with places like Taipei Dome now available, Kuo Hong-Chih also said, "I'm very happy. In our time, it was harder. Now the environment is getting better, and everyone is happy to see it." (Edited by Chang Ya-ching) 1140720</p>

            <h1>CIER: Taiwan Dollar to Slowly Go Up Because of Strong Economy and US Interest Rate Cuts</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Reporter Pan Tzu-yu, Taipei, July 20) Recently, the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) exchange rate has gone down, touching 29.5 NTD per US dollar, due to worries about tariffs. However, since the beginning of this year, its value has risen the most among Asian currencies. The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) looked at the NTD's long-term trend. They believe that this year, the NTD will slowly go up because of Taiwan's strong economic situation and the US Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. They expect the NTD to stay strong at 28 NTD per US dollar by the end of the year, with an average of 28.39 NTD in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>From the second quarter of this year, the NTD exchange rate started to go up strongly. This happened because people expected it to get stronger due to talks between Taiwan and the US, and also because exports were strong, making companies sell US dollars for NTD. In early May, there was a "huge rise" where the NTD went up by more than 1 NTD in two trading days. After that, the Central Bank stepped in to stabilize the exchange rate, and the market became calm again. But the NTD continued to get stronger steadily.</p>
            <p>In July, the NTD went back down to around 29.5 NTD per US dollar. This was because US President Trump announced new tariff rates for different countries, causing Asian currencies to weaken. However, most people in the market still think the NTD will get stronger in the long term.</p>
            <p>CIER believes there are three main reasons why the NTD has been getting stronger in the short term. First, exporters quickly want to change their US dollars back into NTD. Second, everyone expects the Central Bank to let the currency get stronger to help with trade talks with the US. Third, the Taiwan stock market has gone up a lot, making foreign investors bring in a lot of money.</p>
            <p>CIER analyzed that the part about exporters changing US dollars for NTD is closely linked to Taiwan's trade balance. If the trade balance gets worse and exports go down, the NTD will not get stronger as much, or it might even go down.</p>
            <p>Regarding the expectations from the US trade talks, CIER said that as the trade talks with the US finish, these expectations will go down, which will also help the NTD return to a normal value.</p>
            <p>As for the money coming in from foreign investors, CIER believes that the financial market is now less affected by tariff issues. Since the US stock market and the Taiwan stock market are closely linked, the next thing to watch is how the US stock market performs, because it could then affect the Taiwan stock market.</p>
            <p>Looking at the long term, CIER pointed out that the NTD is still expected to go up slowly. This is mainly because of Taiwan's strong economic situation and how many times and how much the US Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.</p>
            <p>According to CIER's economic forecast for the third quarter, the US dollar index will stay relatively weak in the second half of the year. Also, from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chart, it looks like the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in the second half of 2025. Considering inflation, interest rate differences, and the economic situation, the NTD to US dollar exchange rate will go from 32.89 NTD in the first quarter to about 28.39 NTD in the fourth quarter. The average price for the whole year will be about 30.32 NTD, which is about 5.92% stronger than 32.11 NTD in 2024. (Edited by Huang Kuo-lun) 1140720</p>
