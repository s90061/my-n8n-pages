Police in Azerbaijan went into the office of a Russian state news agency today. They arrested three journalists. This happened while Azerbaijan and Russia were already having problems. This new action has made the situation between the two countries more difficult.

The Russian Foreign Ministry called in Azerbaijan's ambassador. They asked for an explanation about the police raid at the Sputnik news office and the "illegal arrest of Russian journalists." It is said that this office continued to work even though it was told to stop in February.

Sputnik news agency said that their manager and chief editor in Baku were arrested. They were "wrongly accused of being agents for the FSB," which is a security service. A reporter from AFP saw the two people being taken away by the police. Later, another Russian journalist was also arrested when they arrived to film the raid.

The Kaohsiung City Government is helping older people find places to live. They are using public housing to create "elderly homes." These homes are managed by welfare groups.

The Social Affairs Bureau of Kaohsiung City Government said today that each home in Fengshan has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and two bathrooms. They come with furniture like shoe cabinets, wardrobes, and kitchen cabinets. They also have air conditioning, water heaters, gas stoves, and range hoods.

**Market Cap ETFs Are Popular: Investment Firms Launching US 50 and Global Blue-Chip ETFs**

Last year, high-dividend ETFs were very popular. This year, market-cap ETFs are becoming very well-known. The Taiwan 50 index, which includes the top 50 companies in Taiwan by market value, has grown a lot in the last two years. Now, many investors are looking at markets outside Taiwan. Investment companies are quickly offering new ETFs: the US 50 ETF and global blue-chip ETFs. These new ETFs focus on the biggest and most important companies in the US and around the world, like a bigger version of the Taiwan 50.

Experts say that in the past, smaller companies in the stock market often did very well. But now, as the global economy gets bigger and bigger, large companies are doing better. For example, like TSMC in the Taiwan stock market, big companies can give as good returns as smaller ones. This makes investors really want market-cap ETFs.

Today, Uni-President Asset Management announced that the Uni-President US 50 ETF (009811) will start selling on July 9th. This ETF follows the US 50 index, which picks the 50 strongest companies in the US stock market based on their market value. All of these companies are leaders in their industries.
