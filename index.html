            <h1>Lithuania's New Government Takes Office, But Appointment of Culture Minister Is Still Questioned</h1>
            <p>Lithuania's parliament approved the new government's plan on September 25. Prime Minister Ruginiene and 14 ministers officially started their jobs. This is the 20th government. However, the new Culture Minister, Adomavicius, is still being questioned about his work background. This is what many people are talking about.</p>
            <p>Lithuania's national radio (LRT) reported that Mindaugas Linge, a conservative politician, joked about the new government's professional standards. He said they are "between a barbecue seller and a pasta maker." This meant that Adomavicius's family runs a pasta and dumpling business, and he does not have enough experience for the job.</p>
            <p>President Gitanas Nauseda also joked before that running a barbecue shop or selling luxury cars is not enough experience to be a minister. But in the end, he still chose Adomavicius as the Culture Minister. This made hundreds of people from the art and culture world protest outside the President's office yesterday.</p>
            <p>Former Prime Minister Gintautas Paluckas resigned after being investigated for a conflict of interest. Inga Ruginiene, a new politician from the Social Democratic Party, was chosen by Nauseda to be the next Prime Minister. She was in charge of forming the new government.</p>
            <p>Forming this government was difficult and took 30 days. This is longer than the last government, which took 21 days. It is also the longest time to form a government in Lithuania since the constitution was approved in 1992. Out of the ministers, 8 are new, and 6 stayed in their old jobs.</p>
            <p>On September 25, Lithuania's parliament approved the new government's plan with 80 votes for, 40 votes against, and 2 people not voting. The new government then started their work.</p>
            <p>Ruginiene said that the new government will work to make public services better, encourage public discussions, and spend more money on defense. They will also make sure salaries grow, old people have more respect, and people who are struggling have better lives. She said that all decisions will be based on respect and talking to each other.</p>
            <p>The government's plan includes spending 5% of the country's money on defense, not raising taxes during their time in office, not increasing the diesel fuel tax, making changes to pensions faster, giving more money for social welfare, increasing salaries for government workers, making waiting times for medical care shorter, improving roads, and stopping extra fees for health insurance. Most of these plans are similar to the previous government's ideas. For foreign relations, they will be less strict with China and want to have normal diplomatic relations again.</p>
            <p>However, the opposition parties said the government's team and plans are "messy." They pointed out that some ministers did not help write the plans. Also, the plans involve spending a lot of money, but they do not say where new money will come from. Many of the chosen ministers' work backgrounds were also questioned by the public. How Ruginiene will lead the new government and answer these questions will be something everyone watches closely.</p>

            <h1>Green Party Accuses Huang Kuo-chang of Running a Spying Group, White Party Says Media Is Misleading</h1>
            <p>Mirror News reported today that Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party, has been training a group to secretly follow and photograph politicians from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). DPP lawmakers are very angry, saying that if this is true, it would be the biggest scandal in politics. The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) has fought back, saying that Mirror News is making things up and mixing different stories. They believe it is a way to distract people from problems with disaster relief.</p>
            <p>Last June, Wang Yi-chuan, a DPP lawmaker, thought he was being followed and reported it to the police. In August, the prosecutor decided not to charge anyone. But Mirror News reported today that Huang Kuo-chang has been training a group to secretly follow and photograph DPP politicians. The report also said that Huang Kuo-chang himself leads these "paparazzi."</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao, a DPP lawmaker, said today that there have been rumors for some time in politics and in parliament about a secret spying group. She said the clues revealed by the media now are very similar to these rumors, which shows that such a group really exists.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that if the media report is true, it is truly the biggest scandal in politics today. She said it is wrong to use immoral methods like watching, following, and secretly photographing political opponents with different opinions. She asked people to see that this is even worse than evil, it is dirty political tactics. She said all victims can take legal action together, because only the law can protect victims.</p>
            <p>The media mentioned that Wang Yi-chuan has been asking questions for many days, but Huang Kuo-chang has always replied by saying he won't join in or stoop to a low level. Wu Szu-yao pointed out that Huang Kuo-chang, who loves to connect things and accuse others, is very good at spreading bad rumors and hinting things about other people. But when it is about himself, even when things are very clear, he chooses to change the subject. She said Huang Kuo-chang's reactions in front of the media recently show that he is weak and feels guilty. He cannot hide for much longer and should bravely face the issue, instead of blaming others or changing the subject to avoid the problem.</p>
            <p>Wang Yi-chuan said today that China's Taiwan Affairs Office announced sanctions against him last May. He said the "paparazzi" started renting cars and following him in May last year. If the people who follow other politicians are the same group of people he met, get paid by the same company, and are directed by the same person, then it is not just a problem of him being followed.</p>
            <p>He stressed, "Where does the money for these things come from? Who pays these people? And where does the money come from?" He will now sue Huang Kuo-chang's group and get to the bottom of it. He said, "Huang Kuo-chang, you cannot hide."</p>
            <p>The Taiwan People's Party (TPP) responded today with a statement. They said that Mirror Media bothered Huang Kuo-chang by following him in the summer of 2023. Huang Kuo-chang then collected evidence to protect himself. Two years later, Mirror News used parts of those old conversations to make up stories and put different things together to help the DPP spread lies. They said Wang Yi-chuan then came out to yell and insult them, and even brought up the sanctions from China, which is an old trick to make someone look bad.</p>
            <p>The TPP pointed out that with the poor disaster relief efforts and many problems, this kind of false accusation is just repeating the same old plan of the party, prosecutors, and media working together to make news to change the focus of attention.</p>
