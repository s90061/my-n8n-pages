More and more American investors are getting caught in what appears to be a clear fraud: small Chinese companies, such as Jayud Global Logistics and China Liberal Education, go public on Nasdaq and then crash dramatically just weeks later. What starts as a persuasive advertisement on Facebook or WhatsApp quickly turns into a "pump-and-dump" scheme, where the stock price is artificially inflated before being sold off by the manipulators.

This pattern suggests a new form of stock manipulation. These small companies raise millions in their initial public offerings (IPOs), only for their stock value to plummet, causing significant losses for investors. The scams use social media and messaging apps to attract investors, making it seem like a legitimate opportunity.

**Saudi Arabia-based Leasing Company to Buy 10 Airbus A350 Freighters**

AviLease, a new aircraft leasing company based in Saudi Arabia, is entering the air cargo market with an order for ten large Airbus A350 cargo jets. This agreement was announced by Airbus at the Paris Air Show on Monday. The A350 freighter model offers the flexibility to use 20-foot shipping containers, a feature rarely seen in traditional side-loading aircraft, according to Crawford Hamilton, head of freighter marketing at Airbus.

This strategic move by AviLease highlights Saudi Arabia's commitment to modernizing its fleet and expanding its role in the global air cargo industry. The addition of these advanced cargo jets will enhance the company's capacity and capabilities in air freight.

**How the Humble Water Gun Became the Symbol of Barcelona's Anti-Tourism Movement**

In Barcelona, Spain, a simple plastic water gun has become an unexpected symbol of the anti-tourism movement. At a recent protest, a woman used one to squirt water at tourists sitting outdoors, illustrating how this cheap toy has become a tool in demonstrations against overtourism in the country.

While not all locals are using water guns against tourists, they are increasingly seen at protests. This trend reflects growing frustration among residents who feel that mass tourism is negatively impacting their quality of life, leading to rising rents, crowded public spaces, and a loss of local culture. The water gun, a seemingly harmless item, represents a non-violent but noticeable way for activists to express their discontent.
