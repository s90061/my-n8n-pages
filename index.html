            <h1>Russia and Ukraine Exchange 146 Prisoners Each, with UAE Help</h1>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine have exchanged 146 prisoners each. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) helped make this happen. This news comes from the Russian Ministry of Defense and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>The Russian Ministry of Defense said that all the Russian soldiers who were set free are now in Belarus. They are getting help for their minds and bodies.</p>
            <p>The ministry also said that Ukraine returned eight people from Russia's Kursk region.</p>
            <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the prisoner exchange on Telegram, which is a messaging app. He did not say how many people were exchanged at first.</p>
            <p>He shared pictures of the freed prisoners, who looked very happy. He said that most of them were caught after Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022. A journalist who was captured one month after the attack was also among them.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy thanked the UAE for helping with the exchange. He wrote that "prisoner exchanges are still happening." He also suggested that this is possible because Ukrainian soldiers are taking more Russian prisoners.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy called the Russian soldiers captured in Russia's Kursk region an "exchange fund" for Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>Canada's Prime Minister: Sending Peacekeepers to Ukraine Is Possible</h1>
            <p>Canada's Prime Minister, Mark Carney, told Ukraine's President Zelenskyy that Canada agrees with Ukraine's wish for strong safety promises in any peace deal. He said that Canada might send peacekeeping soldiers to Ukraine if such a plan is made.</p>
            <p>This comes 3.5 years after Russia started a big war against Ukraine. The President of the United States, Donald Trump, is trying to help make peace. Ukraine is also working with its friends in Europe to create plans for safety after the war. Mr. Trump has said he is open to these plans.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy held a celebration for Ukraine's Independence Day in Kyiv. Prime Minister Carney, who visited Ukraine for the first time since becoming prime minister in March, was there. Mr. Keith Kellogg, who is a special helper for President Trump, was also there.</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy spoke at Sophia Square in Kyiv. He told his guests, "We are all working hard to make sure that when this war ends, Ukraine will have promises of peace. This way, our children and their children will not have to suffer from war or the threat of war."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said he hopes the future safety promises in a possible peace deal will be very similar to Article 5 of NATO. Article 5 means that if one NATO country is attacked, all other NATO countries will act as if they are also attacked.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Carney supported Ukraine's wish for other countries to be involved.</p>
            <p>At a press conference together, Carney said, "Canada believes it is not real to expect that only the strength of Ukraine's army will keep it safe. The army must be supported and made stronger."</p>
            <p>The leaders of Canada and Ukraine also signed an agreement to work together to make drones. Carney said that next month, Ukraine will receive more than 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 22 billion New Taiwan dollars) in military help that was promised earlier.</p>

            <h1>With Peace Talks Stuck, Zelenskyy Calls for Meeting with Putin</h1>
            <p>Today is Ukraine's Independence Day. President Zelenskyy said that talking with Russian President Putin would be "the best way to make peace happen." This is because efforts to end the war through talks have stopped.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Ukraine used drones to attack today. This caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Russia.</p>
            <p>The President of the United States, Donald Trump, tried to set up a meeting between the two leaders. But hopes for peace became smaller after Russia said on August 22 that Putin and Zelenskyy would not meet right away.</p>
            <p>However, President Zelenskyy repeated his call for a meeting today. He said, "a meeting between the leaders is the best way to make the peace process move forward."</p>
            <p>Earlier, Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said that Western countries were trying to "find reasons to stop the talks." He also criticized Zelenskyy for "demanding a meeting right now, no matter what."</p>
            <p>President Zelenskyy promised to "make Russia agree to peace." He said this at a ceremony where Mr. Keith Kellogg, who is a special helper for the United States, and other officials from Western countries were present.</p>
