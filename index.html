            <h1>TRA Reports More Attacks; Union Says Two Stations Lack Railway Police, Become Dangerous Spots</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) stations are still having many violent attacks. The Taiwan Railway Labor Union said today that since the end of July, station staff at Keelung Station have been bothered by homeless people every day. These homeless people have hit and used bad words against the staff. The union said that Keelung Station and Wanhua Station are the only two stations without railway police. This makes them dangerous places.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Railway Labor Union released a statement. It said that from the end of July until today, staff at TRA Keelung Station have been bothered by homeless people at least three times every day. These people not only hit and spoke badly to staff but also followed staff home after work. Staff have called the police many times as their station manager told them to. But after the police leave, the homeless people come back and keep bothering them. All the station staff are very tired from this. Calling the police does not seem to work. The station needs security guards for a long time to keep it safe.</p>
            <p>The union said that in recent years, there have been several attacks on TRA staff. But the Ministry of Transportation has not made any improvements for station and train safety, as required by the Railway Act. Keelung Station is near Keelung Port, where cruise ships often stop. Also, a new route from Keelung to Ishigaki Island will start in September. This means more people will use Keelung Station. So, there should be enough police to keep it safe.</p>
            <p>However, the union pointed out that among other main stations in the Northern Operations Division, Keelung Station and Wanhua Station are the only two that do not have railway police. The Ministry of Transportation has ignored these dangerous spots for a long time. Even though TRA Company held a press conference to say they would enforce rules strongly, they did not hire security guards or ask for railway police to be at these stations.</p>
            <p>The union said that both the Ministry of Transportation and TRA Company have not kept their promise to protect their employees' safety. This has also affected the safety of passengers and the quality of services. This is a serious failure of duty. The union has helped the Keelung Station staff report illegal harm at work. They ask the Ministry of Transportation and TRA Company to provide long-term solutions. They also ask the Ministry of the Interior to send the Second Special Police Corps to important places like these stations. They want more police stations and TRA to hire security guards to fix these dangerous areas.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Digital Affairs Responds to APEC Declaration, Hopes to Build Sustainable Digital System Together</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs (moda) announced today that its minister, Huang Yen-nan, led a group to the APEC Digital and Artificial Intelligence Ministerial Meeting. There, he and representatives from 21 economies, including South Korea's Ministry of Science and ICT, released the first ever Digital and AI Ministerial Declaration. This declaration asks all countries to work together to build a digital system that is trustworthy, safe, and can last a long time.</p>
            <p>The moda stated that Minister Huang Yen-nan led the group to the APEC Digital and Artificial Intelligence Ministerial Meeting from August 4th to 6th, local time in South Korea. The meeting's main topic was "Digital and AI Transformation for Inclusive Prosperity and Sustainable Growth." During the meeting, moda, along with ministers and representatives from 21 economies, together released APEC's first Digital and AI Ministerial Declaration.</p>
            <p>The moda explained that the declaration focuses on topics like using artificial intelligence, changing to digital systems, working together on cybersecurity, making digital services available to everyone, and building digital infrastructure. It also asks all countries to work together to create a digital system that people can trust, is safe, and can continue to grow. These ideas match very well with the moda's own goals: to "strongly fight fraud," "make digital systems stronger," and "develop the digital economy."</p>
            <p>Minister Huang Yen-nan said that this meeting was a good chance to show Taiwan's strengths in digital technology. It also allowed Taiwan to share with other economies its specific actions in "promoting digital and AI innovation to meet social and economic challenges" and "making digital connections stronger for everyone."</p>
            <p>Minister Huang mentioned that building Taiwan's AI system relies on three main supports: "encouraging new ideas," "safety and trust," and "fairness for everyone in society." He also stressed that being open and having many different groups involved are very important. The people at the meeting all agreed with these points.</p>
            <p>Minister Huang said that during the meeting, Taiwan's group talked deeply with digital ministers or representatives from other economies. They discussed important topics that concern everyone, such as how AI is growing, keeping information safe online, making digital systems strong, and creating new digital ideas. This laid the groundwork for future cooperation.</p>
            <p>Also, Minister Huang attended the "Global Digital and AI Forum," which was organized by South Korea and the World Bank. There, he and representatives from other countries discussed the future problems and ways to work together in AI and digital growth.</p>
            <p>Minister Huang said that this trip was very successful. It showed Taiwan's strength and promise as a trustworthy digital partner in the Asia-Pacific region. It also made Taiwan's role in international cooperation stronger. In the future, Taiwan will continue to improve cooperation in the region. It will also help develop digital industries like AI, cybersecurity, using data, and next-generation communication. Taiwan will also keep showing its digital strengths and its wish to work with other countries.</p>
