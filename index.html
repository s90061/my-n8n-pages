            <h1>Proposal to Delay High School Start Time; Education Groups: Curriculum Review Needed</h1>
            <p>A new idea suggests that high school students should start classes later, at 10 AM. However, education groups say that if only the class times change and the school curriculum and other arrangements do not, it might make teaching worse. They believe that if the time students spend at school is shortened, then the curriculum and related plans must also be looked at and changed.</p>
            <p>Someone recently suggested on a government website that high schools should have classes from 10 AM to 4 PM. This idea aims to help students get more sleep and have better learning. The proposal started on September 9th and quickly received enough support by September 14th, with over ten thousand people signing it.</p>
            <p>Today, the National Education Alliance released a statement. They said they support the main idea of improving students' sleep and learning. But similar ideas to start school later have come up many times before. If only the school times are changed, and the curriculum and other support systems are not, it could mean less time for teaching. It might also lead to teachers giving more homework to make up for lost class time. This would hurt the quality of learning and would not help students learn better.</p>
            <p>The National Education Alliance explained that if the number of courses and how the courses are structured stay the same, there is almost no way to change the total hours students spend in class. If students spend less time at school, teachers will have to rush through lessons, and this will cause more pressure on them.</p>
            <p>The National Education Alliance suggests finding out why students go to bed late. They also suggest understanding how students travel to school and how they are picked up. They also think that different areas could try "starting school later but keeping the same class hours" or "having flexible arrival times." If the total time students spend at school is made shorter, then the number of courses, how students are tested, and how many teachers are needed must all be reviewed. They also need to plan for safe care at school and transportation help for families who need it or are disadvantaged.</p>
            <p>The National Federation of Teachers' Unions believes that students in Taiwan spend too much time studying. If class hours are shortened, it means the school curriculum must be changed. If the goal is for students to get enough sleep, then simply starting school later or shortening school hours might not solve the problem. This is because students might still stay up late.</p>

            <h1>China Reviews New Law: Those Abroad Who Harm Ethnic Unity Will Face Legal Punishment</h1>
            <p>Last week, a meeting of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee discussed a new draft law. It is called the "Ethnic Unity and Progress Promotion Law." According to the information shared, people from outside China who do things that hurt ethnic unity and progress will be punished by law.</p>
            <p>Xinhua news agency reported that after the "July 5th riots" in Xinjiang in 2009, the government in Beijing started to change its rules about ethnic groups. They began to emphasize "building a strong feeling of togetherness for the Chinese nation" and made ethnic differences seem less important. The "Ethnic Unity and Progress Promotion Law" is the first special law that formally includes "ethnic unity" as a key part of how the country is managed. The draft law has an introduction and seven chapters, with a total of 62 rules.</p>
            <p>The draft law states that no group or person can stop citizens from learning and using the national common language. Also, no one can cause problems or make conflicts worse by using reasons like ethnic background, customs, or religious beliefs, which would disturb public order.</p>
            <p>Regarding "building a shared spiritual home," the draft law says that people should protect the good image of the Chinese nation. They should respect the history of how the Chinese nation was formed and developed. No one should insult, make fun of, or disrespect it. The country will fully promote and make popular the national common language, and help young children learn Mandarin.</p>
            <p>The draft law also states that the country supports Hong Kong and Macau in teaching about Chinese history, Chinese culture, and the current situation of the country. This is to help people in Hong Kong and Macau to willingly protect the country's power, safety, and interests.</p>
            <p>The draft law also says that the country will help with economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between mainland China and Taiwan. It aims to bring the two sides closer in many different areas. It wants to make people in Taiwan feel more connected to the Chinese nation, feel proud of it, and agree with it. It also wants people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work together to promote Chinese culture and understand that they are all part of the Chinese nation and are Chinese people.</p>
            <p>The draft law sets out the social conditions and requirements to help different ethnic groups interact, exchange ideas, and live together peacefully. This includes helping different ethnic groups to live together in harmony and develop together.</p>
            <p>The draft law also says that if someone organizes, plans, or carries out violent terrorist activities, activities that divide ethnic groups, or extreme religious activities, and these actions are crimes, they will be punished by criminal law. If someone encourages or pays for these actions, and they are crimes, they will also be punished by criminal law.</p>
            <p>The draft law also stresses that if groups or individuals outside China do things that harm ethnic unity and progress or cause ethnic division against the "People's Republic of China," they will be held legally responsible.</p>

            <h1>African Swine Fever Breaks Out in Yeoncheon, South Korea; National Alert Level Rises to "Severe"</h1>
            <p>On September 14th, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters in South Korea confirmed that African Swine Fever (ASF) was found at a pig farm in Yeoncheon County, Gyeonggi Province. Today, they have raised the national alert level to "severe," which is the highest level of warning.</p>
            <p>After the headquarters confirmed the outbreak at the Yeoncheon County pig farm on September 14th, they followed their plans. They killed all 847 pigs at that farm. They also sent a team to the area. This team controlled who could enter and leave and started to study the disease.</p>
            <p>Today, the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters met with other government departments to check the situation of the swine fever outbreak. After the meeting, they changed the national alert level. This is the first confirmed case of swine fever in Korea in two months, and it is the fifth case this year.</p>
            <p>To stop the disease from spreading, government officials have ordered that workers and vehicles from pig farms and related businesses in Yeoncheon County and five nearby cities and counties, including Paju City, cannot move. This ban will be in place until 8 PM local time on September 16th. They have also brought 33 large disinfection machines and disinfection vehicles to clean 294 pig farms and roads near the affected area.</p>
            <p>Sixty-one livestock farms within 10 kilometers of the affected pig farm, and 22 farms that had contact with the affected farm, are now being checked very carefully. According to Yonhap News Agency, government officials plan to do health checks on these 83 farms every week.</p>
            <p>The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasures Headquarters said that the 847 pigs killed are less than 0.01% of all pigs raised in South Korea. They believe this will not affect the country's supply of pork.</p>
