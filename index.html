            <h1>Aid flotilla to Gaza stopped by Israeli forces; activists sent to Istanbul</h1>
            <p>Turkish officials said today that 36 Turkish citizens and other people from 12 countries will arrive in Istanbul today. This comes after Israel stopped a group of ships carrying help to Gaza and held hundreds of people.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that a Turkish diplomat said the special plane will land in Istanbul at 3:40 PM local time. It has 137 people from the group of ships, including 36 Turkish citizens.</p>
            <p>The Turkish diplomat said that besides Turkish citizens, other people on the plane are from 12 countries. These countries are the United States, United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia, and Jordan.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, Oncu Keceli, the spokesperson for the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, announced that a special plane was hired to bring the held activists from Israel back to Turkey.</p>
            <p>Last month, activists like Greta Thunberg from Sweden started a journey on "Global Sumud Flotilla" ships. They tried again to break Israel's sea blockade and bring medical supplies and food to Gaza. However, since October 1st, Israeli forces have stopped these ships and held the people on board.</p>
            <p>Turkey has called Israel's stopping of the ships a "terrorist act." On October 2nd, Turkey also said it has started an investigation into the Israeli military holding Turkish citizens on the ships.</p>
            <p>In June and July this year, Israel also stopped similar groups of ships trying to reach Gaza.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan and Japan Railway Museums cooperate, hope to share digital collections next</h1>
            <p>The National Railway Museum of Taiwan and the Railway Museum in Omiya, Japan, signed an agreement in 2023. The head of Taiwan's museum, Zheng Ming-zhang, said they hope to work together to make their collections better and make them digital.</p>
            <p>Zheng Ming-zhang told a CNA reporter that after signing the agreement in 2023, the two museums will start working together on staff, exhibitions, and research. For example, in February this year, they worked with the Omiya Railway Museum to plan an exhibition called "Japanese Style x Taiwanese Flavor: The Food Culture of Taiwan's Railways."</p>
            <p>After working together on an exhibition, Zheng Ming-zhang hopes they can improve their collections. He mentioned that the Omiya Railway Museum has some important old documents, like government notices and train schedules from when Japan ruled Taiwan. He hopes they can work together to make these collections digital. They plan to start looking into what they need next year for this project.</p>
            <p>Zheng Ming-zhang said that working together again on exhibitions, even having them in Taiwan, or studying and sharing their documents, or holding small academic meetings and railway talks to help their researchers meet, is a great chance. It will help the National Railway Museum of Taiwan show its research to the world.</p>
            <p>Also, the director of the Omiya Railway Museum in Japan, Toru Ishida, recently spoke to Taiwanese reporters. He said that last year, 770,000 people visited the Omiya Railway Museum. In August this year, 1,000 Taiwanese tourists bought tickets online to visit. He thinks about 10,000 Taiwanese tourists visit each year. He also said that when he visited Taiwan's National Railway Museum in July this year, he saw many Japanese people there. He believes this kind of exchange is excellent.</p>

            <h1>Altman reportedly travels to East Asia and Middle East to raise money for OpenAI expansion</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported today that Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, an American company that makes AI, has started a trip across East Asia and the Middle East. He wants to find investors and partners to make things for OpenAI. This is to help OpenAI meet its need for more computer power.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that, according to The Wall Street Journal, Sam Altman has been talking to big suppliers in Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan since late September last year. He wants to make more AI chips and make sure OpenAI gets them first. These suppliers include TSMC, Foxconn, Samsung, and SK Hynix.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not say if the report is true. TSMC, Foxconn, Samsung, and SK Hynix could not comment right away because it was not business hours.</p>
            <p>Samsung and SK Hynix already signed an agreement this week. They may supply memory chips for OpenAI's data centers.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal also said that Altman plans to visit investors in the United Arab Emirates. He wants to get money to build more for OpenAI and for its research.</p>
            <p>The report also mentioned that people who know the situation said OpenAI recently told its investors and partners that it might spend about 16 billion US dollars this year to rent computer servers. By 2029, this cost could go up to about 400 billion US dollars.</p>
