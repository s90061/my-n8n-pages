            <h1>Taichung Rider Upset After Not Overtaking, Follows and Beats Bus Driver, Sent to Police</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a man named Chen was riding his motorcycle and had a problem on the road with a Ubus company bus in Taichung. He then followed the bus to the bus platform at Taichung Railway Station. There, he stopped the driver, Mr. Lin, and hit him. Mr. Lin was hurt, and Mr. Chen left the scene. Today, Mr. Chen went to the police and said he was angry because he could not easily pass the bus. The police have sent his case to the prosecutor's office. He is being investigated for hurting someone and other crimes.</p>
            <p>The Third Police Station in Taichung City said today that at 9:02 PM yesterday, they received a call. The report was about a bus driver being hit by a man at the bus platform of Taichung Railway Station. Police officers quickly went to the place to help.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, Mr. Lin, the 29-year-old Ubus driver, told them what happened. He said that he was waiting at a red light near Taiwan Boulevard and Xingzhong Street in Central District. A man he didn't know stopped him and hit his car window. The man said that Mr. Lin had gotten in his way while driving.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin did not pay attention to the man. But the man followed the bus to the Taichung Station bus platform. There, the man suddenly used his helmet to hit the bus's rearview mirror. He then used his hands to hit Mr. Lin. This broke the rearview mirror. Mr. Lin also got scratches on his neck and a broken hand. When the police arrived, the fighting had stopped. They first helped Mr. Lin go to the hospital. After he was treated, Mr. Lin went to the police station right away to make a complaint.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen came to tell his side of the story this afternoon. He told the police that he was unhappy because he could not easily pass the bus while driving. So, he followed the bus to the Taichung Railway Station bus platform to argue. Then he hit the driver. After the police questioned him, Mr. Chen's case was sent to the Taiwan Taichung District Prosecutor's Office. He is being investigated for hurting someone and damaging property.</p>

            <h1>Wei Chuan Dragons' New Foreign Pitcher Has Good Speed and Power for Starting Role; Team Looks at Long Sheng and Ai Long</h1>
            <p>The Wei Chuan Dragons baseball team has a new foreign pitcher. His name has not been officially announced yet, but he has already started training with the team. The head coach, Yeh Chun-chang, said that the new foreign pitcher is planned to be a starter. He throws with good speed and power. When the team decides which foreign pitchers to keep, Long Sheng and Ai Long seem to be less consistent right now.</p>
            <p>The Dragons' new foreign pitcher has arrived in Taiwan and joined the team. The team only said that he is a right-handed pitcher who has been playing regularly; his name is not public yet. Before today's game, Dragons' head coach Yeh Chun-chang told reporters that the new foreign pitcher has joined the team. He did some simple training yesterday. The pitcher has stayed in good playing shape, so he should not have many problems playing in real games. The team is just waiting for his official papers to be ready.</p>
            <p>Coach Yeh said that they need to watch the new foreign pitcher's performance first. The current plan is for him to pitch one game with the second team (minor league). After that, he might get a chance to play with the first team (major league). This will happen unless his condition is very bad. If everything goes well, he can join the first team.</p>
            <p>When asked about the new foreign pitcher's style, Coach Yeh said the team needs a starting pitcher now. The new foreign pitcher can throw fastballs at about 150 kilometers per hour. He has both speed and power. However, it is hard to say how good his control will be. When a player moves to a new place, it is sometimes hard to know exactly. But he is a pitcher with good skills.</p>
            <p>The deadline for foreign players in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (August 31st) is coming soon. Regarding which foreign players to keep, Coach Yeh said that Tyler Eppler and Andrew Gagnon will definitely stay. The other two, Zac Lowther (Long Sheng) and Aaron Leasher (Ai Long), might be changed.</p>
            <p>Coach Yeh explained that if Ai Long wants to be a starting pitcher, he cannot throw enough pitches as planned, and his performance is not very good. Long Sheng is also not very steady; he plays well in some games and not well in others, which makes him hard to depend on. The coaches have an idea in their minds, but they still need to watch and see.</p>
