            <h1>Judge Stops Trump from Sending National Guard to California</h1>
            <p>A federal judge has stopped the US President Trump's government from using the military to fight crime in California today. The Republican president had said he would send troops to more American cities, including Chicago.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Judge Charles Breyer, from the San Francisco federal court, decided that Trump's government purposely broke the "Posse Comitatus Act." This law stops federal military forces from being involved in law enforcement inside the country.</p>
            <p>In June, Trump ordered 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 active-duty Marines to go to Los Angeles. This was in response to protests after many immigrants were caught.</p>
            <p>Today's decision is a setback for Trump's plan to make the military's role bigger inside the US. Critics believe this is a dangerous increase of the president's power and could cause problems between the military and regular people.</p>

            <h1>Nepalese Tutor Sentenced to 10.5 Years for Growing Marijuana, Will Be Sent Out of Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A Nepalese tutor named Mr. Jin was involved with others in growing 291 marijuana plants. These plants are worth over 20 million NT dollars. A court in Shilin recently gave Mr. Jin a sentence of 10 years and 6 months in prison. After he finishes his sentence or gets a pardon, he will be sent out of Taiwan. Mr. Ma, who was also in the case, was sentenced to 14 years and 6 months. This decision can be appealed.</p>
            <p>According to court documents from the Shilin District Court, Mr. Jin, a Mexican tutor named Mr. Sheng (whose case was handled separately), and a Taiwanese man named Mr. Ma, grew marijuana in places like Taoyuan and Tamsui, New Taipei, between 2023 and 2024. Mr. Jin and Mr. Sheng were in charge of growing the plants and drying them to make drugs. Mr. Ma used secret words like "party" or "group buy" on messaging apps to sell the drugs to different people.</p>
            <p>Police started two investigations in late 2024. They found and seized 291 marijuana plants, finished and partly finished products, and marijuana seeds. The total weight was almost 2 kilograms, and it was valued at more than 20 million NT dollars. The police asked the court to hold Mr. Ma and Mr. Sheng without bail, and this was approved. Mr. Jin was sent to prison.</p>
            <p>During the court hearing, Mr. Jin's lawyer said that Mr. Jin grew the marijuana to help with his pain, not to sell or give to others. Mr. Ma's lawyer said that Mr. Ma used it to treat his anorexia and help his appetite, and asked for a lighter sentence.</p>
            <p>The Shilin court decided that even if Mr. Jin and Mr. Ma felt unwell, they should have sought proper medical treatment. They should not have ignored the government's rules against drug crimes, which helps drugs spread. The court considered that Mr. Jin always admitted his crime, while Mr. Ma only admitted to selling drugs during the trial. Based on these points, they gave different sentences.</p>
            <p>The Shilin court found Mr. Jin guilty of making Schedule 2 drugs, which goes against the Drug Hazard Control Act. He was sentenced to 10 years and 6 months in prison. After his sentence is finished or he gets a pardon, he will be sent out of Taiwan. Mr. Ma was found guilty of making Schedule 2 drugs and selling Schedule 2 drugs. He was sentenced to 14 years and 6 months in prison. This case can be appealed.</p>
