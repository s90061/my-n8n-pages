            <h1>Trump Suggests Tax Refunds from Tariffs; Republicans Say Pay Debt First</h1>
            <p>US President Trump suggested giving "tax refunds" to people using money from new tariffs. But Republican senators are not positive about this idea. Some senators think the tariff money should first be used to pay back the national debt.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that by mid-July, the US government had collected over 93 billion US dollars from tariffs. Most Republican senators want all this money to be used to reduce the national debt.</p>
            <p>The US national debt is now more than 36 trillion US dollars. Because a large tax cut and immigration bill, supported by Republicans, became law in early July, the national debt is expected to increase by an additional 3.4 trillion US dollars in the next 10 years.</p>
            <p>Last week, Trump told reporters, "Paying off debt is an important goal for us, but we are also thinking about tax refunds. We have so much money from tariffs, it would be great to give a small refund to people in a certain income group."</p>
            <p>However, the US Congress must pass a law for Trump's idea to become real.</p>
            <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri proposed a bill on July 28. It suggested using tariff money to give taxpayers 600 US dollars (about 18,000 NT dollars) as a tax refund. Each dependent child would also get 600 US dollars. With this idea, a family of four would receive 2,400 US dollars.</p>
            <p>However, most Republican senators said that the government's most important task should be to get rid of debt.</p>
            <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin said, "We already have 37 trillion US dollars in debt, and a deficit of nearly 2 trillion US dollars. I do not support this plan. This craziness must stop someday."</p>
            <p>Some senators said there is no need to use tariff money for tax refunds yet because people's trust in the economy has recently gone up.</p>
            <p>Republican Senator Roger Marshall from Kansas said, "I just don't know if these measures are necessary. People have not felt hurt by tariffs; in fact, it's the opposite. Prices have stayed stable." He thinks the best way to use tariff money is to "pay off debt."</p>

            <h1>Eurozone Inflation Rate Stays at 2% in July, Not Lowering as Expected</h1>
            <p>The European Union (EU) announced today that the inflation rate in the Eurozone stayed at 2% in July. This is the same as the data from June and did not slow down as the market expected.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), data released earlier by Eurostat (the EU's statistics office) showed that the Eurozone's inflation rate in June was 2%. Analysts from FactSet and Bloomberg News had expected the July inflation rate to drop slightly to 1.9%.</p>

            <h1>NCCU and 8 Universities Partner for New Business Doctorate Program</h1>
            <p>National Chengchi University (NCCU) is working with 8 other universities. Together, they are starting a "Taiwan Cross-University Joint Doctoral Program for Business and Management." The Ministry of Education has given 10 million New Taiwan Dollars for this program for three years. It will combine teachers and resources from different universities to make business and management education better.</p>
            <p>NCCU announced this in a press release today. Tsai Wei-Chi, NCCU's vice president and the head of the Taiwan Association of Business Schools, said that Taiwan's business and management doctoral education has often faced problems. These problems include not combining resources enough across universities, limited international connections, and scattered research efforts. This is happening because of global changes and new technology.</p>
            <p>Tsai Wei-Chi believes that training doctoral students is very important for how strong higher education is in academics. It also affects the country's overall plan for talent and academic development. So, he invited the deans of nine business schools, including NCCU, to form a committee. After many meetings, they decided on the structure of the courses and how to move forward with the program.</p>
            <p>Tsai Wei-Chi pointed out that the main courses will focus on finance, accounting, strategic management, and human resource management. New courses will cover topics like "AI and Business Strategy" and advanced research methods. International experts will teach these courses to help doctoral students connect with global trends and broaden their academic understanding. Currently, 13 core courses in different management areas and 4 courses on new international topics are planned. These will be open for doctoral students from all participating universities to take.</p>
            <p>This program is expected to last for three years. In the second half of this year, universities will first be encouraged to change their rules for cross-university course selection and credit recognition. Doctoral students will also be able to "audit" (attend without getting credit) cross-university courses. In the first semester of the 2025-2026 school year, four core management courses will be offered. Most classes will be in person, but for doctoral students outside the city, some weeks will also offer online participation. More information can be found on NCCU's website.</p>
