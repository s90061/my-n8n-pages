            <h1>Typhoon Yangliu Gets Stronger and Bigger, Land Warning Now Includes Kinmen</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Yangliu is coming to Taiwan. The weather office says Yangliu has gotten a bit stronger in the last three hours. Its stormy area has also grown a little. It is expected to hit Taiwan as a strong typhoon. The land warning now includes Kinmen. Its stormy area will reach the land in Hualien and Taitung by Wednesday morning.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau reported that Typhoon Yangliu was at 21.7 degrees North and 124.2 degrees East at 11 PM on Tuesday, August 12. This is about 340 kilometers southeast of Taitung. It is moving northwest at 27 kilometers per hour. Its strongest winds near the center are 38 meters per second (about 137 kilometers per hour). This is like a level 13 wind.</p>
            <p>The weather office said Yangliu's strength increased slightly in the last three hours, and its stormy area got a bit bigger. The center is now in the sea southeast of Taitung and is moving northwest. Its stormy area is slowly moving into the Bashi Channel and the southeastern sea near Taiwan. It is a danger to Taitung, Hualien, areas south of Miaoli, Penghu, and Kinmen. It is expected to get a bit stronger.</p>
            <p>Weather forecaster Chu Mei-lin said that after midnight on Tuesday, Lanyu, Green Island, Greater Taipei, and the northeast will start to have rain and wind at different times.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin stated that Yangliu is expected to get close to Lanyu and Green Island in the early morning to morning, and the wind and rain will get much stronger. It will get close to the southeast around Wednesday morning to noon. It will likely land near Taitung around noon. Its strength might stay the same or get stronger. In the evening, it will move out to sea from the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area. So, Wednesday will be the day with the most wind and rain. All of Taiwan has a chance of rain. Especially the eastern part and areas south of Chiayi might have heavy rain or very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin pointed out that on Wednesday evening, the center of Yangliu will be west of Penghu. Then it will move towards China. Its strength will slowly decrease. The wind and rain on Taiwan island will calm down in the evening. Only Penghu and Kinmen will still have strong winds and rain.</p>
            <p>Also, the weather office warns that temperatures in areas south of Chiayi and the eastern part will be about 27 to 30 degrees Celsius. Areas north of Yunlin will be hot and humid because of the leeward side effect, with temperatures above 32 or 33 degrees. Miaoli to Changhua and Kinmen might have local high temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>

            <h1>Trump Asks Powell to Lower Interest Rates Again, Criticizes Fed Building Project, and Threatens to Sue</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 12 (Reuters) â€“ Today, former US President Donald Trump again asked Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), to lower interest rates. He also said he might sue Powell because of a project to fix up the Fed building.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Labor released data today. It showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July increased by 2.7% compared to last year. This was lower than Dow Jones' guess of 2.8%. The CPI increased by 0.2% compared to the month before, which was expected. The core CPI for July increased by 3.1% compared to last year and by 0.3% compared to the month before. The expected increases were 3% and 0.3%.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," today. He said that Powell, who is "always too late," must lower interest rates now. He added that the harm caused by Powell being too late is huge.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said, "Luckily, the US economy is doing very well. We have won against Powell and the Fed, who are too slow to act."</p>
            <p>Trump also stated that he is thinking about allowing a big lawsuit against Powell. This is because Powell did a very bad job and was very unable in managing the Fed building's construction. A project that should have cost 50 million US dollars for repairs is now going to cost 3 billion US dollars.</p>

            <h1>China Is Not Happy About Lin Chia-lung Visiting Japan, So China-Japan Agriculture Meeting Is Delayed</h1>
            <p>Tokyo, August 12 (CNA) â€“ The agriculture ministers from Japan and China had planned to meet this month. But China suddenly asked to delay the meeting. Japanese news reported that this might be because China was upset about Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung visiting Japan at the end of July. China stopped the meeting to show its disapproval to Japan.</p>
            <p>The Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun reported based on information from Japanese and Chinese diplomats. It said that Han Jun, China's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, was supposed to attend a meeting of agriculture ministers from Japan, China, and South Korea in Incheon, South Korea, on August 11. After that, he planned to visit Japan. He also planned to meet with Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Shinjiro Koizumi, in Tokyo on August 12.</p>
            <p>The governments of Japan and China had planned for them to sign an agreement during the meeting. This agreement was about working together to stop new plant types developed in Japan from going to other countries. But China suddenly asked to cancel the meeting.</p>
            <p>The report said that people generally believe this happened because of Lin Chia-lung's visit to Japan at the end of July. Lin Chia-lung met with people like Sanae Takaichi, a former Minister for Economic Security and a member of parliament, in Japan.</p>
            <p>This news was made public by Keiji Furuya, a member of parliament and head of the "Japan-Taiwan Inter-Parliamentary Council," a group that supports friendship between Taiwan and Japan. He posted it on Facebook on July 25. Taiwan and Japan do not have formal diplomatic relations, so it is not common for Taiwan's foreign minister to visit Japan.</p>
            <p>Because of this, China protested to Japan. It said Japan was "giving a stage for anti-China actions and sending a wrong message."</p>
            <p>The report said this shows that China is worried about Taiwan and Japan getting closer politically.</p>
            <p>Someone who knows a lot about foreign relations said, "Han Jun wanted to visit Japan, but he suddenly canceled. This must have been ordered by China's leader, Xi Jinping."</p>
            <p>A high-ranking Japanese official said, "Canceling the meeting between the Japanese and Chinese agriculture ministers will not stop Japan." Shinjiro Koizumi had already met with officials from Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture, who visited South Korea from August 9 to 11.</p>
