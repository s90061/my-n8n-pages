            <h1>Trouble Near Yemen: Dutch Ship Attacked, Catches Fire</h1>
            <p>A British company called Ambrey, which works for safety at sea, said today that a cargo ship flying the Dutch flag was attacked. This happened 120 nautical miles southeast of Aden, a port city in Yemen.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency also reported that the UK Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) received a report from military officials. They said a ship 128 nautical miles from Aden was hit by something unknown. It also seemed that the ship caught fire.</p>
            <p>Both the British office and the company mentioned that they got reports of smoke near the ship.</p>
            <p>The UKMTO also stated that the ship's captain saw splashes of water far away.</p>
            <p>Ambrey added that the ship did not send out its special signal (AIS) when it was attacked.</p>
            <p>According to Ambrey, this ship had already been attacked on the 23rd while it was traveling to Djibouti.</p>

            <h1>Russia Calls Up 135,000 Soldiers This Autumn, Most Since 2016</h1>
            <p>Today, Russian President Putin announced the autumn conscription. He is calling 135,000 men to join the army. This is the largest number for an autumn conscription in Russia since 2016.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Russia calls men aged 18 to 30 to join the army every spring and autumn. By law, these soldiers serve for one year at military bases inside Russia. Usually, more people join in spring because most young people finish school then.</p>
            <p>This conscription order is not the same as a wartime call-up. However, those who finish their military service might be called to fight in the future. In the past, there have been reports of conscripted soldiers being sent to the front lines in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>According to Putin's order, 135,000 Russian citizens must join the army between October 1st and December 31st. With the 160,000 people already called up in spring, the total number of new soldiers this year in Russia will be the highest since 2016.</p>
            <p>Since February 2022, after Putin started a full attack on neighboring Ukraine, Russia has been in a state of war. Since then, the number of people joining the army has grown by about 5% each year. Last September, Putin also ordered the Russian army to grow to 1.5 million active soldiers. This makes it one of the largest armies in the world.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang on Livestream: Whistleblower Group Only Acts When Bad Deeds Are Proven</h1>
            <p>The Mirror Media news site recently reported that Taiwan People's Party chairman Huang Kuo-chang has a group that secretly follows people. Huang Kuo-chang said in a livestream tonight that he started the Whistleblower Protection Association. Its goal is to protect whistleblowers and to expose bad things happening. He said they only act when something is clearly illegal or wrong. He also asked why a private group is needed to expose problems: "Under the Democratic Progressive Party's rule, will the police and investigators truly look into these bad cases?"</p>
            <p>During the livestream, Huang Kuo-chang said, "The biggest paparazzi group in the country is your Mirror Media." As of 11 PM, Mirror Media Group has not responded.</p>
            <p>In June last year, DPP lawmaker Wang Yi-chuan thought someone was following him and reported it to the police. In August, the prosecutor decided not to charge anyone. But on the 26th, Mirror Media reported that Huang Kuo-chang has been building a group of followers in recent years to secretly film Green Camp politicians. It also said Huang Kuo-chang personally directed these paparazzi.</p>
            <p>After the Taiwan People's Party responded in writing on the 26th, Huang Kuo-chang had no public events. Huang Kuo-chang said in his YouTube livestream tonight that some news reports said, "How many days has he been hiding? Come out and face us." He didn't know what to say after reading them. He said he has been very busy for the past three days, but he just didn't have any public events. Yet, people said he had been hiding for many days.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that last Saturday, he went to support an important event, a bike race around Greater Taipei. He wanted to sign up but found that registration was already closed. So, he supported it in another way. He set up a supply station at the finish line, giving drinks and protein to the riders. He also grilled sausages there and helped with the grilling himself.</p>
            <p>Talking about the Whistleblower Protection Association, Huang Kuo-chang said he started the association to do two main things: first, protect whistleblowers, and second, expose corruption. He asked why private groups are needed to expose bad things in the country. He said the reason is simple: "Under the Democratic Progressive Party's government, do you think the investigators will seriously look into these cases of corruption?" He gave the example of the "China Airlines smuggled cigarettes case" that he exposed in 2019.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said he created the Whistleblower Association because many whistleblowers were being attacked. He even helped whistleblowers with their lawsuits and gave legal advice for free, never taking money. He said finding corruption is not something you can just do by searching on Google at home. He always checks carefully, "We only act when we are sure that something is illegal or wrong."</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that if it's about personal romantic issues, like a legislator having a mistress or escorts visiting late at night, the association generally doesn't deal with it. This is because it's not related to public interest.</p>
            <p>Regarding being followed and filmed, Huang Kuo-chang said, "Mirror Media Group is a mix of party, investigators, and media." He said they accused him of having paparazzi. But after seeing the news headlines and content, his first thought was, if we're talking about paparazzi, "the biggest paparazzi group in the whole country is your Mirror Media." He asked if they didn't feel ashamed writing these things.</p>
