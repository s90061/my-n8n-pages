            <h1>Typhoon Bualoi Hits Vietnam: 13 Dead, 46 Injured, Over 40,000 Homes Damaged</h1>
            <p>The Vietnamese government says that Typhoon Bualoi has caused more deaths and injuries in Vietnam. Now, 13 people have died, and 46 people are hurt. The typhoon brought strong winds and heavy rain. More than 40,000 homes were damaged, and there were also power cuts and flooded roads.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Vietnam's national weather office said Typhoon Bualoi reached Vietnam earlier today. It moved along the central and northern coast, causing very big waves, up to 8 meters high. After that, Bualoi became weaker and is now a tropical storm, moving towards Laos.</p>
            <p>Before the typhoon arrived, the Vietnamese government moved more than 28,500 people to safer places. Also, several airports in the central part of the country were closed, which caused hundreds of flights to be late or cancelled.</p>
            <p>The Vietnamese government also reported that Bualoi has damaged 44,000 homes and flooded 6,000 hectares of farmland. It also made it impossible to travel in many areas.</p>
            <p>Some factories, like those belonging to Hon Hai, Formosa Plastics, Luxshare, and the Vietnamese car company Vinfast, were on or near the typhoon's path. However, the Vietnamese government said that these factories did not suffer much damage.</p>

            <h1>Trump Announces "High Tariffs" on Imported Furniture in New Social Media Posts</h1>
            <p>Today, former US President Donald Trump made several posts online. First, he threatened to put a 100% tax on "all movies made outside the US." After that, he announced that there would be "high tariffs" on furniture brought into the country. He did not share many details about this.</p>
            <p>The newspaper "The Hill" reported that Trump wrote on his own social media site, Truth Social: "To make North Carolina great again, where the furniture business has completely lost to China and other countries, I will put high tariffs on any country that does not make furniture in the USA."</p>
            <p>He also said that more details would come later.</p>
            <p>Trump had previously said that starting October 1st, the US government would put a 50% tax on all kitchen cabinets, bathroom sinks, and similar items. At the same time, there would be a 30% tax on upholstered furniture (furniture with soft padding).</p>
            <p>Just before Trump announced the new tariffs on imported furniture, he also posted about a 100% tax on movies not made in the US. He also said that California would be "hit especially hard." However, his post did not say when or how these taxes would be put into action.</p>
