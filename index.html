            <h1>New US Defense Plan Coming Out: Will it Include Taiwan and South Korea in Asia's Defense?</h1>
            <p>News from Washington, October 5th â€“ Nikkei Asia reports that the Trump government is about to release a new "National Defense Strategy." This plan might put "defending America" first. People are very interested to see if this defense plan for Asia will include Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia says that America's allies are closely watching for the Trump government's "National Defense Strategy Report." This report comes out every four years. It helps the US decide its main defense plans for inside and outside the country. It is expected to come out in October and might have big changes.</p>
            <p>The 2018 "National Defense Strategy Report," released during Trump's first time as president, said that China and Russia were the main problems for world order. It also promised that the US would be stronger in this competition. Now, this idea seems to be slowly changing.</p>
            <p>By the end of August, the US Department of Defense finished a draft of the new plan. It is now being shared within the government. Politico, a news website, says that this draft puts defending America first. It does not focus on fighting big enemies like China and Russia as much as the 2018 plan did. This is a big change in what is important.</p>
            <p>If this news is true, this change by the Trump government will have many effects. If the US military focuses more on its home country, its promises to protect allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific will be harder to keep.</p>
            <p>Many people in Europe feel sad that US military support might become less. But some allies in Asia, because China is getting stronger, hope that the US will keep its military in the area and even make it stronger.</p>
            <p>However, this hope might not be realistic. Even if the Trump government cares about Asia, military help might not drop as much as in Europe. But if the White House insists on putting America first, Asia will also be affected.</p>
            <p>The current talks inside the Trump government show a worrying fact: officials have not yet decided where the US military's defense line in Asia should be. This line shows where the US believes its national interests are important enough to defend at a high cost.</p>
            <p>In theory, the US could draw four kinds of defense lines in Asia. The best for peace in the area is the current way, which includes Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. This has been America's plan for many decades.</p>
            <p>The worst situation would be if America's defense line in Asia only included Japan, leaving out South Korea and Taiwan. This could make North Korea and China bolder, leading to more conflict.</p>
            <p>In 1950, Dean Acheson, who was the US Secretary of State, suggested a defense line in the Pacific that only included Japan, but not South Korea and Taiwan. It was called the "Acheson Line." Many people believe that this made North Korea think the US would not get involved, which then led to the Korean War that same year.</p>
            <p>The other two choices are to leave out either South Korea or Taiwan. Even if Japan still has US military bases and is protected, if South Korea or Taiwan is left out, it would greatly affect Japan's defense.</p>
            <p>Many US security experts say that current US military officers and officials from the Department of Defense and Department of State mostly support keeping the first plan. However, some people in the Trump government who are careful about getting involved, like Vice President JD Vance, still have doubts about how much responsibility the US should take for defending South Korea and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>People who know about the private talks say that a plan was quietly passed around in the Trump government. It suggested accepting South Korea's ability to use nuclear weapons to deter enemies, and at the same time, making the US less directly responsible for South Korea's defense. This strong idea was rejected, but it might be brought up again later.</p>
            <p>For Taiwan, there are also different ideas in Washington. Strong military and Congress members want to stand against China. They believe the US must clearly promise to protect Taiwan's safety. But some high-ranking officials like Vance take a less active stance on helping Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The final decision on where to draw the defense line in Asia is still with Trump. Because of what he has said and done before, people are not confident in his judgment. Although Trump has often criticized China on trade issues, he has always shown little interest in using more US military power in Asia to balance China's growing military. He does not want to compete with China for power and does not see international issues as a fight for control.</p>
            <p>Since August this year, Trump has been strongly saying that homeland defense is most important. In the same month, Trump ordered thousands of US soldiers to the Caribbean. The official reason was to fight drug smuggling. On September 2nd, the US military attacked a Venezuelan boat suspected of carrying drugs. They killed 11 suspected drug cartel members in international waters.</p>
            <p>In contrast, Trump has been less keen on using the US military to defend allies. He recently told Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, three NATO countries next to Russia, that the US would cut funding for their military building from the 2026 financial year. This clearly shows his "America First" approach.</p>
            <p>Michael Shoebridge, director of Strategic Analysis Australia, said: "Since Trump became president, the US has put homeland security first. It has increased border budgets and even deployed National Guard and Marines at home. The new defense strategy is expected to make these actions official."</p>
            <p>Shoebridge also said: "US allies must improve their own defense and rely less on US support. Investing more in their own defense industries and working more closely with trusted partners like Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines is the only way forward."</p>
