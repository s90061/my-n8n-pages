            <h1>Sun Chia-hung Becomes Taiwan's Flag Bearer at the World Games, Says It's "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Chengdu World Games started with a big opening ceremony today. Sun Chia-hung, a martial arts athlete, was the first martial arts player to carry the flag for Taiwan. He felt very excited and said it was like a dream.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team won 1 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze medals at the last World Games in Birmingham. This year, 120 athletes from Taiwan will compete in 14 different sports in Chengdu. The women's tug-of-war team hopes to win their sixth gold medal in a row in the 500 kg category.</p>
            <p>At the opening ceremony in Chengdu today, Sun Chia-hung and Huang Mei-chien carried the flag for Taiwan. They were the 104th team to enter, between Syria and the Czech Republic. A total of 64 athletes from Taiwan took part in the ceremony. They are competing in sports like canoe polo, Korfball, orienteering, water sports, roller sports, water skiing, martial arts, and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-hung won a gold medal in Tai Chi boxing and a silver medal in Tai Chi sword at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now he is back in Chengdu and is the first martial arts athlete to be a flag bearer. He told reporters how excited he was, saying this moment felt like something from a dream he had since he was little. He believes it is the result of hard work. He said that many older athletes before him also did very well, and together they have made Taiwan's martial arts known and respected in international competitions.</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-chien was a swimmer for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In recent years, she has mostly focused on coaching, but she still competes in fin swimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fin race at the World Fin Swimming Championships. Huang Mei-chien said she has been an athlete's representative and a torch bearer before, but this is her first time carrying the flag. She said, "I am looking forward to it and also a little nervous. I hope to do this job well."</p>

            <h1>If Your Car Gets Flooded, You Need Extra Insurance, Says Financial Supervisory Commission</h1>
            <p>Recently, heavy rain caused by a southwest air current damaged many parts of central and southern Taiwan. Many cars were flooded. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that regular car insurance policies (types A, B, and C) do not cover damage from typhoons and floods. If people want this protection, they need to buy an extra insurance policy called "Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood, or Water Damage Additional Coverage." Only with this extra part will they be covered.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan, who is a deputy head at the FSC's Insurance Bureau, explained at a regular press conference today that insurance has two main parts: for individuals and for companies. The affected areas in central and southern Taiwan are large, and not only people and businesses might be hurt, but also homes and cars. For individual insurance, current home fire insurance already includes "Home Typhoon and Flood Disaster Compensation Insurance." If a home floods with water more than 50 centimeters deep because of a typhoon or flood, this insurance gives basic payment of NT$7,000 to NT$9,000 in three different areas.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan also said that if people think this basic coverage is not enough, they can ask their insurance company to add "Excess Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Coverage." This extra part will pay more than the basic amount. It also offers NT$3,000 per day for temporary housing, for up to 60 days.</p>
            <p>Also, there have been many mudslide disasters recently. Chen Ching-yuan said that if your house is in a low area or on a hillside, you can choose to add "Land Subsidence, Sliding, or Landslide Insurance Additional Coverage." This covers losses caused by land sliding or sinking, landslides, loose ground, and sand or soil washing away (including mudslides) because of typhoons or floods.</p>
            <p>He explained that many cars were also damaged by floods. However, regular car insurance policies (types A, B, and C) do not cover losses from typhoons and floods. If your home is in a low-lying area and you think a typhoon or flood might damage your car, you can add "Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood, or Water Damage Additional Coverage." This will protect your car from damage caused by typhoons, floods, and similar events.</p>
            <p>For company insurance, Chen Ching-yuan said that companies often buy "Commercial Fire and All Risks Insurance." This type of insurance covers buildings, machines, and movable property for sudden, unexpected accidents. So, it includes losses from typhoons and floods.</p>
            <p>However, Chen Ching-yuan also mentioned that commercial fire insurance must list what it covers. So, it does not cover losses to insured property caused by typhoons or floods unless specified. Companies can buy "Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Coverage" separately to cover these natural disaster risks. He advises companies to talk to their insurance company when buying insurance to make sure the coverage meets their needs.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Says Xidong Line Project Damaged Wires; New Taipei MRT Bureau: Will Investigate</h1>
            <p>Songshan Airport had a power cut tonight. Taipower said that the main reason was that the New Taipei City MRT Bureau's Xidong Line project accidentally damaged a power line. However, the New Taipei City MRT Bureau replied that they are not sure if their work caused the power cut. They will let Taipower check the site tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>The power cut at Songshan Airport lasted only 3 to 4 seconds, and no flights were affected. Also, many places in Songshan District lost power for a short time, including the escalators at Nanjing Fuxing MRT Station stopping.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that after checking, the New Taipei City MRT Bureau's Xizhi-Donghu Line project accidentally damaged a power line. This caused a quick drop in voltage, making the power at Songshan Airport, Taipei MRT, and Far EasTone Telecommunications headquarters flicker for a short time. Taipower said that the power supply is normal now.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Government Department of Rapid Transit Systems explained in a message that the MRT Xidong Line project was drilling on Tongxing Road in Xizhi District. Based on Taipower's high-voltage power line maps, there should not be a 161KV high-voltage power line underground in that area. Also, the construction company dug 2.5 meters down and drilled 40 meters, but found no pipes or lines. Therefore, they are not yet sure if their project is connected to the power cut.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City MRT Bureau said that since Taipower directly said the Xidong Line project caused it, they will start managing traffic and let Taipower enter the site for checks tomorrow morning. This is to find out the real cause of the incident.</p>
