            <h1>French Prime Minister Bayrou to Resign After Losing Confidence Vote in Parliament</h1>
            <p>Today, the French Parliament held a vote to decide if they still trusted Prime Minister Bayrou's government. Bayrou had only been in his job for nine months, but he did not get enough votes. Because of this, President Macron will now look for a new Prime Minister, and France is facing a new political problem.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the results of the vote in the French National Assembly showed that 364 members of parliament did not trust the government. Only 194 members said they did trust it.</p>
            <p>Yael Braun-Pivet, the Speaker of the National Assembly, said that according to Article 50 of the French Constitution, the Prime Minister must tell the President that the entire government will step down.</p>
            <p>Someone close to Bayrou, who did not want to be named, told Agence France-Presse that Bayrou will tell President Macron tomorrow morning that he is resigning.</p>
            <p>The office of the French President has already said that Macron will choose a new Prime Minister in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Bayrou is the sixth Prime Minister under President Macron since 2017. He is also the first Prime Minister in modern French history to be removed by a confidence vote, not a no-confidence vote.</p>
            <p>Bayrou's government did not have a lot of support and tried to get enough votes for a plan to save money. On August 25, he announced that he would ask for a confidence vote in Parliament. This news surprised many people in French politics.</p>

            <h1>Trump Loses Appeal in Defamation Case, Must Pay About NT$2.6 Billion to Writer</h1>
            <p>Last year, a jury in Manhattan, New York, decided that former President Trump had unfairly spoken badly about writer E. Jean Carroll. They said he had to pay her 83.3 million US dollars, which is about 2.56 billion New Taiwan dollars. Trump appealed this decision, but today, a higher court said the original decision was correct.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the jury found Trump acted with bad intentions when he spoke about Carroll many times in public. In January of last year, they ordered Trump to pay 65 million US dollars as punishment, 7.3 million US dollars to make up for her losses, and 11 million US dollars for online activities to fix Carroll's reputation.</p>
            <p>When this civil court decision was read in the federal court, people in the room were surprised. This was because the amount of money Trump had to pay was much more than the 10 million US dollars Carroll had asked for.</p>
            <p>At that time, Trump used his own social media platform, "Truth Social," to post many insulting messages. He attacked Carroll, the court process, and the judge.</p>
            <p>Today, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated, "We believe that the federal district court made no mistakes in any of the decisions that were questioned. Also, because of the special and very bad facts of this case, the amount of money the jury ordered for damages is fair."</p>
            <p>Carroll, who is 81 years old, said that Trump spoke badly about her in 2019. At that time, she first said publicly that Trump had sexually assaulted her. But Trump said, "She's not my type," and claimed she made up the story to sell more copies of her memoir.</p>
            <p>In another civil case in 2023, a different New York jury decided that Trump was legally responsible for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store dressing room in 1996. They also said he was responsible for speaking badly about her in 2022, when Trump called her story "a complete scam." In that case, the jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll 5 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Today, the appeals court wrote in its decision, "We agree with the federal district court. The jury had good reasons to believe that Trump would not stop speaking badly about Carroll unless he faced a very large payment."</p>
            <p>Trump was not required to appear in court or give a statement. However, he used this case before to get media attention. He said he was being treated unfairly, and he used this to help his campaign to become president again.</p>
