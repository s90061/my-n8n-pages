            <h1>Vice President: Taiwan-US Talks Continue, Hope for Trade Balance and Industry Benefits</h1>
            <p>Taiwan and the United States started a new round of talks this week. Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim said that the negotiating team is still in Washington. The team is working hard and feels very responsible. They are trying to achieve trade balance and benefits for Taiwan's industries. They also want to find chances for Taiwan and the US to work more closely in technology and other industries.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsiao spoke at a meeting of the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce today. She said that Taiwanese businesses have always stood strong when facing problems. This includes past events like the oil crisis, joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), and big changes in world politics.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsiao stated that the world is still not peaceful now. Taiwan is facing trade wars and technology wars from outside. Taiwan is in the middle of the strongest competition in world politics and industry. But Taiwan has a strong industry foundation that has been built over many years. This helps Taiwan be very important in the world during this time of strong competition.</p>
            <p>As the world changes quickly, Ms. Hsiao hopes Taiwan can play a stable role. In the past, Taiwan often just reacted to things. Now, Taiwan actively plans its resources and policies. It also looks for ways to work with other countries. In recent years, with changes in global industry, spreading risks, and worldwide trends, Taiwan has also made new partnerships in different areas.</p>
            <p>Talking about trade talks with the US, Ms. Hsiao said the negotiation team is still in Washington. The negotiators are very determined and have a strong sense of duty. They are working almost 24 hours a day to get fair trade and benefits for Taiwan's industries. They also want to get chances for Taiwan and the US to work more closely in technology, economy, and other areas in the future.</p>
            <p>Besides the US, Ms. Hsiao said Taiwan has been promoting its New Southbound Policy in recent years. It has also signed trade and economic agreements with countries like the UK and Canada. As the world situation changes, more international friends visiting Taiwan want to make their partnerships with Taiwan stronger. Even with global problems, Taiwan is finding new chances.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsiao said that the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce has always helped the government and businesses talk to each other. It is also an important place to connect Taiwan's industry strengths. She hopes that bigger companies can help smaller ones in the future. She wants Taiwan's whole industry to grow evenly. This means not just high-tech companies, but also many small and medium-sized businesses and all types of work. She hopes everyone can find new opportunities during these changing times.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsiao also said that the government is working with different departments. They are using new chances from AI trends. They are promoting plans for AI intelligence, digitalization, and becoming carbon neutral. This is to make sure that small and medium-sized businesses are not left behind in world changes. Instead, they can grow with new technology industries. Together, they can make Taiwan's economy stronger.</p>

            <h1>Two Kaohsiung Youth Orchestras Invited to Japan, Will Perform in Tokyo Concert Hall</h1>
            <p>Two music groups from Kaohsiung, the KSO Youth Orchestra and the KCO Youth Chinese Orchestra, are invited to perform in Japan. They will play on July 29th at a new concert hall in Setagaya Ward, Tokyo. This visit shows the results of their music exchange.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Bureau of Cultural Affairs announced today that the KSO Youth Orchestra visited Setagaya Youth Orchestra in 2018 and 2019. This year, the KSO Youth Orchestra will go to Japan again with top members from the KCO Youth Chinese Orchestra. Young musicians from Taiwan and Japan will come together to start a new chapter in cultural exchange. The Setagaya Youth Orchestra also plans to visit Kaohsiung in the summer of 2026. Music will connect them and continue this international "music friendship."</p>
            <p>Ms. Wang Wen-tsui, the Director of the Cultural Affairs Bureau, said that in 2016, a Setagaya council member came to Taiwan to find a friendly city for cultural exchange. The two sides first signed an agreement to work together. In 2019, after the two cities signed another agreement, the Setagaya Youth Orchestra and the KSO Youth Orchestra worked together. Their exchange started with music and became very close. It has slowly grown to include culture, art, tourism, and sports.</p>
            <p>The KSO Youth Orchestra has almost 100 members. It is the biggest youth orchestra in southern Taiwan. Its members come from Kaohsiung and other cities in the south. They practice every week and perform twice a year at the Weiwuying Concert Hall and the Dadong Arts Center. This invitation to perform in Setagaya will help the members see more of the world and gain stage experience. It also helps with cultural exchange between the cities.</p>
            <p>For this performance, the KSO Youth Orchestra will be led by the famous young conductor Bao Heng-yi. They will play "Angel from Formosa" by Tyzen Hsiao and "The Moldau" by BedÅ™ich Smetana. The KCO Youth Chinese Orchestra will perform "Under the Bald Cypress Tree" by Yang Chieh-ju and "Spring Morning at Yangmingshan" by Dong Rong-sen. Also, Chen Yi-jou and Ruan Hsin-yu will play Li Bo-chan's "Chu Song" for two bowed string instruments.</p>
            <p>For the last part of the performance, the KSO Youth Orchestra and the Setagaya Youth Orchestra will have 100 musicians play together. They will perform "Cinema Paradiso," a famous movie song by the Italian composer Ennio Morricone.</p>
