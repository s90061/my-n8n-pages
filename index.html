Google recently added a new feature to its search engine called "AI Overviews." This feature uses artificial intelligence (AI) to summarize information and answer questions directly. However, some users have reported that the AI has given incorrect or strange answers.

For example, the AI has suggested putting glue on pizza or said that past US presidents were vampires. These wrong answers have surprised many people. Google has stated that these errors are rare and that most AI answers are correct. The company is working hard to fix these problems and improve the AI model. Google plans to continue using AI to make search better, but these early issues show the challenges of using new technology.

**Venice Starts New Fee for Day Visitors**

The famous Italian city of Venice has begun asking day visitors to pay a fee to enter. This new rule started recently and applies to people who visit Venice for just one day, not staying overnight. They must pay 5 euros on certain busy days.

The city decided to do this to help manage the large number of tourists. Too many visitors can make it hard for local people to live their daily lives and can damage the city's old buildings and delicate structure. The aim is to reduce crowds and protect Venice's unique culture and history. People who live in Venice or are staying in a hotel there do not have to pay the fee.

**Four-Day Work Week Trials Show Positive Results**

More and more companies around the world are trying a four-day work week, where employees work fewer days but often the same number of hours. Recent trials of this new work pattern are showing good results for both businesses and their staff.

Companies that have tried it say that employees are more productive, meaning they do more work in less time. Staff also report feeling less stressed and happier in their jobs. This new system also helps companies attract new workers and keep the ones they have. Employees enjoy a better balance between their work and personal life. These trials suggest that the four-day work week could become a common way of working in the future.`;
