Zoom, the video conferencing company, is laying off around 150 employees, representing less than 2% of its workforce. This announcement comes after the company already reduced its staff by 1,300 people last year. Zoom states that these cuts are necessary to streamline operations and adapt to changing market conditions. The company experienced a surge in demand during the pandemic, but growth has slowed as people return to in-person work. Zoom intends to focus on artificial intelligence and other strategic areas for future expansion. The layoffs will primarily affect employees in engineering roles.

Zoom's CEO, Eric Yuan, expressed his regret over the decision, acknowledging the impact on affected employees. He emphasized the company's commitment to providing support and resources to help them find new opportunities. While Zoom's stock price initially dipped slightly after the announcement, it quickly recovered, suggesting investor confidence in the company's long-term strategy. This latest round of layoffs highlights the ongoing adjustments within the tech industry as companies navigate post-pandemic realities and seek to maintain profitability.

**Tech Layoffs Continue as Zoom Announces 150 Job Cuts**

Zoom, the well-known video conferencing company, is making approximately 150 people redundant, which is less than 2% of its employees. This news follows a larger cut last year when the company let go of 1,300 staff. Zoom says it needs to make these changes to improve efficiency and respond to shifts in the market. The company became hugely popular during the pandemic, but its growth has slowed now that more people are returning to working from offices. Zoom plans to concentrate on artificial intelligence and other important areas to develop in the future. The job losses will mainly affect those working in technical roles.

Eric Yuan, Zoom's CEO, said he was sorry to make this decision and understood the effect it would have on the people involved. He stressed that the company would help them by providing assistance and resources to find new jobs. Although Zoom's share price fell slightly after the announcement, it soon bounced back, suggesting that investors believe in the company's plans for the future. These recent layoffs show that tech companies are still making changes as they deal with the world after the pandemic and try to stay profitable.

**Article 2: New Study Shows Link Between Green Spaces and Improved Mental Health**

A recent study published in the journal "Environmental Science & Technology" has found a strong connection between access to green spaces and improved mental well-being. Researchers analyzed data from over 10,000 participants across various urban areas. The study revealed that individuals who lived in neighborhoods with more parks, trees, and gardens reported lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The findings suggest that regular exposure to nature can have a positive impact on mental health, contributing to overall well-being.

The researchers believe that green spaces provide opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, and relaxation, all of which can help reduce stress and improve mood. They also highlight the potential benefits of green spaces for cognitive function, such as improved attention span and memory. The study emphasizes the importance of urban planning that prioritizes the creation and preservation of green spaces to promote public health and well-being. The researchers call for greater investment in parks and green infrastructure to ensure equitable access to nature for all urban residents.

**New Study Shows Link Between Green Spaces and Improved Mental Health**

A new piece of research published in the journal "Environmental Science & Technology" has discovered a strong connection between having access to green spaces and having better mental well-being. Researchers looked at information from over 10,000 people living in different towns and cities. The study showed that people who lived in areas with more parks, trees, and gardens said they felt less stressed, anxious, and depressed. The results suggest that spending time in nature regularly can be good for your mental health, helping you to feel generally better.

The researchers think that green spaces give people opportunities to exercise, meet others, and relax, all of which can help to reduce stress and improve your mood. They also point out that green spaces might improve brain function, such as helping you to concentrate and remember things better. The study highlights how important it is for town planners to make sure that there are enough green spaces and that they are protected, in order to improve peopleâ€™s health and well-being. The researchers are asking for more money to be spent on parks and green areas to make sure that everyone in towns and cities can easily access nature.
