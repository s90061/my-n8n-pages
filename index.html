            <h1>13 Areas in Taiwan Get High Temperature Warning; Expert Says to Watch for New Storm</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's weather agency today announced a high temperature warning for 13 cities and counties. The capital area, Taipei, might have very hot weather above 38 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Mr. Wu Der-rong said that Typhoon Swordfish will become a strong typhoon today and land in Vietnam tomorrow. Also, a new weather system (tropical disturbance) is forming east of the Philippines, and we need to watch it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Der-rong, who is also a professor at National Central University, wrote in his weather column today. He said that the latest map from the Central Weather Agency shows that Typhoon Swordfish, the 13th typhoon this year, will get stronger today. Its center will pass close to the south of Hainan Island and land in Vietnam by tomorrow afternoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also pointed out that another tropical disturbance is forming in the sea east of the Philippines. The latest computer models from Europe show that this system might become a typhoon in the South China Sea starting on August 27th. It will move west, similar to Typhoon Swordfish. However, it is still uncertain, so we need to keep watching it closely.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu said that the latest European models show sunny and very hot weather everywhere today. Temperatures might go above 38 degrees Celsius, so people should protect themselves from the sun and avoid getting heatstroke. In the mountains, there might be short rain showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon. Taitung and Pingtung also have a small chance of short rain.</p>
            <p>The weather agency today issued high temperature warnings. The weather in many places is hot. Taipei City and New Taipei City are under an "orange light" warning, meaning there's a chance of extreme temperatures above 38 degrees Celsius. Hsinchu County, Taichung City, Changhua County, Nantou County, Yunlin County, Chiayi City, Chiayi County, Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Pingtung County are also under an "orange light" warning, meaning they might have continuous temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Taoyuan City is under a "yellow light" warning, meaning temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius are expected.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu said that from tomorrow until August 28th, the weather will be sunny with some clouds in most places. It will be hot, so people should still protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. More moisture from the south will cause short rain in Hualien, Taitung, and Pingtung sometimes. The air will be unstable, so there might be local rain showers or thunderstorms in the mountains in the afternoon. Sometimes, heavy thunderstorms might also happen in the southern flat areas.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also said that on August 29th and 30th, the moisture from the south will move north. Most places will be cloudy with some sunshine, and it will still be hot. Hualien, Taitung, and Pingtung will have more short rain. In the afternoon, there's a chance of local rain showers or thunderstorms in all areas, including heavy thunderstorms.</p>

            <h1>People Run in Washington D.C. for Ukraine, Wearing Traditional Shirts to Show Strength</h1>
            <p>Just before Ukraine's Independence Day, a charity run called "Vyshyvanka Run" was held in Washington D.C. People ran to show they hope for peace and freedom. They also wore "Vyshyvanka," which are traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts. This showed their Ukrainian culture and their strong spirit, even though their lives have changed a lot.</p>
            <p>The non-profit group "United Help Ukraine" (UHU) organized the "Vyshyvanka Run." More than 100 people came to support. These included Ukrainians living in Washington D.C. who care about the war at home, and Ukrainian-Americans who brought their children. The event was full of blue and yellow colors. The run started with the cheer "Glory to Ukraine!" (Slava Ukraini).</p>
            <p>The organizers said that by running before Ukraine's Flag Day (August 23rd) and Independence Day (August 24th), they want to keep showing the world the value of democracy and freedom. Ukraine declared its independence in 1991, and Independence Day is one of the most important holidays there.</p>
            <p>The special part of the run was the "Vyshyvanka." These are traditional Ukrainian embroidered shirts and are a symbol of the country. Each embroidery pattern has a special meaning, and the patterns are different in different regions. The history of these shirts goes back to the 9th century BC. The event felt like a small cultural festival, bringing people together with clothes and music.</p>
            <p>Maryna Baydyuk, the CEO of UHU, spoke to the Central News Agency. She said, "When Ukrainian people fight for their independence, we stand with them. Tomorrow is Ukraine's Independence Day, and they are still fighting for freedom and justice against Russia's attack."</p>
            <p>She also said that many Americans joined the event. "They also believe in these important values: Freedom is not free. Today, we want to celebrate Ukraine's culture, history, and strength."</p>
            <p>Anna, from Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, has lived in the U.S. for 2 years. She said, "Today is my homeland's birthday. I really admire the people who are still strong and staying there. I want to thank the U.S. for its support, and I hope Ukraine wins soon."</p>
            <p>Brandon, a Washington D.C. resident with Ukrainian family roots, brought his two children to the event. He said, "Supporting this event is very important to me. I also hope my children can learn more about their background."</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for three and a half years. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently met with U.S. President Trump for the second time at the White House. People are now watching to see how peace talks will begin. Brandon said about this, "I must stay hopeful. I can only do that and pray that things will get better."</p>
            <p>"United Help Ukraine" was started in 2014. It began with a group of people in Washington D.C. who supported Ukraine. Now, it has grown into an important Ukrainian charity group in the U.S.</p>

            <h1>Haiti is Very Poor and Troubled by Gangs; OAS Asks for International Help</h1>
            <p>The Organization of American States (OAS) is asking for more money and help from other countries. They want to make things better in Haiti, which has extreme poverty, a lot of instability, and many problems with gang violence. The OAS also said that some South American countries are ready to send soldiers to help keep the peace.</p>
            <p>Albert Ramdin, the head of the OAS, spoke to AFP (a news agency) in a video interview. He talked about a plan the OAS released this week. This plan asks for help for Haiti, which is the poorest country in the western part of the world.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ramdin said that in the past, help from other countries did not work well, and money given to Haiti was wasted. So, he said, "We need to build trust again."</p>
            <p>Mr. Ramdin, who used to be the Foreign Minister of Suriname, said, "Canada and the United States have already given a lot of help. But now, countries in Latin America are interested again in helping Haiti."</p>
            <p>Many parts of Haiti, including most of the capital city, Port-au-Prince, are controlled by armed gangs who fight each other. Because of this, the new help plan from the OAS will focus mainly on making the country safe.</p>
            <p>A group of soldiers from many countries, led by Kenya, has already gone to Haiti to help the police. However, violent events are still increasing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Ramdin said that the OAS does not have the power to send peacekeepers. So, any group of soldiers sent there "must be led by the United Nations or another country." He also said that some South American countries are willing to send their soldiers.</p>
