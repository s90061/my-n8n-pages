            <h1>El Salvador Changes Law: President Can Stay in Power Forever. Opposition Says Democracy Is Gone.</h1>
            <p>Today, lawmakers from the ruling party in El Salvador voted to change the country's constitution and election rules. This change makes it possible for President Bukele to be re-elected many times. However, lawmakers from other parties said, "Democracy in El Salvador is dead."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that President Nayib Bukele won a second term last year, even though the constitution clearly said a president cannot be re-elected. Most judges in El Salvador's top court are friends with Bukele. In 2021, this court decided that running for re-election was a human right for Bukele.</p>
            <p>The changes to the constitution passed easily because Bukele's party, New Ideas, has many seats in parliament. These changes allow the president to serve for an unlimited number of terms. Also, the president's term will change from 5 years to 6 years. The system of two election rounds will also stop.</p>
            <p>After winning re-election last year, Bukele told reporters that he "did not think constitutional changes were needed." But at that time, Bukele did not answer questions about whether he would run for a third term.</p>
            <p>The law to change the constitution passed with 57 votes for and 3 votes against, just as El Salvador's parliament was about to take a break.</p>
            <p>This constitutional change also makes the current president's term shorter. This will allow the presidential, parliamentary, and local elections, which are now held at different times, to happen all together in 2027. Holding these elections at the same time will likely help the ruling party win everything.</p>
            <p>There are only a few lawmakers in parliament who are not from the ruling party. They are against the changes because they worry it will make the ruling party too powerful, with no real competition.</p>
            <p>Marcela Villatoro, a lawmaker from the ARENA party, said, "Today, democracy in El Salvador has died."</p>
            <p>Bukele is still one of the most popular leaders in Central America. This is mainly because he has worked hard to get rid of gangs, which has greatly reduced murders. However, groups that protect human rights are very concerned that innocent people are also being arrested.</p>

            <h1>Food Exhibition Sees 20% More Visitors on First Day; Tuna Show Attracts People to Taste Fresh Fish</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Taiwan Culinary Exhibition started today. On its first day, over 20% more people visited than last year. At the "Pingtung Good Food" area, a show where a tuna was cut open attracted many people. They waited in line to try the fresh taste of bluefin tuna.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Tourism Association, which organizes the food exhibition, reported that 23,189 people visited today. This is 20.26% more than last year.

            <p>Popular foods from Michelin Bib Gourmand also attracted people who wanted to buy them quickly. Last year, Tainan's Steamed Shrimp Meatballs and Hu She Yu Wei sold out fast. This year, they were even more popular. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Tourism Administration, with its "Taiwan is Full of Good Things" program, brought popular foods like Tainan's A-Wen Rice Cakes, Raohe Street's famous Mochi Babies, and Dongshi Beef Noodle House. Seafood restaurant Ri Ai Kitchen also offered fried mahi-mahi.</p>
            <p>Many star-rated hotels are offering discounts to attract customers. Hai Pa Wang has a "Good Food Table Meal Voucher" at a 57% discount, costing NT$5000 each.

            <p>Regent Taipei Hotel's new offers were very popular: the San Want Beitou "Golden Lemon Shabu-Shabu Voucher," the Silks Palace "Imperial Duck Six-Course Meal for Four Voucher," and the Quan Yuan Ge "Master Chef's Roast Duck Six-Way Banquet." The Grand Hotel's Grand Steakhouse offered a "Weekday Grand Steakhouse Seafood and Meat Set for Two Voucher."</p>
            <p>The 2025 Taiwan Culinary Exhibition is happening from August 1st to 4th at the Taipei World Trade Center. The Taiwan Tourism Association announced that tomorrow's seafood cooking show will feature Chef Luo Jin-han, who will show how to cook "Mahi-Mahi with Basil." Also, Chef Hu Cai-bin from "Goro's Time Food" and a YouTuber will teach people how to "make sashimi at home."</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain in Pingtung: 8 Townships Face 5th Day of Closures, 429 People Move from Mountains</h1>
            <p>Pingtung has had heavy rain for many days, and there are warnings for mudslides in several areas. In Sandimen Township, the water level for two bridges connecting it to other places is too high, so the bridges are closed. As of 6:30 PM today, 429 people have been moved from the mountain areas. Tomorrow will be the fifth day that 8 indigenous townships will have no school or work. The county government asks people not to go into dangerous areas.</p>
            <p>Because of the ongoing southwest air current, Pingtung has seen heavy rain for days. Many mountain indigenous areas have mudslide warnings. Tomorrow will be the fifth day that 8 indigenous areas in the whole county will have no school or work. Pingtung County Mayor Chou Chun-mi went to the mountains today to check on the situation. She told the indigenous areas to start moving people out as a safety measure right away. She also encouraged the workers who have been working for two weeks to clear roads.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that it is still raining in the mountains, and the heavy rain might continue for several more days. She asks all local people to follow the government's orders to move to safety and not to go back into dangerous areas. The county government and all parts of the disaster response center are staying very alert and ready to act. If anything happens, they will "deal with it immediately."</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi also said that the "Koushe Bridge" and "Fubon Bridge," which are important bridges connecting the Koushe tribe in Sandimen to Gaoshu Township, are completely closed. This is because the water level is higher than the safe limit. All other bridges in the county are also being watched closely. She asks people not to risk crossing closed roads. For tribes that might become cut off, the county government has already checked their medical supplies and other important goods. They have asked each indigenous township office to report their needs quickly. The county government will then help to get these supplies to make sure people have basic things to live during and after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Jiang Guo-feng, the head of Pingtung County Government's Water Resources Department, said that the water level at Koushe Bridge on County Road 185 in Sandimen has risen a lot due to days of rain. This shows that the bridge itself is not tall enough. Chou Chun-mi visited the site with the Seventh River Management Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Water Resources Agency. She asked the Public Works Department to quickly submit a plan to rebuild the bridge and ask the Water Resources Agency for money to help.</p>
            <p>A press release from the Pingtung County Government's Information and International Affairs Department said that the county government has started a special contract to deal with the disaster. They have called in repair teams who are working day and night. The road clearing teams have been working for two weeks straight, starting as early as 6 AM and continuing until 8 PM. They are still working at the front lines, staying highly alert and ready to respond.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Indigenous Affairs Department, by 6:30 PM, a total of 429 people had been moved from Pingtung's indigenous areas. Most of them, 183 people, were from Taiwu Township, and Chunri Township had the second highest number with 133 people.</p>
