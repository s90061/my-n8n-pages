            <h1>FBI: DNA at scene of US conservative influencer Kirk's murder matches suspect</h1>
            <p>The FBI director, Kash Patel, said today that DNA found at the place where American conservative influencer Charlie Kirk was murdered matches the suspect, Tyler Robinson.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Robinson, who is 22, was caught on September 12th after police looked for him for 33 hours. He will be charged with murder later this week.</p>
            <p>Kirk was shot and killed on September 10th at a university in Utah during a speech. He started "Turning Point USA," a well-known group for young conservative people.</p>
            <p>Police said the suspect used a sniper rifle from a rooftop. He fired one shot that hit Kirk in the neck.</p>
            <p>Patel said on Fox News this morning, "Today I can tell you that DNA on a towel wrapped around the gun and on a screwdriver found at the crime scene matches the DNA of the suspect we have arrested."</p>
            <p>Patel also said that Robinson is believed to have written a note before the crime.</p>
            <p>Patel explained, the note "basically said... 'I have a chance to get rid of Kirk, and I will take it.' This note was written before the shooting."</p>
            <p>He added that the note was left at the suspect's home.</p>
            <p>Patel said, "Even if the note was destroyed, we still found evidence from it."</p>

            <h1>Spanish Prime Minister supports pro-Palestine protests at cycling race, causing political and diplomatic conflict</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, about 100,000 people in Madrid, Spain, protested on the cycling race track of the Vuelta a España. They were protesting against what they called "genocide" by Israel in Gaza. This stopped the last part of the race, which was new. Spain's Prime Minister Sánchez supported the protest, which made other political parties angry. Israel's Foreign Minister called it a shame.</p>
            <p>El País newspaper reported that before the last part of the Vuelta a España was stopped, Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez spoke about his support for the protesters. He has always shown strong support for Palestine and has often spoken against Israel.</p>
            <p>Sánchez said, "Spain is a proud example. We have taken a step to protect human rights. We agree with what is right. Long live the people of Spain!"</p>
            <p>Because of this, Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, said that Sánchez's words encouraged pro-Palestine people to protest. He said this ruined the cycling race. Saar also strongly criticized Sánchez and his left-wing government, calling them "a shame for Spain."</p>
            <p>Spain's biggest right-wing party, the "People's Party" (PP), also used this chance to attack Sánchez. Today, the leader of the PP, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, and Madrid's mayor, José Luis Martínez-Almeida, both said that Sánchez should be responsible for "the violent actions that brought shame to the country."</p>
            <p>They said they support free speech and legal protests. But they also said that protests should not stop sports events because the protests put the lives of cyclists and police officers in danger.</p>
            <p>Feijóo strongly stated, "Stopping a sports event from finishing is political violence."</p>
            <p>Even though he faced strong criticism since yesterday, Sánchez repeated his views today at a meeting of his left-wing "Socialist Workers' Party" (PSOE). He said he has always been against violence. But he has "great respect and admiration" for "Spanish citizens who stand up against unfairness and defend their ideas peacefully."</p>
            <p>Sánchez believes that Spanish people, no matter their political views or party, will always defend "human rights and international law." He said that Israel and Russia are currently harming these rights and laws.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Sánchez asked for punishments for Israel and Russia until they stop their cruel actions. He said they "should not be allowed to take part in any international sports events."</p>
            <p>This year, the Vuelta a España race had an Israeli professional cycling team, Israel-Premier Tech. Also, the team's owner is a good friend of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This caused many protests to support the Palestinian people. For three weeks since the race started, people have gathered to protest along many parts of the race track.</p>
            <p>On September 14th, the last part of the Vuelta a España was supposed to finish at Plaza de Cibeles, where the Madrid city council is located. But many protesters came to the road before the finish line. They pushed down barriers and took over the track, leading to violent clashes with the police.</p>
            <p>To keep the cyclists safe, the organizers had to stop the race early and cancel the award ceremony. This was the first time this has happened in the history of the three major cycling races (Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, and Vuelta a España).</p>
            <p>The protesters held Palestinian flags. They showed support for the Palestinian people who are suffering from war. They said that Israel's attacks in the Gaza Strip are "not war, but genocide." They shouted "Netanyahu is a killer" and "Free Palestine."</p>
            <p>The war in Gaza started in October 2023. It began when the Palestinian group Hamas attacked southern Israel, killing 1219 people and taking more than 200 people as hostages. After this, Israel launched a big counter-attack against the Gaza Strip, which Hamas controls.</p>
            <p>According to health officials in the Gaza Strip, this war has caused over 60,000 Palestinians to die so far. Most of them were regular citizens.</p>
            <p>Since the Gaza war started, the Spanish government has kept saying that Israel's military attacks go against international law. It believes that a "two-state solution" is the only way for peace between Israel and Palestine. In May 2024, Spain officially recognized the state of Palestine. It has also worked hard to put punishments on Israel, like stopping weapon sales. Because of this, Spain's relationship with Israel is still difficult.</p>

            <h1>Trump goes to UK for visit; US and UK will announce over $10 billion agreement</h1>
            <p>High-ranking American officials said today that the United States and the United Kingdom plan to announce economic agreements worth over 10 billion US dollars. This will happen during US President Donald Trump's official visit this week.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that American officials said in a phone briefing that the two governments plan to sign a trade agreement with three main parts. These parts include creating a new technology partnership to make both countries' tech industries stronger, working together on peaceful nuclear energy, and improving cooperation on defense technology.</p>
            <p>Officials said that many leaders from American technology companies are expected to be at this official visit.</p>
            <p>Trump and the First Lady, Melania Trump, will arrive tomorrow evening. On the 17th, they will meet with King Charles III and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle. They will also go to a special dinner there that evening.</p>
            <p>On the 18th, Trump will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. They plan to hold a joint press conference. After that, Trump will return to Washington D.C. on the evening of the 18th.</p>
            <p>Trump is the first US President to be invited twice to a state dinner by the UK. The first time was in 2019, during his first term as president.</p>
            <p>American officials said that the new agreements will focus on working together on the economy. They expect the total value to be at least 10 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>One American official said, "This visit gives the President a chance to make the relationship stronger with this very close partner and friend. It also helps both sides with their shared goals in economy and foreign policy."</p>
