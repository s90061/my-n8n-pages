            <h1>President Lai's National Day Speech: Three Strategies for Competition and Building a "Shield of Taiwan" for Defense</h1>
            <p>The National Day event took place on October 10th. This year, the Ministry of National Defense's band played a song from last year's World Baseball Premier12 tournament. Teams like the Little League World Series champions were welcomed in special "hero" vehicles. Five "Brave Eagle" advanced jet trainers from the Air Force flew over the Presidential Office, releasing colored smoke.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te spoke, saying that "Democratic Taiwan," which was created through much hard work, is the clear identity for the 23 million people of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu in the world. Taiwan is a shining example of democracy in Asia, and it always gives hope to everyone living under authoritarian rule.</p>
            <p>President Lai stated that to keep Taiwan competitive, the government will use three main strategies. These are: increasing investment, making international trade cooperation stronger, and developing important industries. The goal is for Taiwan to become one of the top five computing power centers globally. Also, Taiwan's defense budget for next year will be more than 3% of its GDP, and it will reach 5% of GDP by 2030. The increased defense spending has three main goals. One of these is to quickly build the "Shield of Taiwan" (T-Dome). This system will create a strong air defense that can stop attacks at different levels, sense threats very well, and block them effectively.</p>

            <h1>China Limits Rare Earth Exports; Trump Announces 100% Tariffs Starting in November</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C. â€” U.S. President Donald Trump announced today that he will add a 100% tariff on goods from China starting November 1st. This decision comes because China has put "very strong" controls on exporting rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Trump said that these new tariffs and U.S. export controls on "all important software" will start on November 1st. He made this move to get back at Beijing for what he called their "very strong" actions.</p>
            <p>Trump criticized China again, hinting that plans for a meeting between him and Chinese leader Xi Jinping might be canceled. Trump also threatened China with high taxes, which caused U.S. stock prices to fall sharply.</p>
            <p>On his social media site "Truth Social," he wrote, "It's hard to believe China would do such a thing, but they did, and the results are clear."</p>
            <p>Hours before, Trump made a surprising post threatening to raise tariffs on China. In that post, he said China had sent letters to many countries around the world, explaining its export controls on rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>Currently, Chinese goods face a 30% tariff from the U.S. Trump put these tariffs in place because Beijing failed to stop the illegal trade of fentanyl, a strong opioid drug, and because of unfair trade practices.</p>
            <p>In response, China is currently putting a 10% tariff on U.S. goods as a form of retaliation.</p>
