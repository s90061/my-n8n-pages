            <h1>Nursery Worker Sentenced to 8 Years for Abusing 21 Babies and Young Children in UK</h1>
            <p>A judge in the UK today sent a nursery worker to prison for 8 years. She was accused of many "unnecessary" and "cruel" attacks on babies and young children.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the person on trial is Roksana Lecka, a 22-year-old woman from London. In one case, people said she kicked a small boy in the face many times.</p>
            <p>Lecka said she was guilty of 7 crimes of "abusing children under 16." She was also found guilty of 14 more crimes after a trial. She said her actions were because she used marijuana.</p>
            <p>Judge Sarah Plaschkes said that Lecka did "many cruel acts of violence" while working at two nurseries in London. Lecka was accused of abusing 21 babies and young children.</p>
            <p>Plaschkes said to Lecka, "You pinched, hit, punched, slapped, and kicked them. You also pulled their ears, hair, and toes. You threw children headfirst into their beds. When the children were playing quietly and happily by themselves, you purposely made them suffer... Your actions were truly cruel."</p>
            <p>People found out about Lecka's child abuse in June 2024. At that time, someone saw her pinching many children. The police were called and looked at the nursery's video cameras. They found many cases of child abuse.</p>
            <p>Kingston Crown Court in London received statements from the parents of the abused children. The parents said that the abuse made them feel very sad and guilty.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says More People Will Be Charged After Former FBI Chief Comey's Indictment</h1>
            <p>The US Justice Department has charged James Comey, the former head of the FBI. After this, President Trump said more people he sees as "enemies" will also be charged. Critics say Trump is using the Justice Department to get "revenge." But Trump said his actions are fine because of what happened to him.</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 25, the US Justice Department charged Comey. He was charged with lying and stopping justice. A few days before, Trump openly asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to act against Comey and others he thought were against him. Comey was accused of lying and stopping justice during the investigation into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
            <p>Trump said on the White House South Lawn, "There will be other people (charged). I mean, those people are bad, they are bad radical left Democrats." He also said that charging Comey was about "showing justice," not revenge.</p>
            <p>Critics said this was a big change, making the Justice Department political. They said it was like the president directly telling them who to charge.</p>
            <p>Trump defended his actions by talking about how Democratic governments charged him many times after his first term. He said, "They did this to me for four years. They came after me for four full years."</p>
            <p>Last weekend, Trump posted on Truth Social, a social media site. He told Attorney General Bondi to charge Comey. He also told her to act against Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator from California. Schiff led the first impeachment of Trump when he was a representative. Trump also named Letitia James, a Democratic New York State Attorney General, who sued him for fraud last year.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote then, "They tried to remove me from office twice, and they charged me five times! All for nothing. Justice must happen, right now!"</p>
            <p>The Justice Department has started investigations into James and Schiff. They are accused of mortgage fraud. Both of them say they are innocent and that the investigations are political.</p>
            <p>Last month, the FBI searched the home and office of John Bolton, who was Trump's National Security Advisor during his first term. They were checking if he handled secret documents wrongly. After leaving his job, Bolton often criticized Trump.</p>
            <p>During his 2024 campaign, Trump promised to get revenge. But later, he changed his mind and said that winning the election would be his best revenge.</p>

            <h1>Gold Mine Collapses in Nigeria, Possibly Killing at Least 100 People</h1>
            <p>People living in Nigeria and those who survived said today that a gold mine in Zamfara State has fallen down. They think at least 100 people might have died.</p>
            <p>People who saw it told Reuters that the mine in the Maru local government area fell down yesterday. Rescue work is still happening today.</p>
            <p>Sanusi Auwal, a local person helping with the rescue, said that at least 13 bodies have been taken out of the rubble. His cousin was one of them.</p>
            <p>He told Reuters by phone, "When the mine fell, more than 100 miners were inside."</p>
            <p>Isa Sani, who was hurt and getting medical help, told reporters, "We are lucky to be saved alive. Out of more than 100 people, only 15 were rescued."</p>
            <p>Muhammadu Isa from the Zamfara State Miners Association said that the accident truly happened. He also said that some rescuers died from not being able to breathe while digging out the victims.</p>
            <p>Illegal mining is very common in Zamfara State, Nigeria. Armed gangs often control the gold mines there. There are many violent and deadly accidents.</p>
