A heatwave is affecting Southern Europe. Today, a woman died in Sicily, Italy, because of the heat. Also, some cities had big power cuts because many people used air conditioning. Several areas have said that outdoor work must stop during the hottest parts of the day. The government and worker groups are talking about more ways to help.

The Italian news agency ANSA said that high temperatures are expected across Italy this week. Italian regions have started rules to keep outdoor workers safe. Tomorrow, the Italian Ministry of Labor will sign an agreement with worker groups. This agreement will provide health checks and special clothes for workers in farming and industry, who are most affected.

Because of the hot weather, many shops and homes are using a lot of air conditioning. This has caused power problems in some Italian cities. Today, Florence city center had a blackout, and traffic lights in Bergamo, a large city in northern Italy, stopped working.

To protect workers from the heat, areas like Lazio (where Rome is), Lombardy (where Milan is), and Veneto (where Venice is) have made rules. From 12:30 PM to 4:00 PM during summer, outdoor workers like construction workers and farmers must stop working.

The heat is not only dangerous for workers but also for tourists. A report said that an Asian woman in her 60s fainted on the roof of Milan Cathedral and was taken to the hospital. Hospitals in Italy have seen a 20% increase in emergency visits recently. This is because high temperatures can be harder on older people, those with long-term illnesses, and seriously ill patients. Many Italian hospitals have added more staff to their emergency departments.

Many cities are trying to help tourists escape the heat. For example, in Naples, a local group made a "climate shelter map." It shows over 30 parks and libraries in the city where people can go to cool down.

**US State Department Changes Foreign Aid Policy, Prioritizing Countries That Help Themselves**

Today, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that future US aid will mostly go to countries that can and want to help themselves. He also gave power to diplomats working in other countries to create a quick feedback system. This is to make sure aid programs help American interests and meet local needs. This change will help the US stand stronger against China's aid, which often takes advantage of other countries.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID), which has been around for 60 years, officially stopped its foreign aid work today and joined the State Department. Rubio released a statement called "Make Foreign Aid Great Again" this morning. He highlighted three main ideas: "trade before aid," "focus on chances, not dependence," and "investment instead of aid."

He first said that USAID was not working well and sometimes even caused problems. He said that USAID has done little since the Cold War ended, except creating many non-government organizations using taxpayer money. Development goals were rarely met, unstable situations often got worse, and anti-American feelings grew.

Rubio said that countries that got the most from the US often did not support the US in return. For example, countries in Africa south of the Sahara got $165 billion in aid since 1991. But in important UN votes in 2023, only 29% of their votes were the same as the US, which is the lowest rate in the world.

"During the same time, the US spent over $89 billion in the Middle East and North Africa, but this led to less support for the US than for China in all countries except Morocco."

Rubio stated that since 1991, the UN spent $9.3 billion in Gaza and the West Bank. Some of this money went to groups connected to Hamas, a Palestinian armed group. This caused people to feel angry at the US instead of thankful.

He criticized that only high-level staff in many non-government organizations were doing well, living luxurious lives with US taxpayer money, while the people they said they were helping became poorer.

Rubio announced that USAID has officially stopped its foreign aid work starting today. The State Department will now manage foreign aid programs that fit government policy and help US interests.

He said that the old way of giving aid, based on charity, failed because leaders in developing countries became too dependent on aid. Also, the State Department found that countries that received USAID money often said they needed trade, not aid.

"After talking with countries in Latin America and Africa, we keep hearing the same thing: developing countries want investments that help long-term growth, not decades of gifts from the UN or aid managed by USAID."

For example, a man from Zambia told an American diplomat that instead of the US government giving fish, they should teach Zambian people how to fish.

"American people should not pay taxes for failing governments far away," Rubio said. Looking ahead, US aid will be specific and have time limits. The State Department is also putting together different money accounts and removing complicated rules to act faster and respond to emergencies quickly.

The US government's decision to close USAID has caused strong disagreement. Barack Obama, who has been mostly quiet since Donald Trump returned to the White House, surprisingly spoke out, calling it a "big mistake."

Yesterday, in a video farewell event, he said in a recorded message, "Destroying USAID is not just like a joke, it's a tragedy. Because it is one of the most important jobs happening around the world."

**Remembering Chen Chun-chih, a Fighter for Gender Human Rights**

Before there were laws about gender equality, director Chen Chun-chih worked with the Awakening Foundation to make Taiwan's first documentary about sexual harassment, called "The War of the Roses." It showed stories of people who bravely fought for their rights after being harassed.

This was the first time Chen Chun-chih made a film that was not about gay issues. He thought that people who experienced sexual harassment were similar to gay people because they often could not show their true selves and others did not understand their emotional pain. He felt that making this film would help women's rights and also be a lesson for the gay rights movement.

Chen Chun-chih used his work to focus on gender minority issues. After making "Not Just a Wedding Banquet" at age 30 and openly coming out as gay, he made many more documentaries and a movie called "Recruiting Friends Along the Coastline."

"Not Just a Wedding Banquet," made in 1997, showed Taiwan's first public gay wedding. "Beautiful Boys" was the first LGBTQ-themed documentary shown in movie theaters in Taiwan and was very popular when it came out.

He also wrote to share his ideas. His book "Human Disqualification: The Death of a Boy in Gaoshu" brought attention to the Ye Yong-chih incident. His autobiography, "Taipei Father, New York Mother," was made into a play, with famous actors like Wan Fang and Yang Li-yin.

Chen Chun-chih was once the middle school tutor for actor Lan Cheng-lung, and they had a close relationship. After Chen Chun-chih suddenly died in 2018 due to illness, Lan Cheng-lung decided to make a movie. In his self-directed and self-acted film "Success Tutoring Class," he created a character called "Teacher Xiao Zhi" to honor his respected teacher.
