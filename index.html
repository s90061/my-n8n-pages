The Han Kuang military exercise is now in its fifth day. The 333rd Mechanized Infantry Brigade, which protects southern Taiwan, trained today in Kaohsiung. They used CM33 and CM34 Clouded Leopard armored vehicles to search the Kaohsiung port area. They also used their weapons to protect the area. This training helps them practice real combat skills.

The exercise, which lasts for 10 days and 9 nights, is simulating an enemy attack on Taiwan. All air defense equipment is ready. The Fourth Combat Zone said that the 333rd Brigade searched the port area after hearing about the enemy. They sent armored vehicles and mortar teams to check the port facilities and control tower. This was to see how quickly the troops could react during a real war.

After receiving the enemy report, the company commander quickly gave orders. The troops moved to protect important places. When they arrived, the soldiers got out of the vehicles and started fighting. With the armored vehicles providing cover, they moved forward, searched the area, and successfully took control of the important target.

The Fourth Combat Zone stated that the soldiers practiced different situations. They used their weapons to cover each other and moved forward. This helped them train for real combat and learn more about the area they are responsible for.
