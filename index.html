            <h1>LPGA Canadian Open: Chien Pei-yun Scores 68, Tied for 8th After First Round</h1>
            <p>At the LPGA Canadian Women's Open today, Taiwan's good player Chien Pei-yun played well. She got 5 birdies and 2 bogeys. This means she shot 3 strokes under the normal score, with a total of 68 strokes. She is currently tied for 8th place, 4 strokes behind the leader.</p>
            <p>The LPGA Canadian Open has a total prize of 2.75 million US dollars (about 84.87 million New Taiwan dollars). Only two players from Taiwan, Hsu Wei-ling and Chien Pei-yun, are playing. Lin Tzu-han tried to get into the main competition through the qualifying rounds but could not.</p>
            <p>Chien Pei-yun started her game today from the 10th hole. She got a bogey on the 11th hole, but it did not affect her much. She quickly made birdies on the 15th and 16th holes, getting back her strokes. After changing sides of the course, Chien Pei-yun made more birdies on holes 2, 5, and 8. Even though she got a bogey on the 7th hole, she still finished with a good score of 68.</p>
            <p>Chien Pei-yun has been working hard on her putting all year. Before this game, she tried a new putter, hoping to feel more comfortable. Today, she used 29 putts in total, which is an average performance.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's top player, Hsu Wei-ling, took a break for almost two weeks after finishing 6th in the British Open. Today, she started playing again. But she only got 2 birdies and 4 bogeys, finishing with 73 strokes. She is now tied for 87th place and is 1 stroke away from getting into the next round.</p>
            <p>Akie Iwai, a Japanese player who won the LPGA Portland Classic last week, played perfectly again today in the first round of the Canadian Open. She made 7 birdies and no mistakes. She is currently in the lead with 64 strokes.</p>

            <h1>Tainan YouBike 2.0 Expected to Reach Over 10 Million Users by September</h1>
            <p>Tainan City's public bicycle system, YouBike 2.0, started in February 2023. After about two and a half years, the city government believes that by September, it will have been used over 10 million times. The person who makes the 10 millionth trip will get a gift coupon worth NT$5,000. The two people who ride right before and after them will also get gift coupons and other presents.</p>
            <p>The Tainan City Government's Transportation Bureau said today that the YouBike 2.0 system began its rental service in Tainan at the end of February 2023. By August this year, there are 610 stations. They have 5,300 regular bicycles and 900 electric-assist bicycles. Both citizens and visitors really like using them.</p>
            <p>Currently, YouBike 2.0 stations are mainly located at important transport spots like Taiwan Railways stations, transfer stations, and parking lots. They are also in important community places like schools and neighborhoods. Tourist spots are also key areas for the stations. In the future, the city government will add more stations and bikes to help more people. This will make it even easier to travel around Tainan.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Businessman Sentenced to 1 Year and 2 Months for Spying for China on Falun Gong Information</h1>
            <p>Xue Zhen-chun, a Taiwanese businessman who once studied at the Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School, was told by Chinese security officials to try and get travel information about Falun Gong members from an investigator. He was found innocent in an earlier trial, but in a later trial, he was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison under the National Security Act. Yesterday, the Supreme Court rejected his appeal, and the sentence is now final.</p>
            <p>The court decision stated that Xue Zhen-chun used to be a student at the Chung Cheng Armed Forces Preparatory School. Later, he became a businessman and often traveled between Taiwan and China. Around 2014, he met "Manager Wang" and "Xiao Zheng," who were officials from the Fourth Bureau of China's Ministry of State Security. These officials were in charge of intelligence work for Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau.</p>
            <p>"Manager Wang" and "Xiao Zheng" told Xue Zhen-chun to introduce Taiwanese government officials and ruling party representatives to them. They also asked him to collect documents and news about Falun Gong members entering and leaving Taiwan.</p>
            <p>When Xue Zhen-chun was studying at National Chengchi University, he met a male investigator named Lai. In 2018, Xue asked Lai twice during dinners if he could get travel information about Falun Gong members. Xue offered to help Lai get information from China in return, but Lai did not agree. When Xue was questioned, he denied doing anything wrong, saying that "Manager Wang" and "Xiao Zheng" were made up by him.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court, in its first ruling, believed that information about Falun Gong members' travel was important for relations between Taiwan and China and could affect social stability. The court considered that Xue Zhen-chun did not care about the country's support for him and showed no regret. So, under the National Security Act, for trying to get secret government documents and information for a Chinese government agency to affect social stability, he was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison.</p>
            <p>After an appeal, the Taiwan High Court heard the case and decided there was not enough evidence. They changed the ruling to not guilty. However, the Supreme Court canceled this decision and sent the case back. The High Court then heard the case again but still thought there was not enough evidence. Again, the Supreme Court canceled this decision and sent the case back.</p>
            <p>In the second re-trial, the court decided that travel information is secret government documents and news. It is also important information that is carefully controlled. If Chinese government, military, or party organizations get this information, it could put people's freedom to live and travel, their safety, and their privacy at risk. It could also harm a free and democratic society, which means it could threaten social stability.</p>
            <p>The court in the second re-trial thought about the case. Xue Zhen-chun tried to get secret government documents and information for people from China. Luckily, Mr. Lai noticed something was wrong and did not help, so Xue did not succeed. Even though no harm was done to social safety, there was still some danger. So, Xue was sentenced to 1 year and 2 months in prison. After an appeal, the Supreme Court rejected it yesterday, and the case is now finished.</p>
