            <h1>Yeh Pao-ti's First Home Run Helps Hawks Win; Lin Shih-hsiang Achieves 30 Saves in One Season</h1>
            <p>The TSG Hawks played their last regular season game against the Wei Chuan Dragons. Today, in the bottom of the 8th inning, Yeh Pao-ti hit his very first home run in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). This hit was important because it won the game for his team, making the Hawks win 4-3. This loss was the Dragons' fifth in a row. Also, Lin Shih-hsiang of the Hawks got his 30th save of the season. He is now the 8th player in the CPBL's history to do this.</p>
            <p>The Hawks played the Dragons at their home stadium, Chengcing Lake Baseball Stadium. Both teams did not score any points in the first three innings. In the bottom of the 4th inning, the Hawks scored first with a home run by Yen Yu-hsuan.</p>
            <p>In the top of the 6th inning, the Dragons took the lead. Giljegiljaw Kungkuan hit a home run that brought in two runs. This was his 24th home run this season. In the top of the 7th inning, the Dragons got another point from a hit, a dropped ball by the catcher, and a hit by Wang Shun-ho that allowed a runner to score.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the 8th inning, the Hawks started to attack again. With two players out, Wang Bo-hsuan and Tseng Yu-ching both walked to first base. Then, Yeh Pao-ti hit a home run that brought in three runs. This was his first home run in the CPBL, and it was the winning hit, helping his team get the win. Yeh Pao-ti was chosen as the best player of the game, or MVP.</p>
            <p>The Hawks' starting pitcher, Sakurai Shuto, pitched for 6 innings and let in 2 runs. He pitched well, but he did not get the win or the loss. The win went to the relief pitcher, Huang Chun. Another relief pitcher, Lin Shih-hsiang, pitched for 1 inning. He got two strikeouts and did not let in any runs. This earned him his 30th save of the season, making him the 8th player in CPBL history to get 30 saves in one season.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Secretary: American Military Has Power to Fight Drug Boats in Caribbean</h1>
            <p>US Defense Secretary Hegseth said today that he has all the power he needs. This means the American military can attack boats in the Caribbean Sea that are thought to be carrying drugs. These boats are believed to be near Venezuela.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hegseth said this in an interview on Fox News Channel. A US military attack on October 3rd killed four people. This was at least the fourth attack of its kind in recent weeks.</p>
            <p>In the interview on "The Sunday Briefing" show, he stated, "We have been given all the power we need. These groups are called foreign terrorist organizations."</p>
            <p>Neither Hegseth nor US President Trump has shown clear proof that the boats they targeted were actually carrying drugs. Last week, Trump told the government that he decided the US was in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug groups. However, he did not give new legal reasons for this.</p>
            <p>Hegseth explained, "If you are in our area, in the Caribbean, north of Venezuela, and you want to bring drugs into the United States, the US military can legally target you."</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that having the US military in the Caribbean has successfully stopped drugs from South America from being moved. He told reporters at the White House, "No drugs are coming into our waters now. We will think about what to do next."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Gaza Ceasefire Talks to Last Days; Rubio Calls for Israel to Stop Bombing</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that talks to stop the fighting in Gaza will take several days. Secretary of State Rubio warned that Israel must stop bombing if they want to get the hostages back.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Trump told reporters at the White House: "They are talking now. The talks have started and will go on for a few days... We will see what happens, but I hear things are going quite well."</p>
            <p>Today, CNN showed Trump's answers to questions sent by text. When asked if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to stop military actions in Gaza, he said "yes."</p>
            <p>People from Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas are planning to talk in Sharm El-Sheikh, a holiday town in Egypt. Netanyahu said he hopes the people held hostage in Gaza can be set free within a few days.</p>
            <p>However, Rubio asked the Israeli army to stop bombing Gaza from the air.</p>
            <p>He said on the CBS show "Face the Nation": "I think Israel and everyone agrees that it is not possible to free hostages while bombing continues. So, the air attacks must stop first."</p>
            <p>These diplomatic efforts happened after Hamas responded positively to Trump's plan for a ceasefire. This plan aims to end the war in Gaza and for Israel to let go of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the hostages.</p>
            <p>Rubio also said on the NBC show "Meet the Press" that there are still many "difficult practical problems" to solve before the hostages can be released. He also said that bigger goals, like how to govern Gaza after the war and how to take away Hamas's weapons, will be "even harder."</p>
            <p>He stated, "You cannot create a government in Gaza that is not Hamas's in just three days. I mean, this will take some time."</p>
            <p>Trump told CNN that he expects to find out soon if Hamas, which attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and started the conflict, really wants peace.</p>
            <p>He warned that if Hamas does not give up power, it will be "completely destroyed."</p>
