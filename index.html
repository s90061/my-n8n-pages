            <h1>Typhoon Willow Gets Stronger and Bigger, Land Warning Now Includes Kinmen</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Willow is coming to Taiwan. The Weather Bureau says that in the last 3 hours, Willow has become a bit stronger. Its storm area has also grown a little. It is expected to hit Taiwan as a strong typhoon. The land warning now includes Kinmen. On the morning of August 13th, the storm's edge will touch the land of Hualien and Taitung.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Weather Bureau, at 11 PM on August 12th, the center of Typhoon Willow was at 21.7 degrees North and 124.2 degrees East. This is about 340 kilometers (211 miles) southeast of Taitung. It is moving northwest at 27 kilometers per hour (17 miles per hour). The strongest wind near its center is 38 meters per second (about 137 kilometers per hour or 85 miles per hour). This is like a Category 4 wind.</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau said that Willow got a bit stronger and its storm area grew a little in the last 3 hours. Its center is now over the sea southeast of Taitung, moving northwest. The storm's area has started to enter the Bashi Channel and the southeastern sea of Taiwan. It brings danger to Taitung, Hualien, areas south of Miaoli, Penghu, and Kinmen. The typhoon is expected to get a little stronger.</p>
            <p>Zhu Meilin, a forecaster from the Weather Bureau, said that after late night on August 12th, Lanyu, Green Island, greater Taipei, and the northeast will start to feel some rain and wind from time to time.</p>
            <p>Zhu Meilin said that Willow is expected to get close to Lanyu and Green Island from early morning to late morning. The wind and rain will get much stronger then. From late morning to midday on August 13th, it will be near the southeast. Around noon, it will land in the Taitung area. It is expected to stay strong or get even stronger. In the evening, it will move out to sea from the Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan area. So, the whole day will be when the wind and rain are strongest. There is a chance of rain everywhere in Taiwan. The eastern part and areas south of Chiayi may have heavy or very heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Zhu Meilin also said that on the evening of August 13th, the center of Willow will be west of Penghu, moving towards China. It will then slowly get weaker. The wind and rain on Taiwan's main island will become less strong in the evening. But Penghu and Kinmen will still have strong winds and heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Also, the Weather Bureau warns that areas south of Chiayi and the eastern part will have high temperatures of about 27 to 30 degrees Celsius (81 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). Areas north of Yunlin will be hot and humid because of the "foehn effect" (air sinking down a mountain, which makes it warmer). Temperatures there will be above 32 or 33 degrees Celsius (90 to 91 degrees Fahrenheit). There is a chance that some places from Miaoli to Changhua and Kinmen will have temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

            <h1>Trump Again Asks Powell to Lower Interest Rates, Threatens to Sue Over Fed Building Repairs</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Donald Trump again asked Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve (Fed), to lower interest rates. Trump also threatened to sue Powell because of a building repair project at the Fed.</p>
            <p>The US Labor Department released new numbers today. They show that in July, prices for goods and services (Consumer Price Index, or CPI) increased by 2.7% compared to last year. This was a little lower than the 2.8% that experts expected. Compared to the month before, prices increased by 0.2%, which was expected. If we look at core CPI (prices without food and energy), they increased by 3.1% compared to last year and 0.3% compared to last month. These numbers were also what experts expected.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," today. He said that Powell, who is "always too late," must lower interest rates now. Trump believes that the damage caused by Powell being too slow is too great to measure.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said: "Luckily, the US economy is doing very well. We have won against Powell and the Fed board, who like to keep things as they are."</p>
            <p>Trump also stated that he is thinking about allowing a big lawsuit against Powell. He thinks Powell did a very bad job and was very bad at managing the Fed building's construction. A project that was supposed to cost 50 million US dollars for repairs is now costing 3 billion US dollars.</p>

            <h1>China Unhappy with Lin Chia-lung's Visit to Japan; China-Japan Agriculture Ministers' Meeting Postponed</h1>
            <p>The agriculture ministers from Japan and China wanted to have a meeting this month. But China suddenly asked to postpone it. Japanese media say this might be because Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Lin Chia-lung, visited Japan at the end of July. This made China unhappy, and China canceled the meeting to control Japan's actions.</p>
            <p>The Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun reported, based on what Japanese and Chinese diplomatic sources said, that Han Jun, China's Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, was supposed to attend a meeting of agriculture ministers from Japan, China, and South Korea in Incheon, South Korea, on August 11th. After that, he planned to visit Japan and have a meeting with Japan's Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Shinjiro Koizumi, in Tokyo on August 12th.</p>
            <p>The governments of Japan and China had planned for their ministers to sign an agreement during the meeting. This agreement was to stop new plant types developed in Japan from going to other countries. But China suddenly asked to cancel the meeting.</p>
            <p>Reports say that many people believe this happened because of Lin Chia-lung's visit to Japan at the end of July. While in Japan, Lin Chia-lung met with important people, including Sanae Takaichi, a former Minister of Economic Security and a member of parliament.</p>
            <p>Keiji Furuya, a member of parliament and head of the "Japan-ROC Diet Members' Consultative Council" (a group of lawmakers who support friendly ties between Taiwan and Japan), shared this information on Facebook on July 25th. Taiwan and Japan do not have formal diplomatic relations, so it is very unusual for Taiwan's foreign minister to visit Japan.</p>
            <p>Because of this, China protested to Japan. China said that Japan "provided a stage for anti-China and separatist activities and sent wrong messages."</p>
            <p>The report says that this shows China is worried about Taiwan and Japan becoming closer in politics.</p>
            <p>People who know a lot about diplomacy said that "Han Jun wanted to visit Japan, but the visit was suddenly canceled. This must have been ordered by China's leader, Xi Jinping."</p>
            <p>A high-ranking Japanese official said that "the cancellation of the meeting between Japan and China's agriculture ministers cannot stop Japan." He added that Shinjiro Koizumi had already met with officials from Taiwan's Ministry of Agriculture who were visiting South Korea from August 9th to 11th.</p>
