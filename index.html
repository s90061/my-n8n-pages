            <h1>Trump Orders Two Nuclear Submarines After Russia's Ex-President Makes Strong Comments</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that he has sent two nuclear submarines. He did this because a high-ranking Russian official made very strong comments.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," about the "very strong comments" from Dmitry Medvedev, who used to be Russia's president. Trump said he sent the submarines to certain places. This is in case these "silly and upsetting words" are more than just words.</p>
            <p>He also said that "words are very important" and can cause unexpected problems. He hopes this will not be one of those times.</p>
            <p>Trump did not say if the submarines have nuclear power or nuclear weapons. He also did not say where they went. The US military did not talk about it.</p>
            <p>Before this, Trump had said he might put new punishments on Russia. This was because Russia continued its fighting in Ukraine. Medvedev strongly criticized Trump for this on July 28.</p>
            <p>Medvedev wrote on X that Trump was "playing a game of strong demands." He said Trump "should remember" that Russia is very powerful.</p>
            <p>Medvedev stated that every new strong demand is a threat. It is a step towards war. He said it is not war between Russia and Ukraine, but war with Trump's own country.</p>
            <p>Medvedev was president of Russia from 2008 to 2012. Now, he is the Deputy Chairman of Russia's Security Council. He strongly supports President Putin's war in Ukraine.</p>

            <h1>US Official Visits Gaza, UN Says Many Died Getting Aid</h1>
            <p>Steve Witkoff, a special helper for US President Trump in the Middle East, visited the Gaza Strip today. He went to see how the US is helping with aid there. He is the first important US official to visit Gaza since the war began.</p>
            <p>The United Nations (UN) said that the dangerous situation in Gaza is partly because of this aid effort.</p>
            <p>Witkoff visited a place in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza. This place is run by the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," which the US and Israel support.</p>
            <p>The "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation" started working at the end of May. Many aid groups and foreign governments have criticized it a lot. This week, a group that checks world hunger said that people in Gaza are now facing severe lack of food.</p>
            <p>The UN reported that since the foundation began its work, more than 1,000 people have died trying to get aid. Most of these people were shot by Israeli soldiers working near the foundation's locations.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said that their soldiers did shoot some Palestinians who were trying to get aid. They also said that they have told their soldiers to act better in these situations.</p>
            <p>Mike Huckabee, the US Ambassador to Israel, went with Witkoff.</p>
            <p>Chapin Fay, a spokesperson for the "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," said in a statement that "President Trump knows how important Gaza is. The most important thing is to give food to normal people, not to Hamas (a Palestinian armed group)." A photo with the statement showed Witkoff wearing a military-style shirt, a bulletproof vest, and a baseball cap that said "Make America Great Again" with Trump's name on it.</p>
            <p>Witkoff wrote on the social media site X. He said the reason for his visit was to help President Trump understand the humanitarian situation clearly. It was also to help make plans for giving food and medical help to the people in Gaza.</p>

            <h1>Four Astronauts from US, Russia, and Japan Go to Space Station to Practice Moon Landing</h1>
            <p>Today, NASA (the US space agency) and SpaceX sent a group of four people to the International Space Station (ISS). This is their latest research trip to the space lab that goes around Earth.</p>
            <p>News reports said that two US astronauts, Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, a Japanese astronaut, Kimiya Yui, and a Russian astronaut, Oleg Platonov, went into space at 11:43 AM. They rode in SpaceX's Crew Dragon spaceship, which was launched by a Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>
            <p>This mission, called Crew-11, is the 11th time a new group of astronauts has gone to the ISS. It is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program. This program works with private companies since the Space Shuttle stopped flying.</p>
            <p>The astronauts on the Crew-11 mission will stay for six months. During this time, they will practice situations that they might face when landing on the Moon. This will be near the Moon's South Pole, as part of the US-led "Artemis" program.</p>
            <p>They will use small hand-held controls and many screens. They will check how changes in gravity affect an astronaut's ability to fly a spaceship, like the future Moon landers.</p>
            <p>The Crew-11 mission also has pomegranate seeds from Armenia. These seeds will be compared with other seeds on Earth. This is to study how very low gravity in space affects how plants grow.</p>
            <p>The International Space Station will stop being used after the year 2030. It will slowly come closer to Earth until it breaks apart in the air above a far-away part of the Pacific Ocean called "Point Nemo." This place is often called the "spacecraft graveyard."</p>
