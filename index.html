            <h1>Vietnamese Woman Forced to Work During Period, 12 People Accused by Yilan Prosecutors</h1>
            <p>The Yilan District Prosecutors Office found a group that forced Vietnamese women into sex work. A woman named Chen led this group in Jiaoxi. They made Vietnamese women have sex with customers, even when they had their period. The group made more than NT$8 million in 5 months. Today, prosecutors charged Chen and 11 other people.</p>
            <p>The Yilan District Prosecutors Office said that a Vietnamese woman, who was controlled by Chen and others in Jiaoxi, sent a message on Facebook to a friend in Vietnam asking for help. She included a photo taken from her room. The police and prosecutors started an investigation right away.</p>
            <p>After prosecutor Guo Ting-yu received the report in June, she thought the situation was urgent. She asked for a search warrant two days later and led the team. When Chen and her group saw the police, they hid the women on the building's roof and ran to the roof of a nearby building to escape. The police caught 4 group members and 11 Vietnamese women there.</p>
            <p>The police and prosecutors searched 8 times and got approval to hold 8 people. They also saved many Vietnamese women who were victims. Prosecutors found out that Chen started renting a hotel in Jiaoxi in January to run the sex work group. She used messaging apps to trick Vietnamese women into coming to Taiwan. She told them they could have "free jobs" with good pay and no government control. Chen also paid for their travel first. She did this to trick them into coming to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that Chen and her boyfriend, You, worked with Vietnamese and Taiwanese employment agents, including a person named Huang. They found fake employers and used false documents to apply for legal work permits. After the Vietnamese women entered Taiwan, the fake employers picked them up. Then, the group kept their passports, made them pay high fees, and reported them as missing. This made the women work in sex businesses at the hotel or other places.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors stated that the victims were forced to work even when they had their period. Records show that the group made about NT$1.69 million each month, getting more than NT$8 million illegally in 5 months. Also, prosecutors found another sex work group run by a person named Li and others. This group made NT$20 million each year. Prosecutors have asked the court to take all the illegal money.</p>
            <p>After the investigation, the Yilan District Prosecutors Office charged Chen and 11 others. They were charged with breaking the Human Trafficking Prevention Act and other laws for using people's difficult situations for profit through sex work. Prosecutors have asked for more than 9 years in prison for Chen and You. The articles removed information about reporters and editors.</p>

            <h1>People First Party Group to Vote "Yes" on Auditor-General Appointment</h1>
            <p>Today, September 30, the Legislative Yuan is voting on whether to approve Chen Ruey-min as the Auditor-General of the National Audit Office. Huang Kuo-chang, who leads the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) group, said that all 8 members of his party will vote yes. He explained that the National Audit Office, even with political problems, has clearly pointed out mistakes made by government departments. Its investigation results are fair and objective.</p>
            <p>This morning, Huang Kuo-chang held a press conference with all TPP members to explain their voting decision for the Auditor-General. He said the TPP group decided to vote yes for two reasons. First, he said that the National Audit Office has been one of the more normal working independent government bodies in Taiwan. Every summer, the National Audit Office gives a report that clearly shows major problems in government departments. Even with political issues, the office still clearly presents these problems in its reports.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang also said that the TPP group's second reason is that when they reported problems, the National Audit Office always investigated them. The results of these investigations were fair and objective. For example, last year, there was a big issue about the misuse of labor funds. The National Audit Office bravely released a report about it and asked for the misused parts of the labor funds and employment stability funds to be returned.</p>
            <p>Also, Huang Kuo-chang pointed out that the Legislative Yuan passed a law to increase pensions for police and firefighters, and also military pay. The President approved this law. But Premier Cho Jung-tai did not include the money for this in the central government's budget, as required by law. This shows a serious disrespect for laws passed by the Legislative Yuan and hurts the rights of retired police, firefighters, and military personnel.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang mentioned that the TPP group thought about sending the entire central government budget back. They wanted the Executive Yuan to create the budget according to the law. But they later hoped to solve the problem slowly and asked the Executive Yuan to honestly accept its mistakes and make changes. The articles removed information about reporters and editors.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang said that the TPP group will not ask to return the budget at today's meeting. However, they will also not sign a paper to say they will not bring it up again. He also asked Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu to quickly hold a meeting with all party groups about this matter. He stressed that whether the ruling party creates the budget by law depends on the Executive Yuan's final decision, and then they will decide what to do.

            <h1>ASEAN Finance / Kinsus to Expand in Thailand by Late Next Year</h1>
            <p>Kinsus Interconnect Technology, a big maker of server circuit boards, is focusing on the demand for AI servers. To meet orders, Kinsus is quickly increasing its production outside Taiwan. Kinsus said that the first phase of its factory in Thailand is almost done with customer checks. It will start making products in the fourth quarter of this year, which will bring in money. At the same time, they are also working on the second phase of the factory. They expect the production from the second phase to be many times bigger than the first phase by the second half of next year.</p>
            <p>Kinsus is a main supplier of PCBs (printed circuit boards) for ASIC servers used by CSPs (cloud service providers). It has orders for ASIC AI products and plans to expand its production to meet these orders.</p>
            <p>Kinsus stated that its Thailand factory will be a key place for making AI server products in the future. The first phase of the Thailand factory was checked by customers in the second quarter of this year. It is still making small amounts of products for testing in the third quarter. It is expected to start making products officially in the fourth quarter and begin to earn money. They have already started the second phase of production in Thailand. It is expected to expand in the second half of next year, and the production from the second phase is estimated to be several times more than the first phase.</p>
            <p>Besides expanding overseas, Kinsus is also increasing its production in Taiwan. Kinsus announced earlier that it bought the Chunghwa Telecom factory in Zhongli, Taoyuan, for NT$1.6 billion. This was to expand its Taiwan factory to meet the strong demand for AI servers and network products.</p>
            <p>Experts in the industry say that Kinsus has good technology for server and network boards, especially for making thick, multi-layered boards. They also have long-term orders for AI servers from CSPs. Looking ahead to 2026, as the need for AI ASIC products is clear and more 800G switches are used, Kinsus expects to get more money from high-end network boards and AI server products. Their plan to have two production places in Thailand and Taiwan is expected to help their income grow a lot. The articles removed information about reporters and editors.</p>
