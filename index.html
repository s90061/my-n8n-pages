            <h1>US Generals Gather; Trump Says America Faces 'Internal War'</h1>
            <p>Hundreds of generals from all over the world met in Virginia, USA, today. This meeting was special because it does not happen often. President Trump told these generals that the United States is fighting a "war from inside the country."</p>
            <p>News from AFP and The Hill said that Trump gave a speech to the military leaders at the meeting in Quantico, Virginia. He said, "Together, we will wake up our fighting spirit. This spirit helped us win and build this country."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "In the next few years, we will work together to make our army stronger, tougher, faster, braver, and better at fighting than ever before."</p>
            <p>He also talked about how the National Guard helped in some US cities. He said this was important work for some people there. He called this a war, a war from inside the country.</p>
            <p>Trump also told the generals that the Palestinian group Hamas would face big problems if they did not agree to the peace plan for Gaza.</p>

            <h1>US Defense Secretary Talks to Generals, Promises to End "Woke Culture" in Military</h1>
            <p>Today, in a rare meeting near Washington D.C., the US Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, strongly criticized past policies. These policies aimed to make the US military more diverse and inclusive. He said these policies caused "many years of decline."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hegseth called together top US generals from all over the world last week. They met today in Quantico, Virginia, but the reason was not clear at first.</p>
            <p>These high-ranking military leaders sat in uniform in the Marine Corps University hall today. They listened to Hegseth speak on stage.</p>
            <p>He began by saying, "Bad political leaders led us in the wrong direction. We lost our way and became the 'Woke Department.' But this will not happen anymore."</p>
            <p>Later today, US President Donald Trump will also speak to these generals. He said before that he would use this chance to tell them, "We love them."</p>
            <p>On the stage, there was a large American flag and a stand. A sign in front said "Strength Service America."</p>
            <p>In his speech, Hegseth also criticized how some soldiers look, especially if they are overweight. He said, "Seeing overweight generals in the Pentagon is completely wrong."</p>
            <p>Hegseth said that in the future, all physical fitness tests for the US military will use male standards. He also said that looking professional is very important. He added, "The time for unprofessional looks is over. You will not see people with big beards anymore."</p>
