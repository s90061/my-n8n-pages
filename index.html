            <h1>Trump to Meet Xi Jinping in Korea, May Impose 100% Tariffs Sooner</h1>
            <p>During a disagreement between the US and China about rare earth materials, US President Trump said today that he expects to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Korea in a few weeks. Trump also stated that tariffs give the US an advantage. He said he could put new 100% tariffs on Chinese goods into effect sooner if he wanted to, which he had threatened before.</p>
            <p>Last week, China announced many limits on rare earth exports. If these limits are put in place, they could badly affect US industries like defense, technology, semiconductors, and cars. Donald Trump threatened to respond with 100% tariffs, but he later seemed to calm down. Both the US and China have privately said they want to stop their trade arguments, at least for a while.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked about the progress of US-China trade talks, Trump replied this afternoon at the White House. He said it looks like his meeting with Xi Jinping will happen as planned. He also said again that he has "a very good relationship" with Xi Jinping. China wants to talk, and because of the tariffs, the US is in a very strong position now.</p>
            <p>Trump also mentioned that he could move up the date for the 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, which was planned for November 1st, if he wanted to. But China does not want that to happen. He said, "They want to talk, we are talking, and I think we will reach an agreement that will be good for both sides."</p>
            <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was also there, said that the leaders of the US and China respect each other a lot. He also said that he would talk to Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng tonight. They are expected to meet in Malaysia around next week to get ready for the meeting between Trump and Xi.</p>
            <p>Bessent added that he hopes China will treat the US with the same respect. He also said that the situation has "become less tense."</p>
            <p>Korean news reported on October 16th, quoting Korean officials, that Trump is expected to arrive in Korea on October 29th and stay until October 30th.</p>
            <p>This year's APEC leaders' meeting will take place from October 31st to November 1st, and Xi Jinping is expected to attend. People guess that the meeting between Trump and Xi will most likely happen on October 30th.</p>

            <h1>Afghanistan: Pakistan Breaks Ceasefire, Attacks Again, Killing 10 People</h1>
            <p>Afghan officials told AFP that Pakistan launched air attacks in Afghanistan tonight. These attacks killed at least 10 people and ended a ceasefire along the border that had lasted only two days.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, this ceasefire had stopped about a week of bloody fighting along the border. That fighting had killed many soldiers and civilians on both sides. But the ceasefire only lasted 48 hours.</p>
            <p>A high-ranking Taliban official, who did not want to be named, told AFP: "Pakistan bombed three places in Paktika province. This broke the ceasefire. Afghanistan will fight back."</p>
            <p>An official from a provincial hospital, who also did not want to be named, told AFP that Pakistan's air attacks killed 10 civilians, including two children. Also, 12 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>The ceasefire started at 1:00 PM GMT on October 15th. Pakistan said the ceasefire would last 48 hours. But Afghanistan said the ceasefire would be active until Pakistan broke it.</p>
            <p>Pakistan's Defense Minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, accused Afghanistan of "acting as an agent for India" and "planning against Pakistan."</p>
            <p>Asif wrote on X that "from now on, diplomatic actions will not be in the form of calls for peace, and no delegations will be sent to Kabul." News of the new air attacks came soon after he said this.</p>
            <p>He strongly stated, "Wherever terrorism comes from, it must pay a heavy price."</p>
            <p>Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesperson for the Taliban government, said that troops have been told not to attack first unless Pakistan attacks them first.</p>
            <p>In an interview with Ariana Afghan TV, he repeated the message given to the troops: "If they attack, then you have every right to defend your country."</p>

            <h1>Trump Believes Putin May Be Delaying, Too Soon to Give Ukraine Tomahawk Missiles</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today that Russian President Vladimir Putin might be trying to gain time by agreeing to a new meeting. But Trump still thinks Putin wants to end the war in Ukraine. He also said that it is too early to give Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House today. When reporters asked if he was worried that Putin was just trying to delay, Trump said, "Yes, I am worried."</p>
            <p>He then added, "The smartest people have played tricks on me all my life, but I always got out of it. So, even if he wants to delay a little, it's fine. But I think I am very good at this. I believe he really wants to make a deal."</p>
            <p>Trump said that it is too early to give Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. He hopes to make peace with Russia first.</p>
            <p>He told reporters, "I hope they don't need those missiles. I hope we can end this war without having to think about Tomahawk missiles."</p>
            <p>Trump also said he is confident he can make Putin stop the invasion that started in 2022. He mentioned that he had spoken with the Kremlin leader on the phone the day before.</p>
            <p>The US and Russian presidents agreed to meet in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. This will be their first talks after their meeting in Alaska in August, which did not lead to any peace agreement.</p>
            <p>However, Zelenskyy, who was visiting, was careful. He said that Putin "is not ready" for peace. This was Zelenskyy's third visit to Washington since Trump returned to the White House.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Ukraine has been asking Washington for Tomahawk cruise missiles. They believe these long-range missiles could pressure Russia to end the war.</p>
            <p>But just before Zelenskyy's visit, Putin warned Trump in a phone call not to give these weapons. He said it could make the fighting worse and put peace talks in danger.</p>
            <p>Currently, Russia occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine's land, and most of it has been destroyed by the war.</p>
            <p>Today, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced that it has taken three villages in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions.</p>
