            <h1>Former French President Sarkozy Sentenced to 5 Years, Expected to Go to Jail on October 21st</h1>
            <p>Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was sentenced to five years in prison last month. This was for a crime called "criminal conspiracy." A source told AFP today that Sarkozy will start his sentence on October 21st. He will go to a prison in Paris.</p>
            <p>Sarkozy is 70 years old. He will be the first French leader since World War II to go to prison. He is also the first former leader of a country in the European Union to serve time in jail. He is expected to be in La Sante prison in Paris.</p>
            <p>Sarkozy was the president of France from 2007 to 2012. In late September, he was found guilty. This was because Muammar Gaddafi, the former ruler of Libya, helped fund Sarkozy's election campaign in 2007.</p>
            <p>To keep him safe in prison, officials plan to make security stronger. Sarkozy might be put in a cell for special prisoners or kept alone.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, he went to the financial prosecutor's office in Paris. There, he learned about the details of going to prison.</p>
            <p>An AFP reporter said that he arrived in a car with dark windows. He left after about 45 minutes and did not say anything. Later, an AFP photographer saw him go back to his home.</p>
            <p>Sarkozy says he did not do anything wrong. He has appealed the court's decision.</p>

            <p>He also said that Egypt will host a meeting about rebuilding the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>Sisi stated, "In the coming days, Egypt will work with the United States and other partners. We will create a plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip. We plan to host an early meeting for recovery, rebuilding, and development."</p>
            <p>Earlier, US President Donald Trump visited Israel. Then he went to Egypt for the Gaza summit. He signed the agreement with leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. They all promised to support the Gaza agreement.</p>
            <p>As part of Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, Hamas today released 20 Israeli hostages. They also gave back the bodies of 4 hostages. Israel's prison authority said that Israel has released 1968 prisoners. Most of them are Palestinians.</p>

            <h1>Trump and Regional Leaders Sign Gaza Agreement, Says it's a Great Day for the Middle East</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said today was "a great day for the Middle East." He signed an agreement with leaders from many countries to make the ceasefire in Gaza strong. This happened a few hours after Israel and Hamas finished exchanging hostages and prisoners.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump quickly visited Israel. He gave a speech in the parliament and praised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. After that, he flew to Egypt for a Gaza meeting. There, he signed the agreement with leaders from Egypt, Qatar, and Turkey. They became supporters of the Gaza deal.</p>
            <p>More than 20 world leaders met in Sharm el-Sheikh, a holiday town. Trump said, "Today is a great day for the world, and an even greater day for the Middle East."</p>
            <p>Before signing the agreement, Trump said, "This document will list rules, regulations, and many other things." He said twice, "This agreement will continue to be valid."</p>
            <p>Hamas released the last 20 hostages held in Gaza for two years today. This was part of Trump's plan to end the war in Gaza. In return, Israel's prison office said that Israel released 1968 prisoners. Most of them were Palestinians.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke to members of the Israeli parliament. He said, "From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a country at war. It has carried a heavy burden that only proud and strong-willed people can carry." When he arrived at the Israeli parliament, everyone stood up and clapped for a long time.</p>
            <p>He also said, "For many families in this land, they have not known a truly peaceful day for many years. This long and painful nightmare has finally ended, not only for Israelis but also for Palestinians and many others."</p>
