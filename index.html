            <h1>NTNU Women's Football Coach Chou Tai-ying Sent to Prosecutors for Blood Test Case</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Prosecutors Office has sent Chou Tai-ying, the coach of the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's football team, for more questioning. This is part of a disagreement about blood tests for the team.</p>
            <p>On August 25, the Taipei City Investigation Office searched Chou Tai-ying's home and office in three different places. They also questioned her. Four other teachers, including Chen Chung-ching, were called as witnesses. They were all sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for further questions in the evening.</p>
            <p>Chou Tai-ying, a famous former Taiwanese female football player and now the coach for the NTNU women's football team, is accused of threatening players. She allegedly told them she would lower their academic grades if they did not agree to have blood tests for a research project. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office started an investigation on July 16 and gave the case to the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau's Taipei City Investigation Office.</p>
            <p>The investigators have asked for documents about the research project from the Ministry of Education, the National Science and Technology Council, National Central University, and National Taiwan Normal University. They also questioned one research assistant and 18 current and former female football team members. Twelve of these members were questioned again by the prosecutor.</p>
            <p>After looking at the documents and money flows, the investigators believe Chou Tai-ying might be involved in fraud and taking things that are not hers. A court approved their request for search warrants.</p>
            <p>On August 25, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office ordered the Taipei City Investigation Office to search Chou Tai-ying's home and office. Chou Tai-ying was called in as a suspect, and four witnesses, including Chen Chung-ching, were also questioned. They were all sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for more questions later that night.</p>

            <h1>India Worries China's Dam on Yarlung Tsangpo River Will Take Water, Speeds Up Its Own Dam Building</h1>
            <p>India is concerned that a big dam China plans to build on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet will greatly reduce its water supply. During dry seasons, India fears it could lose up to 85% of its water from the river. Because of this, India is quickly building its own dams to prevent problems.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that China announced in December last year that it would build the world's largest hydroelectric dam in the border area before the Yarlung Tsangpo River flows into India. India's government in New Delhi is worried that China, which claims some parts of India's Arunachal Pradesh state, might use control of the river as a "weapon."</p>
            <p>In July this year, construction started on China's Yarlung Tsangpo River dam. This project will cost 170 billion US dollars (about 5 trillion New Taiwan dollars). Once finished, it will make enough electricity to power all of the United Kingdom for a year.</p>
            <p>The Yarlung Tsangpo River starts from the Angsi Glacier. In India, it is called the Siang River and the Brahmaputra River.</p>
            <p>The Angsi Glacier provides water for over 100 million people in China, India, and Bangladesh downstream. The Indian government has been thinking about water projects to control water from the Angsi Glacier since the early 2000s. However, people living in Arunachal Pradesh, which is close to the Chinese border, have strongly opposed these plans. They worry that building a dam would flood their villages and destroy their way of life, sometimes even using violence to stop the projects.</p>
            <p>In May this year, India's largest hydropower company, protected by armed police, moved equipment to the planned site for the "Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam." If built, this dam would be India's largest.</p>
            <p>Two sources who know about the situation said that important Indian officials have continued to meet this year to speed up dam construction. The office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi organized one of these meetings in July.</p>
            <p>The Indian government wrote a report, without a date, that explains its worries about the Yarlung Tsangpo River dam. Reuters confirmed the details of this report with four sources and was the first to share this information.</p>
            <p>China's government in Beijing has not released many details about the Yarlung Tsangpo River dam project. The Indian government's report uses old studies from Indian government groups like the Central Water Commission and talks about how big the Yarlung Tsangpo River dam is expected to be.</p>
            <p>According to the sources and the report, New Delhi believes China's dam could let Beijing move up to 40 billion cubic meters of water. The problem of not having enough water would be very clear in the dry months, when temperatures rise and land becomes drier in many parts of India.</p>
            <p>The Upper Siang dam project plans to store 14 billion cubic meters of water. This would let India release water during dry seasons to help with droughts. According to the sources and the report, Guwahati, a major city that needs a lot of water for its industries and farming, would benefit. Without the dam, Guwahati's water could drop by about 25% in the dry season, but with the dam, it is expected to drop by only 11%.</p>
            <p>The sources also said that this project could help reduce the terrible effects of floods released by China.</p>
            <p>If the Upper Siang dam's water level is less than half of its full height, it could completely take in any extra water released by China's water facilities. Two sources said India is thinking about keeping 30% of the dam's space empty at all times, in case there are unexpected floods.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told Reuters that the Yarlung Tsangpo River dam project has been carefully studied for safety and environmental science. They said it will not cause bad water, environmental, or geological effects on countries downstream. The spokesperson added that China always uses international rivers responsibly and has long-term communication and cooperation with downstream countries like India and Bangladesh. Modi's office and India's water and foreign ministries did not answer Reuters' questions. The state-owned National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) in India also did not answer Reuters' request for comment.</p>
