            <h1>New Dammed Lake in Hualien: Premier Cho Jung-tai Calls for Full Effort to Reduce Spillover Risk</h1>
            <p>The Hualien branch of the Agriculture Ministry's Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency said today that a new dammed lake in Hualien's Liwu River might overflow and break. Premier Cho Jung-tai asked relevant groups today to keep watching it. He also asked them to work with local governments to fully reduce any bad effects if the lake overflows or breaks.</p>
            <p>The Hualien branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency got a report today. A landslide near the west exit of Jinheng Tunnel on Provincial Highway 8 (Central Cross-Island Highway) blocked the Liwu River. This created a new dammed lake. Because the lake could overflow and break at any time, tourists were quickly moved away. The section of the road from Tianxiang to Taroko was closed. An urgent message was also sent out, asking people nearby to stay away from the riverbed.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said on Facebook earlier that the government has started its emergency plan. They told people living upstream to be careful and move to safer areas below the mountains quickly. He also asked other people not to go into dangerous areas. Lee Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, added in a message to the media that when the government heard about the dammed lake, they immediately used drones to look at the area and check the water level. Premier Cho also told government groups to send people to quickly clear paths so that large machines can enter the area.</p>

            <p>Also, Lee Hui-chih said that Executive Yuan advisor Lee Meng-yen has gone to the Taroko Public Works Section of the Directorate General of Highways' Eastern Region Branch Office to learn about the situation.</p>

            <h1>Presidential Culture Awards Given: 5 Winners Show Different Sides of Culture</h1>
            <p>The 13th Presidential Culture Awards were given out today. The 5 winners cover different areas, from publishing and community groups to social enterprises. They show many different cultural values. For example, Lin Li-ching, who won the Youth Creativity Award, recently helped with disaster relief in Hualien. He has also been helping disadvantaged people find jobs for a long time.</p>
            <p>For the 13th Presidential Culture Awards, Ho Cheng-kuang, who started "Artist Magazine," won the Cultural Cultivation Award. The Meinong People's Association from Kaohsiung City won the Local Hope Award. The Taiwan Love and Care Foundation won the Humanitarian Contribution Award. Lin Li-ching won the Youth Creativity Award. And the Taiwan Labor Front Association won the Social Reform Award.</p>
            <p>Lin Li-ching wrote a book called "Workers" and started two groups: Youxi Social Innovation and Youxi Care Association. Today, he wore his "Youxi" uniform to the ceremony. He thanked Taiwanese society for always believing in them. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they wanted to help homeless people, former prisoners, and other groups find jobs. Many people did not believe in them then, but now "Youxi" has cleaned 94 schools.</p>
            <p>Lin Li-ching said that when he and his team helped with the disaster relief this time, he felt that Taiwanese society is paying more attention to people who use their hands to help society. He feels this is slowly becoming a part of Taiwanese culture. "I think this is the happiest thing about getting this award," he said. "It shows that Taiwanese social culture is caring more about how we personally help our fellow citizens and our land."</p>
            <p>Ho Cheng-kuang thanked those who have supported "Artist Magazine" since it started. Since its first issue, "Artist Magazine" has introduced global trends and also focused on local development. For example, its first issue included a series about the history of Taiwanese art movements by artist Hsieh Li-fa, which began the process of building a history of Taiwanese art. It also published a series of books about Taiwanese artists. From the time martial law ended to the search for local roots after martial law, "Artist Magazine" has always responded to the changes of the times.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Love and Care Foundation has worked for a long time to care for and support people with AIDS and disadvantaged migrant women. Yang Jie-yu, who started the foundation, spoke to Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim, who was in the audience. She said that the foundation needs a new place because they have over 200 children, over 100 adults, and more than 40 foreigners who need shelter. She hopes for help so they can live with respect. She also hopes that more people will be kind to these vulnerable groups.</p>
            <p>Yang Shu-wei, the secretary-general of the Taiwan Labor Front Association, received the award with members of the association. He said that winning this award means that the long-term efforts of the Taiwan labor movement and its help in social reform are finally being noticed. In the future, they will continue to talk with society. They hope to build a democratic society and country where people support and respect each other. They will continue to work with their partners so that reform is not just history but becomes a part of society.</p>
            <p>The Meinong People's Association from Kaohsiung City successfully stopped the building of a reservoir many years ago. This was the first time in Taiwan that a community movement clearly showed environmental awareness. Director Wen Wen-xiang received the award today with over 20 partners. He said that this award belongs to all the people of Meinong. It also makes them believe that if they work hard, the seeds of culture will grow and blossom.</p>

            <h1>Navy Finishes "Sea Power Exercise," Practices Stopping Enemy Fleet Together</h1>
            <p>The Navy held the "Sea Power Exercise" from October 13th until today. During the exercise, they practiced stopping attacks together, putting out fires inside ships, forming battle groups, getting supplies from the air, and firing some real weapons. The Navy Fleet Command released a video today. It showed that the fleet passed the final test of the "Sea Power Exercise" and reached a high level of readiness for surface combat units.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te visited the Navy's 62.1 Surface Combat Unit in Kaohsiung's Cijin camp today. He was with National Security Council Secretary-General Wu Chao-hsieh, Minister of National Defense Kuo Li-hsiung, Navy Commander Tang Hua, and Fleet Command Commander Wu Li-ping. President Lai watched a practice of how to stop an attack together. He went on the Keelung-class destroyer, USS Tsoying, to hear a report about the "Sea Power Exercise" and watched a video summarizing the exercise.</p>
            <p>The Navy Fleet Command released a video of the "Sea Power Exercise." It showed Navy officers and soldiers doing many different tasks during the exercise. These included preparing sea mines, then fast mine-laying boats leaving port to lay mines for defense. Soldiers from the Marine Corps' 66th Brigade guarded the mine-laying boats. Mobile missile launchers with Hsiung Feng anti-ship missiles moved to safe places. Coast Guard ships taking part in the exercise also left port to stay safe. Light, fast boats like the Kuang Hua VI missile boats and support ships also left port to stay safe.</p>
            <p>The video then showed the Navy's 62.1 Surface Combat Unit quickly leaving port and moving at sea. S-70C anti-submarine helicopters landed on Kang Ding-class frigates that were sailing.éŠ³é³¶ (Rui Yuan) drones flew up to watch from the air. P-3C anti-submarine planes also helped with anti-submarine efforts with both air and sea forces. S-70C anti-submarine helicopters carried and dropped torpedoes from ships into the sea. Navy ships moved at sea to refuel and resupply, and they worked together to watch and find targets. The ship-based surveillance drones on the Keelung-class destroyers flew up to get a better view of the sea.</p>
            <p>For live-fire practice, the 5-inch guns on the Keelung-class destroyers fired real ammunition. The 40mm guns on the frigates fired, and the Sea Chaparral missiles on the Kang Ding-class frigates also fired real ammunition. The Phalanx Close-in Weapon System also fired during the exercise. Navy officers and soldiers also practiced dealing with battle damage during the exercise. Ground forces, like the mobile missile launcher units, were set up to attack from the coast, and mobile radar vehicles actively searched for targets.</p>
            <p>At the end of the video, text showed that Navy officers and soldiers not only do daily combat readiness tasks to deal with China's "gray zone" attacks, but they also complete combat readiness reviews every three months and annual "Class A" evaluations. This helps them slowly build up their single-ship combat readiness to basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. Only then can they go through intensive training and pass the "Sea Power Exercise" final test, reaching a high level of readiness for surface combat units.</p>
