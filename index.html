US stocks turned mostly lower on Friday as investors reacted to a range of global events. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a small increase of nearly 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq experienced declines. Traders are concerned about the possibility of direct US military involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, which has been ongoing for two weeks. Other factors influencing the market include expectations for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and ongoing tensions between the US and China regarding chip technology.

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., is looking to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to create what could be his largest investment yet: a trillion-dollar industrial hub for artificial intelligence (AI) in the United States. SoftBank officials hope that TSMC, a leading manufacturer of advanced AI chips, will play a significant role. This initiative comes as TSMC has already announced plans to invest $165 billion in the US and has started mass production at its first factory in Arizona. Son has also prepared a list of SoftBank Vision Fund companies that could be involved in this Arizona manufacturing center.
