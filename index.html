            <h1>A Taipower Worker Got an Electric Shock; Premier Cho Jung-tai Is Sad and Asks for Help.</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporters Lai Yu-chen and Tseng Chih-yi, Taipei, July 15) A Taipower worker was fixing electricity in Yizhu Township, Chiayi County, this afternoon when he got an electric shock. The Executive Yuan said tonight that Premier Cho Jung-tai felt very sad when he heard the news. He has asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower company to quickly help the injured worker and his family. He also asked them to find out why the accident happened.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused power problems in Chiayi County. Taipower was still working to fix it. But this afternoon, news came that a worker fixing power in Yizhu Township, Chiayi County, got a serious electric shock. He was taken to Liuying Chi Mei Hospital in Tainan for emergency care.</p>
            <p>Li Hui-chih, the spokesperson for the Executive Yuan, said through a media message group tonight that Premier Cho Jung-tai was very sad to hear about it. Right away, he asked the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower to give immediate help to the injured worker and his family. Tseng Wen-sheng, the chairman of Taipower, also went to the hospital to visit the worker's family.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai told the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower to understand why the accident happened. He also asked all Taipower managers and workers who are still fixing power and bringing it back to be very careful and safe.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Premier Cho Jung-tai wrote on Facebook that both central and local governments were working hard to help with the typhoon and flood damage. Power was slowly coming back in many places. But he was shocked to hear that a Taipower worker was badly hurt while working in Yizhu, Chiayi. This made him feel very sad. Tseng Wen-sheng had already gone to Chi Mei Hospital to see the worker. He also asked the hospital to take good care of him. He prayed that the worker would be safe and get out of danger.</p>
            <p>Taipower sent out a press release tonight. It said that this afternoon in Yizhu, Chiayi, a Taipower worker from the Chiayi office was fixing a broken high-voltage wire. While checking the power and grounding, he accidentally got an electric shock. When it happened, the worker was not fully conscious. People at the scene quickly gave CPR and called 119 for an ambulance. He was immediately taken to the nearby Liuying branch of Chi Mei Hospital for treatment. Doctors are still trying to save him.</p>
            <p>Taipower said they are very sorry that their worker had an electric shock accident. They have sent managers to the hospital to check on the worker and offer any help needed. (Edited by Lin Ke-lun) July 15, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Made a Trade Deal with Indonesia, But Gave No Details.</h1>
            <p>(CNA Washington, July 15, based on foreign news) Today, US President Donald Trump announced on social media that he has reached a trade agreement with Indonesia. However, he did not explain any details. These include how much the agreement covers, what its terms might be, or when it will start.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," "Just made a great deal with Indonesia that will be good for everyone. I talked directly with their respected president. More details will be announced later."</p>
            <p>Trump recently posted that Indonesia would face 32% tariffs. This matches the 32% equal tariffs he announced for Indonesia on "Liberation Day" in April this year. (Translator: Chen Cheng-chien) July 15, 2025.</p>

            <h1>"Modern Taiwan Tea Selection" Starts in Tokyo, 7 Tea Companies Show Different Kinds of Charm.</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Dai Ya-chen, Tokyo, July 15) To share Taiwan's tea culture and sell more Taiwan tea, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Taiwan Tea Manufacturers' Association held "Modern Taiwan Tea Selection" today in Tokyo, Japan. Seven Taiwan tea companies were there. They showed creative dishes made with tea and refreshing tea drinks, which people liked a lot.</p>
            <p>Seven Taiwan tea companies took part in this event: Tong Hsi Enterprise Co., Ltd., Hsieh Yu Tea Factory, Tai Hsiang Tea, Yu Shan Fang, Pin Hsiang Tea, Hsin Feng Ming Tea, and Tung Chiu Biotech. They showed many different Taiwan tea products, such as loose-leaf oolong and black teas, and tea bags. Tea experts also showed how to make tea at the event.</p>
            <p>Chen Yun-kang, the head of the Taiwan Tea Manufacturers' Association, said in an interview that the association has been around for 71 years. They hold exhibitions in Japan almost every year to promote Taiwan tea. This time, they had a meeting where they could talk directly with Japanese companies. They also promoted using Taiwan tea in different ways, like in bubbly tea drinks and tasty dishes made with tea. They hope to share more of Taiwan tea's flavors with their Japanese friends.</p>
            <p>Also, at the event, a French chef and dessert maker offered creative dishes and desserts made with Taiwan tea. For example, there was an appetizer made with lychee, tomato, and tea leaves. There was also pumpkin soba noodles, which used tea as the soup base and are perfect for hot summer days. This showed new and many ways to use Taiwan tea with food.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chun-ying, the deputy head of the agriculture section at the Taiwan Representative Office in Japan, said in her speech that Taiwan tea and Japan have a long and strong connection. Around the 1920s, during the Japanese rule, Assam black tea plants and the skills to grow and process them were brought to Taiwan. Since then, Taiwan has started to make good quality black tea.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chun-ying said that in recent years, black tea has mixed with Taiwan's local oolong tea types. This has created a special tea culture. Through this event, they hope to help everyone learn again about the wonderful parts of Taiwan tea. (Edited by Kao Chao-fen) July 15, 2025.</p>
