            <h1>Israel Bombs Syrian Military Base, Warns Against Hurting Druze People</h1>
            <p>News from Sweida, Syria, July 16 (Central News Agency) - Israel bombed a Syrian military base in Damascus today. This happened after Israel warned the Syrian government, which is led by Islamic groups. Israel told them not to bother the Druze minority group in the Sweida province, which is their main area.</p>
            <p>An observation group said that fights between different groups in Sweida province, southern Syria, have killed almost 250 people.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, more than 100 people died in fights between the Druze people and local Bedouin groups. The Syrian army entered the city of Sweida, where most people are Druze, yesterday. They said they were there to check on a ceasefire agreement made with Druze leaders.</p>
            <p>However, witnesses said that the army and Bedouin people worked together to attack Druze fighters and regular people. They killed many people in the city.</p>
            <p>In April and May, the army and Druze fighters also fought in Sweida province and near Damascus. Over 100 people died then. This recent conflict is the worst violence since those events.</p>
            <p>Since December last year, when former President Bashar al-Assad was removed from power, the Syrian authorities, led by Islamic groups, have had problems with religious and ethnic minority groups.</p>
            <p>Israel's Minister of Defense, Israel Katz, told the government in Damascus to "not get involved with the Druze people in Sweida province."</p>
            <p>He asked the Syrian army to leave. He promised that the Israeli army would not stop attacking until they did. Katz said, "If this message is not understood," Israel would "make its response to the Syrian government stronger."</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Israeli army stated that they had hit the Syrian military headquarters. (Translator: Lin Yifeng / Editor: He Hongru) July 16, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Cuba's Labor Minister Resigns After Calling People Looking for Food in Trash "Fake Poor"</h1>
            <p>Havana, July 15 (Central News Agency) - Cuba's Labor Minister, Marta Elena Feito, called people who search for food in trash piles "fake poor" and not truly in need. This made many people angry, and today she resigned.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, many Cubans are forced to beg or even look for food in trash. This is because prices are very high, salaries are low, and there is not enough food. This problem is very common in Havana, Cuba's capital city.</p>
            <p>Cuban state media reported today that Minister Feito, who is also in charge of social security, "admitted her mistake and offered to resign." The report also said that her words "lacked objectivity and sensitivity."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, during a meeting of a parliament committee that deals with poverty, Feito said that people looking for food in trash cans were actually pretending to be beggars.</p>
            <p>On state television, she said, "Look at their hands, look at their clothes. They are pretending to be beggars. They are not beggars. There are no beggars in Cuba."</p>
            <p>Cuba's President, Miguel Diaz-Canel, criticized Feito on the social media platform X today for "lacking sensitivity." In a later parliament meeting, he said, "None of us should act proudly, pretend, or be out of touch with the reality we live in."
