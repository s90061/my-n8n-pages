Lin Chih-Sheng, a 43-year-old player for the Wei Chuan Dragons, played very well today. He got 3 hits and helped his team score 3 runs, leading them to a win against Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions. In the fifth inning, he tried to steal a base but did not succeed. He got to third base because the other team made a mistake. He was a little sad when he heard that it would not count as a stolen base. He said he needed one more stolen base to be 8th on the all-time list.

Lin Chih-Sheng was the designated hitter. He hit singles in the first and third innings. In the fifth inning, he walked to first base and then tried to steal. He got to third base because of a mistake by the other team. In the seventh inning, he hit a double, which helped his team score more points. After that, another player ran for him.

This was the first time Lin had 3 hits in a game since September 6, 2022. After the game, he joked, "I seem to play better when there's a typhoon." Then he said, "I just do what I need to do. At my age, it's already great if I can hit the ball." He explained that his good performance comes from his many years of experience. He knows how pitchers usually throw the ball in different situations. When asked if the strong wind affected the game, he thought both teams wanted to score quickly because they were afraid it might rain suddenly. He said both teams played with great effort and it was an exciting game. When asked about his attempt to steal a base, Lin first asked the reporter, "Did it count as a stolen base?" When he heard it did not, he was a little disappointed. He then started counting his career stolen bases but was happy that he was not out.

In the fifth inning, the record showed he was "caught stealing," but he moved to the next base because of an error. He now has 160 career stolen bases, which is the same as Queh Chuang-Chen. If he gets one more stolen base, he will be 8th on the list alone. He said he tried to steal because the pitcher made a big movement. He left the game in the seventh inning because his legs were a bit tired, and he didn't want to prevent his teammates from scoring if they hit a home run. So, a faster runner took his place. In this game, both teams hit a total of 6 home runs. Giljegiljaw Kungkuan for the Dragons and Lin An-Ko for the Uni-President 7-ELEVEn Lions both hit two home runs. Lin Chih-Sheng said they are both good at hitting home runs, and he was happier to see them play well than to play well himself.

**Taiwan Railways: Western Line Trains and 3 Branch Lines Stop Before Noon on July 7th**

Taiwan Railways announced tonight that due to Typhoon Danas, some train services will stop tomorrow, July 7th, until noon. This includes regular trains on the Western Line (from Keelung to Chaozhou) and three smaller train lines: Pingxi, Shenao, and Neipu.

Other train lines, such as the South-Link Line (from New Zuoying to Taitung) and the Taitung Line (from Taitung to Hualien), will run as usual. The North-Link Line (from Shulin to Hualien) will also run, but services might change if the weather gets very bad. For local trains, the Jiji Line will also stop until noon tomorrow. However, trains between Keelung and Hsinchu, Chiayi and Taitung, and on the Liujia and Shalun Lines will continue to run normally. Trains between Hsinchu and Chiayi, and Shulin to Taitung, might also change depending on the weather.

Also, the special Blue Skin Relaxing Express trains (numbers 5898 and 5899) and Tourist Trains (numbers 1 and 2) will not run for the whole day tomorrow. Taiwan Railways said that after the typhoon passes, they will check the tracks and electric lines. Once everything is safe, the stopped train services will start again little by little. They will announce more details about train services after 12 PM tomorrow at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning, based on the latest typhoon information.

If you bought a train ticket for a trip during the typhoon warning period, you can get your money back. You need to go to any train station with your unused ticket within one year from your travel date, and you will not have to pay any fee.

**Cambodia and US Agree on Trade Deal Framework, May Avoid 49% Tariffs**

Cambodia and the United States have agreed on a plan for a trade deal. The "Khmer Times" reported that Cambodia's government and the US have decided on the main points of a joint statement. This news is important because US President Trump had said he might put very high taxes, up to 49%, on goods from Cambodia.

On July 4th, a group from Cambodia, led by Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chanthol, talked online with a group from the US. The US group was led by Sarah Ellerman from the USTR, who works on trade with Southeast Asia and the Pacific. They finished a plan called "Joint Statement on Framework for the US-Cambodia Agreement on Reciprocal Trade." A statement released after the meeting said that this plan would be made public soon.

The statement also said that "Under the leadership of Prime Minister Hun Manet, the government will continue to work closely with the United States to achieve mutually beneficial trade and investment relations." This means Cambodia wants to keep working with the US to have good trade and investments for both countries.

In early April, President Trump said he would put new taxes, from 17% to 49%, on goods from different countries. Countries in Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia, faced the highest tax of 49%. These new taxes made the global money markets unstable. So, President Trump then announced a 90-day break. During this time, the tax would only be 10%. This break is planned to end on July 9th.
