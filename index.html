**Inflation Cools Further, Raising Hopes for Fed Rate Cuts**

US inflation slowed down more than expected last month, increasing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will start reducing interest rates later this year. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, rose by 3.3% in May compared to a year ago, which is lower than the 3.4% predicted by economists. This positive news suggests that the Fed's efforts to control rising prices are working.

The cooling inflation could lead to a decrease in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. Lower interest rates can encourage investment and spending, boosting economic growth. Experts believe that if inflation continues to decline, the Fed might begin cutting rates as early as September. However, they also warn that the central bank will carefully monitor economic data before making any decisions, to avoid triggering a resurgence of inflation. The stock market reacted positively to the news, with major indexes experiencing gains.

**New AI Tool Promises to Revolutionize Medical Diagnosis**

A groundbreaking artificial intelligence (AI) tool has been developed with the potential to transform medical diagnosis. This innovative system, created by researchers at a leading university, can analyze medical images such as X-rays and MRIs with remarkable accuracy. Early trials have shown that the AI tool can identify diseases, including cancer, at an earlier stage than traditional methods.

The AI works by comparing new images to a vast database of existing medical data, identifying subtle patterns that might be missed by human doctors. This could lead to faster and more accurate diagnoses, especially in areas where access to specialists is limited. While the tool is not intended to replace doctors, it can provide valuable support, helping them make more informed decisions and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The developers are currently working on expanding the AIâ€™s capabilities to diagnose a wider range of conditions.

**Article 3: Travel - "Sustainable Tourism Gains Popularity as Travelers Seek Eco-Friendly Options"**

**Sustainable Tourism Gains Popularity as Travelers Seek Eco-Friendly Options**

More and more travelers are choosing sustainable tourism options, reflecting a growing awareness of the environmental impact of travel. This trend involves choosing accommodations, transportation, and activities that minimize harm to the planet and support local communities. Eco-friendly hotels, which often use renewable energy and reduce waste, are becoming increasingly popular.

Many travelers are also opting for slower modes of transportation, such as trains and buses, which have a lower carbon footprint than flying. Furthermore, there is a rising interest in experiences that benefit local economies, such as visiting family-run businesses and participating in community-based tourism projects. Experts believe that the shift towards sustainable tourism is not just a passing fad but a fundamental change in how people approach travel, driven by a desire to protect the environment for future generations.
