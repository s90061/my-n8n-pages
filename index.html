            <h1>Zelenskyy asks NATO to respond strongly to drone crossing, to stop Russia from pushing too far.</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy recently said that a Russian drone entered Polish airspace. He thinks NATO should be stronger in its response. If not, Russian President Putin might take more advantage.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy spoke at the Yalta European Strategy summit in Kyiv. He noted that Russian drones have crossed into Poland and Romania before. He criticized that even though fighter jets went up to stop them, the issue was forgotten after a few days without any real punishment. He asked, "What were the results for Russia? Honestly, there were none."</p>
            <p>On September 10, early in the morning, 19 Russian drones flew from Belarus into Polish airspace. On September 12, NATO announced "Eastern Sentry" operations. France, Germany, and Denmark sent more fighter jets to Eastern countries like Poland and the Baltic states to improve air defense. Zelenskyy believes Putin's actions are meant to make NATO less confident and to delay help for Ukraine's military. He asked Western countries to provide not only defense systems but also weapons to attack Russian drone factories. This would protect Ukraine and NATO's eastern border.</p>
            <p>He said that Ukrainian soldiers face about 800 Russian drone attacks every day. They need at least 500 interceptor drones to deal with them. Each interceptor costs about 3000 Euros (around 100,000 New Taiwan Dollars), so it uses up a lot of military power.</p>
            <p>About peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he is willing to meet Putin directly, but not with America or Europe involved. He questioned if Russia's past talks were just to stop sanctions. He said, "Putin is always the biggest winner." He also asked all countries to increase sanctions and export controls to stop Russia from getting missile parts.</p>
            <p>He stressed that Ukraine will not give up its land without a ceasefire and without guarantees of safety. He said, "We cannot trust Putin; he will not stop."</p>
            <p>Vadym Skibitskyi, Deputy Head of Ukraine's Main Directorate of Intelligence, previously told Ukrinform that Russia plans to make 2,500 high-precision missiles in 2025, including Iskander missiles and different types of drones. Russia has also started a weapons plan that goes until 2037.</p>
            <p>He said that Russia's drone tactics have changed. Now, drones often fly in circles for a long time and change their paths to avoid air defense systems. They also have better missiles that can fight against electronic interference and hit targets more accurately. Most Russian weapon factories are 750 kilometers away from the Ukrainian border, and some are even 1,500 kilometers away. Ukraine needs more long-range weapons to fight back.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that Russia is focusing on making missiles fly farther, be more accurate, and carry bigger warheads. He said that Russia claims "it only needs one range to hit Ukraine, but it plans to attack NATO countries by 2030."</p>
            <p>This year's Yalta European Strategy summit happened in Kyiv from September 12 to 13. People who attended included Keith Kellogg, an envoy for Trump, and Alexander Stubb, the President of Finland. Kellogg said that peace talks are in the "hardest last 10 yards," describing the situation as difficult but still hopeful.</p>
            <p>Because important international people attended, security was very tight. Reports about the summit could only be published after the attendees left Kyiv.</p>

            <h1>FAPA's Advocacy Conference to the US Congress has record attendance, including an Alaskan of Taiwanese descent.</h1>
            <p>The "Formosan Association for Public Affairs" (FAPA) held its yearly advocacy conference this weekend. They taught Taiwanese Americans how to tell their local lawmakers that Taiwan's future is closely connected to US national security and how to support laws that help Taiwan. This year, 112 people joined, which is a new record. An Alaskan of Taiwanese descent even flew across the US just to speak on Capitol Hill.</p>
            <p>FAPA's yearly Advocacy Conference started on September 13 in Washington D.C. For two days, attendees learned many rules for talking to Congress and practiced how to make the most of their time with lawmakers. Today, they officially went to Capitol Hill to meet with the offices of people like Republican Representative Young Kim and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen.</p>
            <p>The US Congress proposes many laws every year. One of FAPA's biggest challenges is to compete with other large lobbying groups. They need to politely explain the contributions of Taiwanese Americans in a very short time. FAPA President Amy Lin said that their most important job on this trip is to explain to the US Congress why Taiwan affects US national security.</p>
            <p>FAPA's CEO, Tiffany Hsiao, and policy researcher, George Tsai, explained yesterday how to write the first letter to a lawmaker, including how to make the subject line interesting. They advised people to research the lawmaker's background first and find topics they care about.</p>
            <p>They also told the Taiwanese Americans attending not to immediately ask for support for the US-Taiwan double taxation avoidance bill when they enter a lawmaker's office. Instead, they should start by sharing a personal story.</p>
            <p>Tiffany Hsiao, from Oregon, gave an example. When she met with her local lawmaker, she talked about an event in 2012 when China asked to remove a mural in her state. This made the lawmaker interested. The mural showed police beating Tibetan protesters, Buddhist monks setting themselves on fire to protest, and the lively freedom of her home country, Taiwan.</p>
            <p>George Tsai talked about things to avoid during advocacy, such as interrupting each other or correcting people on the spot. He also said to keep answers short. Since signing a bill usually needs internal discussion, people should not ask staff to promise to support a bill right away. At the same time, people should not be too afraid to speak up because of the lawmaker's presence, as members of Congress must listen to what their voters say.</p>
            <p>Ethan Chen is the first person from Alaska to attend FAPA's Advocacy Conference in many years. He told CNA that he is learning about advocacy at the national level. He added that Alaska's Senators Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan strongly support Taiwan. He is looking forward to meeting them in person in Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>Ethan Chen flew for almost 8 hours across the US to speak in Washington D.C. His reason was simple: "I care a lot about Taiwan, and I believe in Taiwan's right to decide its own future."</p>
            <p>FAPA was started in 1982 in Los Angeles, California, by a group of activists, academics, business people, and community organizers who cared about Taiwanese issues. They work to protect the human rights and other rights of Taiwanese people at home and abroad. Today, FAPA has over 40 local groups across the US and about 2,700 members.</p>
            <p>Local groups regularly meet with their local Senators and Representatives, building a strong base of support. FAPA staff in Washington D.C. visit Capitol Hill to make sure that issues about Taiwan receive a lot of attention and wide support in the US Congress. The US passed the "Taiwan Travel Act" in 2018, which made exchanges between Taiwan and the US more important. FAPA played a big part in this.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan drone companies are not on the US supplier list; experts suggest starting with Europe.</h1>
            <p>US export rules are complex, and there is a special list of approved suppliers for buying drones. However, Taiwanese companies are not on this list yet. Experts said today that Europe and Taiwan have quietly worked together on technology in recent years, and drones are a key area. They suggest that Taiwanese drone makers should first grow their business in the European market, then enter the US market.</p>
            <p>The "Global Taiwan Institute," a think tank in Washington D.C., held a meeting today titled "Taiwan's 'De-Sinicized' Drone Industry: Achievements and Ongoing Challenges." Matthew Fulco, business editor for "Aviation Week" magazine, and Lotta Danielsson, Vice President of the US-Taiwan Business Council, were among those who attended.</p>
            <p>Besides Taiwan not being on the approved supplier list, tariffs also make it uncertain for US-Taiwan drone cooperation. Matthew Fulco gave an example: the US temporarily changed the "equal tariff" rate for Taiwan to 20%. It is still unclear how this 20% tariff will apply to drone parts.</p>
            <p>He also listed reasons why Europe is interested in Taiwanese drones. First, Europe is worried about the safety of Chinese drones. Also, Taiwanese drones are more likely to meet the cybersecurity rules of the European Union (EU).</p>
            <p>Second, during former President Tsai Ing-wen's time in office, many European groups visited Taiwan. Both sides quietly continued to build technical cooperation, and drones slowly became a very important part of this.</p>
            <p>Matthew Fulco specifically named Poland as "a real chance for Taiwan's (drone industry)." In terms of world politics, Poland has been a very important place for moving supplies during the war in Ukraine. He thinks that the defense cooperation between these two countries makes Poland the biggest market for Taiwan's drone exports.</p>
            <p>Customs data shows that in the first half of this year, Taiwan's drone exports reached 11.89 million US dollars (about 350 million New Taiwan Dollars). This is a big increase of 749% compared to last year. The top 5 export markets were Poland, the US, Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong. Together, they made up 97% of the exports.</p>
            <p>Matthew Fulco said that Poland announced in July it would spend about 53 million US dollars of its defense budget on drone systems (UAS). This is also an opportunity for Taiwan's related industry.</p>
            <p>In addition, he said that Germany and the Czech Republic are both spending more on their military. They also care about defending Ukraine. A representative for Ukraine's rebuilding efforts in the Czech Republic mentioned that drone technology should be a main focus for cooperation between Taiwan and the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Matthew Fulco stated that the US is still Taiwan's most important partner for safety. American defense technology companies are very big and grow quickly. However, Europe is moving faster out of necessity because it faces the biggest war on its own land since World War II.</p>
            <p>Lotta Danielsson said that the US government's export control rules are very complicated, which is one challenge for US-Taiwan drone cooperation. The US has a list of approved companies for buying drones and other things. She knows that Taiwanese companies are not on this list.</p>
            <p>Lotta Danielsson told CNA reporters after the meeting that the list started only a few years ago. It has two colors, blue for government use and green for industry use, and the approval process is not clear.</p>
            <p>She also believes that the European market can help Taiwan's drone industry start small and grow. Once it gets bigger, it might be easier to enter the US market.</p>
            <p>Lotta Danielsson also mentioned problems inside Taiwan's drone industry that need to be solved. These include how to find skilled workers and what kind of support the government should give to Taiwanese companies that might face sanctions from China if they join the drone supply chain. As for geographical limits, Taiwan does not have enough space to test drones.</p>
