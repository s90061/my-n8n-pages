The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to greatly increase the use of co-packaged optics (CPO), which will benefit many chip and component suppliers, including Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). J.P. Morgan predicts that the CPO market will grow to $5 billion by 2028, driven by the increasing demand for faster and more efficient data centers. CPO technology combines optical and electrical components into a single package, reducing power consumption and improving performance, which is essential for the high demands of AI workloads.

**AMD, Palantir Soar as Tech Rebounds on Iran De-Escalation**

Shares of Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) saw significant increases on Monday, leading a broad recovery across the technology sector. This rebound occurred as investors moved past recent concerns about the Middle East, with signs of de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict. This suggests that the tech market is sensitive to geopolitical stability, and a calmer environment can boost investor confidence in growth-oriented companies.
