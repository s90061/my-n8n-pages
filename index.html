Oil prices went down a little today. This happened after investors thought about how much more oil a group of countries, OPEC+, might produce. Also, people were less worried that problems in the Middle East would stop oil from getting to the world. Oil prices had their biggest drop in two years last week.

In New York, the price for a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August went down by 41 cents, to $65.11.

In London, the price for a barrel of Brent crude oil for August went down by 16 cents, to $67.61.

**Trump to Discuss Tariffs, Set Rates for Some Countries by July 9**

Bloomberg News says that White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced today that U.S. President Trump will meet with his trade team this week. They will decide on new taxes, called tariffs, for countries that are "not negotiating in good faith" before July 9th.

Leavitt also said at a White House press conference that the U.S. is "finishing" a trade agreement with India.

Additionally, President Donald Trump seemed to say he might put new tariffs on Japan. This is because Japan does not want to buy rice from the U.S.

Trump wrote on his social media today: "They don't take our rice, and they have a big shortage of rice. We will send them a letter, and we hope to keep trading with them for many years."

Officials from the U.S. and Japan have been talking about trade for several months. But they haven't solved difficult issues about tariffs and trade barriers yet.

Japan has asked the U.S. to remove the 25% tariff on cars, saying it hurts their important car industry. But Trump is not sure about this request because Japan does not import many U.S.-made cars.

When reporters asked White House National Economic Advisor Kevin Hassett if Trump's post meant that U.S.-Japan trade talks were over, he said that both sides would still talk.

Hassett also said that the Trump government would announce trade agreements with several countries after July 4th, which is U.S. Independence Day.

**Alcaraz Wins Tough First Match at Wimbledon, Aims for Third Title**

Young Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz had a close call today. He won a tough five-set match against experienced Italian player Fabio Fognini. Alcaraz is trying to win the Wimbledon men's singles title for the third time in a row.

Agence France-Presse reported that Alcaraz, who is ranked world number 2 in men's singles, fought for over four hours on Wimbledon's Centre Court in hot weather. He won against 38-year-old Fognini with scores of 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1. This win allowed him to move on to the next round.

This is the first time a defending champion has had to play a five-set match in the first round of Wimbledon since Roger Federer in 2010, who narrowly won against Colombian player Alejandro Falla.

Alcaraz, sometimes called "Little Bull," played well at times and made mistakes at other times, including 62 unforced errors. But he didn't show signs of being tired.

In the second game of the final set, 22-year-old Alcaraz broke Fognini's serve at an important moment. He then saved two break points in the next game and shouted, "Come on!"

Fognini was a strong opponent and made Alcaraz work harder than expected. But Fognini, who is ranked 138th in men's singles, eventually got tired. Alcaraz showed his excellent skills in the final set again.

Alcaraz has played 18 first-round matches in major tournaments and has never lost. He beat Serbian star Novak Djokovic in the last two Wimbledon men's singles finals.

Alcaraz will play against British player Oliver Tarvet in the second round of this year's Wimbledon. He said it would be another difficult test.
