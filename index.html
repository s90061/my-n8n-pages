            <h1>Train Service Between Dawu and Longxi Restarts; Buses Help 1548 People</h1>
            <p>The train service between Dawu and Longxi stations started again at 8:02 PM. It had stopped at noon today because a lot of water was leaking inside the Da Niao tunnel, making it impossible for electric trains to run. Taiwan Railways fixed the problem. Buses helped 1548 people by making 36 trips.</p>
            <p>Today, the Da Niao tunnel on the South-Link Line had a lot of water leaking from its roof. This caused the power lines to short circuit and lose power. Because of this, electric trains could not run between Dawu and Longxi. Taiwan Railways quickly started using buses to carry passengers. They also sent diesel trains to pull other trains through the area without power, so trains could keep moving in the affected part.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways said this evening that by 7:40 PM, buses had made 17 trips from Fangliao Station, carrying 731 people. From Taimali Station, 15 trips carried 645 people. From Taitung Station, 4 trips carried 172 people. In total, 36 bus trips carried 1548 people.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways said that regular trains going in one direction, starting from train number 168, and trains going in the other direction, starting from train number 165, have now returned to normal service. They have asked staff at stations and on trains to make more announcements and help guide passengers.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Railways also said that if people bought tickets but could not use them because of this problem, they can get a refund within one year without paying a fee. If they have round-trip tickets, they can get refunds for both trips at the same time.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung Neboen Chorus Wins Gold in Tokyo, Despite Chinese Pressure Over Flag</h1>
            <p>A choir from Taiwan went to Japan for the Tokyo International Choral Competition. Suddenly, China complained and asked for Taiwan's flag to be taken down. Even though this made the choir feel bad before the competition, the Neboen Chorus from Kaohsiung performed as usual today. Good news came in the evening: the Neboen Chorus won a gold medal with a high score of 95.9.</p>
            <p>The 7th Tokyo International Choral Competition was held from July 25th to 27th. Today's folk music category had 8 teams. Three of these teams were from Taiwan: the Bugulafo Children's Art Group from Xingguo Elementary School in Kaohsiung City, Xina Balan Elementary School from Xinyi Township, Nantou County, and the Neboen Chorus. There were also two teams from China in the same group.</p>
            <p>After receiving the complaint yesterday, the organizers suddenly told the Taiwanese teams that the flag hanging in the Dai-ichi Seimei Hall had to be removed. Also, their name for the stage had to change from "Taiwan" to "Chinese Taipei."</p>
            <p>When Taiwan's office in Japan found out, they quickly talked with the choir and Legislator Chiu Yi-Ying, who was also in Japan. They continued talking with the organizers until the last moment before the competition this morning. Mr. Keiji Furuya, who leads the "Japan-Taiwan Parliamentary Group," also spoke up for Taiwan right away. However, the organizers still decided to change the name to "Chinese Taipei" on their own and to not hang any country's flag.</p>
            <p>Even after the flag incident, the Neboen Chorus still performed very well in the morning competition. Their final performance touched everyone in the audience. In the evening, good news arrived: the Neboen Chorus, which often wins big international competitions, got the gold medal with a score of 95.9. The team from Indonesia came in second with 94.8 points, and the team from the Philippines was third with 93.8 points.</p>
            <p>Chen Chun-Chih, the conductor of the Neboen Chorus, told CNA that the competition lasted three days. For the first two days, when they watched the competition, all Taiwanese teams were called "Taiwan," and flags of different countries were hanging next to the stage. But at noon on the second day of the competition, they suddenly received a letter from the organizers. It said that for the third day's competition, "all Taiwanese teams must be called Chinese Taipei, and our flag must be taken down." He said, "Even though they said they needed our agreement, we felt this was not right." So, they quickly asked Taiwan's office in Japan for help.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen said that if the organizers wanted to follow the Olympic rules and change the name to "Chinese Taipei," maybe they could accept it. "But we cannot accept our flag being taken down alone," he said. If one flag was taken down, then all flags should be taken down.</p>
            <p>He said that even though the children were upset, if both sides could agree, they still hoped the children could perform. This is because only by performing can Taiwan's culture be seen by everyone. This is Taiwan's "soft power." He said, "When our soft power is seen and recognized, it is more important than anything else." He was very thankful for everyone's help, which allowed the situation to end well.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen said that they actually thought about "if the flag was taken down alone, then we wouldn't compete." Luckily, in the end, all flags were removed. Before the competition, the children promised to do their best. He was deeply moved by their performance while he was conducting. After this perfect performance, he said, "We didn't hope for much, just the gold medal." And they got it.</p>
            <p>Legislator Chiu Yi-Ying, who went to Tokyo to cheer for the Neboen Chorus, also helped solve the problem during these two days. She was very happy that the team did well.</p>
            <p>She wrote on Facebook, "Children from Liugui, Kaohsiung, we are proud of you! Even though yesterday afternoon, because of pressure from China, the organizers took down our flag, and our name had to be changed to Chinese Taipei (even though we are clearly from Kaohsiung), because of the continuous efforts of our representative office, you stood on the stage. You showed everyone the skill of Neboen, and you showed everyone Taiwan! We just heard that we won the gold medal again, it is so touching! Children, thank you for healing me and bringing glory to Taiwan! Thank you!"</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's Average Temperature in 2024 Was 24.6 Degrees Celsius: Warmest on Record</h1>
            <p>The Weather Bureau says that Taiwan's average temperature last year was 24.6 degrees Celsius. This made it the warmest year ever. Taipei had the most days with high temperatures, reaching 63 days. The Weather Bureau explained that global warming is a long-term reason for these high temperatures, and the El NiÃ±o weather pattern also played a part.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau released its "2024 Climate Annual Report." It said that Taiwan's average temperature last year was 24.6 degrees Celsius. This is 0.7 degrees higher than the usual average of 23.9 degrees, making it the highest temperature ever recorded. All 22 weather stations across Taiwan reported temperatures higher than their usual averages. Also, all of them were among the top 10 warmest on record. Seven stations, including Hsinchu, Taichung, Sun Moon Lake, Tainan, Chenggong, Taitung, and Dawu, broke their own records for average temperature.</p>
            <p>Regarding very high temperatures, last year, the number of "high temperature days" (when the daily highest temperature was 35 degrees Celsius or more after rounding) was fewer than usual at only four stations: Pengjia Islet, Keelung, Hualien, and Hengchun. However, the other 18 stations had more or about the same number of high temperature days as usual. Taipei recorded 63 high temperature days, which was the most in Taiwan. This was 19.8 days more than its usual average.</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau explained that the number of high temperature days started to slowly increase after the middle of the 1970s. This increase became even clearer from the 2010s to 2020. Also, since the middle of the 1960s, the number of low temperature days has been slowly getting smaller.</p>
            <p>For rainfall, the total average rainfall last year was 2135.9 millimeters, which is similar to the usual average of 2161.1 millimeters. Looking closer at how Taiwan's total annual rainfall changes from year to year, the changes are quite big. There is no clear trend of more or less rain. But in the last 10 years, only two years (2016 and 2022) had more rain than usual, while the other 8 years had less.</p>
            <p>If we look at the number of rainy days, last year, the average number of rainy days was 127. This is 14.8 days less than the usual average of 141.7 days. It was the 7th lowest number of rainy days ever recorded in Taiwan's weather history. Looking closer at how the number of rainy days changes over the years, from the 1950s until now, Taiwan has seen a clear trend of fewer rainy days each year.</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau explained that Taiwan's average temperature last year broke the historical record, becoming the warmest year. The reasons for this include the long-term trend of global warming and also the El NiÃ±o weather pattern. Global warming is a long-term trend. Because greenhouse gases are still increasing every year, it is highly likely that temperatures will continue to rise.</p>
            <p>The Weather Bureau explained that with this background, the short-term warming effect caused by the El NiÃ±o phenomenon pushed global temperatures even higher. At the same time, it also made extreme weather events happen more often and with more power, from heatwaves and droughts to heavy rains and hurricanes. These events affected areas all over the world.</p>
            <p>Also, from December 2023 to February 2024 (winter), the monsoon system was weaker. This caused warmer temperatures and less rain in Taiwan during winter. Last summer (June to August), because of the strong subtropical high pressure system in the Pacific, places like the Indochina Peninsula, the South China Sea, Taiwan, and coastal areas of East Asia had less rain. Also, the average summer temperature along the entire East Asian coast was clearly higher.</p>
