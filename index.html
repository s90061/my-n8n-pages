            <h1>Asian Youth Baseball: Hu Guan-wei Pitches 5 Innings, 6 Strikeouts; Relief Pitcher's Fast Performance Stands Out</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's team lost their first game to South Korea in the Asian Youth Baseball Championship. Relief pitcher Hu Guan-wei was a highlight, giving up only 1 run and striking out 6 batters in 5 innings. His pitching speed kept getting faster, and his confident actions on the field created a good atmosphere. Head coach Chiu Yao-yu said that players often feel nervous in their first game, but he believes they will get better.</p>
            <p>The Asian Youth Baseball Championship started today at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. In their first game, Taiwan played against South Korea. Taiwan scored 3 runs in the bottom of the second inning and took the lead. But in the top of the third inning, after a new pitcher came in, South Korea hit many long balls and scored 4 runs, taking the lead. South Korea scored another run in the top of the fifth inning. Taiwan's team could not score more runs and lost the game 3 to 5.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team used three pitchers today: Ke Shao-jie, Lin Ya-lun, and Hu Guan-wei. TV broadcasts showed that Lin Ya-lun and Hu Guan-wei both threw pitches at 145 kilometers per hour. Hu Guan-wei pitched 5 innings in relief, giving up 4 hits, and striking out 6 batters. He gave up only 1 earned run. In the top of the sixth inning, he struck out three batters in a row. His performance was a highlight of the game.</p>
            <p>After the game, Taiwan's head coach Chiu Yao-yu was interviewed on TV. He said that playing at home today, the players seemed too nervous and could not play freely. Chiu Yao-yu also said that he had thought about letting Hu Guan-wei start as a pitcher, but Hu said he was a bit nervous. So, they let Ke Shao-jie start, but Ke also seemed nervous when he played.</p>
            <p>Chiu Yao-yu talked about his choices for changing pitchers. He said that after Taiwan was leading by 3 runs in the second inning, they brought in Lin Ya-lun, a fast pitcher. They hoped his speed would stop the other team from scoring. But the players were too nervous. In a game where winning or losing is important, everyone felt a lot of pressure. The coaches on the side kept encouraging the players.</p>
            <p>Regarding getting used to the baseball field and the lights at night, Chiu Yao-yu said that playing at night was normal for them. The main thing was how they performed during the game. He said that today's game was actually good, and he believes they will play better after this game.</p>

            <h1>Israel Pushes Gaza City Residents South; Hamas Condemns it as 'Open Deception'</h1>
            <p>The Palestinian group Hamas said today that Israel's plan to move people from Gaza City to the south will be a "new wave of harming people" and will make them homeless. This information comes from Cairo and other places.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hamas said Israel's claim that they will set up tents and other shelters in the southern Gaza Strip is "open deception."</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said on August 16 that they are getting ready to give tents and other things to people in Gaza. They will move people from the war area to the southern part of Gaza to "keep them safe."</p>
            <p>Hamas put out a statement saying that setting up tents under the name of helping people is clearly a lie. They said it is meant to "hide the bad things the occupying army is about to do."</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said in early August that they plan to start a new attack to take control of Gaza City, which is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip.</p>

            <h1>Guitar Maestro Huang Chung-yueh as Music Director Gives Accusefive Confidence</h1>
            <p>The band Accusefive started their tour in Yilan, their hometown. On August 16th and 17th, they played in Taipei. About 4000 fans came to their two concerts. Accusefive shared that they invited "Guitar Maestro" Huang Chung-yueh to be their music director this time. The intense training made Accusefive feel very confident, like they had eaten a calming pill.</p>
            <p>Accusefive played two concerts in a row at Taipei Legacy TERA on August 16th and 17th. According to a press release, Yun-an was a little out of breath during the first talking part. Quan-ching joked, "Are you out of breath after only three songs?" Yun-an quickly explained that he can keep going for a long time. Zhe-qian jokingly added, "He can last for three hours!" Accusefive loves their fans, so they let fans ask for songs. Fans used different ways to get Accusefive to choose their song.</p>
            <p>For this Accusefive Live House world tour, they strongly invited Huang Chung-yueh to be the music director. The band members said that the intense practice before the tour felt like "summer special training." Zhe-qian said, "This is the most serious practice I have ever had!"</p>
            <p>Accusefive said, "The main point of this practice was not to think about how great we are, but to think about how to play and express the band's songs. Mr. Huang Chung-yueh is like a 'calming pill.' When he is there, we are more careful to change our daily routines and attitudes. We also work hard to get even better."</p>
            <p>Accusefive will play in Taichung Legacy Taichung on August 30th and 31st. They will also play in Kaohsiung LIVE WAREHOUSE on September 6th and 7th. After that, they will continue their tour to other cities like Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Wuhan, spreading their rock music charm.</p>
