Tesla announced that it delivered a record 466,140 vehicles in the second quarter of 2023. This is a significant increase from the previous year and reflects strong demand for electric vehicles. However, the numbers fell slightly short of analysts' expectations, which had predicted closer to 470,000 deliveries. The company has been aggressively cutting prices to boost sales, which has raised concerns about profit margins. Despite the mixed results, Tesla remains the dominant player in the electric vehicle market, and investors are closely watching its performance in a rapidly evolving industry. The focus now shifts to the company's earnings call, where executives will discuss production plans and strategies for maintaining profitability amid increasing competition.

Tesla achieved a new high in vehicle deliveries during the second quarter of 2023, selling 466,140 cars. This shows that more and more people want electric vehicles. Even though this is a big improvement compared to last year, it wasn't quite as high as experts thought it would be. They had predicted around 470,000 sales. To sell more cars, Tesla has been lowering prices, but this has led to worries about how much profit they are making on each car. Despite these concerns, Tesla is still the most important company in the electric vehicle business. Investors are paying close attention to how well the company is doing as the industry changes quickly. People are now waiting for Tesla's next financial report, where the company's leaders will talk about their plans for production and how they plan to stay profitable even with more competition.

**Article 2: Innovation - New AI Model Can Generate Realistic 3D Models from Text Prompts**

Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence model that can create realistic 3D models based on text descriptions. This technology represents a significant leap forward in AI-powered design and could have wide-ranging applications in fields such as gaming, animation, and product development. Users can simply type in a description, such as "a red sports car" or "a medieval castle," and the AI will generate a detailed 3D model that matches the description. The system uses advanced machine learning techniques to understand the nuances of language and translate them into complex geometric shapes and textures. This innovation promises to democratize 3D design, making it accessible to individuals without specialized training.

Scientists have created a new AI program that can make realistic 3D models just from written descriptions. This is a big step forward in using AI for design. It could be used in many areas, like making video games, cartoons, and new products. Users can simply type what they want, for example, "a red sports car" or "an old castle," and the AI will create a detailed 3D model that looks like the description. The program uses advanced computer learning methods to understand the details of the words and turn them into complex shapes and textures. This new technology could make 3D design easier for everyone, even if they don't have special training.
