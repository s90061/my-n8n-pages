            <p>The K-pop girl group BLACKPINK will hold their world tour concerts on October 18th and 19th at the Kaohsiung National Stadium. The Transport Bureau announced today that a section of Wunshyun Boulevard will be closed for traffic from 8 AM to 12 AM on those days. Also, there will be more MRT and Taiwan Railways trains, and free shuttle bus services.</p>
            <p>The BLACKPINK world tour "DEADLINE" will be in Kaohsiung on October 18th and 19th at the Kaohsiung National Stadium. The Kaohsiung City Transport Bureau released information about transport today.</p>
            <p>The Transport Bureau said in a press release that Wunshyun Boulevard will be completely closed from 8 AM to 12 AM on October 18th and 19th. Only emergency vehicles, official vehicles, and shuttle buses can enter this area. Other cars and motorcycles cannot enter or park there. They will also remove illegally parked cars on nearby roads.</p>
            <p>The Transport Bureau expects heavy traffic on Zuonan Road, Cuihua Road, Junxiao Road, and National Highway No. 10. They suggest that people going north or south use Minzu Road, Boai Road, or HSR Road instead. For those going east or west, they should use Jiachang Road, Xinzhuang 1st Road, or Shuiguan Road.</p>
            <p>People who need to drop off or pick up others can use the parking areas at MRT stations further away. You can take the MRT to R17 World Games Station and then walk 5 to 8 minutes to reach the concert venue. For leaving the concert, the Kaohsiung MRT Company has planned to increase MRT services. Trains will come every 3 to 5 minutes to keep people moving smoothly.</p>
            <p>Also, there will be free shuttle buses at the concert venue. From 2:30 PM to 6:30 PM, buses will take people from Zuoying High-Speed Rail Station and Xin Zuoying Taiwan Railways Station to the concert. From 9:30 PM to 11:30 PM, buses will take people from the concert venue back to Zuoying High-Speed Rail Station and Xin Zuoying Taiwan Railways Station.</p>

These parking areas will be open from 8 AM to 11 PM on October 18th and 19th. Fans who ride motorcycles should use these areas and leave on time.</p>
            <p>The Transport Bureau said that, as usual, there will be no parking spaces for cars at the venue. They ask people not to drive to avoid wasting time looking for parking.

            <h1>Good Bacteria Help Vegetables Survive Drought and Floods, Increasing Survival by Up to 50%</h1>
            <p>The Taichung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station of the Ministry of Agriculture has found four good types of bacteria. Tests in fields show that these bacteria can help vegetables grow even when there is too much water, not enough water, or high temperatures. Compared to before, vegetables can survive 20% to 50% more often, and they even taste better.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taichung Agricultural Research and Extension Station held a press conference at the Ministry of Agriculture. The head of the station, Yang Hong-ying, said that when natural disasters like typhoons, heavy rain, high temperatures, or droughts happen, the amount and quality of crops are affected. This also causes prices in the market to change.</p>
            <p>Yang Hong-ying explained that the Taichung Agricultural Research and Extension Station continues to work on finding new types of crops and ways to grow them that can handle difficult conditions. International studies show that using tiny living things (microbes) can help crops become stronger against tough environments. Since 2021, the station has worked with National Chung Hsing University and the Agricultural Technology Research Institute to create a "Platform for Screening Weather-Resistant Microbe Mechanisms." They have already found four promising weather-resistant microbes.</p>
            <p>Guo Jian-zhi, an assistant researcher at the Taichung Agricultural Research and Extension Station, explained that these four microbes include: Trichoderma, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Streptomyces. Field tests showed that the survival rate of loose-leaf Chinese cabbage after floods and droughts could increase by 20% to 50%. Also, these microbes reduced calcium deficiency browning in heading Chinese cabbage by 30% during hot summers. Vegetables grown with these special microbes also tasted better.</p>
            <p>Yang Hong-ying said that being strong and working in a way that can continue for a long time are important goals for the Ministry of Agriculture. Developing products from weather-resistant microbes is a key way to deal with climate challenges and keep farm production steady. Out of the four important weather-resistant microbes, three are already being sold, and one has been given permission for use through a special agreement.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan Airport Holds Food Festival: Vote for Your Favorite Airport Food</h1>
            <p>Taoyuan Airport Corporation said today that from January to September, Taoyuan Airport had 35.22 million passengers in total. This is 5.24% more than the same time last year. To make food and service better, the airport is holding a food festival. Travelers can vote for their favorite airport food.</p>
            <p>Today, the airport company held a press conference for the "2025 Taoyuan International Airport Food Festival" at Terminal 2. At the event, five dancers performed with popular airport foods like fried chicken, ramen, egg cakes, pineapple cakes, and bubble tea to make the atmosphere lively. Zhuangzhuang, a popular cheerleader, was also the event's ambassador. Yang Wei-fu, the chairman of Taoyuan International Airport Corporation, even put on a chef's apron to announce the start of the yearly "Golden Feast Award" voting event.</p>
            <p>Yang Wei-fu told reporters that because more people are traveling internationally by plane, the total number of passengers at Taoyuan Airport has increased. From January to September 2025, the airport had 35.22 million passengers, which is 5.24% more than the same period last year. The airport company will work hard to improve its food and service in the future. They want Taoyuan Airport to be a warm start and end to every trip. Recently, a British travel service company (APH) also named Taoyuan Airport the most friendly airport in the world.</p>
            <p>Yang Wei-fu said that Taoyuan Airport has always tried to promote Taiwanese food. Currently, there are nearly 80 stalls selling Taiwanese food and gifts inside the airport. Through this event, they hope that travelers can use Google Maps to vote for their favorite food. Taiwanese food has shown great strength in past evaluations over the years. This event also aims to make delicious foods from all over Taiwan known worldwide.</p>
            <p>The airport company said that from now until December 15th, travelers can leave reviews and ratings on Google Maps. They can choose their favorite airport food from nearly 80 restaurants and gift shops. During the event, airport restaurants will offer many special deals. If you spend over NT$300 at airport gift shops, you can also get a special limited gift while supplies last.</p>
