            <h1>Chinese Hackers Pretend to be US Lawmakers to Get Information on Trade Talks</h1>
            <p>People who know about the situation said that before the trade talks between the US and China in July, Chinese hackers seemed to pretend to be the head of the US-China Strategic Competition Select Committee. They sent emails asking for opinions on sanctions against China. They used this chance to put spy software on the computers of organizations that gave advice. This is the latest example of China's spying.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that staff members of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party, several trade groups, law firms, and government offices received emails. These emails looked like they were from Representative John Moolenaar, a Republican from Michigan and the committee's chairman. The emails asked the receivers to share their thoughts on new sanctions against Beijing.</p>
            <p>Sources said the emails said, "Your insights are very important," and asked people to look at a draft law in an attachment. But the emails were sent from an address that was not an official government one, which made them suspicious.</p>
            <p>According to the report, this is the newest example of China's online spying efforts. It might have been meant to put spy software on the computers of groups that advised the Trump team on trade talks.</p>
            <p>The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US Capitol Police (USCP) are looking into these emails, which pretended to be from Moolenaar. Cybersecurity experts found that the hacker group APT41 put harmful software in the emails. Many people believe APT41 works for China's Ministry of State Security.</p>
            <p>A few days after the fake emails were sent, US and Chinese officials had their third round of trade talks in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, at the end of July. After that, the two countries agreed to make their break from tariffs last longer, until early November. At that time, Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.</p>
            <p>This hacking attack was meant to let high-level Chinese officials see the advice Trump was getting from outside groups. It is not clear yet if the hackers successfully got into any of their targets.</p>
            <p>An FBI spokesperson did not want to share details. They said the FBI knows about it and is "working with partners to identify the people responsible." The US Capitol Police did not comment.</p>
            <p>Moolenaar said in a statement that this event shows again how Beijing tries to steal and use US strategies through cyberattacks. He added, "We will not be scared by this."</p>
            <p>Chinese officials said the accusations were not true. They said these claims are just Washington's way of making people look away from its own strong actions. The Chinese Embassy in the US said that China strongly opposes and fights against cyberattacks. It also said it is "strongly against making bad claims about others without clear proof."</p>
            <p>According to the report, this hacking happened when US law enforcement officers were surprised by how many different and bold cyberattacks China was doing. Last month, the FBI said that spy activities linked to Beijing were not only targeting US phone companies and stealing Trump's call records, but also targeting people in more than 80 countries around the world.</p>
            <p>China tried to use Moolenaar as a trick, which made the committee staff very angry. This is because Moolenaar has often strongly criticized Beijing. In January, he said that China's leaders "see the US as an enemy they must harm, not a partner."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal said that the cybersecurity company Mandiant believes that if people opened the attached file that looked like a draft law, the hackers could use the spy software in the email to get deep inside the target organizations.</p>

            <h1>South Korean Government Changes, Splits Power of Prosecutors and Finance Department</h1>
            <p>The South Korean government announced today that it will change how the government is organized. It will get rid of the Prosecutor's Office and split the powers of prosecutors to charge and investigate crimes into two different groups. The Ministry of Economy and Finance will also be split into a Budget Office and a Ministry of Finance and Economy. These changes will start one year after they are officially approved and announced.</p>
            <p>The South Korean government today announced its first changes since President Lee Jae-myung took office. These changes will separate the responsibilities of the Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, which were thought to have too much power in one place.</p>
            <p>The new plan will get rid of the Prosecutor's Office. Instead, a Public Prosecution Office and a Major Crime Investigation Office will be created. These two new offices will take over the powers of prosecutors to charge and investigate crimes. The Public Prosecution Office will be part of the Ministry of Justice, and the Major Crime Investigation Office will be part of the Ministry of Interior and Safety.</p>
            <p>To do this, the Office of the Prime Minister will set up a "Government-wide Prosecutorial System Reform Promotion Group." This group will work closely with the ruling party, the government, and the President's office to create detailed plans.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economy and Finance will also be split into a Planning and Budget Office and a Ministry of Finance and Economy. The Planning and Budget Office will be new and under the Prime Minister. It will be in charge of managing how the budget is made and how money is spent. The old Ministry of Economy and Finance will be renamed the Ministry of Finance and Economy. It will be in charge of economic policy, taxes, and national finances. The Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs will also be the head of the Ministry of Finance and Economy.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Financial Services Commission's jobs related to finance, like analyzing financial information, will move to the Ministry of Finance and Economy. The Financial Services Commission will change to focus mainly on overseeing financial activities.</p>
            <p>Also, the Ministry of Environment will take over the energy policy work from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy. It will be renamed the Ministry of Climate, Energy, and Environment. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, which will no longer handle energy matters, will be renamed the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family will change to the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family and will create a new office for gender equality policies.</p>
            <p>Regarding the Deputy Prime Minister positions, to keep up with industry trends, the new plan will get rid of the Deputy Prime Minister for Social Affairs. Instead, there will be a new Deputy Prime Minister for Science and Technology. The Ministry of Science and ICT will also create a new unit specifically for artificial intelligence matters.</p>

            <h1>Heavy Rain in Taichung Causes River to Flood Bridge, Couple Stuck for 1 Hour</h1>
            <p>Heavy rain fell in Taichung City this evening. The Toubiankeng River in Taiping District flooded quickly. A couple was stuck because the water covered the bridge, so they could not cross. Emergency services were called to help. After the river water went down a bit, they helped the two people get out. The couple was stuck for 1 hour, and then the police drove them home.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Fire Department received a call at 6:11 PM. People were stuck because of heavy rain in Nangguo Lane, Section 2, Changlong Road, Taiping District. The local fire department sent 8 fire trucks, 1 ambulance, 2 boats, and 14 firefighters to help.</p>
            <p>When the firefighters arrived, they found two people who were on their way down the mountain. They were stuck because the river water rose quickly due to the heavy rain, and the bridge was covered in water. They stayed in a safer spot for a while. The firefighters waited for the river water to go down a little. Then, they walked through the water to reach the two stuck people. They helped them put on life jackets and then led them across the bridge to a safe part of the road down the mountain.</p>
            <p>The Taiping Police Precinct and firefighters were there. They learned that Mr. and Mrs. Xie were working on the mountain. Later, because of the heavy rain, the river flooded, and they could not cross the bridge, so they got stuck. After the couple was rescued, police officers took them to the police station to rest. Because their vehicle was still on the mountain, police officers drove them home.</p>
