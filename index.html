            <h1>Chang Chao-Yuan Hits Two Home Runs, Gets Four RBIs, and Is Named MVP; Hawks and Monkeys Game Ends in a Tie Because of Rain</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Hsieh Ching-Wen, Taoyuan, July 27) The Rakuten Monkeys and TSG Hawks baseball teams played a game today in Taiwan's professional baseball league. The game was tied many times. After the top of the ninth inning, the game was stopped due to rain. The score was 7-7, and it was called a tie. Hawks catcher Chang Chao-Yuan hit two home runs in one game for the first time in his career. He also brought in four runs for his team. Because of this, he was chosen as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) for the game.</p>
            <p>The Hawks played against the Monkeys at Rakuten Taoyuan Baseball Stadium. In the first part of the first inning, the Hawks scored first. Steven Moya hit the ball well and helped them score. In the bottom of the first inning, Lin Chih-Ping from the Monkeys hit the ball well and made the score equal. In the bottom of the third inning, Chen Chen-Wei from the Monkeys hit a double first. Then, Lin Chih-Ping hit a single, which helped his team score a run and take the lead. In the top of the fourth inning, Chang Chao-Yuan from the Hawks hit a home run by himself, and the score became a tie again.</p>
            <p>In the bottom of the fourth inning, the Monkeys noticed that the Hawks' pitchers were having problems. The Monkeys got players on all bases by getting walks and hits. Lin Tzu-Wei got a walk when all bases were full, which pushed a runner home and gave the Monkeys the lead again. Lin Chih-Ping then hit a fly ball that let another run score. Lin Hung-Yu hit a single that brought in a run. Liang Chia-Jung added another hit, which brought in the team's sixth run.</p>
            <p>In the top of the fifth inning, the Hawks tried to catch up. Wang Po-Jung hit a good single and scored one run. Then, Chang Chao-Yuan hit his second home run of the game, a three-run home run, which made the score tied again. In the top of the seventh inning, the Hawks took the lead with a hit from Tseng Yu-Ching. In the bottom of the eighth inning, Liang Chia-Jung from the Monkeys hit a fly ball that tied the game again. The game was then stopped after the top of the ninth inning because of rain, and it was called a tie.</p>
            <p>Chang Chao-Yuan had three hits in the game, including two home runs, and brought in four runs. He has hit three home runs in his last two games. Chang Chao-Yuan said that his body felt good recently. He hit a home run yesterday against Monkeys pitcher Chen Kuan-Yu because the ball was in a good place for him to hit. For the two home runs he hit today against pitcher Huang Tzu-Peng, he also had a good plan and timing. He was able to hit the balls that the pitcher did not throw well.</p>
            <p>When asked if he plays especially well at Taoyuan Baseball Stadium, Chang Chao-Yuan said that maybe the LED lights in Taoyuan are brighter, so he can see the ball better. He also said that the Monkeys are a tough team to play against. He believes that leading in the game before it ends does not really count as a lead, because the other team will take any small chance they get.</p>
            <p>The Hawks' starting pitcher, Huang Tzu-Hao, pitched for three innings and gave up four runs. He did not win or lose the game. Chang Chao-Yuan said that the rain made the ground on the pitcher's mound sticky, so Huang Tzu-Hao's shoes kept getting stuck. Also, there were many fans, so he might have been a little nervous. His ball control was not as good as usual. Otherwise, he is a pitcher who usually has good control. (Editor: Li Ming-Tsung) July 27, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Poland's Prime Minister Warns: Russia and China Could Be Ready for a World Conflict by 2027</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Warsaw, July 27, combined foreign reports) Poland's Prime Minister, Donald Tusk, met with a high-ranking general from NATO. After their meeting, he said that Russia and China might be ready for a global conflict as early as 2027. Because of this, Poland and other European countries also need to get ready for "all kinds of situations" that might happen in the next two years.</p>
            <p>The Kyiv Post reported that Prime Minister Donald Tusk made these comments shortly after his meeting in Warsaw on July 25. He met with General Alexus Grynkewich, a US Air Force General who is the leader of Allied Command Operations in Europe for NATO.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, when Prime Minister Tusk visited Pabianice, a city in central Poland, he said: "I expected to get exact information (from General Grynkewich), and I did. This means that, based on all the reports from NATO and the United States, Russia and China will be ready for a global conflict as early as 2027, which is within two years."</p>
            <p>He pointed out: "Poland and Europe, especially Poland, must prepare for all kinds of situations that might happen in the next two years."</p>
            <p>European countries are now spending much more money on their armies. This happened after the United States asked Europe to take more responsibility for its own safety. Poland and other countries on the eastern side of NATO were leading this effort.</p>
            <p>The government in Warsaw has also started doing things to help its people get ready for a possible large-scale conflict. For example, they have made military training available to more people, which has been widely talked about. They have also created guides to help people survive if there is a war.</p>
            <p>However, governments are worried about more than just a regular war starting.</p>
            <p>After Russia fully attacked Ukraine, Poland and its neighboring countries have been targets of Russia's "hybrid warfare." This includes things like damaging property, hacking computers, and spreading false information. These events are often serious, but they are not as big as a full war.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the clearest example of this is the problem at the eastern border of the European Union. This border is next to Russia and its ally, Belarus. Russia and Belarus are accused of making the problem worse on purpose. They have been directing migrants from Africa and Asia to the land borders of Poland and the Baltic countries.</p>
            <p>When Prime Minister Tusk spoke in Pabianice, he talked about the situation at Poland's eastern border. He said this situation shows that Russia is getting ready for a possible global conflict in 2027.</p>
            <p>General Grynkewich has warned many times that 2027 could be a year of crisis, with possible conflicts involving Russia and China. He visited Warsaw on July 25 to meet with Prime Minister Tusk and other important government officials. (Translator: Hung Pei-Ying / Editor: Chen Cheng-Chien) July 27, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese Banks Compete for Business from Billionaires; Managed Assets Reach NT$1.6 Trillion by End of June</h1>
            <p>(CNA reporter Su Szu-Yun, Taipei, July 27) Banks are actively trying to get business from very rich clients. Data from the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) shows that by the end of June, 15 Taiwanese banks were managing assets worth over NT$100 million for their rich clients. The total amount of these assets reached NT$1.6233 trillion, which is an increase of NT$60.3 billion from the previous month. Among these banks, First Bank managed NT$242.7 billion in assets. This means First Bank has been the top bank for managing assets for rich clients for nine months in a row.</p>
            <p>In August 2020, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) launched a plan called "Wealth Management 2.0." This plan aimed to make Taiwan's wealth management services as good as those in Singapore and Hong Kong. It allowed banks to apply to offer services to very rich clients who have more than NT$100 million in assets. By the end of June this year, 15 banks had started offering these services. These banks include CTBC Bank, Mega Bank, Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank, Cathay United Bank, First Bank, Land Bank of Taiwan, UBS Taipei Branch, E.SUN Bank, Taipei Fubon Bank, Yuanta Bank, Hua Nan Bank, HSBC (Taiwan), Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan), Taishin Bank, and DBS Bank.</p>
            <p>By the end of June, the 15 Taiwanese banks were managing NT$1.6223 trillion for their richest clients. This was a big decrease of NT$10.9 billion in May, but then it grew a lot in June by NT$60.3 billion. The number of rich clients also grew to 15,035 people, which is 609 more than the month before.</p>
            <p>Looking at how rich clients' assets were held by the end of June, Hou Li-Yang, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Banking Bureau, said that most of the money was in deposits (47.4%). After that, money was in funds (15.7%), bonds (13%), insurance (11%), and overseas structured products (6.2%).</p>
            <p>The percentage of money in deposits, at 47.4%, is the highest it has been this year. This is mainly because people in the market are being careful and waiting to see what happens. Hou Li-Yang pointed out that compared to the end of June last year, the percentage of money in bonds and funds has gone up. This might be because people in the market think that interest rates will keep going down. So, they are putting more money into things that offer a fixed return, like overseas bonds, to get higher interest.</p>
            <p>For the top three banks in managing assets for rich clients, they are First Bank, CTBC Bank, and E.SUN Bank. E.SUN Bank is a new bank to be in the top three. First Bank managed NT$242.7 billion for its rich clients and has been the top bank for nine months. It has 2,465 rich clients. CTBC Bank managed NT$239.2 billion for its rich clients and has 2,299 rich clients. E.SUN Bank is in third place, managing NT$225.3 billion, and has 2,586 rich clients.</p>
            <p>In addition, for the stock market part, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has approved 8 stock companies to offer services to rich clients. Since these services started in 2020, the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau announced that by the end of June, 1,268 rich clients had used these services. The total money traded by these clients was about NT$331.5 billion. This is 59% more than the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Kao Ching-Ping, the Deputy Director-General of the FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau, explained that stock companies have been actively trying to get rich clients. Also, the world's stock markets have been doing well, which has made people feel positive. Because of this, the amount of money traded through foreign brokerage services has grown a lot compared to last year. In the last year, about NT$18.2 billion was used to buy and sell foreign bonds through these services.</p>
            <p>Looking at how each stock company performed, the top three rankings are the same as in May. They are Sinopac Securities, Cathay Securities, and Mega Securities. Since they started offering these services until the end of June, the total money traded by clients with these companies was NT$167.7 billion, NT$82.4 billion, and NT$36.5 billion, respectively. The other five stock companies together managed NT$44.9 billion. (Editor: Yang Kai-Hsiang) July 27, 2025.</p>
