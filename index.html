            <h1>Taichung Soldier Becomes Scam Group's Money Collector, Charged in Court</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old soldier named Wu worked in the army. He earned a good salary of NT$50,000 each month. But he wanted more money. So, he became a "money collector" for a scam group. He was caught and put in jail. Now, he has been charged with serious fraud and other crimes. Mr. Wu might even lose his job in the army.</p>
            <p>The police in Daya, Taichung, shared this news today. They recently got a report about a fake investment scam. A 40-year-old man, Mr. Zhang, joined an investment group on LINE called "Wealth Plan" through Facebook. The scam group's helpers told him he would "always make money" if he bought gold. Mr. Zhang saw high profits on a fake website. So, he put in a total of NT$1.8 million by sending money or paying in person. When Mr. Zhang wanted to get his NT$28.78 million profit, the scam group asked for a "10% donation." That's when he knew it was a scam.</p>
            <p>The police worked with Mr. Zhang to catch Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu came to collect the money. The police found out that Mr. Wu is a soldier with a steady NT$50,000 monthly pay and a promising army career. But he wanted to earn extra money. He looked for "easy jobs" online. Then, he followed the scam group's orders. He signed fake contracts and collected money from different people.</p>
            <p>On the day he was caught, a court in Taichung decided to keep Mr. Wu in jail. The prosecutor's office in Taichung charged him with breaking laws about organized crime, serious fraud, and money laundering. They also asked for a 50% longer sentence because of the law on preventing fraud crimes. The court is still looking at his case. Mr. Wu might be removed from the army. This means he will lose a lot more than he gained.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan to Charge for Demolishing Illegal Buildings, Aims for Fair Costs</h1>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Government has passed a new rule. This rule is about charging people when the city has to force the demolition of illegal buildings. This rule will now go to the city council for approval. If the council agrees, the city can ask the owner of an illegal building to pay for the costs of tearing it down. This will create a fairer system for everyone.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Department of Building Management announced this morning that the "Building Act" already says that building owners must pay for forced demolitions. The city tried to propose a similar rule in 2019, but it was not approved because it wasn't complete enough. This time, they have updated the rule. They used their experience, new national laws, and looked at how Taipei City and New Taipei City handle similar situations. They changed and improved the details of the rule.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhuang Jing-quan, the head of the Building Management Department, said that the city currently pays for forced demolitions. This costs a lot of public money. Also, it does not stop people enough from building illegally. The new rule clearly states how much to charge, how to do it, and how to protect people's rights. This will make the demolition work more official and legal. In the future, the cost will change based on the building materials. It will be from NT$200 to NT$1700 for every square meter. They hope this will stop people who build illegally and think they can get away with it.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhuang Jing-quan said that if this rule is approved, the city will first focus on tearing down "large illegal buildings under construction" and "illegal buildings that are dangerous to public safety." They will then collect the demolition fees as the rule says. This shows that the city wants land to be used correctly and public safety to be the most important thing.</p>

            <p>The Taiwanese team played their last game in the Super Round against South Korea yesterday in the U12 Baseball World Cup.
