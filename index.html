            <h1>Dingxin, Youshang, and Weisheng Work Together to Build AI Smart Factories</h1>
            <p>Dingxin, Youshang, and Weisheng companies are working together to create new manufacturing systems. They showed their new ideas at the 2025 Taipei International Automation Industrial Exhibition. Their goal is to help smart factories change and improve. They are building "AI autonomous smart factories" and want to help companies create teams that work with AI. This will help businesses move to a new level of operations.</p>
            <p>Dingxin said that in the past, manufacturing companies used different suppliers for their IT (information technology) and OT (operational technology) systems. Also, each factory had different ways of producing things and different types of machines. This made it hard and expensive to combine all the systems. Now, AI technology is much better. AI Agents can understand IT rules and also what is happening on the factory floor. They can also start tasks on their own. Because of this trend, Dingxin, Youshang, and Weisheng are working together. They are offering a new "ITÃ—OT+AI Agent" smart manufacturing solution that is not common in the market.</p>
            <p>Dingxin explained that they showed how their system handles "urgent orders." The system needs to consider many things, like customs costs, customer delivery times, and low-carbon rules. The AI Agent can suggest the best ways to take orders and produce goods. It uses information like the customer's credit history, past orders, machine performance, material stock, and how many workers are available. It also starts tasks like making schedules, buying materials, and changing machine settings. This helps companies in the future to work in two main ways: quick tasks are decided by data and happen right away; for slower tasks, a large AI model combines knowledge and experience to give people the best advice.</p>
            <p>Dingxin stated that their "multi-agent operating platform" acts like a smart brain for the factory. It connects IT data (like ERP and MES systems) with OT data (like sensors, AMR robots, and drying machines). It also works with Youshang's automatic transport and MCS systems, and Weisheng's energy-saving drying machines that have an AIMS AI management system. This allows Edge AI to quickly combine different types of information, find the best solutions, and start tasks across different systems.</p>
            <p>Dingxin also said that this technical cooperation between the three companies makes sure information flows smoothly between machines and that tasks are scheduled automatically. It also brings smart decision-making to the factory floor. This creates "AI autonomous smart factories" and helps companies build AI teamwork. It helps them move faster to a new stage of operations where they can make their own decisions, work efficiently, and stay competitive for a long time.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of National Defense Holds Concert, Minister Gu Lixiong Gives Badges to Old Soldiers</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense held a concert today to remember the 80th anniversary of World War II and the victory in the Anti-Japanese War. Famous artists like Nine One One and Keril Wujie performed. The Minister of National Defense, Gu Lixiong, attended the concert. He gave special badges to two old soldiers who fought in the Anti-Japanese War. The badges celebrate the "80th Anniversary of World War II and the Victory in the Anti-Japanese War."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense held the concert tonight at the Taipei International Convention Center. The concert's theme was "Memory becomes Mission." It featured classic songs from different time periods, with dancers and live music. Lights and animated videos were also used to create an immersive experience for the audience. This mixed historical memories with today's tasks. Minister Gu Lixiong went to the event with his wife, Wang Meihua.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense specially invited two retired soldiers who fought in the Anti-Japanese War, Zhang Zuomin and Zhang Yingnan, to the concert. When the host introduced the two old soldiers, everyone in the audience cheered and clapped. Minister Gu Lixiong then walked to their seats and gave them the special badges that the Ministry of National Defense designed this year. The old soldiers saluted Minister Gu Lixiong, and the atmosphere in the hall was very moving.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense said that by giving the "80th Anniversary of World War II and the Victory in the Anti-Japanese War" badges to Zhang Zuomin and Zhang Yingnan, they want to show respect for their brave actions. They also want to spread the spirit of fighting against the war and believing in protecting the Republic of China. This also helps to fight against China's attempts to change history and control the story of the war. It makes sure that the Republic of China is known as the true inheritor of the Anti-Japanese War history.</p>
            <p>The concert included the band Nine One One, who sang exciting songs like "Ga Le A Le" and "The World Sees It." Their songs helped the audience feel the strong friendship among soldiers in battle. At the end of the show, the National Defense University's Political Warfare and Management College Choir, along with the Taipei Philharmonic Youth and Children's Choir, sang military songs and encouraging songs for the armed forces. This showed that the armed forces continue their traditions and are ready to take on their duties.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of National Defense hopes that this concert will help people remember the Anti-Japanese War. They want the brave spirit of the heroes to stay in everyone's hearts and be passed down through generations. They want the spirit of "protecting the Republic of China," "soldiers and people working together against the enemy," "youth standing up to defend the country," and "allies fighting together" to become deeply rooted in people's minds. While remembering this brave history, they also thanked every hero who worked for peace. They took on the important job of protecting the country and turned yesterday's war memories into today's mission to protect the nation.</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian Man Arrested in Italy, Suspected in Nord Stream Pipeline Explosion</h1>
            <p>Prosecutors in Germany said today that a Ukrainian man was arrested in Italy. He is thought to be involved in the 2022 explosion that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines. These pipelines carry natural gas from Russia to Europe.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, German prosecutors said that a group of people put explosives on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines. A man named Serhii K. is accused of being one of them. He is believed to have helped plan the attack.</p>
            <p>The Nord Stream pipelines connect Russia to Germany through the Baltic Sea. In September 2022, parts of the pipelines under the sea were badly damaged by large explosions. It is believed that someone did this on purpose.</p>
            <p>After this mysterious explosion, both Ukraine and Russia have strongly denied being involved in the incident for the past few years.</p>
            <p>However, German news reports said that investigations pointed to a group of Ukrainians carrying out the attack. There were five men and one woman. They rented a fast boat called Andromeda. They sailed from the German port of Rostock to the site of the explosion.</p>
            <p>According to German magazine Der Spiegel and other media, the goal of these Ukrainians was to destroy the Nord Stream pipelines. This way, Russia, their enemy in the war, would not be able to earn money by selling natural gas to Europe in the future.</p>
            <p>German prosecutors said that Serhii K. was arrested early this morning in Rimini province, Italy. He and his partners are accused of using a fast boat from Rostock to carry out the attack.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors also said that someone got fake ID documents through an agent. Then, these documents were used to rent the fast boat from a German company.</p>
