            <h1>"Weapons" is Number One at North American Box Office Again; "Jaws" Digital Version is Second</h1>
            <p>Today, experts in the movie business shared their estimates. The horror movie "Weapons" is back at number one in North American box office sales. This is its fourth week in theaters. It made 12.4 million US dollars during the long Labor Day weekend.</p>
            <p>News reports say that last week, the Netflix animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters" took the top spot from "Weapons." Exhibitor Relations, a group that watches movie sales in North America, said that "Weapons" has now made a total of 134.6 million US dollars in the US and Canada. This movie stars Julia Garner and Josh Brolin.</p>

            <p>David A. Gross, a movie expert from Franchise Entertainment Research, said, "It's amazing that this movie is still doing so well 50 years after it first came out."</p>
            <p>The crime movie "Caught Stealing," starring Austin Butler and Zoe Kravitz, started at number three. It made 9.5 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>Disney's "Freakier Friday" is in fourth place with 8.3 million US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Liu Xiang-bin, a Player from Korean Baseball, Joins Taiwan Life Dragons; Tseng Chuan-sheng and Lai Po-chun Go Back to Amateur Baseball</h1>
            <p>Good news for Taiwan's top amateur baseball teams! Liu Xiang-bin, an infielder who used to play in the Korean professional league, has applied to join the Taichung Taiwan Life Dragons team. Also, Tseng Chuan-sheng, a former professional player, is joining the New Taipei Caesar team. Lai Po-chun will join the All-Viet Sports baseball team.</p>
            <p>Liu Xiang-bin's parents are Taiwanese people living in Korea. He was born, studied, and played baseball there. He also came to Taiwan for training during high school. He was originally a Taiwanese citizen but became a Korean citizen in his third year of high school. After that, he joined the Hanwha Eagles team as a training player. In 2022, he became a full player. He was let go by the team after the 2023 season.</p>
            <p>Tseng Chuan-sheng, an infielder who played for the Wei Chuan Dragons team, was removed from his team because of a Texas Hold'em poker issue. He has now applied to play amateur baseball again with the New Taipei Caesar team. Lai Po-chun, another infielder, was chosen by the Fubon Guardians in the professional draft in 2022. However, he never played in the top league. He was released after last season. He will now return to amateur baseball and join the All-Viet Sports baseball team.</p>
            <p>The rules for former professional baseball players returning to amateur baseball have changed several times. Starting this year, players who want to return must apply by a certain date. If their application is approved and they finish the registration process, they can play in games organized by the Baseball Association. After these players' applications are approved, they can play in the Popcorn Baseball League, which is expected to start in November.</p>

            <h1>Sports Elite Awards Start Accepting Applications; Finalists Announced in November</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education's Sports Administration announced today that the 2025 Sports Elite Awards are now accepting applications. The deadline to apply is October 3rd. The list of finalists will be announced in November. This year's event is the first one since the Ministry of Sports was officially started.</p>
            <p>The Sports Elite Awards began in 1999. This year will be the 27th time they are held. It is a big sports event in Taiwan every year, often called Taiwan's "Oscars of Sports." There are eight awards: Best Male Athlete, Best Female Athlete, Best Coach, Best Sports Team, Best New Athlete, Best Sportsmanship, Special Award, and Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
            <p>The Sports Administration announced today how to apply and the rules for nominations. Any group that meets the requirements for the "Sports Elite Awards Regulations" can nominate someone. This includes central government offices, city and county governments, national sports groups, city and county sports associations, schools, and media organizations.</p>
            <p>The Sports Administration said that for all awards except the Lifetime Achievement Award, the achievements considered must have happened between October 1, 2024, and September 30, 2025. The last day to send in nominations is October 3, 2025. The date on the postmark will be used. The finalists will be announced in November, and the award ceremony will be on the afternoon of December 24th.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that this year's Sports Elite Awards are the first since the Ministry of Sports was created. Last year, Li Yang won the "Best Sports Team Award" for the second time with his partner Wang Chi-lin. At that time, he joked, "I hope next time at the Elite Awards, I can be the one giving out the awards." Now, Li Yang is the first Minister of Sports, so his wish might come true.</p>
