Taiwanese TV shows are doing very well. Because of this, streaming platforms like Netflix want to put more money into Taiwan. Today, Netflix announced a new plan called the "Future Talent Training Program." They will work with One One Production and the Taiwan Film and Television Production Association. This is the first time they will offer full training in both writing scripts and making films in Taiwan. The goal is to help more people develop skills for making Chinese-language content.

Ms. Huang Yi-mei, who leads Chinese content at Netflix, said that Netflix has been working in Taiwan for a long time. They keep investing money to find good Chinese-language content. They also want to create a good environment where creators can share ideas and learn.

The program includes two parts. First, the "TV Series Script Development Training" will be with One One Production. They will train script assistants for 5 months in a "Writers' Room" style, like in the real industry. Second, the "Film and TV Production Intern Program" will be with the Taiwan Film and Television Production Association. This part will have workshops with experts and allow students to work on real film sets.

**Gaza Civil Defense: Israel Kills 25 in Air Strike on School Shelter**

The Gaza Civil Defense agency said that Israeli forces killed at least 25 people there today. Twelve of them died in an Israeli air strike on a school. This school was used to shelter Palestinians who had to leave their homes. The war in Gaza started in October 2023, almost two years ago. It has caused a serious humanitarian crisis, and more than 2 million people in Gaza have had to leave their homes.

Many Palestinians seek safety in schools. However, the Israeli army often says that Hamas fighters hide among civilians. Because of this, schools are often attacked by Israeli forces. Mohammad al-Mughayyir from the Gaza Civil Defense said that 12 people died in the attack on Mustafa Hafez School. Most of them were children and women.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised yesterday to destroy Hamas. US President Donald Trump said that Israel supported a new ceasefire plan. This plan aims for a 60-day break in fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Gaza Health Ministry, controlled by Hamas, says that Israel's attacks have killed 57,012 people, mostly civilians.

**US Military Leader Apologizes for Sexual Violence by US Soldiers in Okinawa**

Last year, a US soldier in Japan tried to sexually assault a woman and hurt her. A court in Naha sentenced him to 7 years in prison. Today, a US military leader apologized to the Okinawa Prefectural Government about this incident. This is the first apology since last June, when many reports of sexual violence by US soldiers began to appear.

Neil J. Owens, Chief of Staff for the 3rd Marine Division, visited the Okinawa Prefectural Government today. He bowed and apologized to Masahito Ryuu, the head of the Prefectural Governor's Office. He said he was sorry for making victims and local people feel worried. Owens also announced new plans, like teaching US soldiers to follow the law and continuing joint patrols with the prefectural government and police. Masahito Ryuu protested, saying, "This ignores women's rights and makes us very angry. We strongly question the US military's training and management of its members."

In May 2024, US Marine Jamel Clayton tried to sexually assault and hurt a woman he didn't know in Okinawa. He was charged with "sexual assault causing injury." On June 24 this year, the Naha District Court sentenced him to 7 years in prison. The defendant disagreed with the court's decision and appealed to the Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court on June 30. The Okinawa Prefectural Government said that after the first court decision, the US military wanted to apologize. Since 2024, there have been 8 cases where US soldiers were suspected of sexual assault in Okinawa. Four of these cases have led to charges.
