            <h1>Ascendant Technologies: More Than Half of Sales from Low-Earth Orbit Satellites, New Factory Line in Sijhih Starts in Q4</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 31st) Ascendant Technologies, a company that makes products for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellites and wireless communication, announced its sales for the first half of the year. The company made NT$1.13 billion, which is the most it has ever made in this period. Products for LEO satellites made up 52.7% of these sales. This shows that LEO satellites are now the main reason for the company's growth. In June alone, LEO satellite products were 54% of the monthly sales.</p>
            <p>Ascendant Technologies said that they are building more factories to meet the growing demand for LEO satellites. Their new second factory in Sijhih, Taiwan, will start working in the last three months of the year (Q4). They have also finished plans to expand their third factory in Qidu and will soon choose a construction company to build it.</p>
            <p>Outside of Taiwan, they plan to finalize the design for a second factory in Vietnam by the end of September (Q3). This will help the company make more products and deliver them more easily from other countries.</p>
            <p>Ascendant Technologies looked at their orders and found that in June, they received orders for LEO satellite products worth more than NT$180 million. This is about two and a half times the amount of LEO satellite products they actually sold that month. Also, they still have unfulfilled orders for LEO satellite products worth more than NT$400 million. This means that there is still a very high demand for these products.</p>
            <p>Ascendant Technologies expects that in the second half of the year, after a recent period of lower sales, their LEO satellite product shipments will start to increase again each month. They hope to achieve excellent sales again, keeping LEO satellites as their main area of growth.</p>
            <p>Ascendant Technologies said that in the second quarter, their sales were NT$514 million, which is 17% less than the previous quarter. This was partly because they did not include the sales of another company, Zhengtong Technology, in their report. Also, some shipments were delayed because a major LEO satellite customer was testing their products. Another reason was that the New Taiwan Dollar became much stronger against the US dollar, which also affected sales. If we look at the sales using the same currency exchange rate as the first quarter, the company's profit margin (how much profit they make from sales before some costs) in the second quarter was about 49%. This is only a small difference from the 50.6% profit margin in the first quarter.</p>
            <p>The company's income from other areas (not sales) changed from a positive amount in the first quarter to a negative amount in the second quarter. This was because they lost money due to changes in currency exchange rates.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon and Heavy Rains Damage Central and Southern Taiwan; Financial Companies Donate Over NT$209 Million</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 31st) Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in central and southern Taiwan. Because of this, many financial companies have given money to help people affected by the disaster. The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) has collected information. It shows that financial companies, including large financial groups, banks, insurance companies, stock companies, and investment companies, along with their related groups, have given a total of over NT$209.86 million.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas seriously affected central and southern Taiwan. Also, recent heavy rains brought by strong winds from the southwest have made things worse. This has caused a lot of trouble for many people living in those areas.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-chi, the main secretary of the FSC, thanked the financial companies for their donations. He said that some companies gave money as a whole group, while others gave money individually. The FSC's numbers show that financial groups donated NT$115.9 million. Banks in Taiwan gave NT$56.1 million. Insurance companies and their association donated NT$5.75 million. Stock and investment companies and their associations gave NT$4.115 million. Other groups related to the stock market gave NT$28 million.</p>
            <p>CTBC Financial Holding said they donated NT$20 million to cities and counties in southern Taiwan. This money will be used only for disaster help, urgent medical care, finding places for people to stay, and rebuilding efforts. CTBC Bank is also offering an "Emergency Loan Service for Families." Customers who have any financial product with the bank (like savings, credit cards, insurance, funds, or loans) can ask for this loan within three months after a disaster. They just need to show proof of the damage.</p>
            <p>KGI Financial Holding announced today that their group will donate NT$20 million. They will do this through their "KGI Social Welfare Charity Foundation." With the help of group volunteers, they will offer different kinds of care and emergency help. KGI Life quickly started five ways to help their customers who have insurance policies. These include getting claims paid fast, getting money for hospital stays in advance, being able to pay insurance fees later, special discounts on services, and making changes to travel insurance easily. This is to make sure affected people get quick and helpful insurance support.</p>
            <p>Yuanta Financial Holding also announced today that they are donating NT$20 million. This money will go to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's special fund for disaster relief. It will help with disaster aid, urgent medical care, housing for people, and rebuilding after the disaster. This shows the company's strength and teamwork in helping the disaster area. Yuanta Financial said that right after the disaster, they started their emergency plans and special programs to care for their customers.</p>
            <p>Nanshan Life and Nanshan General Insurance announced today that they are donating NT$6 million to the Ministry of Health and Welfare's disaster relief fund through the Nanshan Life Charity Foundation. When Typhoon Danas was coming to Taiwan, Nanshan Life and Nanshan General Insurance immediately started services to help their customers. These include not charging interest on policy loans, not charging interest on home loans, letting people pay insurance fees later, paying claims quickly, and giving money for hospital stays in advance.</p>
            <p>Line Bank (Future Bank) wants to help people affected by the disaster. Starting in August, people who live in flood-hit areas of Taichung, Changhua, Nantou, Yunlin, Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung can apply for a special low-interest loan. It is for 3 years, and you don't need to sign a long-term contract. Each person can borrow up to NT$200,000. The interest rate is 1.88% for the whole loan period, and there is no fee to start the loan. You can apply for this loan until the end of August.</p>
