            <h1>Trump Signs Stablecoin Law, Cryptocurrency Stocks Rise, Ethereum Reaches New High Price</h1>
            <p>(New York, July 21, Central News Agency) Today, the price of stocks for companies related to cryptocurrencies went up a lot in the US stock market. This happened after US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act, which controls stablecoins, into law. Also, Ethereum, which is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, reached its highest price this year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on the evening of July 18. The full name of this law is "The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act." This was a big win for the cryptocurrency industry, which has been asking for clearer rules to make their business more official.</p>
            <p>Today, after the market opened, the stock price of Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, went up by 1.9%. The stock price of Circle, a company that creates stablecoins, also went up by 0.9%.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Ethereum reached its highest price this year, with its latest price at $3816.7. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world, went up a little by 0.2%. However, it is still more than 3% away from its highest price ever, which was $123,153 last week.</p>
            <p>Stablecoins are made to keep a steady value, usually by being linked one-to-one with the US dollar. Cryptocurrency traders are the main users of stablecoins. They use them to move money between different digital coins. Because more and more people are using stablecoins, big banks on Wall Street, like Bank of America, are also planning to create their own stablecoins.</p>
            <p>The GENIUS Act means that stablecoins are now regulated. They are not allowed to earn money or pay interest.</p>
            <p>Deutsche Bank said that Ethereum's price went up because investors want to keep making money in decentralized finance. They expect investors to move their money to Ethereum as another choice.</p>
            <p>Gautam Chhugani, a senior analyst in global digital assets at Bernstein, an asset management company in the US, also said that banks, payment companies, and financial technology (fintech) companies will continue to buy Ethereum. This is to pay for the fees when they put stablecoins and tokenized assets on the blockchain.</p>
