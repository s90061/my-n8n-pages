            <h1>New Child Development Checks: Over Half of Parents Don't Know</h1>
            <p>It has been one year since new rules for child development checks started. A survey found that 52.2% of parents do not know about this free service from the government. The National Health Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, is asking parents to use these regular checks. They say that finding and helping with child development problems early can make a big difference.</p>
            <p>Since July 2024, the National Health Agency has offered more child development checks. They pay for 6 checks for children under 7 years old. Doctors who are trained use special tools, ask parents or caregivers about the child's behavior at home, and use their medical knowledge. This helps them check a child's development in many areas.</p>
            <p>These child development checks can find problems early in how children speak, think, move, or interact with others. Doctors can then teach parents, offer follow-up, or send the child for more detailed development checks.</p>
            <p>However, a survey by the National Health Agency this year showed that 52.2% of parents did not know that the government offers these 6 free child development checks.</p>
            <p>Shen Jing-fen, the head of the National Health Agency, said that in addition to the 6 child development checks, parents should also remember the 7 child health check-ups. She suggests using all 13 free checks before a child turns 7. These checks help parents understand their child's health and development. If there are any problems, a team of experts can help early and give advice on child health.</p>
            <p>Dr. Hsu Kai-hsiang, a doctor at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, shared a story. He once helped a 2-month-old baby during a child health check-up. This baby was not gaining weight well, had trouble feeding, and breathed with difficulty. The baby had only gained 500 grams since birth, which was much less than other babies of the same age. After more checks, doctors found a problem with the baby's heart. They found out the baby had a serious heart problem from birth. The baby had surgery and slowly got better.</p>
            <p>The 7 child health check-ups are offered at different times: from birth to 2 months, 2 to 4 months, 4 to 10 months, 10 months to 1.5 years, 1.5 to 2 years, 2 to 3 years, and 3 years to under 7 years. These checks include looking at the body, checking development, and teaching parents about health. Statistics show that over 80% of parents have used these 7 services in the last three years.</p>

            <h1>Two Elderly Hikers Lost in Keelung Rescued by Firefighters</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a 78-year-old man named Chen and a 73-year-old woman named Lin got lost while hiking in Qidu District, Keelung City. The fire department sent 4 vehicles and 25 people to help. Search teams gathered and went into the mountains. They found the two people on the Xiantonghu Mountain ridge. Luckily, both were fine.</p>
            <p>The Keelung City Fire Department said today that they received a call around 10 AM yesterday. The call said two people from Taipei, about 70 years old, were lost in the mountains. They had started hiking from the Gu Niang Miao entrance on Huaxin 1st Road in Qidu District. After walking for about an hour, they got lost because they did not know the path well. They were stuck on a mountain ridge and needed help to get down.</p>
            <p>The fire department immediately sent 4 vehicles and 25 people from Qidu and Baifu fire stations to search for them. They set up a main help center at Gu Niang Miao. After the search teams gathered, they used the location information given by the lost hikers. They believed the hikers were on the Xiantonghu Mountain ridge. The search team walked for about 30 minutes into the mountain and found the two lost people on the ridge. Checks showed that both were awake and healthy. Then, the rescuers safely helped them go down the mountain.</p>
            <p>You Chia-yi, the head of the Keelung City Fire Department, wants to remind everyone. When you go hiking, you must think about how strong your body is. Bring all the things you need and always pay attention to the weather and the path. Do not think that hiking is without danger. This way, you can be sure your trip is safe.</p>

            <h1>KMT Says Government Fund Misused for Director; Ministry of Labor Denies</h1>
            <p>Today, Ling Tao, who is a leader at the KMT party's think tank, said that a government fund meant to help people find jobs, called the Employment Security Fund, was misused. He stated that between 2022 and 2024, the fund gave NT$28.72 million to director Luo Jing-ren's team for a film called "Zero Day Attack." Ling Tao said this money should not have been used this way and called it a big problem and against the law.</p>
            <p>In response, the Ministry of Labor said clearly that they did not give money for the film "Zero Day Attack." They stated that all their work to promote labor services follows the rules and is not for political reasons. They asked people not to make wrong connections or suggestions.</p>
            <p>Also, about how the Employment Security Fund is managed, the Ministry of Labor said they already explained everything to the parliament and the audit office in March this year. They also said they are still working to make things better.</p>
            <p>The KMT party held a meeting today. Kang Jin-yu, a spokesperson for the party, said that the Employment Security Fund might have become a "fund for government officials and supporters of the DPP party." The audit office checked how the Ministry of Labor and its related offices spent money from the Employment Security Fund. They found that over NT$51.74 million spent in three years did not fit the original purpose of the fund.</p>
            <p>Kang Jin-yu said the Ministry of Labor used this money for making and promoting things in the media, for concerts, music videos, and music events. They also used it for managing the Ministry of Labor's Facebook page, making New Year decorations, and even buying gifts for the minister for holidays.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao said that not only were two dresses for the former Minister of Labor, Hsu Ming-chun, and money for a concert paid for by the Employment Security Fund, but the fund also supported director Luo Jing-ren's team. He mentioned specific projects:</p>
            <p>In 2022, a video and media promotion for Labor Day called "A-Fang Laundry Shop" cost over NT$10.69 million. But it only got 488 likes.</p>
            <p>In 2023, the Labor Day video and media promotion called "2023 Labor Day Theme Video - Paper Figure Edition" cost over NT$9.71 million. It only got 1761 likes.</p>
            <p>In 2024, they continued to make a Labor Day video and promote it, called "2024 Long Live Labor - Moving Edition." This cost over NT$8.31 million, but only got 202 likes.</p>
            <p>Ling Tao pointed out that director Luo Jing-ren's team received a total of NT$28,726,914. This is about 55.51% of the total money (NT$51,744,288) that was not used for its intended purpose. He said that other good art groups are asking why all the money went to Luo Jing-ren's team. He stressed that this use of money does not fit the purpose of the Employment Security Fund. He called it a serious problem and against the law, asking if the government would let this misuse of money continue.</p>
