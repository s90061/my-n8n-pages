            <h1>Microsoft Software Problem Affects US Lab</h1>
            <p>A recent report says that hackers tried to use a weakness in Microsoft SharePoint software. This attack affected one of the 17 national laboratories under the U.S. Department of Energy.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Energy said, "The attackers tried to get into Fermilab's SharePoint server." Fermilab is a very important lab for studying tiny particles. It was started in 1967.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson added that they found the attackers quickly. The problem was small, and no secret information was taken. Fermilab's server is now working normally again.</p>
            <p>Microsoft, Fermilab, and the U.S. Department of Energy did not immediately reply to questions.</p>
            <p>Last month, Microsoft sent out a fix for a big problem in its SharePoint server software. But this fix did not completely solve the problem. This problem was found in May and allowed spies from different countries to attack systems.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy said last week that the SharePoint problem affected their systems on July 18. This included the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages America's nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>The Department of Energy said all affected systems are now back to normal.</p>

            <h1>Yuan Ze University and US School Will Work Together</h1>
            <p>Yuan Ze University in Taiwan and Illinois Institute of Technology in the United States have signed an agreement to work together. In the future, they will offer dual degrees, student exchange programs, shared classes, and allow teachers and students to visit each other. They hope this will give teachers and students more chances to study and work with people from other countries.</p>
            <p>Today, Yuan Ze University and Illinois Institute of Technology signed the agreement online. Important people from Yuan Ze University, like President Liao Ching-jung, attended the signing. Both schools will work together on international studies, shared research, and training people for jobs around the world.</p>
            <p>This cooperation started because of Mr. Hsu Kuo-an, who is an important person at Far Eastern Group and also studied at Illinois Institute of Technology. Yuan Ze University's President Liao Ching-jung also studied there.</p>
            <p>President Liao Ching-jung said that Yuan Ze University always tries to work with universities in other countries. They want to make their international connections stronger. Illinois Institute of Technology has the most international students among all US universities. It was also the first US university to open a branch in India. This new partnership is a big step for sharing learning materials and giving teachers and students more international opportunities.</p>
            <p>Under the agreement, the two schools will work together in many areas. These include research, teaching shared classes, student exchange programs, and dual degree programs. They will also let teachers and students visit each other, work on research together, and do cultural activities. This will make their education and research links stronger. They also plan to offer "2+2" bachelor's degree programs (2 years at each school) and "1+1" master's degree programs (1 year at each school). This will give students more ways to study abroad.</p>
            <p>To make sure the cooperation goes well, Yuan Ze and Illinois Institute of Technology will each have a special team. These teams will help organize and carry out the plans. They will also check and report on how things are going regularly. For student exchanges, the main focus will be on short study trips. They will also decide on how students can get in, how their credits will count, and how much it will cost. For teachers, the focus will be on teaching and research. This will make their learning and sharing of knowledge stronger.</p>
            <p>To help with international efforts, Yuan Ze University started a "Thousand People Abroad Program" in 2023. The Hsu Yuan-zhi Foundation gives money for this program. It also works with the Ministry of Education's "Study Abroad Program" scholarships. This program helps students study abroad through short courses in winter or summer, study camps, student exchange, and dual degree programs. Also, the number of international students at Yuan Ze University has grown each year. In the school year 2020, about 8% were international students. In the second semester of the 2024 school year, about 12% are international students.</p>

            <h1>Minister Wu: Peace Needs Strength</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu met with a group led by Matthew Pottinger, who is in charge of the China program at the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies." Minister Wu said that peace needs to be supported by strength. He also said that countries that believe in democracy must show they are ready and able to keep peace in the area.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu posted on Facebook this morning. He said that on July 28, he met with Matthew Pottinger and his group from the "Foundation for Defense of Democracies" (FDD) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They talked in depth about how Taiwan and the US can work together on money and safety.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu said that Mr. Pottinger and his group will work with partners in Taiwan. They will have a special meeting to discuss energy. They will talk about how Taiwan can make its energy system stronger by working with countries like the US and Japan. Minister Wu used this chance to tell Mr. Pottinger that Taiwan hopes to buy natural gas from Alaska in the US. This would give Taiwan more energy and help both Taiwan and the US.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu stressed that peace must be supported by strength. He said that countries that share democratic values need to show they are ready and able to keep peace and stability in the area. Mr. Pottinger has always strongly supported Taiwan. The "Foundation for Defense of Democracies" has worked closely with Taiwan for many years. It is a key partner for Taiwan in talking to other countries in unofficial ways. It is also very important in Washington D.C. and in making public policy.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the Foundation has been worried about the problems caused by China's growing power. Minister Wu said that Mr. Pottinger mentioned that the US has passed laws and given military help to Taiwan. This shows strong support for Taiwan. He said that more Taiwanese people should know about these efforts. This would help against China's use of fake news to control what people think.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu also said that Mr. Pottinger came to Taiwan in February this year. He was here for the release of the Chinese version of his book, "Boiling Moats: Urgent Actions to Defend Taiwan." Minister Wu also went to this event and supported Mr. Pottinger's ideas. Minister Wu especially congratulated Mr. Pottinger during this meeting because his book is now a bestseller. Mr. Pottinger joked that he should give Minister Wu some money from the book sales.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu said that after the meeting, Mr. Pottinger gave him a special crystal gift with a "porcupine" carved on it. This means that even if Taiwan is a small country, it can use "porcupine tactics" to defend itself. This would make any attacker think twice before acting.</p>
