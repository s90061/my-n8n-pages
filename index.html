            <h1>Trump: Hamas does not want to free hostages; Israel must decide what to do next.</h1>
            <p>On July 27th, in Turnberry, Scotland, former US President Donald Trump said that Israel needs to decide its next steps in Gaza. He mentioned that he does not know what will happen after talks for a ceasefire and releasing hostages with Hamas broke down.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump said it is very important for Hamas to free the hostages held in the Gaza Strip. He also said that Hamas has become "suddenly tougher" on this issue. At the same time, he stated that the United States will give more help to Gaza, which has been affected by the war.</p>
            <p>Trump met with Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. At the start of their meeting, he told reporters, "They (Hamas) do not want to give back these people (the Israeli hostages), so Israel must make a decision."</p>
            <p>He said, "I know what I would do, but I don't think it's right to say. However, Israel must make a decision." Trump did not show any proof that Hamas members stole food sent to Gaza and sold it for money.</p>
            <p>Trump said today that the United States will provide more help to Gaza. He hopes other countries will also help. He also said he would talk about this issue with Ms. von der Leyen.</p>

            <h1>US Commerce Secretary: Reciprocal Tariffs will start on August 1st and will not be delayed.</h1>
            <p>On July 27th, in Washington, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the US is firm on starting reciprocal tariffs on its trade partners by the August 1st deadline. He stated that there will be no delay.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Lutnick told the Fox News Sunday program, "So there will be no delay, no more grace period. On August 1st, the tariffs are set. They (the tariffs on different countries) will start, customs will begin collecting this money, and here we go."</p>
            <p>He said that President Trump is still willing to talk even after the reciprocal tariffs begin. Trump had discussions with European Union officials in Scotland today.</p>
            <p>After his meeting with Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, Trump announced a trade agreement. As a result, tariffs on EU products going to the US will be reduced to 15%. Also, the EU agreed to buy 750 billion US dollars (about 22 trillion New Taiwan dollars) worth of energy from the US and invest an extra 600 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Before this, the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan had already reached agreements with the Trump government.</p>
            <p>The tax rates they agreed to are usually higher than the 10% basic tariffs that the US has been charging most countries since April. However, these rates are much lower than the rates the Trump government threatened to use if no agreement was made.</p>
