            <h1>U12 Baseball World Cup: Hu Cheng-En Shows Power, Still Aims for 30 Stolen Bases</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-Wen, Taipei, July 28) Taiwan's team won 17-0 against Germany today in the U12 Baseball World Cup. This is their third win in the first round, and they have a good chance to move to the next stage. Hu Cheng-En, who said he wants to achieve "30 stolen bases," hit two home runs and got 5 RBIs in today's game. The head coach called him a "key player," but Hu Cheng-En said he still wants to reach his goal for stolen bases.</p>
            <p>The U12 Baseball World Cup is taking place at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. Taiwan's team beat Cuba and Australia earlier. They lost to Japan yesterday, but today they played against Germany. Hu Cheng-En hit a solo home run in his first at-bat in the first inning. This was the first home run for the Taiwan team in this competition. In the fourth inning, he hit a grand slam.</p>
            <p>Hu Cheng-En got on base in all four of his turns. He hit three extra-base hits, which included two home runs and one double. He helped the team get 5 runs. Taiwan's head coach, Chang Tzu-Chien, told a TV reporter that Hu Cheng-En is a key player. If he plays well, he can make the team feel good and strong. If he continues to play like this, it will help in future games too.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, after Taiwan's team lost their first game to Japan, the players were sad and some cried. Coach Chang Tzu-Chien said that when they returned to the hotel, he gathered the players again. He told them not to be sad because of the loss. He said the games are still happening and they have not lost all hope. He added that they might play against Japan again later. He told them to play freely in the next games, and that tomorrow is a new day.</p>
            <p>Hu Cheng-En said in an earlier interview that he wanted to get 30 stolen bases and win a batting award. Today, he showed his power. He said that when he batted in the first inning, he felt calm. He tried to stay calm and hit the balls he wanted to hit.</p>
            <p>When asked if he still wanted to get 30 stolen bases even with his strong hitting, Hu Cheng-En said that he needs to hit singles to steal bases 30 times. He said home runs happen when you are calm and relaxed at important times. He added that his goal of 30 stolen bases has not changed. (Edited by Chang Ya-Ching) July 28, 2025</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Finance Plans New Rule: Spouses Must Pay Tax on Deemed Inheritance Even if They Give It Up</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Ai, Taipei, July 28) In October last year, the Constitutional Court said that some parts of the Inheritance and Gift Tax Law were not fair. Today, the Ministry of Finance announced new rules. These rules say that the tax office can send separate tax bills for "deemed inheritance" and "non-deemed inheritance." This is to stop heirs who do not actually receive money from having to pay tax on the "deemed inheritance."</p>
            <p>The new rules from the Ministry of Finance are temporary until the law is changed. In the future, the law will be updated. It will clearly state that even if an heir gives up their right to inherit, they still have to pay the inheritance tax that comes from "deemed inheritance."</p>
            <p>If a person gives property to their spouse within two years before they die, this property is considered part of their estate (called "deemed inheritance") when they die. It is then added to the total estate for tax calculation.</p>
            <p>For example, a man gave a large amount of shares to his wife within two years before he died. However, his wife and children decided to give up their right to inherit. This meant that the man's only heir, his daughter from another relationship, had to pay all the inheritance tax, even though she did not get the shares. The tax was over 57.35 million NT dollars. On October 28 last year, the Constitutional Court made decision number 113 Constitutional Judgment No. 11. It said that part of Article 15, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 1 of the Inheritance and Gift Tax Law was against the constitution. The law must be changed within two years.</p>
            <p>The main problem in this case was that the husband gave a lot of shares to his wife within two years before he died. So, this gift was still seen as part of his estate and was taxed. But after the husband died, his wife and children gave up their right to inherit. This made his only heir, his daughter from another relationship, legally responsible for paying all the inheritance tax, even though she did not get any benefit from the shares.</p>
            <p>To fix this problem, the Ministry of Finance has introduced these temporary rules before changing the law. Today, they set up the "Principles for Handling Inheritance Tax Assessment for Property Gifted to Spouse within 2 Years Before Death, Included in Total Estate." These rules are active from today. They apply to cases that happened from October 28, 2024, until the new inheritance tax law becomes active. This includes cases that have happened but have not been taxed yet, cases that are being reviewed, cases where tax has not been paid, and new inheritance cases. Right now, about 100 cases involve "deemed inheritance" from a spouse.</p>
            <p>Officials explained that currently, for one inheritance case, there is only one tax bill. The temporary rules say that during this time, separate tax bills can be sent for "deemed inheritance" and "non-deemed inheritance." For example, if the total estate is 65 million NT dollars (including 5 million NT dollars of "deemed inheritance" given to the spouse), and the total inheritance tax is 2.75 million NT dollars, the tax for the "deemed inheritance" would be 210,000 NT dollars (2.75 million NT dollars tax, multiplied by the ratio of 5 million NT dollars to 65 million NT dollars). This part should be billed to the spouse. The tax for the other "non-deemed inheritance" would be 2.54 million NT dollars (2.75 million NT dollars tax, multiplied by the ratio of 60 million NT dollars to 65 million NT dollars). This part should be billed to all heirs, including the spouse.</p>
            <p>Because of these new temporary rules, the man's daughter from another relationship will not have to pay the inheritance tax for the large amount of shares her father's wife received. She will only need to pay the tax for the part of the estate she actually inherited.</p>
            <p>Officials also said that to protect equal rights and property rights, and to make taxes fair, they are quickly working on a new law based on the court's decision. The new law will state that no matter if the spouse gives up their right to inherit or not, the tax office can still send them a tax bill for the "deemed inheritance." The exact wording of the law is still being discussed.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the temporary rules say that when calculating the spouse's right to claim the difference in their remaining property, the "deemed inheritance" can be included in this calculation. This means the amount that can be deducted will increase, which may lead to lower taxes.</p>
            <p>According to the law, when a marriage ends, if one spouse has more property they earned during the marriage, after debts are paid, the difference in property between the two spouses should be divided equally. So, after a person dies, the living spouse can ask for this difference in property. The value of this claim can be taken out of the total estate when calculating the inheritance tax.
