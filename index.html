            <h1>After the Pandemic, Aerospace Demand Grows, Taiwan Companies Join Global Supply Chain</h1>
            <p>After the pandemic, the world's aviation market is very busy. This has made the market for plane repairs and parts much bigger, creating many business chances. Because problems in the global aerospace supply chain have not fully gone away, Taiwanese companies have more chances to join the international supply chain. Leaders in the industry say that Taiwan now has an important place and will continue to make Taiwan more important in the global aerospace market.</p>
            <p>The Taipei International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition will start on September 18. After the pandemic, the world needs more flights for both people and goods. Delays in getting new planes and older planes mean that more repairs and parts are needed. Taiwan's aerospace industry is getting a lot of attention. From repairs and making parts to supplying them, Taiwan is slowly becoming stronger in the global market.</p>
            <p>After the pandemic rules were lifted, the demand for cargo and passenger flights quickly increased. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) believes that in 2025, the global airline industry's income will be more than 1 trillion US dollars for the first time. This is a 4.4% increase from last year, reaching 1.07 trillion US dollars. The number of passengers will also set a new record, reaching 5.2 billion.</p>
            <p>However, problems like broken supply chains and not enough workers from the pandemic have not been solved. Plane makers like Boeing and Airbus keep getting more orders, but they are slow to deliver planes. The planes being used now are also older on average.</p>
            <p>Experts in the industry think that in 2025 and 2026, Boeing and Airbus will deliver 23% and 26% more planes each year, reaching 1,367 and 1,722 planes respectively. As more and more planes are used worldwide, the market for aerospace repair and parts will keep growing, creating big business chances.</p>
            <p>Besides the market getting better, government policies and changes in the supply chain are also helping. Governments in different countries are starting projects to build their own planes. This increases demand inside the country and helps the local aviation industry grow. Also, changes in the international supply chain mean some orders are now going to Taiwan, giving local companies new chances to grow.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese companies are actively taking these new global market opportunities. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp. announced in May this year that it signed an agreement with Airbus. This makes them a main supplier of airframe parts for Airbus, starting a direct working relationship.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Aviation Technologies was already an important partner for Boeing and GE Aviation engines. Now with Airbus, it means their manufacturing skills and factory use will greatly improve. Hsieh Hsin-wen, the general manager of Evergreen Aviation Technologies, said they hope to help Taiwan's aerospace industry work together and grow, and make Taiwan more important in the global aerospace market.</p>
            <p>Evergreen Aviation Technologies is also one of the top ten professional repair companies in the world. It has many approvals from different countries' aviation authorities, which brings repair orders from all over the world. Especially for large commercial planes like B747, A380, and A340, they repair more than most other companies globally, showing how strong they are in the international market.</p>
            <p>The industry is positive about this. As Boeing and Airbus deliver more planes each year, Evergreen Aviation Technologies' repair work for this year is almost fully booked. After their new repair hanger at Taoyuan Airport starts working, their capacity will increase by more than 70% compared to this year.</p>
            <p>Another important Taiwanese company, Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC), is growing with both military and civilian markets. AIDC said that in the first three months of this year, they received new orders worth NT$8.5 billion. In the first half of the year, their total orders for civilian planes and engines went over NT$10 billion. Their customers include big international aerospace companies like Boeing, Airbus, Bombardier, Rolls-Royce, and GE.</p>
            <p>Market news says that AIDC might become a bigger supplier of parts for civilian aircraft systems this year. Talks are in the final stages. A high-level manager even clearly stated, "Taiwan now has a strong position in the international aviation supply chain."</p>
            <p>Asia Pacific Airlines (APA) has experience repairing both military and civilian aircraft. This year, the number of civilian aircraft repairs is expected to increase. They are also actively taking on military aircraft repair jobs, showing stable future business.</p>
            <p>Besides big repair and manufacturing companies, many Taiwanese companies that specialize in making specific parts also play a key role in the international aerospace industry. A company called TUC Limited (È®∞Ëºù-KY), which makes copper clad laminates, is working hard in the defense and aerospace fields. Their Teflon materials have been approved by big European and American companies and are now being made in large amounts. These materials are used in radar and aerospace equipment, and their sales are expected to grow.</p>
            <p>JPP-KY, a company that supplies mechanical parts, bought a French company called Segnere. This helped them become a main supplier (Tier-1) for Dassault military aircraft and they also supply parts to Airbus for a long time. This makes them more important in the European military and aerospace industries.</p>
            <p>Sheng Tai Brassware Co., Ltd. (ÊôüÁî∞), which makes aerospace parts, continues to supply Boeing and Airbus. They also work closely with AIDC. This year, they expect nearly 70% of their business to be from aerospace, showing that their business focus is moving towards aerospace.</p>
            <p>Bao Yi Precision Co., Ltd. (ÂØ∂‰∏Ä) focuses on making very precise metal parts. Their products include assembled parts, cooling fins, and parts for jet engines. They have special skills in working with superalloys and unique manufacturing methods, which has helped them get a strong position in the global aerospace supply chain.</p>
            <p>Industry experts say that Taiwan has good skills in CNC machining and making precise metal parts. This means they can meet the high standards for aerospace parts worldwide. As airlines around the world get more planes, the need for repairs and parts will keep growing. Taiwanese companies will work more closely with big international companies to keep their share of the global market.</p>

            <h1>Joseph Wu Visits Czech Republic, Hopes "Tech Taiwan" Becomes Europe's Best Partner</h1>
            <p>Foreign Minister Joseph Wu wrote on Facebook that during his visit to the Czech Republic, he went to the "Advanced Chip Design and Research Center" (ACDRC), which is a project between Taiwan and the Czech Republic. He also visited Taiwanese tech companies Inventec and Wistron. He hopes that Taiwan's "New Top Ten AI Development Plans" can connect with the Czech Republic. This would create more opportunities for them to work together, not just in semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu started his trip to Europe, and the first stop was the Czech Republic. He said on Facebook today that "From Tech to Culture" is the main theme of this year's "European Taiwan Culture Year." After the opening ceremony of a special exhibition at the National Palace Museum, he specially traveled to Brno. There, he visited the "Advanced Chip Design and Research Center" (ACDRC), a project where Taiwan and the Czech Republic work together. He also visited Taiwanese tech companies Inventec and Wistron to learn more about the chances and challenges for cooperation in technology between the two countries.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu explained that Brno is only a two-hour drive from the capital city, Prague. It has about 400,000 people, but also has as many as 60,000 university students. It is truly a "university city." This young energy helps new technology grow and provides good ground for Taiwan's semiconductor design and technology industries.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu pointed out that Brno University of Technology is where the ACDRC, a main project between Taiwan and the Czech Republic, is located. At a time when the Czech Republic, Germany, and Poland might create a "European Chip Triangle" together, Taiwan is sharing its experience. It is helping the Czech Republic train smart people, making Taiwan more important in the semiconductor world. At the same time, this also makes both countries' economies and democracies stronger.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu also thanked Professor Radek Hol√Ω, the Vice-Rector and Director of the ACDRC project, and his team for their kind welcome. They showed him the wafer design classroom and semiconductor lab, so he could see the project's results up close. Joseph Wu said that both sides are interested in working together on AI technology in the future. He hopes Taiwan's "New Top Ten AI Development Plans" can connect with the Czech Republic to find more ways to work together beyond semiconductors.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu then visited Inventec and Wistron. Both Taiwanese companies said that the Czech Republic is in the "heart of Europe," has good transport, and smart workers. This was key for them to invest and start businesses there around 2006. Now, they have created over 1,200 jobs in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu said that Inventec is increasing its production in the Czech Republic for the car electronics industry, and its new factory will open soon. Wistron won the "Best Employer Award" from Pluxee and received the "Significant Investment Achievement Award" from the Association for Foreign Investment (AFI) in the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>Also, Hon Hai (Foxconn) employs 5,000 people in the Czech Republic. For many years, it has been one of the top 3 exporting companies in the Czech Republic. This shows that the Czech Republic widely recognizes Taiwan's tech industry's contributions.</p>
            <p>Joseph Wu stressed that technology and culture are like two wheels of a cart, both pushing the relationship between Taiwan and Europe forward. This is also how "economic diplomacy" and "value diplomacy" are put into action. At a key time when global supply chains are changing and building "non-red supply chains," Taiwan wants to work with Europe. They want to use this historical chance to create success, so that "Trusted Technology Taiwan" (3T) can be Europe's best partner in global competition.</p>
