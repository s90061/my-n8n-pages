            <h1>New Taipei Girls' Day: Female Students Experience Being Peking Opera Performers in Tamsui</h1>
            <p>The "New Taipei Girls' Day" Tamsui historical walk event took place today. The Social Affairs Department said that through cultural walks and opera performance experiences, children and teenagers are guided to understand gender equality, bravely explore many different developments, and learn about the brave women and their achievements in Tamsui's history.</p>
            <p>The city's Social Affairs Department said that October 11th is "Taiwan Girls' Day," and New Taipei City has also made this day "New Taipei Girls' Day." To celebrate this day, the New Taipei Girls' "Sea Light Legacy, Brilliant Girls" sharing event was held in Tamsui today.</p>
            <p>The Social Affairs Department stated that "New Taipei Girls' Day" has reached its 13th year. It hopes to make gender equality a basic idea from a young age, and to teach values of respecting differences and accepting different people. Director Li Mei-chen said that no matter a person's biological gender or job, everyone can show their strength in life, respect each other, and create the best "female power."</p>
            <p>Female students from Zhengde Junior High School, Tamsui Junior High School, and Tamsui Commercial and Industrial Vocational High School were invited to the event. At the Tamsui Customs Wharf, a place that trains Peking Opera talent, Pan Jun-ren, the general secretary of the Huaya Traditional Opera Art Education Promotion Association, showed the special "qiao gong" (fake feet) performance technique for Peking Opera female roles.</p>
            <p>Pan Jun-ren, a man, plays female roles in Peking Opera. He learned qiao gong to show the light and graceful steps of women, which needs deep skill and creates strong drama on stage. He shared his story of bravely chasing his dream of becoming an opera performer. He used to study art, but he started to like Peking Opera because of a university professor. He then combined his skills in painting and ink wash with Peking Opera to show the true meaning of traditional Eastern beauty.</p>
            <p>Pan Jun-ren mentioned that the famous "Huadan" (female role) actress Li Qiu-gui (Li Guang-yu) was his first teacher, who helped him start his dream in Peking Opera. He invited students to try on costumes, singing styles, and hand gestures, and he also encouraged the students there to bravely follow their dreams. He said, "If I can bravely follow my dream, then you can definitely do it too."</p>
            <p>Members of the city council also came to speak at the event. Kuomintang City Councilor Chen Wei-jie joked that because most of his family members are men, he understands the hard work of women even more. Democratic Progressive Party City Councilor Zheng Yu-en reminded the female students to protect themselves while chasing their dreams and to set clear body boundaries.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Police Get Ready for Heavy Traffic Before Mid-Autumn Festival Holiday</h1>
            <p>Taipei City traffic officers and volunteer traffic helpers started their shifts early this evening. This is to prepare for many cars that might appear as people travel home for the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. The traffic at the intersection of Keelung Road and Roosevelt Road, which changed to a normal crossroad 5 days ago, was about the same as the past two days, staying normal.</p>
            <p>The Gongguan roundabout at the intersection of Taipei's Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road was changed to a normal crossroad on September 29th. On the first workday after the change, there was heavy traffic during both morning and evening rush hours, which made people complain.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Mayor Chiang Wan-an said yesterday that in the two days after the roundabout was removed, traffic has mostly returned to how it was before. He told departments to keep making the road layout and traffic lights better, and not to relax. He especially told them to be ready for tonight's evening rush hour traffic before the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.</p>
            <p>A reporter rode a motorcycle from Taipei City Hall along Keelung Road at 6 PM today to check the traffic. While staying within the speed limit and not weaving through traffic, it took about 15 minutes to reach the Roosevelt Road intersection. This was faster than the 20 minutes it took at the same time on October 1st and 2nd. The end of the line of cars waiting at the red light was still around the entrance to Lane 114, Section 4 of Keelung Road, just like on October 1st and 2nd.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Traffic Department Director Hsieh Ming-hung said that police traffic officers started guarding major intersections at 4 PM today, preparing for the possible increase in traffic before the holiday. He observed that except for the many cars going from Fuhe Bridge towards Yonghe, the traffic was similar to the past two days. Department staff drove three times from 5 PM onwards to check travel times, and they were also similar to the past two days.</p>
            <p>He said they will continue to watch the traffic, adjust the traffic light timings, and stay in touch with New Taipei City. They will be ready for any sudden situations.</p>

            <h1>Tang Chia-hung Wins All-Around Gymnastics Gold at National Games, Jokes He's Tired</h1>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung, known as the "World Cat King," won the gold medal today in the men's all-around artistic gymnastics at the National Games in Yunlin. He scored a total of 78.598 points, beating many other good athletes. After the competition, he laughed and said, "I really am tired."</p>
            <p>The Yunlin National Games are planned to be held from October 18th to 23rd. However, the artistic gymnastics part was moved earlier this week because it clashed with the World Championships, which start on October 19th. Today was the second day of the competition, and tomorrow there will only be the men's and women's individual event finals.</p>
            <p>Today was the men's all-around artistic gymnastics event. Athletes competed in six different areas: floor exercise, pommel horse, still rings, parallel bars, vault, and horizontal bar. Tang Chia-hung, representing Taipei City, created the biggest difference in scores between himself and other athletes with his 13.300 points in the still rings.</p>
            <p>However, in his best event, the horizontal bar, he only got 12.566 points. Among the 8 athletes in the final, he even scored lower than Chuang Chia-lung, who represented New Taipei City.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung told a Central News Agency reporter that yesterday was the qualifying round for the all-around, and there was also the team competition. He was already very tired. Today, he continued to compete in the all-around final. After finishing the competition, he was truly exhausted.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung laughed and said, "The last time I competed in all six all-around events was at the 2022 World Gymnastics Championships. It's been 3 years since then, and competing again this time was indeed a very good experience."</p>
            <p>He added that when he went to Japan for training in mid-July, he specifically focused on all-around training. He thinks this early preparation helped him finish both the qualifying round and the final within two days.</p>
            <p>However, Tang Chia-hung also said that for the World Gymnastics Championships on October 19th, he will only compete in the horizontal bar. He plans to "first perfect the new difficult movements on the horizontal bar, and for the all-around part, I will take a break for now."</p>
