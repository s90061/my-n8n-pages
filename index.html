            <h1>Hsu Chia-ching Visits STUF Headquarters, Shares NGO and Government Experience</h1>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching, who leads the Overseas Community Affairs Council, visited the headquarters of the STUF United Fund, a non-governmental organization (NGO), in New York today. She talked about her experience working with NGOs and running them. She also shared her deep feelings about how hard it was for Taiwan to achieve its democracy and social development, after visiting Taiwanese communities in Latin America recently.</p>
            <p>The STUF United Fund (STUF) is made up of Taiwanese businesspeople from North America. It is a member of the UN Global Compact and has a special role to advise the UN Economic and Social Council (UN-ECOSOC).</p>
            <p>Members of STUF have been working for a long time on global public health and promoting business responsibility. In recent years, they have also focused on training young students from Taiwan and new generations of Taiwanese Americans in North America. This helps continue their important work in international charity and Taiwan's involvement.</p>
            <p>On the 11th, Hsu Chia-ching visited the STUF headquarters, which opened in Manhattan, New York, in July. She learned about STUF's main work recently and also congratulated them on their new office.</p>
            <p>She said that over the past few years, the STUF United Fund has developed a clearer structure. STUF has been a UN NGO since 2016. During this time, they have tried many new things. Some were difficult, and some went smoothly. They worked very hard during this process.</p>
            <p>She said: "STUF has big goals around the world. They hope to offer all kinds of help and services, just like the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals."</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching, who has experience with NGOs in Taiwan and other countries, said that NGOs need to have clearer goals to be more effective. Especially with limited resources, if their plans are too big and they have too many projects, results will appear slowly or even get lost.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching recently visited Taiwanese communities in many South American countries. At the STUF headquarters, near the UN headquarters, she listened to reports from STUF staff in various US states and new members. She also shared her feelings about meeting local people and overseas Taiwanese in Latin America.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching believes that Central and South America have many resources and good weather, and their people work hard. But their economic and social development has not been impressive. There is a very big difference in how countries develop. Politics is the biggest reason for this. She noted that in modern times, only the Americas, from north to south, have not had a major war.</p>
            <p>She stressed that Taiwan has good government, and it is a strong democratic country. This is very special. All people in Taiwan know they must work together to achieve these things. Many other countries had to go through bloody revolutions and wars.</p>
            <p>She said: "Over the past few decades, Taiwan has gone through political changes and social changes without paying a very high price. It has been able to keep improving and developing. This is our luck, but we must keep working hard to stay ahead. If we make wrong choices, the results could be completely different."</p>

            <h1>U.S. Naval Academy Receives Threat, Enters Lockdown</h1>
            <p>The U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland went into lockdown today because of a threat. The school asked teachers, students, and staff to find a safe place to stay. Later, the local state government said that there was no real threat.</p>
            <p>News from the U.S. Naval Institute reported this afternoon that a spokesperson for the Naval Academy confirmed the news. The Naval Support Activity Annapolis, which is near the Naval Academy, is working with local police to respond to the threat. The school told all teachers, students, and staff to stay in a safe place.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson also said that as a safety measure, "the base is locked down." This situation is still changing, and they will give more information when they have it.</p>
            <p>Earlier, 11 News reported that a local police spokesperson said, "We cannot confirm there is a threat right now, but we are searching the area to be very careful."</p>
            <p>Later, 11 News reported that the office of Maryland Governor Wes Moore said, "After working with local, state, and federal police, there is no real threat to the Naval Academy at this time."</p>
            <p>The report mentioned that before this investigation at the Naval Academy, other universities across the United States also received threats. These included seven colleges that traditionally serve Black students. These schools had to close or go into lockdown because of the threats.</p>

            <h1>Belarus Releases 52 Political Prisoners; Lithuanian President Thanks Trump for Help</h1>
            <p>Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda held an urgent press conference today. He announced that Belarus has let go of 52 political prisoners. These prisoners include citizens from different countries, like Lithuania. They have safely arrived in Lithuania. President Nauseda thanked former US President Trump for helping with this.</p>
            <p>According to Lithuania's national radio (LRT), those who were released include people who oppose the government, journalists, and people who protested against the government. There are also citizens from other countries.</p>
            <p>Among them, Elena Romanauskiene, a Lithuanian citizen, was also set free. She used to be a marketing manager at a health resort owned by Belarus. Belarus accused her of sharing information about important Belarusian officials who visited the resort, and then put her in prison.</p>
            <p>Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said he worked very hard to make sure Romanauskiene was released. He especially thanked Donald Trump for being involved in the whole process. He also said that more than 1,000 political prisoners are still in jail in Belarus. He believes they should keep working to free them. He also told Lithuanian citizens not to go to Belarus.</p>
            <p>This release was announced today after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko met with John Coale, a high-ranking official from the Trump administration. The list of released people includes 14 foreign citizens. Lukashenko said this was "at the request of the US President." According to CNN, the released people include 6 Lithuanians, 2 Latvians, 2 Poles, 2 Germans, and 1 French and 1 British person.</p>
            <p>CNN quoted US officials saying that the US agreed to partly lift sanctions on Belavia, Belarus's state-owned airline. This would allow the airline to buy parts for Boeing planes. US officials also said that the talks covered regional safety and Belarus using illegal immigrants as a political weapon.</p>
            <p>The list of released prisoners also includes Mikola Statkevich, a well-known opposition leader in Belarus. He ran for president in 2010. After the election in 2020, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for protesting. The human rights group Viasna said that no one has known what happened to him since early 2023.</p>
            <p>TASS, a state-owned Russian news agency, reported that this release was "for humanitarian reasons" and a "goodwill gesture." It was in response to requests from Trump and other world leaders.</p>
            <p>Nauseda stressed that this action is not related to removing or making Western sanctions on Belarus less strict. However, he admitted that it is "positive news in a dark time" for the region.</p>
