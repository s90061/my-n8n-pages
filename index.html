            <h1>New York Mayoral Election Debate: Mandani Continues to Lead Strongly</h1>
            <p>Today, New York held its first TV debate for the mayoral election. The Democratic candidate, Zohran Mamdani, debated with Andrew Cuomo, a former New York governor who is not part of a political party. They talked about housing prices, taxes, public safety, and President Trump. Polls show that Mandani is still far ahead after some candidates left the race. It is very likely that he will become the young mayor at 34 years old.</p>
            <p>Zohran Mamdani, a New York State Assemblyman nominated by the Democratic Party, Andrew Cuomo, who ran independently after not being nominated in the Democratic primary, and Curtis Sliwa, nominated by the Republican Party, took part in the first TV debate for the New York mayoral election on October 16. NBC New York and Politico organized this debate.</p>
            <p>The current Democratic mayor, Eric Adams, left the race on September 28. So, the election is now a competition between Mandani and Cuomo. American media reported earlier that Donald Trump's team was worried about Mandani possibly winning. They wanted to persuade other candidates to stop running and focus votes on Cuomo.</p>
            <p>The debate focused on how affordable life is in New York, the business environment, taxes, public safety, police, and immigration. Cuomo's ideas included making rent cheaper, lowering crime rates, improving education, creating jobs, and making the city more hopeful.</p>
            <p>Cuomo said that reports about him meeting with Trump to discuss the election were not true. He also criticized past New York mayors who failed because they lacked management experience, suggesting voters should not make the same mistake again.</p>
            <p>Mandani emphasized that he would keep fighting against Trump and ensure that New Yorkers can afford to live in the city. He thought Cuomo's criticism about his lack of political experience was not relevant to New York City.</p>
            <p>Mandani, who has been leading in the polls, paid attention to the situation with immigrants. He said that people in America are slowly becoming unhappy with Trump's tough ways of dealing with illegal immigration.</p>
            <p>Politico's analysis showed that Mandani, who has a strong presence, led the two-hour debate even though he was against two older and more experienced politicians. He performed much better than in the primary election, where he was less confident and sometimes seemed confused. Cuomo appeared more formal and serious, reciting facts, which was more suitable for a legal discussion than a lively TV debate.</p>
            <p>Mandani, who will be 34 on October 18, wants to freeze rent, make buses free, build many public homes, increase taxes for rich people, and get rid of special classes for talented students in public schools. Republicans and the Democratic establishment believe his ideas are too far left and might change American politics in the future.</p>
            <p>For the past two months, people not supporting Mandani tried to unite other candidates, but they could not stop Mandani's strong lead. Before the debate, Fox News showed a poll. It said that 52% of possible voters supported Mandani, 28% supported Cuomo, and 14% supported Sliwa. This was the first time Mandani's support in polls went over 50%.</p>
            <p>New York City will vote for its mayor on November 4. Early voting will be open from October 25 to November 2. The next debate will take place on October 22.</p>

            <h1>Taichung's Zhongxiao Night Market Adds Motorcycle Parking Lot, Opens October 17 for Easier Shopping</h1>
            <p>Taichung's Zhongxiao Night Market is a popular food area. Cars and motorcycles often park illegally on the roads and in the small streets around it. So, the Transportation Bureau built a "Zhongxiao Motorcycle Parking Lot" at the corner of Zhongxiao Road and Lane 195. It opened today, October 17. It has 80 spots for motorcycles, making parking safe.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Transportation Bureau released a press statement today. It said that Zhongxiao Night Market in the South District of Taichung is an old and popular food area. Many traditional snack stalls and special restaurants are there. It attracts many locals and tourists who come to eat. Because of this, motorcycles often park illegally on nearby roads and alleys. This makes it hard for people to walk and causes traffic problems.</p>
            <p>Yeh Chao-fu, the head of the Transportation Bureau, said that the new Zhongxiao Motorcycle Parking Lot is close to the night market. It will help with the need for motorcycle parking during busy times. This will make traffic better around the area and improve the overall environment.</p>
            <p>The Transportation Bureau explained that building the parking lot included preparing the land and paving it with asphalt. Based on the space and needs, about 80 motorcycle parking spots were marked. The whole parking lot has LED streetlights, so it is bright at night, making it safer and more comfortable.</p>
            <p>The parking lot's design also includes green elements. Maple trees are planted at the entrance to provide shade and a welcoming look. Large-leaf boxwood and red-tip photinia hedges are placed at the borders and in separate areas. This creates clear paths and makes the parking area good for the environment, reducing carbon and being friendly for motorcycles.</p>
