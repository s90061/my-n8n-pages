**Bitcoin Price Hits New Record, Over US$113,700**

Bitcoin, the largest digital currency, reached a new high today. This happened because more big investors want to buy it, and because US President Donald Trump has been supportive of digital currencies.

Reuters reported that Bitcoin reached its highest price ever today at US$113,734.64. Its price has gone up about 21% this year.

In March, Trump signed an order to create a special reserve for digital currencies. He also chose officials who are positive about digital currencies, like Paul Atkins for the SEC and David Sacks for AI at the White House. Trump's family business is also getting into digital currencies. A document from July 8 showed that "Trump Media & Technology Group" is thinking about starting a fund (ETF) that invests in Bitcoin and other digital currencies.

**UK-France Summit Leaders Reaffirm Commitment to Peace in Taiwan Strait**

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron held their 37th summit in London today. After the meeting, they released a joint statement. In the statement, they said that the UK and France will work together for peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula, South China Sea, East China Sea, and the Taiwan Strait. They also asked for a peaceful solution to issues between Taiwan and China.

Macron visited the UK from July 8 to 10. Today, he met with Starmer at the Prime Minister's home in Downing Street, London. The joint statement after their meeting talked about how they will work together on foreign policy, defense, economy, energy, technology, and illegal immigration. The statement said that what those helping Russia in its war against Ukraine have done shows that security in Europe and the Indo-Pacific region are closely linked. The UK and France will work more closely to support a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

The UK and France also updated their defense agreement from 2010. This agreement might now include French military bases on RÃ©union Island in the Indian Ocean and New Caledonia and French Polynesia in the South Pacific. They also agreed to work more together on cybersecurity and new types of threats, using artificial intelligence (AI). For economic and technology cooperation, the summit statement mentioned that the UK and France will work to make the European civilian nuclear power supply chain more diverse and remove Russian parts. They will also work more together in areas like AI, supercomputers, important minerals, satellites, and protecting important structures, including putting more money into the European satellite company, Eutelsat Group.
