            <p>Today is National Sports Day and also the day the Ministry of Sports officially opened. Premier Cho Jung-tai posted many photos of himself exercising on Facebook. The photos showed him doing bodyweight exercises and playing football. He said he tries to exercise whenever he has free time from work. He asked everyone to exercise to be healthy and feel good.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Sports started this morning. President Lai Ching-te said before that sports are a sign of a strong country. Sports can make people healthy and unite the country. The government will work hard to make Taiwan stronger through sports. It will focus on five main goals: increasing sports funding, improving resources for athletes, promoting sports for everyone, supporting fair sports for all, and developing the sports industry.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai shared several photos of himself exercising on Facebook. These included doing planks, playing football, and learning fencing. He said that to stay healthy and have enough energy for his daily work, he tries to use small breaks between meetings and events. He lays out a yoga mat and does bodyweight exercises. He hopes that people will exercise more to stay healthy and energetic.</p>
            <p>The first head of the Ministry of Sports is Li Yang, an Olympic badminton gold medalist. Cheng Shih-chung, the Director-General of the Sports Administration, and Huang Chi-huang, the CEO of the National Sports Science Center, are the political vice ministers.

            <h1>Green Groups Ask for 52% Carbon Cut by 2035 to Speed Up Net-Zero Efforts</h1>
            <p>Changing to digital ways is happening in businesses now. Artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching net-zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for the government and companies. These are important for Taiwan's future success. The Central News Agency's team is reporting on how the government and different businesses are using AI to make work better and create new green ideas. This shows Taiwan's industry growing again.</p>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Hsiung-feng, Taipei, September 9) The Ministry of Environment will hold a meeting today about NDC3.0. Environmental groups are asking for bigger goals: cutting carbon by 52% by 2035, promising to raise carbon prices by 2035, and including plans for industry to remove carbon and stop using coal in factories. These changes would help Taiwan reach net-zero faster.</p>
            <p>At the start of the year, President Lai Ching-te announced goals at the Presidential Office's Climate Change Committee. Compared to 2005, Taiwan aims to cut carbon by 32% (plus or minus 2%) by 2032 and by 38% (plus or minus 2%) by 2035.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Environment is holding a meeting about the "Republic of China (Taiwan) 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC3.0) Draft." They will explain the 2035 carbon reduction goals and the NDC 3.0 draft. They want to hear ideas from different groups. Because of this, environmental groups held a press conference today called "Taiwan NDC3.0 Civil Review."</p>
            <p>Chao Chia-wei, the director of the Taiwan Climate Action Network Research Center, said that NDC3.0 is a key plan for the next 10 years. He compared Taiwan's NDC to those of other countries and found three main problems. First, if Taiwan wants to reach net-zero by 2050, it needs to cut carbon by 52% by 2035. Second, there are no clear carbon reduction goals for important areas like industry and energy. Third, the way decisions are made is not strong enough. For example, the Presidential Office's Climate Committee only gives advice, it doesn't truly make changes happen.</p>
            <p>Chao Chia-wei believes that the Climate Committee had a good start in the past year, but it still has weaknesses. For instance, there are not enough plans for carbon pricing by 2035, and not enough is being done to stop giving money to fossil fuel companies. He also said that policies that increase investment in fossil fuel production should be checked, as they go against carbon reduction goals.</p>
            <p>Chen Yu-ping, the secretary-general of the Taiwan Environmental Planning Association, said that solar power is still important for clean energy. However, public support for it has decreased from last year to this year. She thinks Taiwan should connect green energy plans with land use plans. This would create better tools for planning space, which would help land value, culture, and local management for a long time. She also said that after Typhoon Danas, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs should have made plans to help green energy make the energy system stronger.</p>
            <p>Tang Lin-hsiang, a researcher at the Environmental Rights Foundation, pointed out that Singapore has clearly stated in its NDC that its carbon tax will increase. It will go from 25 Singapore dollars per ton now to 45 Singapore dollars by 2026 (about NT$1065). By 2030, it will be 50 to 80 Singapore dollars. This shows their strong commitment to cutting carbon. But Taiwan's carbon fee is currently only NT$300, and there are many discounts. He said the lowest price should be much higher and should go up over time to speed up the move to net-zero.</p>
            <p>Tang Wei-chieh, a specialist at the Homemakers Union and Foundation, said that the plan for a net-zero green lifestyle doesn't clearly show the important role of local governments. Also, the energy change plan doesn't include enough about local areas and Indigenous peoples. He gave an example: the UK's NDC includes many levels of government working together, clearly stating each local area's responsibilities and important policies. Canada also clearly says that everyone in society and all levels of government must work together, with each province and territory helping.</p>

            <h1>WB Boxing World Championships: Chen Nien-chin Easily Moves to Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Li Chien-chung, Taipei, September 9) In the WB World Boxing Championships in Liverpool, UK, Taiwan's excellent boxer Chen Nien-chin easily won her first fight today. She won 5-0 against Jenni from Switzerland in the women's 65 kg class and moved on to the top 8.</p>
            <p>Chen Nien-chin is 28 years old and won a bronze medal in women's boxing at the Paris Olympics. Today, she competed in the round of 16 at the first World Championships held by the World Boxing (WB) federation.</p>
            <p>Chen Nien-chin was the last person from the Taiwanese team to compete. But when she started, she was very ready to fight Anna Julia Jenni from Switzerland. In the first round, her defense was very good. Her counter-punches hit her opponent well. Four judges gave her 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the second round, her opponent attacked more, trying to get close many times. But Chen Nien-chin kept her distance well and did not let her opponent succeed. All five judges gave her 10 points for this round.</p>
            <p>In the last round, both boxers attacked a bit less. Chen Nien-chin, who was ahead after the first two rounds, did not rush. She waited for chances to defend and counter-attack. She won the match successfully.</p>
            <p>Her coach, Ko Wen-ming, said in an interview with the Central News Agency that Chen Nien-chin had to wait many days to fight, so she was a bit excited. He added, "But she performed very steadily in the first round. She did not rush her punches and used the plan they made before the fight very well."</p>
            <p>Coach Ko Wen-ming stressed that the first match is always the hardest. He said, "Moving to the quarterfinals is the first step. Of course, the main goal is to win a medal."</p>
