            <h1>Michigan Governor Visits Singapore; Prime Minister Wong Says Cooperation with US Helps Competitiveness</h1>
            <p>Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer is visiting Singapore. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said that Singapore relies on trade. He added that working with the US at both the federal and state levels helps Singapore stay strong as a trusted global hub and keeps its economy competitive.</p>
            <p>Governor Whitmer recently visited Singapore. Prime Minister Wong posted on Facebook last night that he was happy about her visit. As a graduate of the University of Michigan, he was pleased that Whitmer and her team came to Singapore. They came to talk about working together in technology, advanced manufacturing, and making supply chains stronger.</p>
            <p>Lawrence Wong has a master's degree in economics from the University of Michigan and a master's degree in public administration from Harvard Kennedy School. He started his career in public service as an economic analyst at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.</p>
            <p>Since the free trade agreement between Singapore and the United States began in 2004, trade between the two countries has continued to grow. The US sells more to Singapore than it buys. Singapore's tax rate is 10% on products on former US President Trump's tariff list, which is quite low.</p>
            <p>Experts, like Maybank economist Lee Shun-rong, believe that Singapore faces the lowest US tariffs in Asia. This makes its exports more competitive than those of other US trading partners. Companies from other countries that have higher tariffs might think about making more products in Singapore. A recent report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development said that Singapore received the most foreign direct investment ever. In 2024, it was ranked second globally, just after the United States.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Wong said that Singapore is a small, open country that relies on trade. It needs to have strong relationships with countries all over the world. The US is already the biggest source of foreign investment for Singapore. It is also Singapore's main partner for trade in services and its third-biggest partner for trade in goods.</p>
            <p>Wong said, "Our cooperation at both the federal and state levels further strengthens Singapore's position as a trusted global center. It also helps us stay competitive." He hopes that Governor Whitmer's visit will bring good results for people in both Singapore and the US.</p>
            <p>Whitmer used to be a lawyer. She is an American politician from the Democratic Party and has been the Governor of Michigan since 2019. She has also visited Taiwan before to announce the opening of Michigan's office in Taiwan. This was to attract Taiwanese businesses to invest in the US and to make economic ties stronger.</p>

            <h1>TSMC Fails to Go Up; Taiwan Stock Market Drops Back to Flat After Starting Higher</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan stock market started high this morning but then went down. Around 10 AM, the market index became negative. By 10:30 AM, the main market index had a small gain of 6.51 points, reaching 24078.24 points. The total value of shares traded was about 206.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>TSMC's stock price started high this morning, going up by as much as 10 NTD to 1175 NTD, but then it fell. Hon Hai's stock price went up by as much as 5 NTD to 203.5 NTD. MediaTek's stock price went up by as much as 20 NTD to 1380 NTD. After their initial rises, the gains for all these stocks became smaller.</p>
            <p>Last week, Nittobo, a big Japanese company that makes glass fiber, decided to spend about 15 billion Japanese Yen to build a new factory and make more products. Because of this, the idea that there would be a shortage of materials for PCBs (printed circuit boards) did not come true. Recently, the prices of glass fiber stocks, which were popular, dropped. Taiwan Glass's stock price fell to its lowest allowed price for the day, 28.75 NTD. Fuqiao's stock price also fell by more than 9% during the trading day.</p>
            <p>Grand Fortune Securities said that on August 7th, the US set new tariffs (taxes on imported goods) between 15% and 50%. The uncertainty about these tariffs is now fading, and this has made the stock market react positively. Also, the popularity of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and technology stocks continues. In addition, the US Federal Reserve Chairman Powell suggested that interest rates might be lowered in September. All these things have made the market more active.</p>
            <p>Grand Fortune Securities believes that the market is now focused on two main things: "AI and the Fed's policy." The Taiwan stock market has successfully gone higher than its previous best. AI-related stocks, like those for advanced semiconductor manufacturing and important parts for AI servers, are worth watching.</p>

            <h1>Homeowner Hires Workers for House Repairs, But They Are 5 Thieves Who Stole Valuables</h1>
            <p>A house in Miaoli City was recently being renovated. Unexpectedly, the owner hired a group of workers who were all thieves. They stole items from the house late at night, including two large wooden treasure basins. The owner lost about 800,000 New Taiwan Dollars. After an investigation, the police went to Hsinchu County and arrested Mr. Zhong and four other people involved in the crime.</p>
            <p>Xue Yu-hong, the deputy head of the investigation team at Miaoli Police Station, said today that they received a report from a citizen. The report said that wooden treasure basins and many other decorations from a house in Miaoli City had been stolen. The total loss was about 800,000 New Taiwan Dollars. The police quickly formed a special team to investigate. They looked at security camera videos and found a truck that looked suspicious. By tracking the truck, they found the people who were likely involved in the crime.</p>
            <p>The police found out that the homeowner, whose items were stolen, hired a foreman named Peng in early August. Peng then hired Mr. Zhong (57 years old) and four other workers to fix up the inside of the house. During the repairs, many decorative items kept in the house slowly disappeared. The homeowner became suspicious of the workers and called the police.</p>
            <p>The police asked Prosecutor Wu Jia-wei from the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office to lead the investigation. After checking the security camera videos, they found that Mr. Zhong and the others drove a truck to the house at night. They climbed a ladder at the back of the house to get inside. They then took two large wooden treasure basins made of juniper wood, which were worth about 700,000 NTD.</p>
            <p>On August 27, the police got a search warrant from the Miaoli District Court. They went to the Xinpu Township area in Hsinchu County. They arrested the foreman Peng and Mr. Zhong, along with three other people. At Mr. Zhong's rented place, they found the two large wooden treasure basins and the stolen decorations. All the stolen items were returned to the homeowner. After questioning, the five suspects were sent to the Miaoli District Prosecutors Office for investigation because of aggravated theft.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli Police Station reminds people that when they renovate their homes, they should keep valuable items safely. They should store them carefully or put them in a safe. This will prevent thieves from targeting them.</p>
