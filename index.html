            <h1>CDMO Business Grows, Bora Pharmaceuticals Earns NT$19.5 Per Share in First Half of Year</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals has announced its financial report for the first half of the year. The company's total sales were NT$9.347 billion. Because its CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) business grew a lot, the company's net profit was NT$2.016 billion. This is an 11.9% increase from last year. The profit per share was NT$19.5, which means they earned almost NT$20 for each share.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals said today that their CDMO business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year, reaching over NT$5.01 billion. This includes orders within the company. This growth happened because they increased their production ability and started making new types of medicines. However, there were some delays in production at their sterile injectable drug factory in Maryland, USA, and their factory in Zhunan, Taiwan. This was due to a time of change as they brought new parts of the business together. But this situation got better in June, and delayed orders will be finished soon. The company has a clear view of future orders, and the demand for their services remains strong for a long time.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals is continuing to invest more to expand its CDMO business around the world. Their factory in Canada recently added a new production line that can fill strong skin medicine. This will allow them to produce these orders faster, in larger amounts, and with more flexibility. This new line will help the Canada factory grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injectable drug line at the Maryland, USA, factory is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. Also, the AST isolated filling system will start working automatically in 2026. In addition, the Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, has made its clinical-stage clients into long-term partners in the first half of this year. More drug companies are now signing agreements because they want to make their products in the United States.</p>
            <p>The chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, Sheng Pao-hsi, said that the company has added 8 new CDMO clients this year. Most of these new clients are being served by the Maple Grove factory in North America, which focuses on local production. This year, new orders worth US$138 million have been added, mostly for the Canada factory and the sterile drug factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was part of the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started its operations. The expansion to 2000 liters has made many US drug companies, who are developing late-stage medicines, contact them for business.</p>
