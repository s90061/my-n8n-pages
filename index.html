US retail sales saw a small increase in May, but this mainly happened because people bought more gas and groceries. This shows that consumers are still being careful with their money due to high prices. They are choosing to spend on things they need rather than things they want. Shoppers spent less on items like electronics, furniture, and sports equipment. This trend suggests that people are trying to save money where they can. Economists say that while the economy is still growing, it is doing so at a slower pace. People are feeling the impact of inflation, which makes everyday goods more expensive, and are adjusting their spending habits to fit their budgets.

**New Study Shows Benefits of Four-Day Work Week**

Recent research from trials of a four-day work week has shown positive results for both employees and companies. Workers who participated in these trials reported feeling less stressed and healthier overall. They also said they had more time for personal activities and hobbies. For businesses, the studies found that productivity did not decrease; in fact, some companies even saw an increase in output. Another key benefit for companies was fewer sick days taken by staff and a lower number of employees leaving their jobs. While the four-day work week is not easy to implement for all types of work, especially in jobs requiring constant service or long hours, the new findings suggest it could be a successful model for many. This approach is gaining more interest globally, not just from small businesses but also from larger organizations looking for new ways to improve work-life balance and efficiency.

**Popular Cities Struggle with Too Many Tourists**

Many popular European cities, like Amsterdam, Venice, and Barcelona, are facing a problem called "overtourism." This means too many tourists are visiting, which is making life difficult for the local residents. People living in these cities are complaining about very high rents, overcrowded public transport, and increased noise. They also feel that the unique culture and character of their cities are changing because of the large number of visitors. As a result, locals in some areas are starting to protest, asking for changes. City governments are now trying to find solutions. Some measures include banning large cruise ships from city centers, increasing taxes for tourists, and putting limits on short-term holiday rentals. The main goal is to find a balance where tourism can still bring economic benefits, but not at the cost of the quality of life for the people who live there.
