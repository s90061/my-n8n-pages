            <h1>Control Yuan: Chen Chu Followed Rules for Leave and Gave Up Her Monthly Salary</h1>
            <p>Control Yuan President Chen Chu was in the hospital because she was sick. People were talking about whether she still got her salary while on leave. Today, the Control Yuan said that Chen Chu followed all the rules for taking time off. Also, since she started her leave, she has chosen not to take her monthly salary. This money has been put back into the government's bank account at the beginning of each month.</p>
            <p>At the end of last year, Chen Chu had a cold and went to the hospital. During a health check, doctors found a tumor in her right kidney. After an operation, before she could leave the hospital, she had a blood clot in the blood vessels on the left side of her brain. The hospital said at that time that Chen Chu's health was steady, and she was also doing physical therapy.</p>
            <p>Chen Chu is still on sick leave. People have been talking about her salary while she is away. The Control Yuan explained today that Chen Chu's sick leave followed all the rules for government workers.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan also said that Chen Chu has not taken her monthly salary since her leave started. This money has been put back into the national treasury every month. The Control Yuan has received proof of this each time, and everything is officially recorded.</p>

            <h1>Thai Woman Pretends to be a Tourist but Smuggles Drugs into Taoyuan Airport; 15 Kilograms of Marijuana Found, She is Charged</h1>
            <p>Customs officials and airport police at Taoyuan Airport recently checked the luggage of arriving passengers. They used an X-ray machine and saw something strange in a bag from Thailand. When the passenger went to pick up her bag, they stopped her. They found 15.039 kilograms of marijuana. The woman was sent to court for breaking drug laws and has been charged.</p>
            <p>Captain Chang Tsung-lung from the Aviation Police Bureau's criminal investigation team told reporters today that on June 3rd, police and customs officers were checking bags at Taoyuan International Airport. They saw something unusual in the luggage of a Thai tourist, a woman named P (not her real name). They opened the bag and found 26 packages of marijuana, weighing 15.039 kilograms. They immediately reported it to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office to start an investigation.</p>
            <p>Chang Tsung-lung said that the investigation team found the 27-year-old woman flew to Taiwan from Bangkok, Thailand. Her family was having money problems. Police think a drug group tricked her into carrying drugs to Taiwan by pretending she was a tourist. She tried to hide the drugs by acting like she was just visiting. But the woman said she was only helping a friend bring the bags and did not get paid. She tried to say this to avoid punishment.</p>
            <p>Chang Tsung-lung said it was good that the special team found the drugs in time, so they did not reach the public. The woman was sent to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office for breaking drug laws and was charged in mid-August. The aviation police will continue to work hard to stop drugs at the border. They remind people that carrying illegal drugs can lead to a life sentence in prison or at least 10 years in prison. There can also be a fine of up to 15 million New Taiwan Dollars. They warn everyone not to try to break the law.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Health to Continue Plan for Publicly-Paid Doctors; Medical Groups Say Policy Changes Too Much</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) has decided to keep its plan for doctors who are paid by the government to work in important medical areas. Doctors' groups are very unhappy. They say the government keeps changing its mind and cannot be trusted. They believe that trying to fix the lack of doctors in special fields by training more government-paid doctors is a bad idea. They think this will cause problems for healthcare in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>To help with the problem of not having enough doctors in rural areas, the MOHW started the "Plan for Training Publicly-Paid Doctors in Key Medical Fields" in 2016. This plan hoped to provide more doctors for distant places and special medical areas. The second part of this plan will finish in the 2025 school year.</p>
            <p>Now, the government has decided to continue the plan. The Minister of Health and Welfare, Shih Chung-liang, explained yesterday that they need more doctors in rural areas. Also, there is a growing need for doctors who can work in many different medical areas.</p>
            <p>After this news came out, many doctors were upset. The National Federation of Physicians Associations quickly released a statement with three main worries. First, they said the policy changes too often, and this makes people lose trust. Two months ago, the government said it would stop the plan, but now it is continuing it. This makes the government's plans seem unreliable and confuses both the public and doctors.</p>
            <p>Second, they said that the old way of checking doctors' skills is not being used, which means new doctors cannot join the program. Third, they believe that using these government-paid positions for too long is not the right way to fix the problem. The Federation of Physicians Associations strongly asked that the number of medical students should be decided based on Taiwan's long-term healthcare needs and expert opinions. They said this should not change often because of short-term government choices.</p>
            <p>Today, the Primary Care Medical Association also spoke out. They asked why the government thinks training more publicly-paid doctors will solve the problem of not having enough doctors in important fields. They said this is like looking for fish in a tree. To truly solve the shortage of doctors in busy, serious, difficult, and rare medical fields, the government should pay them more money. They should not force more public medical students to enter these fields with low pay.</p>
            <p>The Primary Care Medical Association believes that doctors in busy, serious, difficult, and rare fields are in short supply because they work long hours, face high risks, get paid less, and have a poor quality of life. Their pay is not fair compared to doctors in less risky fields. They think that adding more government-paid students to these important fields will only make doctors' rights ignored, causing them to leave and find other jobs.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Medical Association also shared many concerns. They said that the problems with the public medical student system have been known for many years. These problems include very long contracts (10 years), strict punishments if doctors break the contract, and doctors being unhappy with medical conditions in rural areas. This means that when the contract ends, not many doctors stay, showing that the system does not work as it should.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Medical Association stated that the government's recent announcement shows that it has not fully thought about the future need for medical staff in rural areas. They made a big decision about training doctors based only on a quick feeling about a lack of staff, without asking many groups or experts for their opinions. In Taiwan, many people want to become doctors, so this plan will likely still attract young students. However, the association believes this will cause future problems for Taiwan's healthcare system.</p>
