Nvidia, a major computer chip company, has recently reached a total value of over $3 trillion. This makes it almost as valuable as Apple, the well-known tech giant. Nvidia's growth is mainly due to the very high demand for its special computer chips, which are essential for artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

On Wednesday, Nvidia's shares went up by 5.2%, increasing its total market value to $3.012 trillion. For a long time, Apple was considered the world's most valuable company. However, Microsoft currently holds that title, with a market value of $3.15 trillion. This year, Nvidia's stock has risen by more than 147%, adding over $1.8 trillion to its value. This rapid increase shows just how important its processors are for the developing field of AI, where demand is currently much higher than the available supply.

**Early Summer Heatwave Hits Parts of Europe, Raising Alarm**

Parts of Europe are currently experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas. This extreme weather has led to health warnings and concerns about potential wildfires. Countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece are particularly affected, and authorities are advising people on how to stay safe and deal with the heat.

This period of unusually hot weather follows a mild winter and spring, which has raised fears about how intense the rest of the summer might be. Experts who study the climate warn that these early heatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe. They explain that this trend is a clear result of ongoing climate change, which is making extreme weather events more common globally.

**European Airports Expect Travel Chaos This Summer**

Travellers planning to fly across Europe this summer should prepare for possible disruptions. Airports throughout the continent are getting ready for significant problems, including many flight delays and cancellations. These issues are expected because there are not enough staff and due to potential strikes by air traffic controllers.

Big airports like London Heathrow, Amsterdam Schiphol, and Frankfurt are already facing these challenges. Travel experts are giving advice to passengers: they recommend booking flights that can be changed easily, arriving at the airport much earlier than usual, and being ready for long queues. The aviation industry is still trying to fully recover from the effects of the pandemic. Now, with a big increase in people wanting to travel for their summer holidays, the current airport resources are under a lot of pressure.`;
