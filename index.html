Heavy rain in Nepal caused a big flood in a mountain valley. This flood swept away 18 people and destroyed an important bridge to China.

Officials said that one person died because of the flood in the Bhotekoshi river. Also, 17 people are still missing. These missing people include 11 from Nepal and 6 from China.

Floods and landslides often happen in South Asia between June and September. Experts say that climate change is making these natural disasters worse.

**Former Japanese Submarine Commander Says Taiwan Needs More Submarines Quickly**

Taiwan is testing its first submarine, called Hai Kun, and plans to build seven more. A former leader of Japan's submarine fleet, Kazuki Yano, said that Taiwan should build these submarines fast. This would make China's navy use a lot of its energy and money to watch out for Taiwan's submarines, making China's forces less concentrated.

Mr. Yano thinks submarines are very important to stop China from easily moving through the area called the First Island Chain. He also said that Taiwan's submarine project is helped by the US, and if it uses new technology, the submarines could be very strong.

He explained that even though the Taiwan Strait is not very deep, submarines can still work there. If Taiwan has many submarines, China will have to spend a lot of time and effort looking for them, which will divide China's power.

Mr. Yano believes that by 2027, Taiwan will not have enough submarines for China to be very worried. So, he said Taiwan needs to build more submarines quickly and get them ready for fighting.

To avoid friendly submarines (from Taiwan, Japan, and the US) hitting each other, they need to stay in certain areas. Mr. Yano suggested that the US should help organize how these three countries' submarines work together.

About building a special "cave" base for submarines in eastern Taiwan, Mr. Yano said it would cost a lot of money and could still be hit by China's missiles. He suggested that Taiwan should keep its submarines in different ports and bays, with teams to support them. This way, the submarines would be safer and more effective.

**Malaysian Scholar Calls for Diverse Markets After US Puts 25% Tariffs on Malaysia**

US President Donald Trump announced that new taxes, called tariffs, will be put on goods from Malaysia. The new tariff is 25%, which is higher than the old 24%. A Malaysian expert said Malaysia should trade more with places like Europe, India, and other Southeast Asian countries to depend less on the US. He also said that Southeast Asian countries could learn from Europe to make their trade stronger.

Malaysia's Ministry of Trade said that Malaysia values its trade relationship with the US. They want to keep talking to the US to have fair trade that helps both countries.

An expert in economics, Muhammad Najib Razali, said that the US buys a lot of things from Malaysia, like computer chips and parts. The electronics industry is a very big part of what Malaysia sells to other countries, about 40%. These new tariffs will cause problems for this industry.

He also said that tariffs on Malaysian palm oil and farm products have already made less money for Malaysia. The new 25% tariff will make it even harder for these products. Other businesses, like those making wood products, furniture, and other goods, might also face difficulties and higher costs.

To handle this, Mr. Razali suggested that Malaysia should make its economy stronger. He thinks Malaysia should trade more with the European Union, India, the Middle East, and other countries in Southeast Asia. This would help Malaysian businesses find new customers and rely less on the US. He also said Malaysia could become a place where friendly countries send their manufacturing.

Mr. Razali also suggested that Southeast Asian countries could work more closely together, like the countries in Europe do. Malaysia should join more with other Southeast Asian countries in making goods. While helping businesses affected by the tariffs with tax breaks and other support, Malaysia could also try to stop unfair trade through the World Trade Organization if needed.

Earlier tariffs from Trump on Malaysia caused worry, leading to delayed orders. Taiwanese businesses in Malaysia are also concerned about these changing rules. A Taiwanese business leader said that because China's goods to the US are taxed, China is selling more goods cheaply to other parts of the world, which will be a problem for Taiwanese businesses too.
