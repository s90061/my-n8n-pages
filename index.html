<p><b>Apple is Working on At Least 7 Headset Projects, Says Analyst</b></p>

<p>Since Apple introduced its Vision Pro in June 2023, the company has not released any new headset products for two years. However, a new report from an analyst suggests that Apple sees headsets as the next important trend in electronics. The company is currently working on at least seven different projects, including three for the Vision series and four for smart glasses.</p>

<p>Kuo Ming-Chi, an analyst who often shares news about Apple, wrote on Medium today that Apple will not release new headsets in 2026. He expects several new products to come out starting in 2027. Of the seven projects, five have clear release dates, and two are still being decided.</p>

<p>Kuo said that the first Apple headset product to be widely sold will be smart glasses, similar to Ray-Ban glasses. He expects 3 to 5 million units to be shipped in 2027. Because Apple is joining this market, the total market for these types of smart glasses could be more than 10 million units in 2027, making it an important new trend.</p>

<p>Kuo also mentioned that Apple's Vision series and smart glasses have strong hardware development and can work well with other Apple products. However, the challenge is with their AI operating system and software.</p>

<p>Kuo believes that before Apple releases smart glasses with displays, some other brands will release similar products to be first and get attention. But because their technology and design still need improvement, these products will likely only be for a small group of people in the next two years.</p>

<p>Kuo also shared Apple's plans for headsets from 2025 to 2028. A new Vision Pro will have a faster M5 chip instead of the M2, but other features will stay the same. It is expected to start being made in large numbers in the third quarter of 2025, with about 150,000 to 200,000 units shipped in 2025. This product will still be for a small group of users. Its goals are to keep people interested, continue developing its system, reduce extra parts, and explore new uses for mixed reality (XR) headsets.</p>

<p>Another headset product, called Vision Air, is expected to be made in large numbers in the third quarter of 2027. It will have a new design and use the best iPhone processor. It will be more than 40% lighter than the Vision Pro because it will use plastic instead of glass, a lot of magnesium alloy, and fewer sensors. Its price will be much lower than the Vision Pro.</p>

<p>A completely new second-generation Vision Pro is planned to be made in large numbers in the second half of 2028. It will have a new design, be much lighter, and cost less. It will use a processor like those in Mac computers.</p>

<p>For smart glasses, Kuo said Apple plans to produce Ray-Ban-like smart glasses in the second quarter of 2027. He expects 3 to 5 million units to be shipped in 2027. These glasses will come in different materials for the frames and arms. Users will control them with their voice and hand movements. They will not have a display, but their main features will include headphones, a camera, video recording, and AI environment sensing.</p>

<p>Kuo thinks that smart glasses might replace some wireless earbuds and mobile phone cameras in the future. He sees the most growth for these products in the short term, expecting more than 10 million units to be sold by all brands worldwide in 2027.</p>

<p>Kuo also believes Apple will start producing XR glasses in the second half of 2028. These glasses will be controlled by voice and hand movements. They will use LCoS projection and waveguide technology for their display and will show colors. AI will be a key feature for these glasses. Another similar product is also being developed, but it will be made later and is less clear at this time.</p>

<p>Kuo mentioned that Apple was also developing a display accessory that could connect to Apple devices like iPhones to show their screen on glasses. It was supposed to be made in large numbers in the second quarter of 2026. This product weighed about 120 to 130 grams, but other similar products on the market weigh less than 100 grams. Apple decided this product was not competitive and stopped developing it in the fourth quarter of 2024. The company is still discussing what the product will be and what its features will be, and it might start developing it again.</p>

<p><b>Military Bureau: 205 Factory Contractor Followed Rules for Visits, No Illegal Subcontracting</b></p>

<p>Media reported that a contractor for the Military Armament Bureau was accused of illegal subcontracting and not following rules for visits. Today, the Military Armament Bureau Production Manufacturing Center stated that all contractors follow the correct procedures for visits. They also said that the contractor only checked things before repairs, so there was no illegal subcontracting.</p>

<p>Rohm Media reported that on June 12, a maintenance worker from a contractor died suddenly at the Military Armament Bureau Production Manufacturing Center's 205th Factory Guangfu Camp hydraulic machine factory. The report said that a person who gave information claimed the worker was not registered to enter the camp by the contractor. This suggests illegal subcontracting and not following rules for camp visits.</p>

<p>The Military Armament Bureau Production Manufacturing Center released a statement this morning. They said that on June 12, the contractor for the 205th Factory's hydraulic machine repair contract brought workers to check the ice water cooling system before maintenance. They followed all rules for visits, and staff from the factory were with them the whole time. This means everything was done correctly.</p>

<p>The Production Manufacturing Center also said that they checked their maintenance contracts and found that contractors are clearly not allowed to subcontract. They confirmed that the contractor only did a check of the ice water cooling system before repair, so there was no illegal subcontracting.</p>

<p>The Production Manufacturing Center stated that all work follows the "Government Procurement Act" for repairing production machines. They also follow the "Specific Practices for Visitor Control and Procedures" for each factory to make sure rules are followed and the camp is safe.</p>

<p><b>LPGA Dow Championship: Lin Tzu-han and Partner Finish Tied for 18th Place</b></p>

<p>The LPGA Dow Championship, a team golf tournament, finished today. Taiwanese golfer Lin Tzu-han and her partner, Jodi Ewart Shadoff from England, played well together. They scored 64 strokes today. Over four days, they were 13 strokes under par, with a total of 267 strokes. They finished tied for 18th place.</p>

<p>The LPGA Dow Championship started in 2019 and is one of the few team events in the LPGA. It has a total prize money of US$3.3 million (about NT$97.1 million). In the first and third rounds, two players play one ball for the team. In the second and fourth rounds, each of the four players plays their own ball, and the best score on each hole for the team is counted.</p>

<p>Lin Tzu-han, who is new to the LPGA this year, and her partner Jodi Ewart Shadoff were the only Taiwanese team to make the cut. In today's round, where each player played their own ball, Lin and Shadoff helped each other out. If one person got a par, the other would get a birdie. If one got a bogey, the other would get a par. They never made a mistake at the same time. Today, they scored 64 strokes, which was better than their 65 strokes in the second round.</p>

<p>However, because many players scored very low in the final round, Lin Tzu-han and Jodi Ewart Shadoff's ranking went down slightly from the third round.</p>

<p>Lin Tzu-han, who is 25 years old, is a new player on the LPGA tour this year. Before this tournament, she played in five other competitions, but she only made the cut and finished one of them, tied for 70th place. The Dow Championship is her second tournament this year where she made the cut, and she achieved her best ranking of the season so far.</p>
