A woman named Ms. Li, who was the leader of a gold buying group, has been held by the court without visits. This happened after new evidence was found in a case where five family members died in Fengyuan, Taichung. Ms. Li was previously released on bail, but prosecutors arrested her again. The court decided she should be held because there is strong suspicion that she committed fraud and other crimes.

The family of five was found dead at home on July 2nd. Police did not think it was murder. Investigators found that the family joined Ms. Li's gold buying group through a friend. They were told they could buy gold with credit cards and earn money. After a year, the family owed a lot of money. Ms. Li then demanded 5 million New Taiwan Dollars from them, saying they had broken their agreement. She also took them to a pawn shop where they used their house as collateral to borrow 2 million New Taiwan Dollars. The family later also pawned their cars and motorcycles.
