            <h1>US and China May Agree on TikTok; US Lawmaker Worries About China's Influence</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 17 (CNA) The United States and China are close to an agreement about the video app TikTok. This agreement would change who owns TikTok, giving ownership to the US. John Moolenaar, who leads a special US House committee on competition with China, said today that he is concerned about this.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Moolenaar said in a statement: "From early reports, I worry that this agreement might still make the new TikTok use ByteDance's software and apps. This could allow the Chinese Communist Party to keep control or influence."</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, recently said that the US and China have a basic agreement about TikTok. This agreement is designed to move the ownership of TikTok to the US.</p>
            <p>US President Trump also mentioned that he has an agreement with China about TikTok. He said that several large companies want to buy it. He will talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping to confirm all the details.</p>
