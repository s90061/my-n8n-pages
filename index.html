Due to Typhoon Dujuan, Taipei City's traffic department has extended the time people can park their cars in certain areas. This is for red and yellow lines near floodgates in Zhongshan, Songshan, Shilin, Wanhua, and Datong districts. Cars must be moved by 12 PM on July 7th. If cars are not moved by then, they will be towed, and owners will have to pay a fine. Also, parking fees will start again.

The Central Weather Bureau said that the wind and rain on July 7th in Taipei are not strong enough to stop work or school. So, July 7th will be a normal working day. The water department has also said that all floodgates and ramps were opened for normal use at 11 PM on July 6th. This extended parking time is to help people move their vehicles.

**Typhoon Dujuan Lands in Chiayi**

Typhoon Dujuan hit Taiwan and landed in Budai, Chiayi County, at about 11:40 PM on July 6th. This is an important event because it is the first time a medium-strength typhoon has landed in central Taiwan since 1986.

Early on July 7th, the typhoon's center was about 30 kilometers southwest of Chiayi. It was moving towards the northeast and then north-northeast. In the past, other typhoons have also landed in central and southern Taiwan, causing a lot of damage.

**Hsieh Su-wei Reaches Wimbledon Quarterfinals**

Taiwanese tennis star Hsieh Su-wei and her partner, JeÄ¼ena Ostapenko from Latvia, have reached the quarterfinals of the Wimbledon women's doubles tournament. They played against Ekaterina Alexandrova from Russia and Zhang Shuai from China and won easily with scores of 6-4 and 6-0.

Hsieh Su-wei, who is 39 years old, has won the Wimbledon women's doubles title four times before. Earlier this year, she and Ostapenko were also runners-up at the Australian Open. During their match, there was a rain delay in the second set that lasted about 30 minutes. After the rain stopped, Hsieh and Ostapenko played even better and won the match. Their next opponents in the quarterfinals will be Anna Kalinskaya from Russia and Sorana CÃ®rstea from Romania.
