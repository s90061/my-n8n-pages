            <h1>Six Taiwanese Companies on Fortune Global 500 List This Year; TSMC Moves Up 60 Spots</h1>
            <p>The American "Fortune" magazine recently published its 2025 list of the world's 500 biggest companies. Six companies from Taiwan are on the list. Hon Hai (Foxconn) is ranked 28th, and TSMC is ranked 126th, which is 60 spots higher than before.</p>
            <p>This year, the Fortune Global 500 companies together made 41.7 trillion US dollars in sales. This is 1.8% more than in 2023. Their total sales are more than one-third of the world's total economic output (GDP). These companies also employ 70.1 million people in total.</p>
            <p>Walmart, a big retail company from the US, is number one for the 12th year in a row. It is also the 20th time it has been number one since 1995.</p>
            <p>The top 10 companies on this year's list did not change much from last year. But among the companies lower down on the list, technology companies moved up a lot. For example, Meta Platforms, a big American social media company that owns Facebook and Instagram, moved up 25 spots to rank 41st.</p>
            <p>Nvidia, a big company that makes AI chips, moved up even more, by 156 spots, to rank 66th. China's electric car company BYD also moved up 52 spots to rank 91st.</p>
            <p>The six Taiwanese companies on this year's list are, in order: Hon Hai (28th), TSMC (126th), Quanta (348th), Pegatron (461st), CPC Corporation, Taiwan (494th), and Wistron (496th). Quanta moved up 96 spots from last year.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Tesla Buys LFP Batteries from South Korea's LG Energy Solution to Rely Less on China</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that the American electric car company Tesla has signed a deal worth 4.3 billion US dollars (about 128 billion New Taiwan Dollars) to buy batteries for energy storage systems from LG Energy Solution, a South Korean company. Tesla is doing this to rely less on products from China because of import taxes.</p>
            <p>One person who knows about the deal also said that LG Energy Solution (LGES) will send the LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries to Tesla from its factory in Michigan, USA.</p>
            <p>Earlier today, LG Energy Solution announced they signed a 4.3 billion dollar contract for three years to supply LFP batteries globally. However, they did not say who the customer was or if the batteries would be for cars or energy storage systems.</p>
            <p>Vaibhav Taneja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said in April that US import taxes greatly affected their energy business. This was because Tesla bought LFP batteries from China.</p>
            <p>At that time, he also said, "We will also try to get more supplies from companies outside of China, but this will take time."</p>

            <h1>Federal Reserve Keeps Interest Rates the Same Again, Resists Pressure from Trump</h1>
            <p>The US Federal Reserve (Fed) decided today to keep interest rates unchanged again. This decision was made even though President Trump repeatedly asked them to lower the rates.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Fed officials want to wait and see the economic information from this summer. This is because Trump's tax policies often change, and the effect of taxes on prices takes time to show. They want to check how prices are affected.</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve had a meeting from July 29th to 30th. During the meeting, they thought about changing interest rates. They also wanted to find a good balance between controlling rising prices (inflation) and making sure there are enough jobs (a healthy job market).</p>
            <p>But the Federal Reserve's way of waiting for data made Trump angry. Trump often criticized Jerome Powell, the head of the Federal Reserve, for not lowering interest rates further.</p>
