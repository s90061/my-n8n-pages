Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the way people work around the world. Many companies are now using AI tools to do tasks that machines could not do before. This is making some people worry about losing their jobs, especially in areas like customer service, data entry, and simple writing.

However, experts also say that AI will create many new jobs. These new roles will often involve working with AI, managing AI systems, or developing new AI technologies. For example, there will be more demand for AI specialists, data scientists, and people who can train AI models.

To prepare for these changes, workers may need to learn new skills. Companies are also looking at how AI can help their employees work better, not just replace them. AI can take over repetitive tasks, allowing people to focus on more creative and complex problems. This shift could lead to more interesting and productive work environments.

**Cities Get Ready for More Hot Weather**

Around the world, cities are making plans for hotter summers and more heatwaves. A heatwave is a period of unusually hot weather. Scientists say that climate change is causing these hot periods to happen more often and be more extreme. This is a big problem for people living in cities, especially older people and children, because concrete and buildings can make cities much hotter than the countryside.

To help people stay safe, city leaders are trying different ideas. One plan is to plant more trees and create more green parks. Trees provide shade and make the air cooler. Another idea is to use "cool roofs" which are light in color and reflect the sun's heat, keeping buildings cooler inside.

Cities are also setting up cooling centers where people can go to escape the heat. They are also giving out warnings when very hot weather is coming. These steps aim to protect the health of city residents as global temperatures continue to rise, making daily life safer in a changing climate.

**Working from Anywhere: The Rise of Digital Nomads**

More and more people are choosing to work remotely, allowing them to travel and live in different countries. These people are often called "digital nomads." A digital nomad is someone who uses technology to work from anywhere in the world, not just a traditional office. This trend has grown a lot since the pandemic, as many companies now allow their employees to work away from the office.

Digital nomads often stay in a place for a few months before moving to another. This way of life offers a lot of freedom and the chance to experience different cultures. It also helps local economies, as these travelers spend money on housing, food, and activities.

Many countries are now creating special visas to welcome digital nomads. These visas make it easier for people to stay and work legally for longer periods. Popular places for digital nomads include sunny countries with good internet and a lower cost of living. This new way of working is changing both the travel industry and how people think about their careers.`;
