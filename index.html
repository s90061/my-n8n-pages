            <h1>Customs Office Checks "Washing Origin" More Closely, Asks People to Report</h1>
            <p>The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance said today that some goods made in China are being sent through Taiwan to pretend they are from Taiwan. This is called "washing origin." The Customs Administration asks people to report if they see any local companies doing this. They should also provide clear proof. This helps the customs office check these cases and keeps trade fair, protecting Taiwan's interests.</p>
            <p>Today, the Customs Administration held a regular press conference. Mr. Zhao Tai-an, the Deputy Director of the Customs Administration, said that from April 1st to August 17th this year, the customs office checked 12,537 shipments sent to the U.S. Of these, 156 cases were sent to the Bureau of Foreign Trade. The Bureau of Foreign Trade has given fines totaling NT$2.64 million, depending on how serious the cases were.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zhao Tai-an also noticed that since April, exports have continued to reach new high numbers. However, the number of cases sent to the Bureau of Foreign Trade has not increased much. This means that even though more goods are being exported, the percentage of wrongdoings might be going down.</p>
            <p>The Customs Administration said that besides continuing to check things more carefully, they also ask people to report if they see any local companies involved in "washing origin." They should give clear proof so the customs office can check. This will help keep trade fair and protect the country's interests.</p>
            <p>The Customs Administration explained that when someone reports illegal shipments, they can do so in writing, by speaking, by phone, or by fax. They need to give their own information (name, ID number, and contact address or phone number) and information about the company or person they are reporting (name, ID or passport number, or company name, tax ID, and address). They also need to describe how the goods were moved (names of goods, amount, and way of transport) or give other clear proof (like sales papers or shipping documents). If the report is missing information, the customs office will ask the person to provide it by a certain date. If the information is not given in time, the report cannot be accepted.</p>
