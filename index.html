Many companies are now using a hybrid model of remote work. This means that employees work from home some days and come into the office on other days. A recent survey shows that about 60% of companies have adopted this system.

This shift has some advantages. Employees can save money on commuting and have more flexibility. Companies can also reduce their office space and attract a wider range of talent. However, there are also challenges. Managers need to find ways to keep remote workers engaged and ensure that everyone feels included. Companies must also invest in technology to support remote collaboration.

Overall, the hybrid model seems likely to be the future of work for many businesses. It offers a balance between the benefits of remote work and the advantages of in-person interaction. However, companies will need to carefully manage the challenges to make it successful.

**Article 2: Innovative Startup Tackles Food Waste with AI**

A new startup is using artificial intelligence to fight food waste. The company, called "WasteNot," has developed a system that helps restaurants and grocery stores predict how much food they will need each day. This allows them to order the right amount and avoid throwing away excess food.

The system uses data from past sales, weather forecasts, and local events to make its predictions. It also takes into account the expiration dates of different products. WasteNot claims that its system can reduce food waste by up to 30%.

Several restaurants and grocery stores have already started using the system. They report that it has saved them money and reduced their environmental impact. WasteNot is planning to expand its system to other industries, such as hospitals and schools.
