            <h1>Taiwan's Resilience Forum Starts on September 20th with 5 Main Topics to Improve International Cooperation</h1>
            <p>The All-out Defense Resilience Committee will be one year old soon. This month, the committee meeting will be different. It will be an international forum on September 20th. This forum will focus on 5 main topics of resilience. It will show three important things: Taiwan is noticed by many countries, it wants to work with other countries, and it is united inside. More than 20 international visitors and representatives from 16 offices in Taiwan will come to the event.</p>
            <p>The All-out Defense Resilience Committee had its first meeting in September last year. It has been working for almost a year now. Lin Fei-fan, the Deputy Secretary-General of the National Security Council, told reporters that the All-out Defense Resilience International Forum on September 20th will be about "Resilient Taiwan: Democracy and Sustainability." President Lai Ching-te, who leads the committee, will give the opening speech, and then the discussions will begin.</p>
            <p>Lin Fei-fan said that the discussions will be based on the 5 main topics of Taiwan's all-out defense resilience. Committee members will lead these discussions. They have also planned for speakers and people to talk about each topic in detail. For example, the first topic, "Civilian Training and Use," will be led by committee member Wu Yi-nung. Committee member Yen Po-wen will speak about Taiwan's strong civilian power, from disaster relief to making the country more resilient. Experts from Taiwan and other countries will also join the discussion.</p>
            <p>Kuo Ya-hui, the Spokesperson for the Office of the President, said that President Lai has been actively working on the All-out Defense Resilience Committee since he took office. He is working to bring together central and local governments, as well as private groups, to work closely. He is also sharing experiences with international partners. In the past, Taiwan has shared its knowledge with Japan, the United States, and several European countries on topics like disaster prevention, cybersecurity, and energy security. The goal of this forum is to work with democratic friends to make global security stronger.</p>
            <p>It is understood that holding an international forum to show one year of the committee's work is mainly to highlight Taiwan's current achievements in all-out defense resilience. These achievements are "being noticed by many countries, working with other countries, and being united inside."</p>
            <p>Regarding international attention, this forum has invited over 20 international visitors and representatives from 16 offices in Taiwan. The American Chamber of Commerce in Taiwan, the European Chamber of Commerce Taiwan, and the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Taipei will also send people to attend.</p>
            <p>For international cooperation, the invited guests are experts in fields like trade, space science, disaster prevention, energy security, and supply chain resilience. This is based on the All-out Defense Resilience Committee's work over the past year. While sharing and exchanging experiences with other countries, the forum will also help Taiwan find opportunities and ways to cooperate in different areas and technologies with other countries that also care about defense resilience.</p>
            <p>Regarding internal and external unity, this international forum is the first hosted by the Taiwanese government with the theme of all-out defense resilience. Besides inviting business people, private citizens, and think tank representatives from Taiwan, international experts will also be there. This shows that Taiwan is a responsible member of the international community, standing with democratic countries to increase strength and protect peace and stability in the region.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hsu Bo-chin of National Sun Yat-sen University Becomes Head of Kaohsiung Medical Management Center</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau announced today that Hsu Bo-chin, the Vice President of National Sun Yat-sen University, will now lead the Kaohsiung City Hospital Management Center, which is part of the Health Bureau. They hope to use his wide experience to help city hospitals run well and improve the quality of medical care.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau made this announcement today through a news release. Hsu Bo-chin was borrowed from National Taiwan University College of Medicine to be the Vice President at National Sun Yat-sen University. Now, he will be the head of the City Hospital Management Center, which is part of the Health Bureau.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau hopes to use Hsu Bo-chin's rich experience in clinical work, teaching, and research to guide city hospitals to run effectively and make medical care better. He will also help Min-Sheng Hospital become a regional teaching hospital and a moderate-level emergency hospital. This will provide more complete and easy-to-reach medical and health services for the city's residents.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said that in August this year, the Health Bureau, National Sun Yat-sen University, and National Taiwan University signed an agreement to work together on medical care. This agreement brings in many outside medical resources to help improve the services and quality of city hospitals. Hsu Bo-chin becoming the head of the City Hospital Management Center today is a step forward in this three-way cooperation agreement.</p>
            <p>Besides becoming the head of the center, Hsu Bo-chin will also help Min-Sheng Hospital with medical and management tasks. By bringing in resources, he will improve the quality and amount of clinical medical care, teaching, and research. This will help Min-Sheng Hospital upgrade from a local hospital to a regional teaching hospital and successfully pass the review to become a moderate-level emergency hospital.</p>
            <p>Hsu Bo-chin said that his most important job in this new role is to make sure that the resources of city hospitals are used in the best way and closely meet the needs of the citizens. In the future, he will combine the varied professional knowledge of National Sun Yat-sen University with the city government's public health policies to create an even better healthcare system.</p>
            <p>Hsu Bo-chin graduated from the Medical College of National Taiwan University. He then earned a Ph.D. in Clinical Medicine and a Master's degree in Accounting and Management (EMBA) from National Taiwan University. He used to be the Vice Dean of the National Taiwan University College of Medicine and the head of the Committee for Shared Education and Teacher Training.</p>

            <h1>Nepal Gets a New Prime Minister, China Says It Respects Nepal's Choice</h1>
            <p>The government in Nepal has changed. The former Prime Minister, Oli, had to leave his job because he blocked social media, and young people protested a lot. Karki, who was a chief justice before, is now the new Prime Minister. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that China congratulates the new leader. They also said that China always respects the choices that the Nepali people make for their country's path.</p>
            <p>Former Nepalese Prime Minister Oli, who is part of the Communist Party of Nepal, went to China in early September. He attended a summit and a military parade. After he came back, he said that social media sites like Facebook would be blocked. This made many young people very angry, which led to big protests and trouble. Oli quickly resigned, and Karki became the Prime Minister on September 13th.</p>
            <p>According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, a spokesperson, whose name was not given, made this statement in response to a reporter's question.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said that China congratulates Karki on becoming the temporary Prime Minister of Nepal. The spokesperson mentioned that China and Nepal have been good friends for a long time. China "always respects the development path that the Nepali people choose for themselves." China wants to work with Nepal. They want to follow the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" and improve how they talk and work together in all areas. This will help the relationship between China and Nepal get better and better.</p>
            <p>Oli, who is also the strong leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxistâ€“Leninist), has been involved in Communist politics for many decades. He served as the Prime Minister of Nepal four times. In recent years, he made himself look like a hero. At his public events, you could often see big pictures of him and banners that said, "KP (Oli's initials) Dad, we love you."</p>
            <p>Some journalists even said that Oli believed his own words were the "final decision." He rarely listened to criticism or advice, even if it came from his own political party.</p>
            <p>In early September, after Oli went to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit and the September 3rd military parade, he announced that he would block many social media sites like Facebook, YouTube, and X. Many young people in Nepal, who have high unemployment and use social media a lot, went out to protest. They even set fire to buildings, including the homes of government officials. Videos online showed that some protesters even threw away and burned a picture of Chinese President Xi Jinping that was hanging in the office of the ruling party.</p>
            <p>News and videos about the sudden change in Nepal's government because of the large protests by young people were shared online in China for a short time. Chinese internet users discussed it. Some people connected Oli's blocking of social media to China's own internet censorship and Oli's relationship with China. However, most videos about the Nepal protests were deleted by internet controllers soon after they were posted. Only a few videos were shared privately.</p>
