            <h1>Changing Your Lifestyle Helps Lower Diabetes Risk; Doctors Say It Works Better Than Medicine</h1>
            <p>A study in Taiwan found that more young people under 40 are getting diabetes. Doctors say that your waist size is an important sign of metabolic syndrome. Studies show that changing your lifestyle, like what you eat and how much you exercise, can effectively lower the chance of getting diabetes. This works even better than medicine.</p>
            <p>Ou Hong-yi, who leads the Diabetes Teaching Association of the Republic of China, explained at a health education press conference today. He said that a study in Taiwan showed that the number of young people under 40 with diabetes went up. In 2016, 0.853% had it, but by 2022, it was 1.041%. One main reason for this increase is metabolic syndrome.</p>
            <p>Yang Wei-hsun, who leads the Diabetes Association of the Republic of China, pointed out that metabolic syndrome was once thought to be a stage before illness. But actually, at this point, the risk of heart and blood vessel diseases already starts to go up. It is also linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, like female reproductive system cancers and male colon cancer. Metabolic syndrome is defined by things like a large belly, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar when you haven't eaten. Among these, waist size is the most important factor, as it is closely connected to fat around your organs.</p>
            <p>Tsai Meng-hsiu, who is the head of the Health Management and Preventive Medicine department at Chi-Mei Hospital, said that adult men's waist size should be less than 90 centimeters, and women's less than 80 centimeters. To measure, you should do it in the morning before eating, standing naturally. Take off any clothes around your waist. Use a tape measure to go around the middle of your stomach (between the top of your hip bones and the bottom of your ribs). The tape should be snug but not press into your skin.</p>
            <p>To fight pre-diabetes, Tsai Meng-hsiu explained that studies have found that if patients join a lifestyle improvement program, eat healthy, and do at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise each week, their chance of getting diabetes went down by 58% after 2.8 years. For those who only took medicine, the chance only went down by 31%. Another study that followed people for 15 years also found that changing your lifestyle works better than medicine.</p>
            <p>Tsai Meng-hsiu also said that in daily life, eating healthy, moving more, getting enough sleep, managing stress, staying away from smoking and drinking, and having good social connections can also help reduce waist size and get healthy again. For eating, be careful about the salt and seasonings hidden in food from restaurants. Do not drink juice instead of eating real fruits and vegetables. For exercise, make sure you get a little out of breath, feel a little warm, and sweat. Slowly increase your exercise time to more than 150 minutes a week.</p>
            <p>Wei Hsi-lun, who is the deputy director of the National Health Agency, said that since 2022, the agency has been running a "Metabolic Syndrome Prevention Program." This program gives health advice, such as balanced eating and regular exercise, to people with metabolic syndrome. This helps them manage their health early. After 3 years of the program, more than half of the people whose waist size was not normal but completed at least 3 follow-up checks, saw their waist size improve. About 12% of them reached a healthy waist size.</p>

            <h1>Will Everyone Get Cash? Green Party Says There Are Three Big Problems</h1>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao, the leader of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) group in the Legislative Yuan, said today that they are still talking about whether to give out cash to everyone. The problems are: first, if the government needs to borrow money to do it; second, how to make it legal under the constitution, as there were original doubts about it; and third, whether to exclude rich people. Wu Szu-yao also said that when the Legislative Yuan talked about special rules in the past, they never discussed these issues. Now, the ruling party is facing these issues seriously. She asked the opposition parties to also take them seriously.</p>
            <p>The government had planned to approve a special budget today. This budget was for making the economy, society, and national security stronger because of global events. It included giving out 235 billion New Taiwan Dollars in cash to everyone. However, for some reason, it was not put on the meeting's schedule.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Wu Szu-yao spoke to the media at the Legislative Yuan. She said that they are still discussing the universal cash handout. The problem is that giving out cash means the country needs to borrow money. Can the country really afford it? On one hand, there will be other big costs in the future, like special money for typhoon disasters, water control budgets, and defense. On the other hand, after changes to the law about how government money is divided, 375.3 billion New Taiwan Dollars will be given to local governments in the new year. After all, the total amount of money the government has is limited.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said the second problem is this: if they decide to give out the money, they must make sure it follows the constitution. There were doubts about whether the Legislative Yuan's past changes to the law were constitutional. So, the government and lawmakers need to talk more about how to make it constitutional.</p>
            <p>Regarding the rule that might exclude rich people, which the public is concerned about, Wu Szu-yao said that whether to include or exclude rich people is an issue worth discussing.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao explained that if the cash handout is seen as social welfare, then it should exclude rich people. But if they follow what the opposition party says â€“ using extra tax money to give cash to everyone â€“ then excluding those who pay the most taxes goes against the idea of "returning tax money to the people" that the opposition party talks about.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that the issues mentioned can and should be discussed. She hopes that opposition lawmakers will also face them seriously. She added that in the past, when special laws were discussed, the opposition parties never talked about excluding rich people, where the money would come from, or how much the country could afford to give. Now, the ruling party has to deal with these things responsibly.</p>
