            <h1>Trump Warns Iran: If Nuclear Facilities Restart, US Will Bomb Again</h1>
            <p>US President Trump warned today that if Tehran tries to restart its nuclear facilities, which the US bombed last month, he will order new attacks on Iran's nuclear sites.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump gave this warning to Iran during talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Turnberry, Scotland.</p>
            <p>Iran insists that it will not stop its uranium enrichment activities inside the country, even though three of its nuclear facilities were bombed. Iran says it is not trying to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters that Iran has been sending "unpleasant signals." He said any move to restart their nuclear program would be destroyed immediately.</p>
            <p>Trump stated, "We have already destroyed their nuclear ability. They can try to restart it, and if they do, we will quickly destroy it before anyone can react."</p>
            <p>Last month, the US launched air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. Washington claims these facilities are part of Iran's nuclear weapons program. Tehran says its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes.</p>

            <h1>Trump Warns Gaza People Are Hungry, Promises to Help Set Up Food Centers</h1>
            <p>US President Trump warned today that people in the Gaza Strip are facing "real hunger." He said the United States and its partners will help set up food centers.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that aid groups are trying to quickly deliver food aid to the Gaza Strip during Israel's "tactical pauses" in military actions.</p>
            <p>After meeting British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland, Trump spoke about many people in Gaza being hungry. This is different from what Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu had previously called worries about hunger in Gaza a way for the Palestinian armed group Hamas to spread its message. Yesterday, he even claimed that "there is no hunger problem in Gaza."</p>
            <p>Trump said the US and its partners would help build food centers to help the people of Gaza. UN aid agencies warn that over 2 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip face dangerous hunger and lack of food.</p>
            <p>At a press conference with Starmer, Trump told reporters, "We will get some nutritious food, and we can save many people. I mean, some children's situations, that is real hunger."</p>
            <p>Trump also added, "Before we take any action, we must provide help based on humanity. We must make sure children have food."</p>
