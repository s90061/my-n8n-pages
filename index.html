            <h1>Tesla Changes Car Prices: Up to NT$100,000 Off Model 3 and Model Y</h1>
            <p>Today, electric car company Tesla changed its car prices in Taiwan. This is because people in Taiwan expect changes due to import taxes on US goods. If you get a Model 3 or Model Y car from August 27 to September 30, you can get a discount of up to NT$100,000.</p>
            <p>Tesla said that the cost of car parts and shipping around the world is going up. Also, the change in import taxes from the US is not the only reason for Tesla's prices in Taiwan. Even if Taiwan lowers these taxes, Tesla will not reduce the prices of Model S and Model X cars.</p>
            <p>Tesla explained that for the Model 3, they are giving discounts to meet what the Taiwan market expects. For the Model Y in Taiwan, it will still be imported from the Berlin factory. There are no plans to move production. The price reduction will be given to new car owners who are about to receive their cars as a kind of insurance help.</p>
            <p>Tesla announced that this is the biggest car price discount ever for their updated car models. The Model 3 Performance model has the largest discount, which is NT$100,000.</p>

            <h1>Wu Chih-chung: Taiwan Helps Indo-Pacific Safety by Making its Defense Stronger</h1>
            <p>The group called "Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China" (IPAC) is visiting Taiwan. Today, during a lunch, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Chih-chung said that Taiwan helps keep the Indo-Pacific region safe by making its own defense stronger. He also said that many countries supporting Taiwan show that Taiwan is very important for world safety. Taiwan hopes to work more closely with countries that share similar ideas in important areas.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent out a news release in the evening. It stated that Vice Minister Wu Chih-chung welcomed the IPAC group of five people, led by Iain Duncan Smith, a former leader of the UK Conservative Party, at a lunch today. He thanked IPAC for always showing strong support for Taiwan through their actions.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung said that in recent years, China has often tried to influence Taiwan, carried out attacks in a hidden way, and used military threats. These actions have seriously hurt peace and stability in the region by changing the situation in the Taiwan Strait. Taiwan is working hard to follow its "Four Pillars of Peace Action Plan." It is helping the Indo-Pacific region stay safe by making its own defense stronger.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung also said that more and more countries are supporting Taiwan. This includes worrying about China's military exercises near Taiwan, sending warships through the Taiwan Strait, and opposing China's "One China Principle." All these things show that Taiwan is very important for global safety and success. He hopes that Taiwan will work more closely with countries that think similarly in more important areas in the future.</p>
            <p>Mr. Smith said that IPAC now has members from parliaments of 43 countries and the European Parliament. This shows that more and more countries are worried about China. In recent years, China has used its strong economic and political power to ignore global rules and harm the free market. Democratic countries should work together and face the dangers and problems that China brings.</p>
            <p>Smith stressed that if countries around the world cannot work together to stop China's goals, China's powerful actions might become even worse. In the future, IPAC will continue to speak out about issues related to China and take real steps to help democracy grow worldwide.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that IPAC held its fourth yearly meeting in Taipei last July. Forty-nine lawmakers and important people from 23 countries and the European Parliament attended. At the meeting, they agreed on a plan for parliaments in different countries to pass resolutions about UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. Since then, many countries' parliaments have passed similar resolutions, and their governments have shown support for Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that the visiting group met with President Lai. They also visited important people like the Secretary-General of the National Security Council, Wu Chao-hsieh, the Minister of the Mainland Affairs Council, Chiu Tai-san, the Deputy Minister of the National Development Council, Chan Fang-kuan, and other organizations like the Institute for National Defense and Security Research.</p>

            <h1>Osaka Wanted to Charge Extra Fees to Foreign Visitors, But Experts Said No</h1>
            <p>The Osaka government in Japan thought about charging an extra fee to foreign visitors. This fee was meant to help pay for ways to deal with "overtourism." But today, the Osaka government held a meeting with experts and scholars. After discussing it, they decided not to do it. The experts said it would go against laws and fairness, so they advised against it.</p>
            <p>The Sankei Shimbun newspaper in Japan reported that Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura first suggested charging foreign visitors an extra fee last March. He believed this fee could help pay for solutions to "overtourism." Yoshimura asked a group of experts and university professors if this idea was possible.</p>
            <p>Today, the Osaka government held a meeting with experts and scholars to discuss this plan. They then sent their decision to the Osaka government. The main point they talked about was how to collect the money, like through taxes or other fees. They thought that only taxing foreign visitors might go against tax agreements that say people should not be treated differently because of their nationality. Also, if they charged a set fee at places like airports, it would take a long time to figure out how to collect it.</p>
            <p>The meeting's decision stated that more foreign visitors to Japan have caused problems like more trash and not enough public toilets. However, trying to charge extra fees only to foreign visitors has issues with legal fairness and how to do it in real life. These problems still need to be solved.</p>
            <p>The experts and scholars believed that "overtourism is not only caused by foreign visitors, so it's hard to clearly say why only foreign visitors should pay an extra fee." The experts suggested that instead, a hotel tax should be collected from all tourists, no matter their nationality, and this money should be used well.</p>
            <p>The Osaka government is thinking about increasing the hotel tax. From September, the tax will change from 100-200 yen per night to 200-500 yen per night (about NT$42 to NT$105). They expect that this year, the tax money collected will increase by 4 billion yen compared to 2024, reaching 7.3 billion yen.</p>
            <p>After receiving the experts' decision, Mr. Hirofumi Matsusaka, the Head of Citizen's Culture Department in Osaka, said that they will use the "hotel tax" effectively. They will actively put plans into action and will not charge other fees to foreign visitors for now. They will also focus on tourists and local people living well together, to make Osaka more attractive.</p>
