**Citizen Judges Trust Justice More After Participating, Survey Shows**

A new survey by Taiwan's Judicial Yuan shows that most people who served as citizen judges trust the justice system more afterward. The survey, which looked at cases in 2025, found that 98.7% of citizen judges trusted the courts after taking part, up from 89.8% before.

The report also said that 95.3% of those who served as citizen judges or alternate judges would be happy to do it again. Most of them (over 90%) felt good about the whole process, from choosing the judges to the trial and discussions. A high number, more than 97%, said it was easy to understand the legal points, evidence, and laws.

The Judicial Yuan stated that the new system is working well. Even though some cases were more complicated this year, citizen judges found it easier to understand the main issues. This shows that judges, prosecutors, and lawyers are doing a good job helping citizen judges understand everything. People are still concerned about their personal information and safety, but overall, the system is getting better and more citizen judges are taking part.

**Village Officer in Nantou Helps People for 19 Years, Even After Dog Bites**

Qiu Lihui, a village officer in Guoxing Township, Nantou County, has been helping local people for 19 years. She has a tough job; she's even been bitten by dogs three times! Doctors sometimes ask her why she needs so many tetanus shots. Even with these challenges, she says she's happy to help villagers with their problems.

Her job includes almost everything in the village, like farming issues, local government tasks, public works, dealing with complaints, checking disaster areas, and reporting broken roads. Because of messaging apps, she's often working 24 hours a day.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, she was very busy handing out health kits, delivering food, and sending important notices. Nantou County Magistrate Hsu Shu-hua praised village officers like Qiu Lihui. She said they are important for helping people, especially those who need it most, and for keeping communities stable, especially during disasters or health crises.

**South Korean President May Visit US for Talks with Trump in Late July**

South Korea and the United States are planning a meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae-myung and US President Trump. Reports say they are aiming for the week of July 21st for President Lee's visit to the US and their first talk. They are expected to discuss things like trade taxes and how much money South Korea spends on defense.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio might visit South Korea around July 10th. During this trip, he is likely to officially invite President Lee Jae-myung to the United States.

Before this, the two leaders had planned to meet during the G7 summit on June 17th and the NATO summit on June 24th. However, these meetings were delayed because President Trump went home earlier than planned and because of worries about the war in the Middle East. If the meeting in July happens, the main topics will be about trade taxes and increasing defense spending.
