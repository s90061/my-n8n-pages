            <h1>Man Posts World Masters Games Shirt with "TAIPI" Mistake, Court Says No Punishment</h1>
            <p>A man named Mr. Huang shared pictures and words online in May. The pictures showed a World Masters Games T-shirt with the word "TAIPI" printed on it instead of "TAIPEI." The police said this was false information. But the Shilin court decided that the post did not make people scared or worried. So, it did not break the Social Order Maintenance Act which punishes spreading rumors. The court said there would be no punishment, but this decision can be appealed.</p>
            <p>The 2025 Taipei-New Taipei World Masters Games will happen from May 17 to May 30. On May 21, someone posted on Threads, a social media platform. The post said, "First, Taipei's English name in an advertisement was spelled TAIIPEI. Now, my friend who works at an elementary school got these World Masters Games T-shirts for teachers and staff. They are 'NG' (not good) shirts." The post also had a picture of the T-shirt with "TAIPI" on it.</p>
            <p>This post got a lot of attention. The Taipei City Department of Education and the Taipei-New Taipei World Masters Games Organizing Committee both said the post was not true. They asked the police to investigate. The Xizhi police station in New Taipei City found that Mr. Huang was the person who posted it. They sent the case to the Shilin District Court because they believed he broke the Social Order Maintenance Act by "spreading rumors that can disturb public peace."</p>
            <p>According to the court's decision, Mr. Huang admitted to making the post. He said the picture came from a friend at his school. He thought the clothing company might have given away the faulty T-shirts to staff because they didn't want to throw them away. He felt it was a big mistake, so he shared it online.</p>
            <p>The judge believed that Mr. Huang shared his own thoughts and opinions based on the information his friend gave him. This is part of his freedom of speech. Even if his words made some people feel negative or unhappy, it does not change his right to express his opinion and comment.</p>
            <p>The court's decision said that based on the evidence from the police, it could not be proven that Mr. Huang purposely made up false information. Also, the court could not say that his post made people scared or worried, which would disturb public peace. Therefore, his actions did not fit the part of the law that punishes "spreading rumors that can disturb public peace." So, the court decided not to punish him, and this decision can be appealed.</p>

            <h1>Russian Drone with Bombs Enters Lithuania, Country Asks NATO to Make Air Defense Stronger</h1>
            <p>Last week, a Russian military drone carrying explosives flew into Lithuania's air space. Because of this, Lithuania today asked NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) for help to make its air defense system stronger.</p>
            <p>AFP and Reuters news agencies reported that Lithuania's Foreign Minister, Kestutis Budrys, said this event is just one of many similar events recently. He called these situations "a warning that Russia's attack on Ukraine is spreading to NATO areas."</p>
            <p>Mr. Budrys said he has sent a letter to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. In the letter, he asked for "quick action to make Lithuania's air defense stronger." This includes having NATO countries fly planes to guard the sky.</p>
            <p>Lithuania's Defense Minister, Dovile Sakaliene, said that Lithuania is forming special groups to deal with drone threats. They are also setting up "air defense units with short-range weapons."</p>
            <p>NATO replied by email, saying they are watching the situation closely. NATO said: "General Alexus Grynkewich, who is in charge of Allied Air Command Europe, can decide what actions he thinks are needed. NATO countries are also buying and making new ways to find and stop drones."</p>
            <p>The drone flew into Lithuania on July 28 from Belarus, a country next to Lithuania and a friend of Russia. People saw the drone flying over parts of Vilnius, which is the capital city.</p>
            <p>When Russia attacks Ukraine with missiles and drones, they often fly over Belarus. Belarus was also one of the places Russia started its full invasion in 2022.</p>
            <p>The drone was found on August 1 in a military training area. Lithuanian officials said they believe it was a "Gerbera" drone, which is mainly used for attacking and looking for information.</p>

            <h1>Equal Tariffs to Start on August 7, Experts Say Chip Tariffs Will Have a Bigger Impact on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>The United States' equal tariffs are expected to start on August 7. Also, former US President Trump has announced that tariffs on medicines and chips will be introduced soon. Because of this, the market is waiting to see what happens, and US stocks went down on Tuesday. Experts warn that chip tariffs will affect Taiwan more than equal tariffs, and investors should pay close attention.</p>
            <p>Investors are watching closely how tariffs will change things. On August 5, all four main US stock market indexes fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down by 61.90 points, or 0.14%, ending at 44111.74 points. The S&P 500 index went down a little, by 30.75 points, or 0.49%, ending at 6299.19 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index, which focuses on technology stocks, went down by 137.03 points, or 0.65%, ending at 20916.55 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went down by 62.72 points, or 1.12%, ending at 5561.69 points.</p>
            <p>For individual company stocks, as Trump announced that chip tariffs would come soon, Intel's stock price went up by 0.69 US dollars, or 3.54%, to 20.19 US dollars. TSMC ADR (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company American Depositary Receipt) went down by 6.53 US dollars, or 2.73%, to 232.47 US dollars. NVIDIA also went down by 1.74 US dollars, or 0.97%, to 178.26 US dollars.</p>
            <p>Cathay Securities Investment Trust's ETF research team said that last week, the US announced an equal tariff rate of 20% on Taiwan. This will start on August 7. Because this rate is higher than Japan's and South Korea's 15%, it caused some market changes at first.</p>
            <p>However, Cathay Securities Investment Trust's analysis shows that this 20% tariff does not apply to the list of tariff-free goods (Annex II) or new items added by the President's memo. Taiwan's main export goods to the US, such as semiconductors, servers, raw materials for medicines, important parts, minerals, and chemical materials, make up almost 75% of its exports. These items will not be affected by these equal tariffs. The real important thing to watch next is the US Section 232 tariffs, which might be announced in mid-August and could put taxes on semiconductors.</p>
