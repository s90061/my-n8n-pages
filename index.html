            <h1>Remembering the August 14th Victory: Air Force Commander Asks Soldiers to Keep the Fighting Spirit</h1>
            <p>General Cheng Jung-Feng, the head of the Air Force, led a special event today. It was to remember the 88th anniversary of the August 14th air battle victory. He told all the soldiers to remember the fighting spirit, improve their skills, make the country's defense stronger, and continue to earn trust from the public.</p>
            <p>Military News Agency reported today that the Air Force Headquarters held the "814 Air Battle Victory 88th Anniversary" event. General Cheng congratulated soldiers who received medals, awards for being good examples, and prizes in sports or group competitions. He praised their hard work and effort throughout the year. He hopes this will encourage all soldiers.</p>
            <p>During the event, General Cheng talked about the history of the August 14th air battle victory. He said that in 1937, over Jianqiao Airport in Hangzhou, Colonel Kao Chih-Hang was the first to shoot down an enemy plane. This was the first victory in the war and it made all the people and soldiers feel stronger about fighting. It also created a spirit of "no enemy can defeat us, bravely face danger, win with fewer people, and defeat the strong when we are weak." He said that even though times are hard now, the military must continue the spirit of those who came before them and protect the country, freedom, and democracy.</p>
            <p>General Cheng gave four hopes for the soldiers. First, he emphasized "developing professional skills and building a good reputation." He hopes that besides being good at their main jobs, soldiers can also learn more about other areas they are interested in. This means using new technology to become more competitive. Second, he said "learning foreign languages is helpful for life." He encouraged soldiers to use the military's language programs and study chances to get better at foreign languages. This will help them with international talks and doing their jobs.</p>
            <p>Third, he said "follow rules and obey orders." General Cheng pointed out that following safety rules is very important for staying safe and keeping the military strong. Soldiers must always follow operating rules to make sure tasks are completed smoothly. Lastly, he told soldiers to "love the country, love their work, and love the people." During peaceful times, they should show a good image and discipline to get support from the public. During wartime, they should protect the country's safety with loyalty and good skills.</p>
            <p>Finally, General Cheng encouraged all soldiers to remember the brave acts of the August 14th air battle heroes. He asked them to continue the fighting spirit, make sure they are safe and professional, bring together the country's defense power, and keep the country safe and the region peaceful.</p>

            <h1>Hsia Ho-Hsi to Lose Weight for Golden Bell Red Carpet Hosting, Huang Di-Yang Avoids Reading Comments</h1>
            <p>The hosts for the 60th Golden Bell Awards red carpet, Huang Deng-Hui, Huang Di-Yang, Hsia Ho-Hsi, and Mu Mu, appeared together today. Hsia Ho-Hsi plans to lose weight to look his best on the red carpet, aiming to go from 68 kg to 60 kg in three months. Huang Di-Yang said he does not read comments to avoid feeling stressed.</p>
            <p>This year's red carpet hosts have their own unique styles. Hsia Ho-Hsi and Mu Mu (Lin Wei-Ni) will host the variety show category. Huang Deng-Hui and Huang Di-Yang will host the drama category. Huang Deng-Hui called himself the "face of the show." Mu Mu (Lin Wei-Ni) is the "energy giver." Huang Di-Yang said he is in charge of "keeping the rhythm." Hsia Ho-Hsi wants to be the "sexy one." He also shared that he will lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising to be in the best shape.</p>
            <p>Huang Di-Yang is excited to work with Huang Deng-Hui. He said they have known each other for three years and are in the same badminton club. Their teamwork is so good that they can "catch the ball" without even looking at each other, meaning hosting should be easy for them. Huang Deng-Hui joked that his wife told him, "Don't talk, because you look better in photos without sound."</p>
            <p>Huang Di-Yang hosted the first Taipei Drama Awards and received a lot of praise. He said he rarely reads comments because he doesn't want to feel stressed. Hsia Ho-Hsi also said that while he doesn't often read online messages, he can still feel how much past audiences cared about the awards show.</p>
            <p>This year, the Radio Golden Bell Awards ceremony will be on October 11th. The awards for variety shows and dramas will be on October 17th and 18th. All events will be held at the Taipei Pop Music Center and produced by Sanlih E-Television.</p>
