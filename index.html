            <h1>Germany Train Accident: At Least 3 Dead, Many Hurt</h1>
            <p>Police said that a train carrying about 100 people went off the tracks in a forest in southwestern Germany. At least 3 people died in this accident.</p>
            <p>A police spokesperson told AFP that 3 people died and several people were hurt in the accident.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that police in Stuttgart said two parts of the train went off the tracks. This happened between the towns of Riedlingen and Munderkingen, which are close to the borders of Germany, Switzerland, and France. We do not know why the accident happened yet.</p>
            <p>Photos from DPA show that the train parts that went off the tracks were mostly not broken. But two of them were lying next to each other across the railway.</p>
            <p>The German train company, Deutsche Bahn, said in a statement that "many people were hurt." The company will help the police and other officials with their investigation.</p>

            <h1>US Commerce Head: Chip Report Coming in Two Weeks</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Washington, July 27) In April, the United States started an investigation into the chip industry. They said it was for national security. Countries like Taiwan, which make a lot of chips, are worried because they do not know what the new rules will be. Today, the US Commerce Secretary, Mr. Lutnick, said that the results of this investigation will be shared in two weeks.</p>
            <p>Today, US President Trump finished a deal about taxes on goods with Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, in Scotland. Mr. Lutnick answered questions from reporters there about the chip taxes.</p>
            <p>In February, President Trump said he would put a 25% tax on chips that come from other countries. Two months later, the Commerce Department started an investigation into chips. They used a rule from the 1962 "Trade Expansion Act," called Section 232.</p>
            <p>This investigation looks at many things. For example, it looks at parts of chips like silicon wafers, machines that make chips, and products that use chips. The Commerce Department wants to see if the US can make more chips itself. This would make the US less dependent on chips from other countries. They also want to know if new taxes or other trade rules are needed to keep the country safe.</p>
            <p>The United States needs a lot of chips from Taiwan. The last president, Mr. Biden, tried to change this. He helped to pass a law called the "CHIPS Act." This law gives money to chip factories so they can make more chips in the US. TSMC, a big chip company, also got money from this law.</p>
            <p>After Trump said he would put a 25% tax on chips, many people asked him not to do it. A group in Washington called ITIF looked at the numbers in May. They think that if there is a 25% tax on chips, the US economy will grow 0.18% less in the first year. If this tax stays for ten years, the US could lose 1.4 trillion US dollars. This is about 41 trillion Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>Also, if chips cost 25% more, the price of cars could go up by as much as 1000 US dollars. ITIF believes that the government will lose more money from taxes because the economy will get smaller than it will gain from the new chip tax.</p>
            <p>The group also said that the US government would lose 165 billion US dollars in taxes. For each person in the US, their living standard would go down by 122 US dollars in the first year. Over 10 years, this could be a loss of 4208 US dollars per person.</p>
            <p>For important industries like AI and cars, the group said that if chips cost more, it will cost more to teach AI systems. This will make the US less strong in AI. At the same time, China will keep giving a lot of money to its AI and chip industries. This will help Chinese companies grow their AI power without the same high costs. They might become the leaders.</p>
