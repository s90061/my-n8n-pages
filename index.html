            <h1>US Starbucks Uses AI, Employees Spend Less Time in Storage and More with Customers</h1>
            <p>Starbucks, a big coffee company from the US, said today that by the end of September, they will start using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system in over 11,000 of their stores in North America. This system will help them check their stock and make their supply chain work better.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this new system lets employees use a tablet to scan shelves in the storage room. The software then automatically counts the items and shows which things are running low.</p>
            <p>Deb Hall Lefevre, Starbucks' Chief Technology Officer, said in a statement that this system will help them restock items faster. It will also make sure popular ingredients like cold foam, oat milk, and caramel sauce are always available.</p>
            <p>Lefevre wrote in the statement that customers will always get the drinks they want. Also, employees can spend less time in the storage area and more time at the counter making drinks and talking to customers.</p>
            <p>Lefevre added that this new technology is already being used in thousands of stores. It helps them check stock 8 times more often than before.</p>

            <h1>UN Worries About North Korea Possibly Doing Medical Tests on People with Disabilities</h1>
            <p>Today, a United Nations committee, which helps people with disabilities, said there is strong information that North Korea is doing medical tests on people with disabilities. They are also forcing some people to not have children and killing disabled babies.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said these tests are said to be happening in children's hospitals and places where people are held. People did not freely agree to these tests and did not know enough about them.</p>
            <p>The committee stated, 'We have good information that North Korea is doing medical and science tests on people who have mental or learning disabilities.'</p>
            <p>The committee is also worried about reports that women with disabilities are being forced to stop having children or have abortions. They are also 'very worried about trusted information that disabled children are being killed. This includes reports of babies being killed in hospitals with official permission.'</p>
            <p>Mara Gabrilli, a member of the committee, said they have asked North Korea to make all such tests against the law immediately. They also want to make sure that these places are checked by people who are not part of the government. And they want a way for victims to get help.</p>
            <p>This report from the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities about North Korea uses information from a UN expert who visited North Korea in 2017. It also uses information from people who left North Korea and other secret reports.</p>
