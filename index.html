            <h1>Trump: Hamas Does Not Want to Release Hostages; Israel Must Decide Next Steps</h1>
            <p>On July 27, in Turnberry, Scotland, former U.S. President Trump said that Israel needs to decide what to do next in Gaza. He also said that he does not know what will happen after talks to stop fighting and release hostages with Hamas, an Islamic group, have failed.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump stressed it is very important for Hamas to free the people they are holding in the Gaza Strip. He added that Hamas has become "suddenly tougher" on this issue. At the same time, he said that the United States will send more help to Gaza, which has been badly affected by the war.</p>
            <p>Trump met with Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. At the start of their meeting, he told reporters, "They (Hamas) do not want to give back these people (the Israeli hostages). So, Israel must make a decision."</p>
            <p>He said, "I know what I would do, but I don't think it's right to say it. Still, Israel must decide." Trump did not show proof that Hamas members stole food sent to Gaza and sold it for money.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump stated that the United States will give more humanitarian aid to Gaza. He hopes other countries will help too, and he said he would talk about this with Ms. von der Leyen. (Translation by Liu Shu-chin/Review by Ho Hung-ju) 1140728</p>

            <h1>U.S. Commerce Secretary: Tariffs Will Start on August 1, No Delay</h1>
            <p>On July 27, in Washington, D.C., U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, said that the United States will definitely start new tariffs on its trade partners by the August 1 deadline. He added that there will be no delay.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Lutnick told "Fox News Sunday" on Fox TV, "So there will be no delay, no more grace period. On August 1, the tariffs are set. They (referring to the tariffs from various countries) will start, customs will begin collecting this money, and here we go."</p>
            <p>He said that after the new tariffs begin, President Trump is still open to more talks. Today, Trump started discussions with European Union officials in Scotland.</p>
            <p>After talks with Ursula von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, Trump announced a trade deal. Tariffs on goods from the EU to the U.S. will go down to 15%. The EU also agreed to buy $750 billion (about NT$22 trillion) worth of energy from the U.S. and invest another $600 billion.</p>
            <p>Before this, the United Kingdom, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Japan had already made deals with Trump's government.</p>
            <p>The agreed tax rates are usually higher than the basic 10% tariffs the U.S. has charged most countries since April. However, they are much lower than the rates Trump's government said it would impose if no deal was reached. (Translation by Ho Hung-ju/Review by Liu Shu-chin) 1140728</p>
