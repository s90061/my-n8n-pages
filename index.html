            <h1>Chen Pei-chi: Ko Wen-je hopes to return to Hsinchu to see his mother after being released on bail on the 8th</h1>
            <p>The Taipei District Court decided that Ko Wen-je, who used to be the chairman of the Taiwan People's Party, can be released on bail. Today, Ko Wen-je's wife, Chen Pei-chi, said that Ko Wen-je's lawyer told her his first wish. He wants to go back to Hsinchu right away to see his mother. He also wants to see where his father's ashes are kept. This has been a wish he has thought about for a long time.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing a case about Jinghua City. Ko Wen-je, who used to be the mayor of Taipei, asked to be released on bail. On the 5th, the court agreed, setting bail at 70 million NT dollars. But after talking to his lawyer, Ko Wen-je said he needed more time to think. The Taiwan People's Party said that once Ko Wen-je tells his lawyers to agree on the 8th, they will quickly finish the bail process at the court. Then, Ko Wen-je will be released.</p>
            <p>This evening, Chen Pei-chi went outside the Tucheng Detention Center to cheer for Ko Wen-je's supporters. During a live broadcast, she thanked "little grass" (a term for his supporters) and other supporters for always standing by Ko Wen-je. She hopes that tomorrow, after she pays Ko Wen-je's bail money at the Taipei District Court, she can go home safely with him.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that his lawyer told her Ko Wen-je's first wish is to go back to Hsinchu immediately to see his mother. So, the plan for tomorrow, after he is released on bail, is to first go back to Hsinchu to see his mother. He also wants to see where his father's ashes are kept. This is a wish he has had in his heart for a long time.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that on March 10, the day of Ko Wen-je's father's funeral, Ko Wen-je tried to wait until his father was cremated and properly placed. But he was not allowed to. Not being able to be with his father was Ko Wen-je's biggest regret. So, "tomorrow, we will visit my mother-in-law in Hsinchu and see where my father-in-law is." After that, he might need to focus on how to fight the court case.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi also said that the lawyer told her Ko Wen-je wants a normal desk, chair, and desk lamp. This is because there are no tables or chairs in the Taipei Detention Center. He has to kneel or lie down to read things. Also, the light is dim. In the past year, Ko Wen-je has almost hurt his eyes.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-chi said that tomorrow, a short meeting with everyone is also planned in front of the Taipei District Court. If there is enough time, Ko Wen-je will travel all over Taiwan, from north to south. He will thank all the people and groups who have supported and encouraged him. She added, "We will thank everyone one by one."</p>

            <h1>OPEC+ major oil-producing countries decide to increase daily production by over 130,000 barrels starting in October</h1>
            <p>Today, eight main countries in OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) said they have agreed to produce more oil again. They plan to increase daily oil production by 137,000 barrels starting in October.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that these eight countries are Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman.</p>
            <p>The heads of the energy departments in these countries said in a statement that they decided to increase daily production by 137,000 barrels starting next month.</p>
            <p>In recent years, OPEC+ often agreed to produce less oil to keep oil prices high. But since April this year, the eight countries mentioned earlier have changed their plan. They now want to get back more of the market share. They have agreed to increase oil production many times. Right now, international oil prices are around 60 dollars per barrel, which is a relatively low price.</p>

            <h1>EuroBasket: Georgia unexpectedly defeats France 80-70, enters quarterfinals for the first time in team history</h1>
            <p>Today, Georgia surprisingly beat France 80-70 in the EuroBasket (European Basketball Championship). France played without NBA star Wembanyama. This is the first time in Georgia's history that they have reached the quarterfinals.</p>
            <p>Many NBA stars are playing for their countries in the 2025 EuroBasket. France has good players like Zaccharie Risacher, a top pick for the Hawks, Guerschon Yabusele, a forward for the Knicks, and Alex Sarr, a center for the Wizards.</p>
            <p>Sadly, some excellent tall players are not playing for France this time. These include Victor Wembanyama, the main star for the Spurs, and Rudy Gobert, a center for the Timberwolves.</p>
            <p>For Georgia, tall players like Goga Bitadze from the Magic and Sandro Mamukelashvili from the Raptors are playing.</p>
            <p>Before the game, France was expected to win. But Georgia started strong and finished the first quarter with a score of 24-20. By halftime, Georgia was slightly ahead at 38-37. Kamar Baldwin, Georgia's point guard, scored 14 of those points.</p>
            <p>In the second half, Georgia kept up their strong play. They increased their lead to 58-54 by the end of the third quarter. But France kept fighting to close the gap. With 4 minutes and 19 seconds left in the game, Elie Okobo made a two-point jump shot, making the score 66-66.</p>
            <p>However, in the important last moments, Tornike Shengelia, Baldwin, Bitadze, and Mamukelashvili scored for Georgia. This led Georgia to win the game against France with a final score of 80-70.</p>
            <p>For Georgia, Baldwin played the best, scoring 24 points. He made 3 out of 4 three-point shots, 5 out of 6 two-point shots, and all 5 free throws. Shengelia also scored 24 points and got 8 rebounds.</p>
            <p>France had a better team on paper, but their NBA players Risacher and Yabusele only scored 7 and 12 points respectively. Another NBA player, Sarr, could not play because he was injured.</p>
            <p>Georgia will play against Finland in the quarterfinals next. Yesterday, in the round of 16, Finland surprisingly beat Serbia, who was expected to win the championship, with a score of 92-86. This allowed Finland to reach the quarterfinals, which surprised the international basketball world.</p>
