            <h1>To Deal with Drug Tariffs, Health Minister Chiu Tai-yuan Says: Have at Least 3 Months of Medicine Stock</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Health Minister, Chiu Tai-yuan, said that to prepare for possible higher taxes on imported medicines from the US, they have checked all drugs made in the US. They have also increased the amount of locally made medicines and raw materials. The plan is to have at least a 3-month supply of finished medicines and a 6-month supply of raw materials. This will make sure there are always enough drugs available.</p>
            <p>Minister Chiu Tai-yuan spoke at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Health and Environment Committee today. He gave a report on how new US taxes on imported medicines might affect Taiwan. Before the meeting, he spoke to reporters and said that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA) have started four main plans. These plans are: getting warnings earlier, having more stock, making sure drug prices are fair, and helping local companies make more medicines. All these steps are to make sure people in Taiwan have enough medicine.</p>
            <p>He explained that for the drug warning system, if important medicines start to run out, they will use a special platform to quickly notice and react. To have more medicine stock, they are actively increasing the amount of drugs stored in Taiwan. This will help if there are problems with supply.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiu also said they have checked all the medicines made in the US. They are talking to drug companies that have licenses to understand the supply situation from other countries. They are increasing Taiwan's medicine stock. Finished medicines should be stored for at least 3 months, and raw materials for 6 months. This is to ensure there is enough supply and to keep people safe when they use medicines.</p>
            <p>About making drug prices fair, Chiu Tai-yuan stated that both the FDA and the NHIA have good systems to manage drug prices. If costs go up, there are ways to change prices as needed. Also, they are encouraging local companies to make more medicines. This will make Taiwan's medicine supply steady and make Taiwan less dependent on other countries for drugs.</p>
            <p>Legislator Chen Chao-tzu from the People's Party said Taiwan's market is quite small. She suggested improving how they check and warn about problems in the supply chain. She also suggested changing drug price differences and how people pay for part of the cost. She wants to support local companies that make medicines and protect Taiwan's own medicine market. She also said that imported and local medicines should be treated fairly. She encourages local companies to make special and very important drugs, not just cheap similar ones. This way, Taiwan's market will not be left behind.</p>

            <h1>Kaohsiung All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant Checks: All 19 Re-inspected Pass</h1>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau recently checked all-you-can-eat restaurants. They inspected 19 businesses and 19 food items. In the first check, 5 businesses did not follow good food hygiene rules, and 1 drink did not meet health standards. The businesses were told to make improvements, and after a second check, all of them passed.</p>
            <p>The Kaohsiung City Health Bureau announced today that all-you-can-eat restaurants are very popular because they offer many different kinds of food. From July to August, the Bureau did special checks on hygiene standards and food labels. They checked 19 businesses and 19 food items. The Bureau also reminded businesses to keep managing their own hygiene well. They advised customers to choose restaurants with a good reputation and to pay attention to how clean the whole place is.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau said that this year's "All-You-Can-Eat Restaurant Inspection Project" checked 19 restaurants in its area. These included places that offer all-you-can-eat barbecue, hot pot, and skewers. The main things they checked were: if the food business was registered, if they had product insurance, if they followed good food hygiene rules, if food serving areas had correct labels, and if they kept records of where their food came from. They also tested 19 drinks, ready-to-eat foods, and wet rice or noodle products from the restaurants to check their hygiene.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau explained that they tested 19 food items. These included 6 ready-to-eat foods, 6 drinks or cold foods, 3 wet rice or noodle products, 2 beef items, and 2 pork items. The first test showed that one drink did not meet the hygiene standards. After the business made the needed improvements, a second test showed that the drink was now safe.</p>
            <p>In addition, 5 businesses did not follow good food hygiene rules. This was because some food was not kept off the floor, employees had not had health checks, or cold storage temperatures were not recorded. After the businesses were told to make changes, all of them passed the second check.</p>
            <p>The Health Bureau warned that food can spoil easily in hot summer weather. It is very important to make sure food is handled cleanly during all steps. Businesses should also improve how they store food, and how clean their employees, work areas, and equipment are. They must carefully check how food is made and its quality. They should follow all food safety laws to make sure food is safe and clean.</p>

            <h1>South Korea Shows Peace, Kim Yo Jong Calls It 'Wishful Thinking'</h1>
            <p>Kim Yo Jong, who is the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said today that North Korea has never taken down its loudspeakers used for propaganda, and they will not do so in the future. She said that South Korea's idea that North Korea is reacting to its peaceful actions is just "wishful thinking."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Kim Yo Jong, who is a high-ranking official in North Korea's Workers' Party, stated that changing the yearly military exercises between South Korea and the US is "useless." She added that it will not change the fact that this alliance is against North Korea.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Kim Yo Jong has strongly disagreed with the new liberal government in South Korea. This government has been trying to make the situation between North and South Korea less tense. Officials and experts think that Kim Yo Jong speaks for her brother, Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>North Korea's official news agency (KCNA) shared what Kim Yo Jong said: "I believe Seoul's way of dealing with North Korea will not change, and it will never change."</p>
            <p>The South Korean military said they saw North Korean soldiers taking down some loudspeakers that were used to send messages to South Korea. South Korea had also taken down similar loudspeakers before.</p>
            <p>After a time of high tension, people in South Korea were carefully hopeful. They thought that North Korea might be reacting well to President Lee Jae-myung's plan to talk with North Korea. They even thought North Korea might want to start talking again.</p>
            <p>Kim Yo Jong also said that North Korea will not have talks with the United States. She said that any news about such talks happening is "false ideas."</p>
