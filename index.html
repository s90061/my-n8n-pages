            <h1>Trump: Nearly 200 Tariff Letters Will Be Sent Next Week, Rates 10% or 15%</h1>
            <p>Washington D.C., July 25 (CNA) - The deadline for a break in US equal tariffs is coming soon. US President Donald Trump said today that most agreements are now done. The US will directly "collect certain tariffs." In the next week, nearly 200 tariff letters will be sent to tell countries their new tax rates, which might be 10%, 15%, or less.</p>
            <p>In early April, Trump started equal tariff measures on "Liberation Day." Earlier this month, he signed an order to delay the equal tariff break until August 1st. This was to give countries more time to talk with the US. But he also sent over 20 tariff letters to tell trade partners about the new tariff rates. Taiwan was not included in these letters.</p>
            <p>As the August 1st deadline gets closer, Trump spoke to reporters today before going to Scotland. He said, "Most of the agreements are finished now because we will just collect certain tariffs directly." He will keep sending tariff letters to countries in the next week. The tax rates might be 10%, 15%, or possibly less.</p>
            <p>He said nearly 200 tariff letters will be sent. "Once those letters are sent, we have an agreement."</p>
            <p>Trump had sent tariff letters to Japan, the EU, and Canada before. He said Japan and the EU came back to talk with the US. After the US and Japan made a trade deal earlier this week, he thinks there is a good chance the EU will also make a deal. But talks with Canada are not going well. Canada might be a country where the US just collects taxes without talking.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump will visit Scotland from today until July 29th. He will visit Turnberry and Aberdeen. He will also meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to make a big trade deal between the US and UK even better.</p>
            <p>He said they want to talk about some parts of the agreement and "make small changes."</p>
            <p>When reporters asked if there was room to change steel and aluminum tariffs, Trump said no.</p>
            <p>In May, Trump announced that the US and UK had made a trade deal plan. The UK will allow more US products into its market and lower non-tariff barriers for US products. The US will still tax UK products at 10%. But, based on the deal, UK car makers can send 100,000 cars to the US each year with a 10% "equal tariff." If they send more than this number, the tax rate will go up to 25%.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported earlier that Trump and Starmer signed a trade deal at the G7 summit in June. This deal greatly lowered US taxes on UK cars and aerospace products. But the parts about steel and aluminum tariffs are still being discussed.</p>

            <h1>Thai-Cambodian Conflict: CNN Says US Ally Fights China-Backed Forces</h1>
            <p>Bangkok, July 25 (CNA) - Deadly fights have happened on the border between Thailand and Cambodia. US news reports say that one side fighting has a long-term friendship with the US and a stronger army. The other side has a weaker army but is close to China.</p>
            <p>CNN says that since France, a strong colonial country, drew the border over 100 years ago, Bangkok and Phnom Penh have often fought over land.</p>
            <p>Since the fight between Thailand and Cambodia started yesterday, more than ten people have reportedly died, and over 100,000 people have left their homes.</p>
            <p>CNN compared the two sides in the conflict based on history and military strength:</p>
            <p><h3>Thailand Has Better Numbers</h3></p>
            <p>Thailand is much stronger than its neighbor Cambodia in terms of the number of soldiers and weapons.</p>
            <p>Thailand has 361,000 active soldiers, which is three times more than Cambodia. Thai soldiers also have many different weapons that Cambodian soldiers do not have.</p>
            <p>The British think tank IISS (International Institute for Strategic Studies) wrote in its "Military Balance 2025" report: "Thailand has a big and well-funded army. Its air force is one of the best in Southeast Asia in terms of equipment and training."</p>
            <p>At the same time, the Lowy Institute for International Policy, an Australian think tank, ranked the military strength of 27 countries in the region. Thailand was 14th, and Cambodia was 23rd.</p>
            <p>It might not be a surprise that their armies are so different. Thailand's population is four times larger than Cambodia's, and its GDP (total money earned by the country) is more than ten times larger. Also, unlike Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, Thailand was not hurt by wars in Southeast Asia in the second half of the 20th century. Before that, it also did not experience European colonization.</p>
            <p>Overall, the Lowy Institute's "Asia Power Index," which ranks countries based on military, economic, diplomatic, and cultural strength, shows Thailand at number 10. This is lower than Indonesia but higher than countries like Malaysia and Vietnam.</p>
            <p>The Lowy Institute puts Cambodia among the smaller countries in Asia, similar to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Laos.</p>
            <p><h3>Thailand's Strong Relationship with the US and Global View</h3></p>
            <p>The military is very important in Thai politics. For many years, conservative groups ruled Thailand. These groups included the military, the king, and powerful important people.</p>
            <p>According to the CIA World Factbook, since 1932, military leaders in Thailand have taken power in 20 coups (sudden, illegal takeovers of government). These coups often led to democratic governments being removed. The military sees itself as the main protector of the monarchy (system with a king or queen).</p>
            <p>According to the US Department of State, Thailand has been a treaty ally of the US since 1954. This was when they signed the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," also known as the "Manila Pact."</p>
            <p>During the Vietnam War, US Air Force B-52 bombers were based at several airfields in Thailand. Tens of thousands of Thai soldiers also fought with US-backed South Vietnamese forces against communist North Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Washington has kept a strong relationship with Bangkok. It calls Thailand a major non-NATO ally. This has given Thailand access to US support for its weapon programs for decades.</p>
            <p>The yearly Cobra Gold exercise, which started in 1982, is held by Thailand and the US Indo-Pacific Command. It began as a joint military exercise between Thailand and the US, and many other countries have joined since then.</p>
            <p>The US Department of State says that in addition to Cobra Gold, Thai and US armies have done over 60 other joint exercises.</p>
            <p><h3>Cambodia Gets Support from China</h3></p>
            <p>According to IISS, the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces were formed in 1993. This was after Cambodia's communist government army joined with two non-communist resistance armies. This makes them newer than the Thai army.</p>
            <p>IISS states: "China and Vietnam are the most important international contacts for Cambodia's defense. While there is a history of relying on Russia for weapons, China has become the main supplier."</p>
            <p>Beijing has even built a naval base in Cambodia. International experts say that the Ream Naval Base, located in the Gulf of Thailand, will be able to host Chinese aircraft carriers.</p>
            <p>Cambodia and China had their 7th "Golden Dragon" joint exercise in May this year. It was said to be the biggest ever and included live fire drills.</p>
            <p>A report from February this year on the Chinese People's Liberation Army's English website said that their relationship is expected to "enter a new stage and achieve new developments." This is the support the Cambodian army needs.</p>
            <p><h3>What Happens Next</h3></p>
            <p>US military expert Carl Schuster said that even though Thailand has an advantage in the number and quality of its military, one thing helps Cambodia: the actual land along the disputed border.</p>
            <p>He told CNN: "The land makes it easier to enter the disputed area from Cambodian territory."</p>
            <p>Schuster also said that Cambodian forces are known to have placed landmines and traps in the disputed area. Thailand is expected to rely on long-range weapons.</p>
