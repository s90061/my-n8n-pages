            <h1>Shortage of Specific Epilepsy Medication: Normal Supply to Resume in December</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) recently announced on its Western Medicine Supply Information Platform that there is a temporary shortage of "Neurontin Capsules 100mg." This medicine is used to treat epilepsy. The shortage is because of delays in the manufacturing factory's supply chain. The medicine is currently being controlled and supplied. It is expected to be available normally again in December this year.</p>
            <p>On September 3, the TFDA announced information about the shortage of "NEURONTIN CAPSULES 100MG" by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals. This information is for doctors and clinics.</p>
            <p>Shen Tsai-ying, the head of the Taiwan Association of Community Pharmacists, said today through a media group that Pfizer announced a medicine shortage in early August. They have not been able to order the medicine since August. She knows that two other Taiwanese factories make the same medicine. But if there are only three factories, and one has a shortage, it will affect patients' access to the medicine. She thinks we should check the medicine licenses and the factories that produce them. This will make healthcare stronger.</p>
            <p>According to the National Health Insurance Administration, about 15 million doses of this medicine were used in 2023. Yang Po-wen, a senior technical specialist from the TFDA's drug division, told CNA in the evening that this medicine is approved to help treat partial seizures in adults and children aged 3 and older, and nerve pain after shingles. The TFDA received a report from the medicine's license holder about the supply problem causing the shortage. The medicine is now being supplied in a controlled way. It is expected to return to normal supply in December this year.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-wen said that after checking, there are still two other licenses for medicines with the same active ingredient, same form, and same amount in Taiwan. The TFDA has asked these companies to make more, and they will supply them soon. Also, doctors can choose medicines with the same active ingredient but different amounts, depending on the patient's needs. This should meet the needs of patients.</p>
