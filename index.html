            <h1>Matatagaya River Landslide Dam Causes 15 Deaths, 7 Missing; Volunteers Help Hualien, Disaster Center Improves Transport and Communication</h1>
            <p>The Matatagaya River in Hualien had a landslide dam that caused a disaster. Many people are now helping with recovery work. The Central Emergency Operation Center said that many volunteers came to help today. They will improve transport and communication. So far, 15 people have died, and 7 people are still missing.</p>
            <p>On the afternoon of September 23, water overflowed from the landslide dam in the Matatagaya River in Hualien. This caused serious damage to homes in Guangfu Township and resulted in deaths and injuries. Today is the fourth day after the disaster. Many volunteers and groups are helping with recovery and cleaning the area. They are also helping the people affected.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center held a special meeting this morning about the Matatagaya River landslide dam in Hualien. Mr. Huang Chao-chin, the Deputy Commander and Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Agriculture, led the meeting.</p>
            <p>According to the Central Emergency Operation Center, as of 9 AM today, 15 people have died, 7 are missing, and 78 are injured because of the overflowing dam. The number of missing people changed from 8 to 7 because a body found yesterday on Fozu Street was identified by the family.</p>
            <p>Before each government department gave their reports, the Central Emergency Operation Center had a video meeting with the local command post. The commander of the local post talked about things like clearing trash, helping volunteers with transport, improving communication, and giving supplies to the affected people.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center said that for clearing trash, if it stays on the roadside, it could cause environmental problems. They asked the relevant government departments to quickly find a good place to put it. They also said they would quickly sort out transport for volunteers and improve phone signals.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center reported that before the water overflowed, the landslide dam was 200 meters high. Now it is 86 meters. The lake area was 140 hectares and is now 15.5 hectares. The total amount of water in the dam was 91 million tons and is now 7 million tons.</p>
            <p>Also, the National Airborne Service Corps helicopters flew over the dam area today. They saw that water is still washing away the dam body from the overflow opening. The collapsing slopes around it are still not stable. Also, rain in the water collection area still adds water to the lake. So, a red alert remains.</p>
            <p>The report also stated that the first line of defense for the Matatagaya River channel is planned to be finished within 2 weeks. This will hopefully stop the water from flowing out again. They plan to fix the damaged Guangfu No. 1 levee within 1 month and strengthen it within 3 months. The repairs should be finished before the flood season in 2026. Heavy machines needed for the disaster area are expected to arrive by noon today.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center said that for the Matatagaya River bridge that was washed away, they expect to finish a temporary road with culverts within 1 month. A temporary steel bridge should be finished in 4 months. A one-way bridge will open by the end of 2026, and all bridges will be finished and open by the following year.</p>
            <p>In addition, to help volunteers in the disaster area, Taiwan Railways Administration (TRA) will add 10 train services from today until September 29. They are also thinking about adding more train cars. The local police have set up checkpoints on important roads and added police officers to help with traffic. They have also announced information about alternative routes.</p>
            <p>The Central Emergency Operation Center also said they have created plans to help the affected people with money. This includes interest help for rebuilding or buying homes, interest help for repair loans, rental help, and short-term places to stay. They will share this information soon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Huang Chao-chin ordered that they continue to work with the local government to find the 7 missing people. Because drones showed that water is still overflowing from the landslide dam, the red alert is still active. They understand that affected people want to go home, but they suggest staying in safe places first.</p>

            <h1>Former Democratic Official Joins Microsoft, Trump Says She Should Be Fired</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Donald Trump said that Microsoft should fire Lisa Monaco. Ms. Monaco worked for two past Democratic presidents. Now, she is the President of Global Affairs at Microsoft.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that this seems to be the latest action from Trump to get back at people he sees as his political enemies. This happened the day after James Comey, a former head of the FBI, was charged with a crime.</p>
            <p>After Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Ms. Monaco helped the Department of Justice manage and respond to the event.</p>
            <p>Ms. Monaco was a security advisor for former US President Barack Obama. She was also the Deputy Attorney General in former President Joe Biden's government. According to her LinkedIn page, Ms. Monaco joined Microsoft in July. She is in charge of how the company works with governments around the world.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, that Ms. Monaco "is a danger to America's national security, especially because Microsoft has big contracts with the US government."</p>
            <p>He also wrote in his post: "I think Microsoft should end Ms. Monaco's job contract right away."</p>
            <p>Ms. Monaco's security clearance was taken away in February this year. Trump said today that because of "many wrong actions by Ms. Monaco," the US government has also stopped her from entering any government buildings.</p>
            <p>Microsoft did not want to comment on Trump's post. Ms. Monaco herself did not answer immediately.</p>

            <h1>China and Russia Work Together on Energy; Russia Says Arctic Gas Projects Are Happening</h1>
            <p>On September 26, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak led the 22nd meeting of the China-Russia Energy Cooperation Committee in Beijing. Mr. Novak said that Russia and China are working on several projects together. These include getting natural gas from the Arctic and turning it into a liquid.</p>
            <p>According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak held the 22nd meeting of the China-Russia Energy Cooperation Committee in Beijing on September 26.</p>
            <p>Ding Xuexiang said that working together on energy is a great example of fair and useful teamwork between China and Russia. He offered three ideas to make this energy cooperation stronger in different areas. First, they should combine their interests more deeply and slowly move forward with important projects. Second, they should find more ways to work together in areas like renewable energy, hydrogen energy, and energy storage, to help change how energy is used. Third, they should work together better to truly follow many-sided ways of working and help global ideas for managing energy become real.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that during the meeting, both sides looked at how they are working together on oil, natural gas, coal, electricity, renewable energy, and nuclear energy. They talked deeply about what to do next and agreed on many things. After the meeting, Ding Xuexiang and Novak both signed the meeting notes.</p>
            <p>According to Sputnik news agency on September 26, Mr. Novak said in the meeting that Russia wants to work with China on electricity. This includes buying and selling electricity and building important energy structures. He also said that Russia and China are working on new ways to send natural gas, such as a route through the Far East and another one through Mongolia.</p>
            <p>Mr. Novak also mentioned that "they are working on several joint projects. These include getting natural gas from the Arctic and turning it into a liquid, building a gas processing complex in the Baltic Sea, a gas chemical complex in Amur, and working together to develop the Zashulan coal mine in the Transbaikal region."</p>
