            <h1>Lien Bing-fa Becomes First Vietnamese Golden Bell Best Actor, Says "Beyond Imagination" and Thanks Taiwan for Kindness</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 18 (CNA) Lien Bing-fa, an actor from Vietnam, won the Best Actor award at the 60th Golden Bell Awards for his role in the drama "Out of the Medical World." He is the first Vietnamese person to win this award. He beat many strong actors to get the prize. He thanked Taiwan for the chance, saying, "I love Taiwan very much. Thank you for your kindness and gentleness."</p>
            <p>In "Out of the Medical World," Lien Bing-fa played a doctor who works in different countries. His character faced challenges with medical ideas and his own identity. His excellent acting surprised everyone. Lien Bing-fa said that winning the award was more than he ever imagined. He thanked the production team, his fans, and Taiwan for giving him this opportunity, and for its kindness and gentleness.</p>
            <p>Lien Bing-fa used to be a tour guide. He decided to quit and become an actor because he couldn't give up his dream of art. He gave himself two years to try to succeed in the entertainment business and went to hundreds of auditions. When he was 26, his first movie, "Double Wolves," won an award. He said, "I am not afraid that I started late. The important thing is how long you can keep going." He is very thankful to be able to act in Taiwan and hopes to make more movies here.</p>
            <p>Yan Yi-wen also won the Best Director award for a drama series for "Queen of the Shadows." She said, "Only after I finished filming 'Queen of the Shadows' and people started calling me 'director' did I feel like I had truly succeeded. This year, this was the award I wanted the most."</p>
            <p>Now that she has won, she dedicates the award to her father in heaven. "Before he passed away, he told me that because I started in this industry later in life, and I wasn't a great beauty, if I wanted to succeed, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and do things I wanted to do but were afraid of. Dad, I listened to you, and I hope you can see all these efforts."</p>

            <h1>European Parliament Opposes China's Misinterpretation of UN Resolution 2758, Taiwan's Foreign Ministry Expresses Thanks</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 18 (CNA) Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stated today that the European Parliament's "Delegation for Relations with China" made an announcement on October 16. This happened after the 42nd EU-China Inter-Parliamentary Meeting. In their statement, they said again that they support peace in the Taiwan Strait. They also clearly stated their opposition to China's wrong interpretation of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758. MOFA welcomes and thanks the European Parliament for this. Taiwan will continue to work closely with the European Parliament to make democracy stronger.</p>
            <p>MOFA added that in their statement, the European Parliament's "Delegation for Relations with China" said again that keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is good for both the European Union and the whole world. They once again clearly disagreed with China's wrong understanding of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. They also stressed that they will continue to work closely with Taiwan. The EU rejects any actions that try to change the situation in the Taiwan Strait using force or threats.</p>
            <p>MOFA pointed out that during its current term, the European Parliament has already passed several statements friendly to Taiwan. These include a resolution called "The People's Republic of China's Improper Interpretation of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 and its Continuous Military Provocations Against Taiwan." They also passed two resolutions on the EU's "Common Foreign and Security Policy" and "Common Security and Defense Policy."</p>
            <p>MOFA said that these statements show that the European Parliament strongly supports keeping peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the Indo-Pacific region. They also show that Europe is very concerned about China's incorrect reading of international law and UN resolutions. In the future, Taiwan will continue to improve its cooperation with the European Parliament. We will work together to make our democracies stronger and build partnerships based on shared values.</p>

            <p>Chiayi County, October 18 (CNA) The Puzi Police Station in Chiayi County received a report today about a baby's body found in a house in Liujiao Township. The police started a special investigation. This evening, they caught a foreign caregiver at Chiayi HSR Station. The caregiver admitted that she gave birth to the baby. The reason for leaving the baby is still unclear.</p>
            <p>The police said that around 10 AM today, they got a call. The caller said a baby's body was found in a house in Gengliao Village, Liujiao Township. When the police arrived, they quickly started working on the case and asked the prosecutor to lead the investigation. Firefighters checked the baby and confirmed it was a newborn and clearly dead.</p>
            <p>The police explained that the person who reported the case went home this morning to visit their parents. The mother told them that their Indonesian caregiver might have been pregnant. The person reporting the case then found a suspicious feed bag next to the house wall. When they opened it, they found a newborn baby's body inside and immediately called the police.</p>
            <p>The police looked for more clues and talked to people. They focused on the caregiver. This evening, they brought her in for questioning. The caregiver admitted that she had given birth to the newborn. The exact reason why she left the baby is still unknown. After questioning, the case will be sent to the Chiayi District Prosecutor's Office for investigation under the charge of abandonment leading to death.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi District Prosecutor's Office said that the baby's body had no outer injuries. It looked like a baby born at full term. It is not yet clear if the baby was born alive or dead. An autopsy will be done later to find out the cause of death.</p>
