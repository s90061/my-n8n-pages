Many families are now buying less food when they go to the supermarket. This is because the cost of living has gone up significantly, making everyday items more expensive. People are finding they have less money for groceries, even for things they buy regularly.

To save money, shoppers are making several changes. Some are choosing cheaper brands instead of their usual favorites. Others are looking for discounts and special offers more often. Many families are also carefully planning their meals at home to avoid wasting food, and they are eating out less frequently. This trend shows how higher prices are directly affecting daily life and household budgets across the country.

**How Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Workplace**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how many jobs are done, making the workplace look very different. Companies are using AI tools more and more to help with tasks that are repeated, like processing data or answering customer questions. This means some parts of people's jobs might be done by machines instead.

However, experts say that AI isn't usually taking away jobs completely. Instead, it's changing what skills workers need. There's a growing demand for people who can work *with* AI, understand how it operates, and use it effectively. This shift means employees might need to learn new digital skills and focus more on problem-solving, creativity, and human interaction, which AI cannot easily do. Many new jobs are also being created directly because of AI technology.

**Popular Travel Spots Tackle Too Many Tourists**

Some of the world's most famous cities and natural places are facing a problem: too many tourists. While tourism helps local economies, a very large number of visitors can cause issues like crowded streets, higher prices for locals, and damage to the environment. This situation is often called "over-tourism."

To deal with this, many popular destinations are now trying new methods to manage the flow of visitors. These methods include setting limits on how many people can enter certain areas each day, introducing tourist taxes, or encouraging visitors to explore less-known parts of the region. The goal is to make tourism more sustainable, meaning it benefits both travelers and the local communities, without harming the environment for the future.
