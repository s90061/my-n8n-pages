            <h1>Hsu Chia-ching Visits Brazil: From Dreams to Roots, Overseas Taiwanese Celebrate 70 Years of Immigration</h1>
            <p>Hsu Chia-ching, the head of the Overseas Community Affairs Council, arrived in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, on August 23rd for a six-day visit. Her first stop was a celebration for the 70th anniversary of Taiwanese immigration to Brazil. She joined hundreds of overseas Taiwanese people to remember the hard work and great achievements of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil over the past 70 years.</p>
            <p>This year marks 70 years since Taiwanese people started moving to Brazil. Many groups worked together to plan this celebration. It showed how strong the overseas Taiwanese community is and how well they have kept their culture alive. Ambassador Liao Chih-hsien, Taiwan's representative in Brazil, and Director Chu Yi-ching, from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in SÃ£o Paulo, were there with Ms. Hsu. This showed that the government cares a lot about the overseas Taiwanese community.</p>
            <p>The event had many different activities, such as an exhibition of immigrant items, a painting exhibition by famous artist Chang Dai-chien and his students, a Taiwanese food fair, and a main celebration ceremony. The exhibition used pictures and words to show the difficult journey of the first Taiwanese immigrants to Brazil. It also showed the great contributions of later generations in areas like education, culture, and economy. The food fair attracted people with classic Taiwanese snacks like shaved ice, minced pork rice with mushrooms, oyster vermicelli, and bubble tea. This fully showed the rich and varied food culture of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The main celebration was grand and heartwarming. Nearly a thousand overseas Taiwanese people and Brazilian friends attended. There were exciting music, dance, and art performances. Guests gave gifts and cut a cake together. This showed the deep roots of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil and their hopes for the future. SÃ£o Paulo City Council member Kenji Ito gave awards and medals on behalf of the City Council. He recognized the contributions and influence of Taiwanese people on local society.</p>
            <p>In her speech, Hsu Chia-ching said that the history of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil is a journey full of hard work and hope. The first generation of immigrants built a strong foundation. The second and third generations continue to pass on culture and education. This shows the community's strong unity and their continued spirit of helping others.</p>
            <p>She encouraged the descendants of immigrants to return to Taiwan for school to strengthen their connection with Taiwan. She also said that the Overseas Community Affairs Council will keep promoting policies to help overseas Taiwanese get more resources for economic development, cultural inheritance, and youth training. This will help the overseas communities shine even brighter in the local society.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Liao Chih-hsien said in his speech that the 70th anniversary of Taiwanese immigration to Brazil is an important historical moment. He noted that the Chang Dai-chien and his students' painting exhibition crossing international borders shows the deep influence of Taiwanese culture. He praised Taiwanese immigrants for being kind and helpful, actively participating in society, and showing a positive force on the international stage.</p>
            <p>Director Chu Yi-ching added that Taiwanese immigrants have worked hard and overcome many difficulties. They have achieved great things in various fields in Brazil and have become a bridge and example for Taiwan-Brazil friendship. She also mentioned that SÃ£o Paulo is a special place with kind people, making it an important base for promoting cultural exchange between Taiwan and Brazil.</p>
            <p>Liu Hsueh-lin, the head of the event's planning committee, also spoke at the meeting. He introduced a book called "The History of Taiwanese Immigration to Brazil: Roots." This book won first place in the Social Sciences category of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Cultural and Educational Foundation's Chinese Writing Awards in 2024. It is an important part of studying the history of Taiwanese immigrants in Brazil. An animated film called "Dreams and Roots" was also shown. It encouraged the descendants of immigrants to bravely follow their dreams, remember where they came from, and create a better future for themselves and society.</p>
            <p>During her visit, Hsu Chia-ching also visited important overseas Taiwanese organizations and schools in SÃ£o Paulo. These included the Moo-Yi Church, the Moo-Tao Church, the Chinese Association, the Saint Jude Chinese School, and the Brazil Hakka Association. She will also visit overseas communities in Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro to learn more about their efforts and achievements in faith, culture, and education.</p>

            <h1>Students from New Southbound Countries Reach 82,000, A New High, Increasing Over 2 Times in 11 Years</h1>
            <p>The latest statistics from the Ministry of Education show that in the 2024-2025 school year, there are 123,000 international students in colleges and universities. Among these, about 82,000 students are from New Southbound Policy countries. This is the highest number ever, more than double the number from 11 years ago. For the past five years, Vietnam has had the most students.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education recently released new statistics. These show that the number of international students in colleges and universities was 93,645 in the 2014-2015 school year. This number grew each year, reaching its highest point of 129,207 in the 2018-2019 school year. In the 2020-2021 school year, when COVID-19 started, the number dropped to 90,895. After that, it slowly went back up. In the 2024-2025 school year, it has reached 123,188 students.</p>
            <p>For students from New Southbound Policy countries, the Ministry of Education's statistics show that there were 25,289 students in the 2014-2015 school year. This was 27% of all international students. The number grew each year, reaching 82,622 students in the 2024-2025 school year. This is a new record high and makes up 67% of all international students. The number of students from New Southbound Policy countries has increased by more than two times in 11 years.</p>
            <p>Looking closer at students from New Southbound Policy countries, which include Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and India, the Ministry of Education found something interesting. Before and including the 2019-2020 school year, most students from these countries were from Malaysia. But starting from the 2020-2021 school year, Vietnam became the country with the most students (17,534 people). Vietnam has stayed in the top spot since then, reaching 39,695 students in the 2024-2025 school year. This is more than double the number in five years.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education explained that to attract students from New Southbound Policy countries to study in Taiwan, they have started several plans. These include the "New Southbound Industry-Academia Cooperation International Program," the "Plan to Increase Enrollment of Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Foreign Students in Key Industries," and the "Plan to Promote International Students Coming to and Staying in Taiwan." These plans give schools more flexibility in admitting students to bring in more international students.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Ministry of Education also provides many scholarships and grants. It also keeps improving support services and advice for international students. This helps make sure there are good support systems in place to make studying in Taiwan more attractive for talented students from New Southbound Policy countries. Every year, the Ministry also visits New Southbound Policy countries to join or hold higher education exhibitions and recruitment events. They share information about studying in Taiwan with local students and their parents.</p>
