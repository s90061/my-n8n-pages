            <h1>Tsai Chi-chang Goes to Japan to Watch Key Taiwanese Players for WBC; Ku Lin-jui-yang Has Recovered from Injury</h1>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang, who is the head of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL), went to Japan in early September. He wanted to see Taiwanese players who play there. Today, he said he met Ku Lin-jui-yang, Sung Chia-hao, and other players. Ku Lin-jui-yang's injury is now completely better. Tsai also helped the World Baseball Classic (WBC) Taiwan team's head coach, Tseng Hao-chu, watch important players.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang went to Japan recently. On August 31, he went to a "Taiwan Day" event for the Japanese team Nippon Ham Fighters. He also visited three baseball teams: Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, and Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He met Ku Lin-jui-yang and Sun Yi-lei from the Fighters, Wang Yen-cheng, Sung Chia-hao, Hsiao Chi, and Yang Po-hsiang from Rakuten, and Chang Chun-wei from SoftBank.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang traveled with Lin Wei-chu, who is a vice team leader for the Fubon Guardians. Tsai said he wanted to meet all the Taiwanese players in Japan. But only three teams had games at times that worked for them. Tsai met seven players. He said that some of these players were important ones that Tseng Hao-chu, the head coach for the WBC Taiwan team, specifically asked him to watch carefully.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang said, "It was like when I went to America before. This time, I went to Japan with Wei-chu to follow Coach Hao-chu's instructions. We looked for specific things about the players. During this visit, I found the answers for him."</p>
            <p>Ku Lin-jui-yang was supposed to pitch in his first recovery game in the minor league on September 4. But it was delayed because of rain. In the end, he threw 30 pitches indoors. Tsai Chi-chang also went to the bullpen to see Ku Lin-jui-yang that day. Tsai said that Ku Lin-jui-yang's pitching speed is back to 150 kilometers per hour. He also had no pain after throwing. This shows his injury has healed.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chi-chang also said that during his trip to Japan, besides seeing the players, he also talked with the three teams: Nippon Ham, Rakuten, and SoftBank. He hopes to build stronger connections with the CPBL.</p>

            <h1>National Freeway No. 7 City Plan Change Approved, Improving Kaohsiung's Traffic Strength</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior's City Planning Committee approved a plan today. It is about changing the city plan for the "National Freeway No. 7 Kaohsiung Section New Construction Project." The city's Urban Development Bureau said that after this plan is approved, it will make traffic stronger and improve the city's ability to compete. The project is expected to finish by the end of 2030.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Interior's City Planning Committee held its 1086th meeting today. They approved the city plan change for the "National Freeway No. 7 Kaohsiung Section New Construction Project." Lin Chin-jung, the Vice Mayor of Kaohsiung, led the city government team to the meeting. This showed the city's strong desire to improve industry and traffic.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung said that in recent years, the city area of Kaohsiung has grown quickly. Also, Kaohsiung Port handles more than ten million containers every year. Because of this, traffic has become more complex. To fix the problem of traffic jams, the Executive Yuan approved the "National Freeway No. 7 Kaohsiung Section New Construction Project Plan" in March 2023.</p>
            <p>This project will start by connecting to National Freeway No. 10. It will then go south through Dashu, Renwu, Niaosong, Daliao, Fengshan, Xiaogang, and Linyuan areas. It will pass the east side of the Linhai Industrial Park to Nansing Road, which is a road connecting to the Intercontinental Container Terminal. The total length will be 23 kilometers. The total cost will be about 135.79 billion New Taiwan Dollars. It is expected to be finished and open to traffic by the end of 2030.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, the Urban Development Bureau sent out a press release. It said that this change plan includes eight planning areas. These are Dashu, Renwu, Chengcing Lake Special District, Niaosong (Renmei Area), Daliao, east of Dapingding, Dapingding Special District, and the original Kaohsiung City area. The area being changed is about 133 hectares.</p>
            <p>The plan also involves changing areas for agriculture, industry, rivers, parks, and roads. The Urban Development Bureau said they will mainly use public land first. They will also use flexible ways like setting up surface rights to reduce problems with moving people and land disputes.</p>
            <p>Also, National Freeway No. 7 will connect with National Freeways No. 1 and 10, Provincial Highway 88, and the planned second Kaohsiung-Pingtung Expressway. This will create a round-shaped fast road network for eastern Kaohsiung. It is expected to reduce traffic on National Freeway No. 1 by 14% to 24%, on Provincial Highway 88 (Wujia to Fengshan section) by 30%, and on National Freeway No. 10 (Renwu to Dingjin section) by 29%.</p>
            <p>When National Freeway No. 7 is built, it will be the main road connecting to the Intercontinental Container Center. It will help to separate large truck traffic from other vehicles. This will reduce the mix of big and small vehicles on local roads. It will also lower the risk of accidents in the city and make local traffic safer. And it will connect important industrial areas to the north, making transport between the port area and local areas more efficient.</p>
