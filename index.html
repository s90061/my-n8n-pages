Amazon has just launched a new AI-powered chatbot called "Rufus," designed to help shoppers find what they're looking for more easily. Integrated directly into the Amazon mobile app, Rufus can answer questions about products, suggest items based on customer needs, and compare different products.

Rufus isnâ€™t replacing regular search, but rather offering an extra layer of support. Users can ask questions like "Is this jacket waterproof?" or "What are the best hiking boots for beginners?" Rufus uses information from Amazon's product catalog, customer reviews, and online information to provide relevant answers. Amazon hopes this will improve the shopping experience and help customers make more informed decisions. Currently available to a select group of users, Amazon plans to roll out Rufus to more customers in the coming weeks.

**UK's 'Right to Disconnect' Debate Gains Momentum: Should Workers Ignore After-Hours Emails?**

The conversation around a "right to disconnect" law in the UK is getting louder. This law would give employees the legal right to ignore work-related emails and calls outside of their contracted working hours, without fear of punishment. Proponents argue it's crucial for protecting workers' mental health and preventing burnout, especially with the rise of remote work blurring the lines between personal and professional life.

Several European countries, including France and Spain, already have similar laws. Supporters in the UK believe it would lead to a healthier work-life balance, increased productivity during work hours, and reduced stress among employees. However, some business leaders express concerns about potential negative impacts on competitiveness and flexibility, particularly in fast-paced industries. The debate is ongoing, with unions and worker advocacy groups pushing for the government to consider implementing such a law.
