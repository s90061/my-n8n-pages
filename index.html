            <h1>Market Thinks About US-Russia President Talks, Oil Prices Go Down</h1>
            <p>Investors are thinking about two things. First, US President Trump decided to keep the trade war with China on hold for longer. Second, they are watching what might happen from his meeting with Russian President Putin later this week. Because of these things, international oil prices closed lower today.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September went down by 79 cents, or 1.24%. It closed at $63.17 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
            <p>The price of Brent crude oil for October went down by 51 cents, or 0.77%. It closed at $66.12 per barrel in London.</p>

            <h1>Korean News: Ex-President's Wife Arrested, First Time Both Former President and Wife Are Held</h1>
            <p>Yonhap News says that Kim Keon-hee, the wife of former South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol, has been arrested. She is accused of stock market manipulation, interfering in elections, and taking bribes. This is the first time in South Korean history that a former president and their spouse have both been held in custody at the same time. They are currently in different detention centers.</p>
            <p>Reports say that the Seoul Central District Court issued an arrest warrant for Kim Keon-hee late last night. This was because they believed she might destroy evidence. The special team looking into Kim Keon-hee's alleged crimes asked the court on August 7th to arrest her. They said she might have broken laws about capital markets, political money, and special punishments for certain crimes.</p>
            <p>The three accusations are related to a stock manipulation case involving Deutsch Motors, a case where a political middleman interfered in an election, and a case about requests from religious people.</p>
            <p>The court held a hearing yesterday to decide if an arrest was necessary. Kim Keon-hee was there. The hearing lasted more than four hours and finished around 2:35 PM. After the hearing, Kim Keon-hee was sent to the Seoul Southern Detention Center to wait for the decision.</p>
            <p>After the court issued the arrest warrant, Kim Keon-hee was officially held there.</p>
            <p>Yoon Suk-yeol was arrested on July 10th by a special team investigating a case of rebellion and treason. He is currently held at the Seoul Detention Center.</p>
            <p>Kim Keon-hee was supposed to be moved to the Seoul Detention Center, but the special team asked to move her to the Seoul Southern Detention Center instead.</p>

            <h1>Russian Army Moves Far Into East Ukraine; Zelenskyy Says: We Will Destroy Them Soon</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said today that Russian soldiers suddenly moved about 10 kilometers deeper into Ukraine, near Dobropillia, a coal mining town in the east. But Kyiv will "destroy them" soon.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Zelenskyy told reporters: "Russian forces have moved 10 kilometers deep in several places. All of them have no equipment, only weapons in their hands. Some troops have been found or destroyed, or captured. We will find and destroy the rest of the Russian troops soon."</p>
            <p>He also said that Russian President Putin being invited to talk with President Trump in the United States is his "personal victory." This meeting will also cause delays in further sanctions against Moscow.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy explained: "First, he (Putin) will be on US land for talks, which I see as his personal win. Second, he is getting out of being isolated because he will talk on US land. Third, through this meeting, he has somehow delayed sanctions."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that both Kyiv and Moscow need to give up some land to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. Today, Ukraine said that they will not remove their troops from the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine for any possible peace agreement with Russia.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy stated: "We will not pull back from Donbas... If we pull back from Donbas today, including from our defenses, the land and high places we control, we will surely open a way for the Russian army to attack."</p>
