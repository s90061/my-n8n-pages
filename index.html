            <h1>Woman Pulled by Homeless Man While Taking Out Trash in Taipei, Citizens and Police Help Catch Him</h1>
            <p>Yesterday evening in Taipei's Songshan District, a woman was taking out her trash when a homeless man suddenly pulled her towards a wall. Luckily, people passing by helped her, and the police were called. When the police arrived, they found the man, Mr. Xu, had been sniffing glue and had his private parts showing. The police arrested him right away and sent him for legal processing.</p>
            <p>The Songshan Police Precinct's Songshan Police Station received a report around 10 PM last night. The report said that a homeless man in their area was pulling a woman. Police officers were immediately sent to check the situation.</p>
            <p>The investigation showed that the woman was going out to throw away her trash when Mr. Xu, 59 years old, came up behind her. The woman felt something was wrong and turned around. Suddenly, Mr. Xu grabbed her wrist from behind and pushed her against a wall. They struggled in the street.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, a motorcycle rider and a passenger saw that something was wrong. They immediately stopped and went to help. Other people passing by also helped to stop the man and called the police.</p>
            <p>When the police arrived, they confirmed that the woman had no clear injuries. However, Mr. Xu was sniffing glue, seemed confused, and had his private parts showing. He was arrested on the spot.</p>
            <p>The police stated that after their investigation, Mr. Xu would be sent to the Taipei District Prosecutors Office for crimes like forced indecency, coercion, public indecency, violating the Sexual Harassment Prevention Act, and violating the Social Order Maintenance Act.</p>

            <h1>U.S. Scholar Hopes to Make Hualien Children Proud of Their Home by Using Stones as Textbooks for Environmental Education</h1>
            <p>An American scholar who lives in Taiwan hopes that children in Hualien can feel proud of their hometown. She wants to use local stones as teaching materials for environmental education. This way, children can learn about their environment in a special and meaningful way.</p>
            <p>The scholar believes that teaching children about their local environment, especially about the unique geology of Hualien, can help them connect more deeply with their home. By using stones found in Hualien, which is known for its beautiful mountains and coastlines, children can touch and see what they are learning about. This hands-on approach can make learning more interesting and memorable.</p>
            <p>She plans to create lessons where children collect and study different types of stones. They will learn about how these stones were formed and what they tell us about Hualien's history and nature. This method is not just about learning facts; it's about experiencing and appreciating the natural world around them.</p>
            <p>The goal is to teach children the importance of protecting their environment. When they understand and value their home, they are more likely to take care of it. This project could help Hualien's future generations to be guardians of their beautiful natural resources.</p>

            <h1>Women's Groups Call for More Security Cameras in Public Spaces After Sexual Assault Case Involving Wanted Man at Taipei Main Station</h1>
            <p>Following a sexual assault case at Taipei Main Station involving a wanted man, women's groups are asking for more security cameras in public areas. They believe that better monitoring can help keep people safe and prevent such crimes from happening again.</p>
            <p>The incident at Taipei Main Station has caused worry about safety in crowded public places. Women's rights organizations are speaking out, saying that authorities need to do more to protect people, especially women, in these spaces. They point out that a wanted criminal was able to commit a serious crime, which means current security measures might not be enough.</p>
            <p>These groups are suggesting that adding more security cameras, especially in places that are often busy or have poor lighting, can act as a deterrent to criminals. It can also help police identify and catch offenders more quickly if a crime does occur. They emphasize that simply having cameras is not enough; the surveillance systems must be well-maintained and actively monitored.</p>
            <p>They are also calling for better communication and cooperation between different agencies, such as the police and railway authorities, to improve overall public safety. The goal is to make sure that everyone, regardless of gender, feels safe and protected when using public transportation hubs and other public spaces.</p>
