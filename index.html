On July 10, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is ready to talk about a lasting ceasefire in Gaza. This would happen during a 60-day break in fighting. But first, Gaza must be demilitarized, meaning no more military groups or weapons.

On July 6, Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian group, had talks in Doha to try and agree on a temporary ceasefire. The war between them started in October 2023 after Hamas attacked.

Netanyahu stated yesterday that Steve Witkoff, a special envoy from the US, suggested a 60-day ceasefire. In return, half of the 20 hostages still in Gaza would be released. Today, Netanyahu said in a video speech that if the ceasefire begins, they will discuss how to end the war permanently. He added that Hamas must put down its weapons and lose its power to rule or fight. If they cannot agree in 60 days, Israel will use its army to achieve this. Hamas said yesterday they would free 10 hostages, but today they disagreed with the plan because it would mean Israel keeps a large military presence in Gaza. Hamas also wants aid to enter Gaza freely to help with the humanitarian crisis, and they want real guarantees for lasting peace.
