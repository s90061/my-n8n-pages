            <h1>Trump: Putin will face serious problems if he does not agree to end the war</h1>
            <p>A big meeting between the US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will happen on August 15th in Alaska, USA. Trump said today that Russia will face "very serious problems" if Putin does not agree to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. But Trump did not say what these problems would be.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump spoke to the media at an event today. He said that if Putin does not agree to stop the war with Ukraine during their meeting, Russia will face "very serious problems."</p>
            <p>However, when asked if this meant new punishments or taxes, Trump did not answer directly.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Trump had said he might punish countries that buy energy from Russia. He also said he has added more taxes on goods from India. He mentioned that in the future, other countries, possibly including China, might also face these punishments.</p>
            <p>Trump and Putin plan to meet face-to-face on August 15th in Anchorage, the biggest city in Alaska. News from other countries said that this will be the first meeting between a US President and a Russian leader since 2021.</p>
            <p>Also, Trump said today that after his meeting with Putin, he plans to have another meeting soon. This next meeting would include him, Putin, and the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Recently, Russia has attacked Ukraine more often. Also, Zelenskyy was not asked to come to the US-Russia meeting on August 15th. This makes people more worried that Trump and Putin might make a deal that forces Ukraine to give up things it does not want to.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Trump said that both Kyiv (Ukraine) and Moscow (Russia) must give up some land to end the war. Trump and Putin's meeting this week will quickly show if Putin is willing to make a deal. Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine will not give up land that has been taken by force.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has lasted for almost three and a half years. Since Trump returned to the White House, he has been trying to get Russia and Ukraine to agree to stop fighting forever. But so far, he has not been able to get Russia to give up anything important.</p>

            <h1>ESPN: NBA Trail Blazers find a buyer, sold for about 120 billion NT dollars, will stay in Portland</h1>
            <p>Sources have told ESPN that Tom Dundon, the owner of the Carolina Hurricanes ice hockey team (NHL), has agreed to buy the NBA team Portland Trail Blazers. The team was owned by Paul Allen, one of the people who started Microsoft. The price is a bit more than 4 billion US dollars, which is about 120 billion New Taiwan dollars.</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, a business news group in the US, the Trail Blazers were valued at 3.65 billion US dollars this year. This makes them one of the teams with the lowest value in the NBA.</p>
            <p>ESPN, a sports news group in the US, also reported that Tom Dundon wants the team to stay in Portland. This information came from people who know about the deal.</p>
            <p>Paul Allen, who started Microsoft with Bill Gates, bought the Portland Trail Blazers in 1988 for 70 million US dollars (about 2.1 billion New Taiwan dollars). He passed away in 2018 because of cancer. In his will, he said that the team should be sold "at some point."</p>
            <p>After Paul Allen died, his sister Jody owned the team. She managed the team as the person in charge of Paul Allen's trust.</p>
