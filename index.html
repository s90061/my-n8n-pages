            <h1>China Supports Palestine: Clear Position but Limited Power</h1>
            <p>The conflict between Israel and Hamas has been going on for almost two years. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is getting worse. Many Western countries have said they recognize Palestine as a country. China was one of the first countries to have official relations with Palestine. Right now, China's role in the Middle East is mainly about showing moral support. It does not have as much power to get involved in the conflict as the United States, but its influence will grow in the future.</p>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, sent gunmen into Israeli towns. They attacked, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 200 people as hostages. The Israeli army fought back, attacking the Gaza Strip many times.</p>
            <p>At first, China did not clearly criticize Hamas. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning, said two days later that China is "a common friend of Israel and Palestine." She also said that China supports a "two-state solution" to solve the conflict.</p>
            <p>It was not until May 10, 2025, that China's Ambassador to Israel, Xiao Junzheng, clearly stated in an interview with Israeli news that: "Hamas's actions were cruel, unforgivable, and made people angry. China is against and condemns what Hamas did on October 7. This is very clear." This statement was made just before US President Trump visited the Middle East. People talked about the timing of China's statement, thinking it might be a way to divide Israel and the US, and to get closer to Israel.</p>
            <p>In fact, one week after the attack, on October 14, 2023, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke with Turkey's Foreign Minister. Wang Yi criticized Israel's actions, saying they went beyond self-defense. He also said that the main reason the situation between Palestine and Israel is so bad today is because the Palestinian people's right to have their own country has been ignored for a long time. Also, their right to live safely and their right to return home have been ignored for a long time.</p>
            <p>To understand China's position, which is "supporting Palestine but avoiding Hamas," it is important to know China's support for developing countries after the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took power. Also, China's foreign policy tries to balance different ideas, such as not interfering in other countries' business, fighting terrorism, and caring about economic growth.</p>
            <p>‚óè China's Support for Palestine's Statehood: Driven by History</p>
            <p>According to China's official statements, "China was one of the first countries to support the Palestinian people's fight for freedom and to recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the State of Palestine."</p>
            <p>In 1964, the PLO was formed. The next year, it set up an office in Beijing that had the same rights as a diplomatic office. In November 1988, Palestine announced it was creating the State of Palestine in the West Bank. China quickly announced it would have official relations with Palestine.</p>
            <p>After the CCP took power in 1949, during the time when Mao Zedong was in charge, China's foreign policy was to support people in developing countries (called "Asia, Africa, and Latin America") against strong powers and colonial rule. Israel was supported by Europe and the US, so the Palestinian fight for freedom naturally received China's support. The former leader of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, visited China 14 times. His successor, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, has also visited China 5 times since 2005.</p>
            <p>A Chinese scholar of international relations told the Central News Agency that China's early support for Palestine was mainly political, and other types of support were very small. In 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US, China felt that it also faced threats from extreme nationalism, separatism, and extreme religious ideas in Xinjiang. So, fighting terrorism became a top priority for China. Therefore, even though China still gave political support to Palestine, it was very careful about actions that involved terrorism.</p>
            <p>Different from Palestine in the West Bank, Hamas was officially formed at the end of 1987 and controls the Gaza Strip. Many countries, including those in Europe and the US, see it as a "terrorist organization." Hamas also does not recognize Israel's right to exist, unlike the PLO. However, China has not called Hamas a terrorist organization.</p>
            <p>‚óè Fighting Terrorism First: China's Support for and Avoidance of Hamas</p>
            <p>On July 23, 2024, different Palestinian groups signed the "Beijing Declaration" in Beijing. On that day, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with the vice chairman of Fatah, the largest Palestinian group. However, it was not officially stated if Wang Yi also met with representatives of Hamas, the other large group that controls Gaza. Israel's Foreign Minister, Yisrael Katz, said on social media platform X that Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement in China to control Gaza together after the war. He criticized this as not rejecting terrorism.</p>
            <p>Some scholars have different opinions on whether China secretly gives more support to Hamas. Guermantes Lailari, a former US Air Force officer and now an international visiting scholar at Taiwan's Institute for National Defense and Security Research, wrote an article in April 2024. He stated that Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau (who was killed by Israel in May 2025), once studied at Beijing's "Renmin University of China." Mohammed Deif, a military leader of Hamas (later killed by Israel), studied in 1996 at a military engineering college of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. There, he learned how to make artillery, rockets, and explosives.</p>
            <p>The article also said that, according to many sources, during the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, the Israeli army found many Chinese weapons, advanced explosives, equipment for gathering information, and other military supplies in Gaza. They also found two tunnel engineers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This suggests that China helped Hamas build a large network of tunnels in Gaza.</p>
            <p>China denied providing advanced weapons to Hamas in January 2024. But Lailari said that even if these Chinese-made weapons were given to Hamas through Iran, China knew about it.</p>
            <p>‚óè Middle East Peace is Good for China, but Its Mediation Power is Limited</p>
            <p>China started to have a "Special Envoy of the Chinese Government on the Middle East Issue" in 2002, which is only about 20 years ago. The Chinese scholar mentioned earlier said that this position is more like a way for a major country to protect its own interests and views. However, for more than ten years, this position has "done almost nothing and has not been very noticeable."</p>
            <p>In March 2023, China helped Saudi Arabia and Iran, two long-time rivals, agree to start diplomatic relations again and reopen their embassies. This made people see China's influence in a new way. China needs energy from other countries, so it wants the Middle East to be stable and peaceful. However, China has not played a special role in mediating military ceasefires.</p>
            <p>In June this year, as the Israel-Hamas conflict continued, Israel and Iran attacked each other more strongly than ever before. The United States also launched "Operation Midnight Hammer," attacking nuclear sites in Iran and using "massive bunker-buster bombs" in real combat for the first time. But China, which is a partner of Iran and its biggest buyer of oil, did almost nothing except call for the situation to calm down.</p>
            <p>Craig Singleton, a senior fellow for China affairs at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington, analyzed that China only talks about its position. This is because if it "promises too much but does too little, it will show the limits of its power." Other analyses suggest that China will avoid directly confronting the United States on Middle East issues.</p>
            <p>When looking at the Palestinian issue, China's support mainly shows its "moral position." But Palestine also gives back.</p>
            <p>In June 2023, Palestinian President Abbas visited China. He supported China's concerns on all issues. In the joint statement between the two countries, he clearly said that Xinjiang is not a human rights issue. Instead, it is about fighting terrorism, stopping extreme ideas, and preventing separatism. "Palestine strongly opposes interfering in China's internal affairs using the Xinjiang issue as an excuse." Almost all Arab countries, which are mostly Muslim, have not questioned human rights issues in Xinjiang. This is very important for China to keep its own Muslim population calm.</p>
            <p>Also, China and Israel started diplomatic relations in 1992. The Chinese scholar said that the benefits of technical and trade cooperation between the two countries are much greater than what a chaotic Palestine can offer. Having diplomatic ties with Israel also shows that China wants to have richer and more balanced relationships with Middle Eastern countries.</p>
            <p>He said that as China becomes stronger, its involvement in the Middle East will also increase. But for now, China can only help with agreements that are "within its power." China also understands that its power to get involved is still limited.</p>

            <h1>Two-State Solution Summit: Arab League Says It's the Only Way for Middle East Peace</h1>
            <p>The United Nations General Assembly's summit on the two-state solution started at the UN on September 22. France and Saudi Arabia organized the meeting together. The Arab League stressed that creating a Palestinian state is necessary for stability in the region and to end the conflict. It is also the only way to keep peace in the Middle East.</p>
            <p>The UN summit to discuss the "two-state solution" for Palestine and Israel happened on September 22, Eastern US time, at the UN headquarters in New York.</p>
            <p>This summit came from the "New York Declaration" that France and Saudi Arabia had suggested earlier. The declaration says it is important to solve the Palestinian problem peacefully and to make the two-state solution happen. It also asks for countries to work together to stop the war in Gaza and to make the two-state solution work well.</p>
            <p>The Arab League supported this declaration, and more than 10 UN member countries had signed it by July.</p>
            <p>Arab countries believe that for the long conflict between Israel and Palestine, Israel must stop occupying Palestinian land for a long time. They also believe that Palestine should become a state through the "two-state solution."</p>
            <p>As early as 2002, Arab countries signed the "2002 Arab Peace Initiative" to show this long-held belief.</p>
            <p>The main points of the Arab Peace Initiative are: Arab countries will have normal relations with Israel. In return, Israel must leave all Palestinian land it has occupied and blocked since 1967, which it did under the name of security. Also, Palestine must become a state. And Israel must fairly solve the problem of identity for Palestinians who are living outside their home country.</p>
            <p>Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace agreement with Israel in 1979. Jordan followed in 1994.</p>
            <p>However, because Israel has continued to occupy more Palestinian land over the past year, the Arab League, which has 22 member countries, held an urgent meeting in Cairo on September 4. They decided that Israel must completely leave the occupied Palestinian land. This is a necessary step before Arab countries can have "full normal relations" with Israel.</p>
            <p>On September 3, the United Arab Emirates warned Israel. It said that any action to take over the West Bank would seriously harm the spirit of the "Abraham Accords." It would also cross a "red line" for the UAE. This statement was the strongest criticism from the UAE against Israel's actions since the Israel-Hamas conflict began in October 2023.</p>
            <p>The UAE also stated firmly that if Palestine cannot become a state, the UAE will not provide aid for rebuilding after the war, as Israel has asked.</p>
            <p>The "Abraham Accords" were promoted and signed by US President Donald Trump during his first term. They helped Arab countries like the UAE, Bahrain, and Morocco start normal diplomatic relations with Israel.</p>
            <p>Lana Nusseibeh, Assistant Minister for Political Affairs and Special Envoy of the Foreign Minister of the UAE, said: "Signing the Abraham Accords is about continuing to support the Palestinian people and their legal request for an independent state."</p>
            <p>Saudi Arabia was ready to make a peace agreement with Israel in 2023. But in 2024, at the "International Coalition for the Two-State Solution" meeting in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Foreign Minister clearly said that Saudi Arabia could not have normal relations with Israel if Palestine did not become a state.</p>
            <p>On September 15, at the Arab-Islamic Leaders Summit in Qatar, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi even more bravely called Israel an "enemy." Several high-ranking Egyptian government officials told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper that this "enemy statement" seemed like it would end the peace between Israel and Egypt that had lasted for over 40 years.</p>
            <p>Currently, about 150 countries around the world recognize Palestine as a state. These include France, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Spain, and Portugal.</p>
