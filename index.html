            <h1>Deng Kai-Wei Returns to Major League Baseball, Will Start Against Rockies on September 1st</h1>
            <p>Today, the San Francisco Giants baseball team played against the Baltimore Orioles at home. Before the game, the team announced some player changes. Left-handed pitcher Carson Whisenhunt was put on the 15-day injured list. Right-handed pitcher Deng Kai-Wei was called up to the Major Leagues. This is the third time Deng Kai-Wei has been promoted to the Major Leagues since he started playing in the US. He will start as a pitcher in an away game against the Colorado Rockies on September 1st, US time.</p>
            <p>Deng Kai-Wei came back to the Major Leagues today and returned to the San Francisco Giants' home stadium. This is his second time being called up to the Major Leagues in August, and he is set to be a starting pitcher. The team has announced that he will start the game against the Colorado Rockies on September 1st.</p>
            <p>Deng Kai-Wei first joined the Major Leagues in March last year. At that time, he played as a long relief pitcher. Because he had always been a starting pitcher in Triple-A, he needed to get used to a new role in the bullpen. In August this year, he returned to the Major Leagues again as a starting pitcher. He played in 4 games, pitching for 13.1 innings. His record was 1 win and 3 losses. On August 8th, he got his first career win at home against the Nationals.</p>
            <p>Giants' new left-handed pitcher, Carson Whisenhunt, is now on the 15-day injured list. Whisenhunt joined the Major Leagues in July, was sent back to Triple-A for a short time, and then brought back to the Major Leagues to replace the injured Landen Roupp.</p>
            <p>Recently, the Dongyuan Elementary School Little League team, which won the Little League World Series in Williamsport, was invited to the MLB Giants' home stadium. Giants pitcher Spencer Bivens personally recorded a video for the young players to cheer on their senior, Deng Kai-Wei.</p>
            <p>On September 1st, the "North American Taiwan Baseball Alliance" in the San Francisco Bay Area will hold a Minor League Taiwan Day event with the San Jose Giants, a 1A team of the San Francisco Giants. Taiwanese people living abroad will also bring cheering towels to support Deng Kai-Wei in his away game.</p>

            <h1>Alcaraz Wins in Three Sets, Moves to US Open Quarterfinals</h1>
            <p>Today, Spanish tennis player Carlos Alcaraz won his match easily against French player Arthur Rinderknech in three straight sets. This means he has reached the top 8 at the US Open for the fourth time.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Alcaraz, who is the second seed, played against a strong Rinderknech. Alcaraz won the match with scores of 7-6 (7/3), 6-3, and 6-4.</p>
            <p>After the match, Alcaraz said, "The first set was very close at the beginning. But then I found my rhythm and tried to use my chances well. I played aggressive and good shots. After the second set, I had good control and tried to keep playing that way."</p>
            <p>Today, Alcaraz hit 36 winning shots and made only 11 mistakes that were not forced by his opponent. He has not lost a single set in this tournament so far. This is the first time he has reached the top 8 in all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same year.</p>
            <p>"I think my style of play fits well with the energy in New York," he added.</p>
            <p>Next, he will play against Jiri Lehecka from the Czech Republic, who is the 20th seed, to try and get into the semifinals.</p>

            <h1>Washington Post Shares Trump's Plan for Gaza: People to Be Moved, Area Managed for 10 Years</h1>
            <p>Today, the "Washington Post" reported on a plan for Gaza after the war, which is being discussed within President Trump's government. The plan suggests that the US would manage the war-torn area for at least 10 years. It also talks about moving people from Gaza and rebuilding the area to be a place for holidays and factories.</p>
            <p>The "Washington Post" <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/08/31/trump-gaza-plan-riviera-relocation/">reported</a> that a 38-page document they looked at says that during the rebuilding, the 2 million people living in the Gaza Strip would "voluntarily" go to other countries or be moved to special areas within Gaza. This would be for at least a temporary period.</p>
            <p>Reuters had previously reported on an idea to create large camps called "Humanitarian Transit Areas" to house Palestinians. This work might also happen outside of Gaza. This plan uses the name "Gaza Humanitarian Foundation," which is supported by the US. However, this organization is actually seen as controversial.</p>
            <p>According to the Washington Post, people who own land in Gaza would get "digital certificates." These certificates would give them the right to rebuild their homes and other properties. Each Palestinian who leaves would receive 5,000 US dollars in cash, rent help for four years, and enough food for one year.</p>
            <p>The report states that this plan, developed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is called the "Gaza Reconstitution, Economic Acceleration and Transformation Trust" (GREAT Trust).</p>
            <p>The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation works with the Israeli army. An American security and logistics company delivers food into Gaza. This is supported by the Trump government and Israel. Israel says that the United Nations system allows fighters to take aid supplies.</p>
            <p>In early August, the United Nations said that since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started working in May, more than 1,000 people have died trying to get supplies. Most of these deaths happened near the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation's locations, where people were shot by the Israeli army.</p>
            <p>The White House and the State Department did not immediately answer questions about the plan. However, this Gaza rebuilding plan seems to be similar to what Trump has said before.</p>
            <p>On February 4th, Trump first publicly said that the US should "take over" Gaza. After moving the Palestinians, he suggested rebuilding it to be "The Riviera of the Middle East."</p>
