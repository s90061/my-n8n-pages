UK inflation remained unchanged at 8.7% in May, defying expectations of a fall and adding to pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates further. Economists had predicted a drop to 8.4%, but sticky core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, remained stubbornly high at 7.1%. The persistent inflation, significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target, is primarily driven by rising prices in services, including restaurants, hotels, and air travel. This is despite a decrease in energy costs compared to last year.

The unexpected figure has shaken financial markets, with the pound rising against the dollar and euro. It also increases the likelihood of another interest rate hike when the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee meets next week. Higher interest rates could further squeeze households already struggling with the cost of living crisis. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt acknowledged the challenge and reiterated the government's commitment to halving inflation by the end of the year, though analysts are now questioning the feasibility of achieving this target.

**Article 2: Scientists Develop New Material That Can Repair Itself**

A team of researchers has announced the creation of a novel material with the remarkable ability to self-heal. The material, a type of polymer, can mend cracks and scratches without any external intervention, offering potential applications in various industries, from aerospace to consumer electronics. The secret lies in the materialâ€™s unique molecular structure, which allows broken bonds to reform quickly and efficiently. When damage occurs, the molecules are drawn back together, effectively â€˜healingâ€™ the affected area.

Tests have shown that the material can repair significant damage within a matter of hours at room temperature. This self-healing capability could extend the lifespan of products, reduce waste, and improve safety in critical applications. The research team is now working on scaling up production and exploring different applications for the self-healing polymer. They believe that this innovation could revolutionize the way we design and manufacture products, making them more durable and sustainable.

**Article 3: Amsterdam to Ban Cruise Ships from City Center**

Amsterdam is planning to ban cruise ships from its city center in an effort to reduce pollution and overtourism. The move aims to improve the quality of life for residents and protect the city's historic environment. Large cruise ships, which often carry thousands of passengers, contribute significantly to air and water pollution and can overwhelm the city's infrastructure.

City officials believe that removing cruise ships from the central IJ harbor will make Amsterdam a more livable and sustainable city. The ban is part of a broader strategy to manage tourism more effectively, including measures to discourage rowdy behavior and promote responsible travel. While the decision has been welcomed by environmental groups and local residents, it has faced criticism from the cruise industry, which argues that it will negatively impact the city's economy. The ban is expected to come into effect in the near future, pending final approval from the city council.
