            <h1>Russian Airline Cancels Over 40 Flights After Hacker Attack</h1>
            <p>(Moscow, July 28, Central News Agency) Russia's national airline, Aeroflot, was attacked by hackers. A hacker group that supports Ukraine said they did it. Today, Aeroflot had to cancel more than 40 flights, mostly flights within Russia. The Kremlin said the situation is worrying.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Aeroflot canceled these flights after its computer systems stopped working. The canceled flights also included flights to Minsk, the capital of Belarus, and Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Also, at least 10 flights were delayed.</p>
            <p>Aeroflot did not say how long it would take to fix the problem. But at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, the flight boards showed many red "canceled" signs. This happened during a time when many Russians are on holiday and traveling.</p>
            <p>A hacker group called "Silent Crow" said in a statement that they worked with a Belarusian group called Cyberpartisans BY. They said their action was related to Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Glory to Ukraine! Long live Belarus!" Reuters has not been able to check if the statement is true. Ukraine has not said anything about it yet.</p>
            <p>Silent Crow has said before that they carried out several hacker attacks this year. Their targets included Russia's property database, the Russian national telecom company, big insurance companies, Moscow city's IT department, and the Russian office of the Korean car company KIA.</p>
            <p>Russian prosecutors have confirmed that today's problem was caused by a hacker attack. They have started a criminal investigation.</p>
            <p>Dmitry Peskov, who speaks for the Kremlin, said: "The information we read publicly now is quite worrying. The threat from hackers is still a danger for all big companies that offer services to the public."</p>

            <h1>Trump Plans New Taxes on Goods from Countries Without Trade Deals</h1>
            <p>(Turnberry, Scotland, July 28, Central News Agency) Today, former US President Donald Trump said he might put a new tax on goods from countries that do not have their own trade deals with the United States. This tax, called a tariff, could be between 15% and 20%.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a US business news company, reported that Trump met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Turnberry, Scotland. Trump said, "For the whole world, I would say the tariff rate will be between 15% and 20%... I just want to be friendly."</p>
            <p>Trump also said, "I would say it's probably between 15% and 20%, maybe one of those two numbers."</p>
            <p>According to CNBC, these new percentages are much higher than the 10% tariff Trump announced in April this year.</p>
            <p>Trump mentioned, "We will basically set tariffs for all other countries in the world. This is what they will have to pay if they want to do business in the United States, because you cannot sit down and make 200 agreements."</p>
