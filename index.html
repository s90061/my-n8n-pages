            <h1>Golden Eagle Lectures to Start in September, Training Financial Workers</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance has teamed up with National Chengchi University's Finance Department. Today, they announced that the "Golden Eagle Lecture Series" will begin in September. This series will continue the ideas and spirit of Ms. Hou Jin-ying, who is 95 years old. She is known as the "Mother of Taiwan's Finance" and is the chairperson of Far Eastern International Bank. The goal is to keep training people for finance jobs.</p>
            <p>Tonight, the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance held a dinner party at the Far Eastern Shangri-La Hotel in Taipei. This party was to celebrate the start of the Golden Eagle Lecture Series. Teachers and old students from the NCCU Finance Department were there. Mr. Yang Chin-long, the governor of the Central Bank, used to be a student of Ms. Hou Jin-ying when she taught at NCCU's Banking Department (now the Finance Department). He sent his good wishes in writing and gave a special glass monument to show his respect for his former teacher.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chiang Yung-yu, who leads the NCCU Finance Department Alumni Association, spoke at the event. He said that Ms. Hou Jin-ying planned to set up the Taiwan Academy of Banking and Finance in 1995. This helped to build a strong base for financial education. In 2008, she became the chairperson of Far Eastern International Bank. Since then, she has shown great vision and leadership. The Golden Eagle Lecture Series is now starting to show how much she has given to and influenced financial education.</p>
            <p>Ms. Chen Su-tien, who used to be the chairperson of Taiwan Life Insurance, talked about Ms. Hou Jin-ying. She said that Ms. Hou has always paid attention to details and worked hard in education and real-world finance. She not only taught with words but also showed by example, which has greatly influenced many students over the years.</p>
            <p>The NCCU Finance Department said that the Golden Eagle Lecture Series will carry on the friendship among NCCU Finance alumni and its mission in financial education. The courses will mix academic knowledge, practical experience, and current social trends. It will become an important way for financial education and the finance industry to connect.</p>

            <h1>Pixel 10 Review: Experts Say TSMC Chip Makes AI Better</h1>
            <p>Google's new Pixel 10 phones went on sale in Taiwan today. After testing them, tech experts found that the new phones use chips made by TSMC. This makes the Artificial Intelligence (AI) features much more useful. This helps Google keep its leading position in AI. In the future, other Android phone companies will want to use Google's AI services more. This will make the user experience more consistent and smooth.</p>
            <p>The Pixel 10 series has a new Tensor G5 processor. TSMC made this chip using 3-nanometer technology. This is the biggest improvement ever for Google's own chips. It can offer more than 20 generative AI services on the phone. The G5's different computing parts work much better, and the main processor (CPU) is, on average, 34% faster.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yi Ge, the editor of the YouTube channel "Yi Ge's Tech Life," told reporters that AI features have been around for 2 or 3 years. They often make people want to buy new phones. But most people don't think about how cool AI features are. They think about how useful they are.</p>
            <p>After testing the Pixel 10, Mr. Yi Ge found three important things. First, Google's engineering team in Taiwan is the biggest outside of the U.S. Many AI features are tested in Taiwan, so they work there right away when the phone is released.</p>
            <p>Second, Mr. Yi Ge said that in the past, Pixel phone users often complained about the phones getting too hot. Now, the Pixel 10's chips are made by TSMC. During his tests, the phone did not get hot, and it worked very smoothly.</p>
            <p>Also, Mr. Yi Ge said that even the basic Pixel 10 phone has three cameras and the full G5 chip. The price has not gone up, so it's easier for people to buy. Even if some parts are not as good as other phones, AI can make them better. For example, the Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 100x zoom for professional photos. After taking a picture, AI checks the scene and makes the image better. This takes about 3 to 5 seconds, but the result is amazing.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yi Ge also saw that the Pixel 10's battery lasts much longer. Last year, when he tested the basic Pixel 9, it would run out of battery by the afternoon. This year, the Pixel 10 can last all day until you get home.</p>
            <p>Reporters tested the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It has a matte glass back and shiny metal sides. It feels light and balanced in the hand. The fingerprint sensor and face unlock are very fast. Opening apps is also very quick. This is what you expect from a top-end phone.</p>
            <p>Using the Geekbench 6 program to test performance, the Pixel 10 Pro XL's CPU scored 2302 points for single-core tasks and 6248 points for multi-core tasks. This is more than a 30% improvement compared to the Pixel 9 series. This is close to the company's claim of a 34% CPU performance increase.</p>
            <p>When testing the 100x zoom to take a picture of a toy doll at home, you first need to download a special AI image model. After AI made the image better, the words on the tag, which were hard to see before, became very clear. However, the letters for "miffy" on the tag were a little bit twisted. They hope to fix this with future software updates.</p>
            <p>Reporters also tested the "Photo Guidance" feature. You just press a button on the top right of the camera screen when looking at any scene. The AI scans the picture and gives you different ideas for themes. For example, "Get Inspired," "Dolls on the Sofa," "Learning Spot by the Window," or "Study Items on the Desk." After you choose, the AI gives you text instructions, like "Move the camera left to avoid cutting off the table and make the picture more complete." This helps users take good photos.</p>
            <p>The main camera on the Pixel 10 Pro XL can also take portrait photos with up to 50 million pixels. Tests showed that details around hair, depth sensing, and separating subjects were much better. There were no unnatural blurry edges.</p>

            <h1>Roarke Settles Down After Home Run, Brothers Beat Monkeys; Coach Says Hsieh Jung-hao Must Think About It</h1>
            <p>In a baseball game today at the Taipei Dome, the CTBC Brothers pitcher Roarke gave up a home run in the first inning but still pitched well for 6 innings. In the end, the Brothers won against the Rakuten Monkeys with a score of 8 to 6. However, Coach Hirano Keiichi said that in the 9th inning, the closer Wu Chun-wei had to come in. He thinks Hsieh Jung-hao needs to think carefully about his performance.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the 1st inning, the Monkeys scored first when Lin Cheng-fei hit a 3-run home run. But in the second part of the 2nd inning, the Brothers sent 10 batters to the plate. After Hsu Chi-hung got a walk, Chang Chih-hao, Yueh Tung-hua, Chiang Kun-yu, Kao Yu-chieh, and Wang Wei-chen all hit singles. They scored 5 runs to take the lead. When the score was tied, Wang Wei-chen hit a single that brought in 2 runs, putting them ahead.</p>
            <p>Hsu Chi-hung of the Brothers hit a 2-run home run in the second part of the 7th inning. This was his 16th home run this season. They also added one more run in the second part of the 8th inning. In the first part of the 9th inning, Brothers pitcher Hsieh Jung-hao left the game with all bases loaded, forcing Wu Chun-wei to come in. Hsieh gave up a 2-run single to Chen Chen-wei and then threw a wild pitch that gave up another run. But in the end, the Brothers still won 8 to 6, giving the Monkeys their third loss in a row.</p>
            <p>After the game, Brothers head coach Hirano Keiichi said directly that in the 9th inning, because they were leading by 5 runs, he wanted to save closer Wu Chun-wei. But in the end, Wu still had to come in. "Jung-hao really needs to think about this. Especially as an experienced player, this kind of situation has happened more this year. If there were other players competing for his spot, we don't know if he would even be on the first team."</p>
            <p>Brothers starting pitcher Roarke (Nivaldo RodrÃ­guez) threw 98 pitches in this game over 6 innings. He gave up 5 hits, including Lin Cheng-fei's home run in the first inning. He also gave up 1 walk and got 4 strikeouts, allowing 3 runs. This was a good start, and he got his 9th win of the season. This was his first win in almost a month, and he was chosen as the MVP of the game.</p>
            <p>Hirano Keiichi said that Roarke had not gotten much help from the batters in several games. But today, the fielders successfully scored runs for Roarke. He especially mentioned that Yueh Tung-hua felt bad about making a mistake in Roarke's last start. "Today, Tung-hua helped the starting pitcher a lot both in hitting and fielding."</p>
            <p>When asked about Yueh Tung-hua, Roarke said, "He is a very good player. I take off my hat to him. Anything can happen in a game. Nobody wants to make a mistake. The most important thing is to keep moving forward. We are a team. If a teammate makes a mistake, we should support him and try to make up for it."</p>
