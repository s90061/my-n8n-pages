Jensen Huang, the CEO of US artificial intelligence chip company Nvidia, said in an interview with CNN that the US should "reduce its reliance on other countries" and move tech manufacturing back home. He believes this "re-industrialization" of manufacturing in the US can also ease pressure on Taiwan.

Huang mentioned that the US should invest in manufacturing because there's a "missing link" in their industry right now. He also added that having the passion, skills, and craftsmanship for manufacturing is very valuable for economic growth and a stable society, as people don't need a PhD to have a good life and career.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer. Huang stated that having a complete industry and manufacturing ecosystem not only makes the US stronger but also reduces their single reliance on other countries, which is a smart move.

**Hsieh Su-wei Loses Wimbledon Women's Doubles Final, Misses 10th Major Title**

Taiwanese tennis star Hsieh Su-wei and her partner Jelena Ostapenko from Latvia lost in the Wimbledon women's doubles final today. They fought for nearly two and a half hours against Elise Mertens and Veronika Kudermetova, but were defeated 6-3, 2-6, 4-6. Hsieh missed her chance to win her 10th major tournament trophy.

Hsieh, who is 39, has won 9 major doubles titles in Grand Slams, including women's and mixed doubles. She has won women's doubles titles with four different partners, earning her the nickname "Queen of Versatility."

In this year's Wimbledon, Hsieh and Ostapenko reached the finals again, after doing so at the Australian Open earlier this year, where they also finished as runners-up.

**US Defense Official Colby Calls for Focus on China, Highlights Difficulty of Three-Front War**

Elbridge Colby, the US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, has been trying to get the US military to focus its resources more on countering China. Experts say he has pointed out that the US cannot currently handle wars on three fronts at the same time.

Colby wrote a memo in early June to US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The memo explained that Ukraine's requests for US weapons might further reduce the Pentagon's already low supplies. Some government officials and members of Congress believe the memo played a role in the Pentagon's decision to temporarily stop sending weapons to Kyiv, although President Donald Trump later changed this decision.

Colby's supporters say this shows his effort to keep the US promise of strengthening its military in the Western Pacific. Colby has pushed allies to increase their military spending. He has also pressured Japan and Australia to say what military actions they would take if China attacked Taiwan, which surprised some officials because the US usually has a policy of "strategic ambiguity" on this issue.
