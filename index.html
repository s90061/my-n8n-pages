            <h1>Student shares story after 4 universities cancel admission</h1>
            <p>A high school student in Taichung had his university admissions cancelled by four universities because his learning portfolio was said to be fake. He was later accepted into the Medical Department of National Cheng Kung University through the Advanced Subject Test. Today, he shared his experience. He said that if he could do it again, he would make sure to write the award names correctly from the start, and then there would be no problems.</p>
            <p>This high school student shared on social media that he was accepted into Yang Ming Chiao Tung University's Medical Department through the application process. His learning portfolio mentioned that he had participated in the High School Elite Debate Competition and won the "Best Debater" honor. However, some internet users questioned this, saying that he was not the "Best Debater" in that year's Elite Competition, but only an "Excellent Debater" in one of the matches.</p>
            <p>He was originally accepted by National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei Medical University, China Medical University, and Chung Shan Medical University. Because of the incident where his learning portfolio was said to be fake, these four universities cancelled his admission one after another.</p>
            <p>Before the new school year started, this first-year university student was interviewed by a cram school today. In the live broadcast, he shared his journey. He said he never thought he would appear in the media this way. He received notices from the universities explaining that there were errors in the text of his application. He tried his best to explain clearly. When the first university cancelled his admission, he knew "it was over."</p>
            <p>After his admission through the application process was cancelled, he felt very bad and couldn't eat. Although he went back to school to study, he had no energy to read and lost 7 kilograms. Facing a lot of public criticism, he also wondered, "Am I a murderer?" But he admitted he did make a mistake. If he had written the award names correctly from the beginning, there would have been no problems.</p>
            <p>He said that after the General Scholastic Ability Test (GSAT), he stopped studying. With just over 30 days left, he still had 16 textbooks for the Advanced Subject Test that he hadn't read. He had thought about preparing to retake the test and believed he could improve his GSAT score from 70 to 75 in half a year. But his mother's words, "Is it so hard to do something you've already done again?", made him change his mindset and start preparing for the Advanced Subject Test.</p>
            <p>He also said that when he first shared his learning portfolio online, his only reason was that he couldn't find any senior students' materials to refer to when he was preparing his application. After being admitted to medical school, his application materials for one school received a very high score. Some people asked him for advice. He thought he could provide it for those who were preparing, so he made his preparation materials public online.</p>
            <p>He said that he prepared for the Advanced Subject Test and entrance exam in a short time. He finished reading the physics textbooks he hadn't read in 3 days. He did many past exam papers and different types of questions for each subject, and corrected his mistakes to understand them clearly. Finally, he got into a medical college.</p>
            <p>Why did he decide to try for the Advanced Subject Test only 35 days before it? He said that it was his graduation ceremony that day, and he also told his girlfriend he liked her. He believed that if he tried his best, he would definitely succeed, like an arrow hitting its target.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan Prosecutors investigate NCSIST project leak, technician held in custody</h1>
            <p>A technician named Lin from the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) is suspected of leaking information about a project. The project was called "Pengyuan Campus Smart Monitoring and Command System Network Electrical Infrastructure Project." On September 2, the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office arrested him. Today, the Taoyuan District Court decided to hold Mr. Lin in custody and not allow him to see anyone. This is because the court believes he might destroy evidence or talk to other people involved.</p>
            <p>Huang Kuo-chang, the leader of the Taiwan People's Party, said on September 2 that someone inside NCSIST was selling secret project documents to companies. NCSIST replied that their internal security system found unusual copying of documents. They reported the case to the Military Police Command on August 14, and the Military Police Command then reported it to the prosecutors for investigation. NCSIST said they will strongly protect their rights and make sure that anyone involved gets the strictest punishment to serve as a warning to others.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office announced today in a press release that on the afternoon of September 2, they received a request from the New Taipei Military Police Squad of the Military Police Command to investigate the case of leaked project information from the "Pengyuan Campus Smart Monitoring and Command System Network Electrical Infrastructure Project" of the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology. They immediately assigned Prosecutor Lai Ying-ying of the Anti-Corruption Division to handle the case.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office said that on the evening of the same day, they arrested the suspect, Mr. Lin, a technician from NCSIST's Institute of Information and Communications. After questioning, the prosecutor believed that Mr. Lin was involved in crimes such as leaking secrets not related to national defense by a non-government employee and attempted breach of trust. These are serious charges. The prosecutor thought he might talk to other people involved or witnesses, or destroy evidence. So, last night, they asked the Taoyuan District Court to hold him in custody and not allow him to see anyone.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Court said that after questioning, the suspect admitted to the crimes. There was also evidence mentioned in the application, which showed that the suspect was indeed strongly suspected of attempted breach of trust and leaking secrets not related to national defense by a non-government employee. Even though the suspect admitted to the crimes, he did not give consistent information about important details like the content, format, time, location, and payment for the information given to other people involved. This suggested he was trying to hide some facts.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Court pointed out that Mr. Lin's electronic devices have not yet been checked by digital experts, and other people involved have not yet been found. Therefore, it is possible that Mr. Lin might try to work with other people involved or destroy evidence to make the case unclear, and to reduce his punishment. Also, Mr. Lin deleted his Line chat messages with other people involved. This shows that he actively tried to destroy evidence and avoid being investigated by the police and prosecutors.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan District Court stated that there was enough reason to believe that the suspect might talk to other people involved and destroy evidence. This was a reason for keeping him in custody. Also, considering that the suspect's crime was not minor and looking at the progress of the investigation, the court decided that it was necessary to keep him in custody and not allow him to see or communicate with anyone.</p>

            <h1>Scholar: Russia-Ukraine war ending soon is good for Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Lin Zheng-yi, a researcher at the Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica, said at a meeting today that it would be good for Taiwan if the war between Russia and Ukraine ended soon. This is because the United States would then pay more attention to China. This would be different from after the September 11 attacks or the financial crisis, when China had a long time to develop without much attention.</p>
            <p>On September 4, the Institute for National Policy Research held a meeting at the Chang Yung-Fa Foundation. The meeting was about "Current International Situation Dynamics: From the Alaska Talks, the SCO Summit to the Strategic Implications of WWII Commemorations."</p>
            <p>Lin Zheng-yi said at the meeting that Beijing does not want Russia to lose the war in Ukraine. China is worried that if Russia loses, the United States will focus its attention on China. He added that if the Russia-Ukraine war ends earlier, it will be good for Taiwan. China will get more attention from the United States, unlike the long break it had after the September 11 attacks and the financial crisis.</p>
            <p>Lin Zheng-yi also said that the military cooperation between China and Russia is more than just a relationship between two countries. It includes joint actions that affect other countries. The relationship between the two countries is almost "unlimited." If something happens in the Taiwan Strait, Russia will not just watch. It might cause trouble in Europe, and NATO would get involved. This would stop European countries from helping the United States in the Indo-Pacific and the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>On August 15, US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska. They did not reach an agreement to end the Russia-Ukraine war.</p>
            <p>Former Representative to the US, Kao Suo-tai, said at the meeting that the Alaska talks were not seen as good, not blessed, and would not be remembered. He called it a quickly organized and rushed summit. International opinion also believed that a summit aiming to achieve a breakthrough in a war that had been going on for more than three years might only be a formality and useless.</p>
            <p>Kao Suo-tai believes that the Alaska talks showed the clear truth of international politics. He thought that many European countries would immediately remember the dark history of the 1938 Munich Agreement and the 1945 Yalta Agreement. These events showed how the independence and territory of weaker countries were decided by powerful nations in secret meetings.</p>
            <p>Kao Suo-tai mentioned that the Alaska talks showed Trump's style: he wanted quick results, loved grand events, and made decisions on the spot. Trump strongly believed in leader-to-leader diplomacy and special envoys made of his close advisors. He often made policies based on his feelings, which brought big risks and unpredictability. However, we must admit that this is the new normal and new way for the White House to handle important issues.</p>
            <p>Wu Chun-chih, Director of the DPP's China Affairs Department, said that Chinese President Xi Jinping, in his speech before the September 3 military parade, talked about "speeding up the building of a world-class military and strongly protecting national sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity." This showed China's desire for Taiwan's land. By promoting a "strong military dream," China was clearly challenging the United States.</p>
