            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs Helps Households Install Rooftop Solar Power; 21 Cities and Counties Join</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs is working with local governments to help households install solar power on their rooftops faster. The Ministry said that 21 cities and counties in Taiwan have joined this plan. They have approved about NT$1.3 billion for the years 2025 to 2026. Currently, 11 cities and counties, including Taipei City, Taoyuan City, Hsinchu County, Miaoli County, and Taichung City, have started accepting applications. People can apply now.</p>
            <p>To meet the country's need for cleaner energy and make the power system stronger and more independent, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and local governments are working together. They want to make it easier to get financial help and simplify the application process. This will help renewable energy grow in many places, making the power system more stable.</p>
            <p>Today, the Energy Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced in a press release that 21 cities and counties across Taiwan have joined this plan. This includes areas in the north, central, south, east, and on offshore islands. They have already approved about NT$1.3 billion for this year and next year. This shows that local governments strongly support and actively participate in the energy change plan. Each city and county is finishing its budget, rules, and application websites step by step.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration explained that as of September 1st, 11 cities and counties have officially started accepting applications. People can apply for rooftop solar power now. Installing solar panels on rooftops not only helps keep homes cool but also effectively lowers the temperature on the top floor and reduces household electricity bills.</p>
            <p>The Energy Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs also said that other cities and counties are preparing their budgets and getting ready to accept applications. This shows that local governments generally support and want to be part of the energy change plan. Besides the money from the central government, 10 cities and counties also offer their own extra help. Among these, Kaohsiung City, Taipei City, and Changhua County each added an extra NT$10 million for equipment.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will continue to work closely with local governments. They will make it more attractive to apply and easier to do so. This financial help can be for systems that got their official registration after January 1st this year. People who want to join should apply soon.</p>

            <h1>Former Head of China's Stock Market Regulators is Investigated</h1>
            <p>On September 6, China's anti-corruption agency announced that Yi Huiman, who was the vice chairman of the Economic Committee of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is now being investigated. He is accused of serious rule-breaking and illegal actions. Yi Huiman was the head of China's stock market regulator for about five years. During his time, many new companies joined the stock market. However, the Chinese stock market did not do well.</p>
            <p>News reports from financial media say that Yi Huiman became the head of China's stock market regulator on January 26, 2019, and left the job on February 7, 2024. In his five years, about 1700 more companies were listed on the A-share market. The Shanghai Composite Index only went up about 190 points, from 2597.78 to 2788.55. During this time, it fell below 3000 points about 20 times. Because the A-share market stayed around 3000 points for a long time, many people in the market were unhappy.</p>
            <p>While Yi Huiman was in charge, China's stock market made several big changes. On July 22, 2019, the STAR Market opened. On November 15, 2021, the Beijing Stock Exchange opened. On February 17, 2023, the A-share market started a new system where companies can list more easily. This caused a large increase in listed companies. From 2019 to 2023, the total money raised from new company listings was over 2 trillion Chinese Yuan (about 8.5 trillion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Reuters reported on September 5 that Yi Huiman's new system for listing stocks also caused problems in the market. He was criticized for allowing companies to raise money through new listings even if they were not strong, which hurt the stock market. Many bad companies were allowed to list their shares.</p>
            <p>On February 7, 2024, Yi Huiman was removed from his position. Wu Qing, a former vice mayor of Shanghai, took over. The Chinese government did not say why Yi Huiman was removed.</p>
            <p>After Wu Qing became the head of China's stock market regulator, he made rules stricter. He made it harder for bad companies to stay listed and made new listing rules tighter. Because of this, the money raised from new company listings in China dropped by 64% in the first quarter of last year. The number of new listings also fell by more than half.</p>
            <p>Financial media also reported that in recent years, many people in the stock market system have been investigated for corruption. These include Wang Jianjun, a former vice chairman of the regulator, Wang Huimin, a former head of the anti-corruption group at the regulator, Yao Qian, a former head of the technology department, Li Xiaoqiang, a former deputy head of the issuing department, and Wu Guofang, a former deputy head of the legal department.</p>
            <p>Public information shows that Yi Huiman is 61 years old and from Cangnan, Wenzhou, Zhejiang. He finished Zhejiang Finance and Banking School in 1984. This school was a special technical school under the People's Bank of China at that time. In January 1985, Yi Huiman started working at the Hangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. He worked at this bank for 34 years, moving up from basic roles. In May 2013, he became the president of the bank.</p>

            <h1>Woman in Kaohsiung Crashes Car into Store, Two People Hurt and Four Motorcycles Damaged</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, a woman in Kaohsiung, whose last name is Hong, was driving to a PX Mart store in Fengshan. While trying to park, her car suddenly sped forward. It hit two other women, Ms. Huang and Ms. Wang, and then crashed into the store's metal racks. Four motorcycles were also damaged. Ms. Huang and Ms. Wang were taken to the hospital but were not badly hurt. Ms. Hong was tested for alcohol, and the result was zero. The police are still finding out exactly why the accident happened.</p>
            <p>A video shared on social media shows an SUV crashing into a PX Mart store in Fengshan. Luckily, the car did not go inside the store. The Fengshan Police Department in Kaohsiung City said this morning that Ms. Hong, 65 years old, was driving her SUV to the PX Mart on Haiyang 1st Road around 3 PM yesterday. When she tried to park, her car suddenly moved quickly. It hit Ms. Huang, 77, and Ms. Wang, 52, who had just finished shopping and were walking out of the store. They had cuts and bruises on their legs. Both women were awake and were taken to the hospital for help.</p>
            <p>After hitting the two women, Ms. Hong's car also hit four motorcycles and some metal racks belonging to the store. Luckily, the car stopped just before hitting the store's glass entrance, so it did not go inside and cause more damage. Police came to the scene and tested Ms. Hong for alcohol. Her alcohol test was zero. The police are still working to understand the full reason for the accident.</p>
