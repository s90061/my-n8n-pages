            <h1>Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu Win Bronze in Mixed Team Trap Shooting at Asian Championships</h1>
            <p>At the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan, Taiwanese athletes Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu won a bronze medal today. They played in the mixed team trap shooting bronze medal match and beat Qatar 43 to 37. This is the first medal for Taiwan's shooting team at these championships.</p>
            <p>Yang Kun-pi, a skilled shooter who has been to the Olympics three times for Taiwan, competed today with his partner Liu Wan-yu in the mixed team trap shooting event at the Asian Championships. They both did well in the three rounds of qualification. Yang Kun-pi shot 24, 25, and 24 points, missing only two clay targets. He scored the highest in the whole event with 73 points. Liu Wan-yu also got better as the competition went on, scoring 20, 21, and 24 points. Together, they scored 138 points, which put them in 4th place and allowed them to move to the next stage.</p>
            <p>They missed the chance to compete for the gold medal by just 2 points. However, in the bronze medal match against Qatar, Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu showed great skill. In the third round, they both hit all 10 targets perfectly. This gave them a 6-point lead and set them up for the win. Their opponents could not catch up, and Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu won the match 43 to 37. This win also brought the first medal for Taiwan's shooting team at this Asian Championship.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that Yang Kun-pi and Liu Wan-yu have been competing together in international events for many years. After winning a silver medal together at the 2019 Universiade in Naples, they later won other mixed team events, like the Shooting World Cup and the Asian Clay Target Cup. Now, they have won a bronze medal together at the Asian Shooting Championships. As they continue to gain more international experience, they have a good chance to win medals at the 2026 Asian Games in Nagoya.</p>
