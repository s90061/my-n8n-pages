            <h1>Car Falls 100 Meters in Nantou, All 4 People Rescued and Awake</h1>
            <p>Today, a car was driving on Provincial Highway 21, near the 123-kilometer mark, going down a mountain. The driver might have made a mistake, and the car fell about 100 meters into a valley. The Nantou County Fire Bureau received a report. They sent 10 vehicles, 17 firefighters, and 15 volunteer firefighters. All four people in the car were rescued. They were awake and were sent to the hospital.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, the Nantou County Fire Bureau got a call from the police.

            <h1>Taiwan Wins 8th Title at Asia Youth Baseball Tournament, Beats Japan Again</h1>
            <p>Today, in the final game of the Asia Youth Baseball Tournament, Taiwan played against Japan again. It was a game where pitchers did very well. Ko Shao-Chieh pitched confidently and threw a complete game shutout for 7 innings. Chen Po-Yu hit a very important triple in the 6th inning to break the tie. This helped the team win 3-0. They won for the second time in a row and got their 8th title ever.</p>
            <p>The final game of the Asia Youth Baseball Tournament was held at the Tainan Asia-Pacific International Baseball Training Center. More than 5,100 people came to watch. Taiwan beat Japan in the last game of the preliminary round yesterday. Today, they met again in the final game and kept their strong performance.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's starting pitcher today was Ko Shao-Chieh. In the first inning, he walked a batter, then gave up a hit, and then walked another batter. This meant Japan had runners on all bases. But he calmed down in time during this difficult situation. He made Japanese batters hit a foul fly ball to third base and a fly ball to right field, which were outs. Then he struck out another batter for the third out, keeping Japan from scoring.</p>
            <p>After getting through the first-inning trouble, Ko Shao-Chieh pitched better and better. In the 2nd and 3rd innings, he quickly got three outs for Japan. In the bottom of the 4th inning, after one out, he walked a batter. Then, because of a small mistake by his teammates in defense, Japan got an infield hit and had a runner in scoring position. But Ko Shao-Chieh was not too worried. He made a batter hit a ground ball for an out and kept Japan from scoring.</p>
            <p>Neither team scored in the first five innings. Taiwan broke the tie in the top of the 6th inning. After two outs, Chen Rui-Xin got a hit first. Then Hu Guan-Wei walked to first base. Chen Po-Yu then hit a triple, which brought in two runs at once.</p>
            <p>Taiwan started to attack again in the top of the 7th inning. Huang Zi-Qi got a hit, then moved forward with a sacrifice bunt. Zeng Yi-Zhe hit an infield single to move the runners. Jiang Jin-Cheng then got another hit, adding one more important run for the team.</p>
            <p>Ko Shao-Chieh pitched all 7 innings. He only allowed 4 hits. He got 4 strikeouts and walked 3 batters, letting no runs score. He pitched a great shutout game and stopped Japan's batters. He was a big reason why the team won the championship.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's team has always done well in the history of the Asia Youth Baseball Tournament. This year, they won for the second time in a row and got their 8th title. The top two teams in the Asia Youth Baseball Tournament get to play in next year's U15 Baseball World Cup.</p>

            <h1>Spain Wildfires: 4 People Dead, 350,000 Hectares Burned</h1>
            <p>Today, the head of Spain's civil protection and emergency services, Virginia Barcones, said that the wildfires across the country this month are almost under control. These fires spread across a large area and caused 4 deaths.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, Barcones told Spanish national TV (TVE) that "fewer wildfires are still burning, and the end is much closer."</p>
            <p>However, she also said that the fires that are still burning are "unpredictable." She added, "We still need to make a final strong effort to end this terrible situation."</p>
            <p>The European Forest Fire Information System says that 350,000 hectares of land in Spain have been burned in the last two weeks. Spanish firefighters have been working for weeks to put out the fires, with help from other European Union countries.</p>
            <p>The northern and western parts of Spain were hit the hardest. These areas include Castile and Leon, Extremadura, and Galicia. The wildfires started during a two-week period of very hot weather. During that time, temperatures across the country went above 40 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>This fire emergency shows not only the problem of climate change but also a trend that makes rural areas in Spain more likely to suffer from fires.</p>
            <p>The area of Castile and Leon has long had problems with people moving away, older populations, and less farming and animal grazing. These activities used to help clear away things that could easily burn in the forests, but now they happen much less.</p>
