<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/south-korea-may-delay-us-113126134.html">News Link</a>

South Korea is preparing to confront U.S. officials over potential restrictions on chipmakers operating in China. This comes as Washington is planning a third round of waivers for chipmakers, including Samsung and SK Hynix, allowing them to bring in American chipmaking equipment for their China operations.

The South Korean government is expected to address these concerns during its next economic talks with the U.S. this year. The country is seeking a permanent exemption from the restrictions. The initial waivers were granted in October 2022 to prevent immediate disruptions to global supply chains.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has recently indicated that it will grant another round of waivers. However, the South Korean government views these waivers as temporary and insufficient, as they only extend the existing exemptions by one year.

This issue is crucial for South Korea as its chipmakers have significant investments in China. Samsung operates a large NAND flash memory factory in Xi'an, and SK Hynix has a DRAM factory in Wuxi, which contributes a significant portion of its total DRAM production.

The potential restrictions are part of the U.S. strategy to limit China's access to advanced semiconductor technology, aiming to slow down its technological and military advancements. However, this policy creates challenges for international companies that have established operations in China.

South Korea's push for a permanent waiver reflects its concerns about the long-term impact on its domestic industries and global competitiveness. The outcome of these discussions will significantly influence the future strategies of South Korean chipmakers and the broader semiconductor supply chain.

**Taiwan's China Airlines postpones retirement of older planes due to Boeing 787 delays**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/taiwans-china-airlines-postpones-retirement-051339368.html">News Link</a>

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan's China Airlines is postponing the retirement of some of its older aircraft due to delays in receiving Boeing 787-9 jets. These delays may lead to compensation from the U.S. planemaker, according to the airline's president.

The airline, also known as CAL, ordered 24 of the 787-9 widebody aircraft in 2022, with deliveries expected to begin in 2025. However, there have been some changes to the delivery schedule.

China Airlines President Kao Shing-hwang told reporters that there have been slight adjustments in the delivery dates of the first few planes. He added that the airline will continue to communicate with Boeing regarding compensation, though he did not specify the amount.

Kao explained that China Airlines planned to retire some of its existing fleet as the new 787s arrived. Due to the delays, some of these older planes, including two A330s and a 747 freighter, will remain in service for a longer period. He noted that the decision was made after careful evaluation of the situation.

The airline currently operates a fleet of Boeing 747s, 777s, and Airbus A330s and A350s for its passenger and cargo services.

Boeing has faced various production issues and delivery delays across its commercial aircraft programs, impacting several airlines globally. These issues have prompted airlines to adjust their fleet plans and seek remedies from the manufacturer.

**Nvidia Secures Entire Wistron Plant Through 2026 to Build AI Servers**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-secures-entire-wistron-plant-185445590.html">News Link</a>

Nvidia (NVDA) has reportedly secured the entire production capacity at Wistron's newly launched Taiwan server facility through 2026. This move aims to meet the surging demand for AI servers, according to a report by Economic Daily News.

The Wistron facility, which began operations in June, is expected to produce over 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter. This exclusive agreement with Nvidia highlights the intense competition for AI server production capabilities.

Nvidia, a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) essential for AI workloads, has seen its market value increase significantly due to the boom in artificial intelligence. Its data center segment, which includes AI chips and related infrastructure, has become a major revenue driver.

This strategic partnership with Wistron, a major Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, ensures a stable supply of high-performance AI servers for Nvidia. It also reflects the growing importance of Taiwan in the global AI supply chain, as it is home to many key hardware manufacturers.

The rapid growth in AI technology has created immense demand for specialized hardware, leading to a scramble among tech giants to secure production resources. Nvidia's proactive approach in securing Wistron's plant capacity demonstrates its commitment to maintaining its leadership position in the AI market.

This agreement could have significant implications for other companies looking to build AI infrastructure, as production capacity for advanced AI servers becomes increasingly limited. It also underscores the crucial role of manufacturing partners like Wistron in enabling the expansion of AI capabilities worldwide.
