            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai Hopes to Explain Cash Handout at Legislature; KMT Asks DPP Not to Block Session Extension</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai said that giving everyone NT$10,000 cash, which means borrowing money, was a difficult decision for him. He hopes to explain it at the Legislative Yuan. Luo Chih-chiang, a leader from the KMT party, said today that if Premier Cho has ideas, they can talk about them during the extended session of the Legislative Yuan. He asked the DPP party not to stop the session from being extended.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao, a leader from the DPP party in the Legislative Yuan, said today that Premier Cho wants to clearly tell everyone, and the parliament, the exact numbers. This is because he cannot let opposition lawmakers keep using wrong information to confuse people. She asked the KMT and other parties not to spread false information. To give out cash, the government needs to borrow NT$101.4 billion.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that Premier Cho is very willing to go to the Legislative Yuan to explain things to lawmakers from all parties. If there is a chance for this, it depends on whether the opposition parties agree. It is also possible that the opposition parties do not want Premier Cho to report to the parliament. So, they will keep watching what the opposition parties decide.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan held a meeting today. Luo Chih-chiang, a leader from the KMT party, spoke after their party meeting. He said that today's meeting was mainly about extending the session and a proposal to change some laws. These changes would make punishments for child abuse stronger.</p>
            <p>Luo Chih-chiang pointed out that the Legislative Yuan recently passed a special law. This law is called the "Special Act for Strengthening Economic, Social, and Livelihood National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations." Next, they are waiting for the Executive Yuan to send out a special budget plan. The KMT party also heard that Premier Cho Jung-tai has talked about giving tax money back to the people, which is part of this special law. The KMT party believes that if Premier Cho has any ideas, they can discuss them during the extended session. They also ask the DPP party not to stop the Legislative Yuan from extending its session.</p>
            <p>Luo Chih-chiang said that for the proposed change to the criminal law about making punishments for child abuse stronger, the KMT and Taiwan People's Party will work together. They will suggest a version that could make child abuse punishable by death in the most serious cases.</p>
            <p>The media asked about the KMT party's position on the Legislative Yuan approving new grand judges on July 25. Luo Chih-chiang said that the party has not yet decided on a clear position. They are allowing party members to keep talking about it. The KMT party will hold a meeting before the vote on July 25 to decide their final position.</p>
            <p>The media asked about Premier Cho Jung-tai saying it was a very hard decision for him to give out NT$10,000 cash by borrowing money. Luo Chih-chiang said that he does not see Premier Cho struggling with this decision. He thinks Premier Cho is out of touch and does not understand the difficulties people face. He said the government collected too much tax money. Now, they should give this extra money back to people when they are having financial problems. Luo thinks that if Premier Cho is still struggling with this, it means he is simply too far removed from ordinary people's lives.</p>

            <h1>Hong Kong's Unemployment Rate Stays at 3.5%</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Chang Chien, Hong Kong, July 18) Official numbers show that from April to June this year, the number of people without jobs in Hong Kong stayed at 3.5%. This is the same as it was from March to May.</p>
            <p>Hong Kong's statistics office recently announced that the number of people without jobs in different industries did not change much. Fewer people were jobless in arts, entertainment, recreation, and professional and business services. However, more people were jobless in construction and food services.</p>
            <p>The total number of employed people in Hong Kong is now 3,657,300. The total number of people who can work is 3,793,500.</p>
            <p>The Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Chris Sun, said that how the unemployment rate changes in the future depends on how well the whole economy does. But Hong Kong's economy is still growing, and this should help the job market.</p>

            <h1>CPBL All-Star Game on July 19-20: First 20,000 Fans Get Good Local Bananas</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Wang Shu-fen, Taipei, July 18) The Ministry of Agriculture's Agriculture and Food Agency announced today that they are working with the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL). For the CPBL All-Star Game on July 19 and 20 at the Taipei Dome, the first 20,000 fans who enter each day will receive good quality fresh bananas grown in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture and Food Agency said they want more people to know about good quality bananas grown in Taiwan and different products made from them. The CPBL All-Star Game happens during summer, which is when many local bananas are ready. So, besides giving bananas to fans, they also prepare 200 bananas each day for the players. This way, both fans and players can easily get nutrients during the game period.</p>
            <p>Also, on July 19, cheerleaders will help promote local bananas and play games with fans at the stadium. On July 20, before the game, there will be a fun hitting contest called "All-Around Hitting King." This contest will use local summer fruits to teach fans about good quality local fruits. The Agriculture and Food Agency has also prepared fresh bananas and banana products for fans to enjoy.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture and Food Agency stated that Taiwan has improved its banana types and growing methods. This means delicious, good quality bananas can be grown all year. Bananas have carbohydrates, protein, fiber, and vitamins. They also have potassium, which is an important mineral for the body. Getting enough potassium helps your nerves and muscles work well. They suggest that people who love sports eat good local bananas to get a lot of nutrients.</p>
