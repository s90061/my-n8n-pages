            <h1>Huang Pi-hsun Elected as TLPGA Chairperson, Hopes More Young People Join</h1>
            <p>TLPGA, the Taiwan Ladies Professional Golf Association, held its election for chairperson on September 1st this year. Huang Pi-hsun, a famous player from the 1980s who played in Japan, was elected. "Pretty Baby" Yeh Hsin-ning was chosen as the vice chairperson. Huang Pi-hsun said today that the association will be more open and clear in the future. Also, more young board members will be part of its work.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Ladies Professional Golf Association (TLPGA) held its chairperson election on September 1st this year. Huang Pi-hsun, who is 68 years old, was elected. She will officially start her role in January next year. Yeh Hsin-ning, 37, became the youngest vice chairperson in the association's history.</p>
            <p>Huang Pi-hsun is from Fengyuan, Taichung. She became a professional player in 1980. It took her 4 years to join the Japan Ladies Professional Golf Tour. In five seasons from 1985 to 1989, she won 9 championships. This made her famous in Japan.</p>
            <p>Huang Pi-hsun spoke to the media today during a Mid-Autumn Festival event. She said that she still needs to learn many things about the association. However, she will continue the good things done by the previous chairperson. For areas that need change, she will listen to different ideas after understanding everything fully.</p>
            <p>Huang Pi-hsun smiled and said, "I often play with young golfers. So, I hope more young board members or members can join the association's work to help TLPGA do even better."</p>
            <p>Regarding the future plans for the Taiwan Ladies Tour, Huang Pi-hsun shared that she will first see what sponsors want. Then, she will decide whether to make cooperation with other countries' tours bigger. But she will definitely work hard to make Taiwan's own tour events stronger.</p>
            <p>Yeh Hsin-ning mentioned that she hopes the association's events and competitions will become more youthful and energetic. She felt that when she played in the past, a competition would end and leave no special memories. "In the future, I hope every competition can have special moments. This way, more companies and sponsors will want to get involved."</p>

            <h1>French Prime Minister Lecornu Resigns Less Than One Month After Taking Office, Worsening Political Problems in the Country</h1>
            <p>PARIS (Central News Agency, Reuters) â€” The French President's office stated today that President Emmanuel Macron has accepted Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's resignation. This makes the political difficulties in France even worse.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that President Macron had only appointed Lecornu as Prime Minister last month. However, the new list of government ministers that Lecornu announced last night had almost no big changes. This caused strong criticism from both left-wing and right-wing politicians.</p>
            <p>Lecornu, who is 39 years old, only started his job as Prime Minister on September 9th. He is the seventh Prime Minister during President Macron's time in office.</p>
