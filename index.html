        const text = `**Travelers Bewareâ€¦ China Bans Power Banks Without '3C Mark' on Flights; Non-compliant Products Will Be Held**

The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has banned passengers from carrying power banks without a 3C mark on flights, starting today. Media reports and passenger experiences show that reminders and security checks vary among airports. Some airports check at least twice, while others provide multiple reminders before the official check.

This year, there have been several incidents where power banks and other lithium battery products caught fire or smoked on planes in China. On June 26, the CAAC issued an urgent notice. As of June 28, passengers are not allowed to bring power banks without a clear 3C mark, or those that have been recalled, on domestic flights within China.

A reporter from "Hong Kong01" visited Lanzhou Zhongchuan Airport in Gansu on June 27. They found that almost every power bank was checked separately. A staff member there said that from June 28, Chinese-made power banks without a 3C mark cannot be used on domestic flights. However, they are allowed on international flights (including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan). Also, if a power bank is made and bought overseas, it can be taken on both domestic and international flights in China.

"The Beijing News" reported on June 28 that Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport's Terminal 2 has put up "New Power Bank Rules" signs in visible places, such as at the terminal entrance security check, check-in areas, and security checkpoints. These signs clearly tell passengers which power banks are not allowed on planes.

At the terminal entrance security check, there is a "Power Bank Discard Bin." This is for passengers to check if their power bank meets the new rules. If not, they can choose to leave it, or have family take it, or send it by mail to avoid being turned back after entering the security area.

Staff at the airport said that by 8 AM on June 28, they had already collected three large bins full of power banks that passengers chose to leave behind.

Hubei's "Yangtze Cloud News" interviewed Ms. Deng, who was checking in at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport this morning. She said that after checking her luggage, passengers first go through a special security check for power banks before entering the regular security area for boarding. All power banks in bags are checked. Those without a 3C mark are kept, and those that pass the check get a sticker showing they've been checked.

Another Chinese internet user shared their experience flying from Beijing Capital Airport T3 today. They said that as soon as they arrived at the check-in counter, they saw new signs. On the way to security, staff held up signs to remind people. When putting items on the tray for security, staff would check, and after passing the security machine, someone else would check again. In total, there were five reminders.
