            <h1>US Puts 35% Tax on Canadian Goods, Blames Canada for Not Stopping Fentanyl Smuggling</h1>
            <p>WASHINGTON/TORONTO (CNA) â€“ The White House said that President Trump today signed an order. This order will raise taxes on all Canadian goods sent to the US that are not part of the "US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement." The tax will go from 25% to 35%. One reason for this is that the US believes Canada has not stopped fentanyl smuggling.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that according to information from the White House, goods sent to other countries to avoid the new tax will also get an extra 40% tax.</p>
            <p>This is the newest action in a long trade dispute started by President Trump when he took office. Part of Washington's reason is that Canada has not effectively stopped fentanyl from being smuggled.</p>
            <p>The White House said Canada "continues to do nothing and is fighting back." President Trump believes the higher taxes are necessary. Before this, Trump said that Canadian Prime Minister Carney tried to reach out before the tax deadline on August 1st, but they did not talk in the end.</p>
            <p>Trump had said earlier that if countries did not make a deal with the US by August 1st, their goods would face higher taxes. Mr. Carney's office did not reply immediately when asked for a comment.</p>
            <p>Officials in Ottawa have often said that very little fentanyl coming into the US is from Canada. They also said that Canada has taken steps to control its borders more tightly.</p>
            <p>Trump said that even though he likes Canada, Canada has been "very bad" to the US for many years.</p>
            <p>Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, said that if Mr. Carney "starts to be friendly and stops fighting back," President Trump might think again about the taxes.</p>
            <p>About 75% of all Canadian goods sent to other countries go to its southern border. This means Canada is easily affected by US trade actions.</p>
            <p>This new tax, raised to 35%, will affect steel, aluminum, cars, and products that do not follow the rules of the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA).</p>
            <p>Economists say that even with the pressure from these taxes, Canada's economy is surprisingly strong. They expect it will likely avoid a slowdown in economic activity. (Translated by Li Pei-shan / Reviewed by Chang Hsiao-wen) 2025/08/01</p>

            <h1>Tropical Depression Forms, Weather Agency Thinks It Will Become a Typhoon in 24 Hours</h1>
            <p>TAIPEI (CNA) â€“ The weather agency said that the 13th tropical depression of this year formed this morning. It might become the 10th typhoon, named Bailu, within the next 24 hours. It is expected to move towards the southeast sea of Japan. It will not directly affect Taiwan, but it will make the southwest winds stronger. This will cause more rain in central and southern Taiwan tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi, a forecaster at the Central Weather Agency, told CNA that the 13th tropical depression formed this morning. It is about 1200 kilometers east of Taipei. It is expected to follow the path of Tropical Storm Krovanh and move towards the southeast sea of Japan.</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi said that the new tropical depression might become this year's 10th typhoon, Bailu, within 24 hours. It will not directly affect Taiwan. However, it will indirectly make the southwest winds stronger. This means there will be another round of heavy rain tomorrow, and the rain in central and southern Taiwan will become heavier.
