        const text = `**Lai Ching-te's Three Degrees of Kinship Clause Criticized as "Stupid"; DPP National Congress Plans to Postpone Proposal**

Today is the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) National Congress. It was initially expected that under the steadfast will of Party Chairman Lai Ching-te, a proposal related to the "three degrees of kinship clause" would be put forward to amend the party charter, prohibiting family members of DPP public representatives from serving as publicly funded assistants. However, due to strong opposition within the party, the DPP Central Party Headquarters did not propose this motion today, effectively postponing its implementation indefinitely.

In February of this year, several public representatives were investigated for alleged embezzlement of assistant fees. President Lai Ching-te, also serving as DPP Chairman, issued an order at a Central Standing Committee meeting, demanding that DPP public officials adhere to the highest standards. He stated that assistants for public representatives should follow the "Civil Servant Employment Act," prohibiting the employment of spouses and relatives within three degrees of kinship by blood or marriage. Family members could serve as volunteers but should not be publicly funded assistants. This statement by Lai immediately sparked backlash within the party.

Taipei City Councilor Jian Shu-pei was reportedly heard privately criticizing the system as extremely foolish. Many Green camp councilors also admitted that the party central command issued the order without prior communication, catching public representatives across northern, central, and southern Taiwan off guard. They questioned who would assist them after hours, especially since councilor assistants are on call 24 hours a day.

According to Article 26 of the Civil Servant Employment Act, superiors in government agencies may not employ their spouses or relatives within three degrees of kinship by blood or marriage within their own agency, or appoint them as superiors in directly subordinate agencies. Spouses and relatives within three degrees of kinship by blood or marriage of departmental heads in the agency should be avoided from employment within their department.

Party insiders stated that after Lai Ching-te ordered the study of amending internal regulations in February, Party Secretary-General Lin Yu-chang also indicated that he would follow Lai Ching-te's instructions to research whether to amend the party charter to include explicit regulations. According to DPP rules, any amendment to the party charter must be proposed to the National Congress and passed by national party representatives to become effective.

While Lin Yu-chang was still in the research phase, many within the DPP had already criticized the party headquarters. New Taipei City Councilor Lin Ping-yu believed the logic was too far-fetched and that such a "ridiculous idea" was being planned for inclusion in the party charter, questioning if someone found governing too easy and wanted to increase the difficulty. Taipei City Councilor Jian Shu-pei was also reported to have criticized the policy as "super stupid."

Party insiders pointed out that public criticism was just the tip of the iceberg; many Green camp public representatives had petitioned the party central committee, stating that implementing this amendment would surely cause problems and must be avoided. The most common viewpoint was that the focus should remain on how to resolve and reduce the risk of assistant fee fraud, rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater. They noted that political aides and assistants cannot work standard nine-to-five hours like ordinary jobs, often relying on family members with high levels of understanding, which is common in local areas. In fact, with family assistance, politicians usually operate more smoothly.

Party insiders said that, based on the consolidated party opinion, the party central committee has decided not to propose the motion at today's National Congress. As long as no party representative suddenly proposes it during the impromptu proposal session, this issue will essentially be postponed indefinitely.

**Iran Resumes Negotiations with China to Purchase J-10C; Russian Expert Believes Iran's Fighter Jet Shortfall Reaches 400**

Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily reported that after the 12-day conflict between Iran and Israel, Iran has resumed negotiations with China to purchase J-10C fighter jets. According to Iranian and Russian financial media reports on Thursday (June 26), this 4++ generation medium multi-role fighter, developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, is expected to address the long-standing combat capability shortcomings of the Iranian Air Force.

The report stated that although negotiations between Iran and China have failed multiple times over the past nearly 20 years, Iran appears eager to strengthen its air force fleet after its air defense capabilities were compromised during the 12-day conflict with Israel. The demand is estimated to be as high as 400 aircraft. Currently, Russia's production capacity is constrained by its domestic needs for the war in Ukraine, and Russian think tanks acknowledge that Chinese fighter jets have become the best solution.

Sing Tao Daily cited Russia's Kommersant newspaper, reporting that as early as 2015, Iran and China were close to signing a contract for up to 150 J-10C fighter jets, but the deal fell through due to disagreements over payment methods. China at the time did not accept oil or natural gas as payment, while Iran was constrained by foreign exchange shortages and UN sanctions, making a deal difficult. After the arms embargo was lifted in 2020, negotiations briefly resumed but ultimately stalled for the same reasons.

In early May, an aerial conflict erupted between Pakistan and India, where Pakistan, using Chinese J-10CE fighter jets equipped with PL-15 air-to-air missiles, shot down five Indian military aircraft near the border, including three French-made Rafale jets, drawing global attention.

The report stated that the J-10CE is a single-engine multi-role fighter developed and produced by China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, with the "E" designation for the export version. It is considered an economical alternative to the F-16V and the Swedish JAS-39 Gripen E, with a unit price ranging from 40 to 50 million US dollars (approximately 310 to 390 million Hong Kong dollars), depending on configuration and training package. In contrast, Russian Su-35 and MiG-35 aircraft are more expensive, and their production capacity and delivery issues are more challenging.

The report quoted data from the British IISS think tank's "The Military Balance 2025," which indicated that before the war, Iran had approximately 150 usable fighter jets, mostly old US-made models from the 1970s, such as F-4, F-5, and F-14. Their maintenance relies on self-produced parts, making operations difficult. Other aircraft, such as the MiG-29s acquired in the late 1980s, are also in poor condition due to a lack of spare parts.

Iran had planned to expand its military through a Su-35 procurement deal signed in 2023, ordering 50 aircraft, but has only received 4 so far. As most of Russia's production capacity is dedicated to the war in Ukraine, it is difficult to fulfill the contract in the short term, forcing Iran to seek alternatives.

The report stated that the Israeli airstrike on June 13 highlighted the weakness of Iran's air defense system. Furthermore, the US's agreement on June 24 allowing China to legally purchase Iranian oil offers Iran the possibility of trading oil with China as a form of payment, potentially accelerating the J-10C procurement process.

Ilya Kramnik, a strategic researcher at the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, pointed out that even if Iran successfully receives the Su-35s, it would still need a large fleet to support its comprehensive air defense capabilities, estimating a demand of 400 aircraft. The lower-cost and stable supply of the J-10C is currently the only viable option. He also mentioned that while the Russian MiG-35 is a potential alternative, this type of aircraft has not yet entered mass production, making it difficult to serve as a main supplementary aircraft.

Brigadier General Hamid Vahedi, Commander of the Iranian Air Force, met with senior Chinese Air Force officials and inspected the J-10CE during the 2024 China Airshow. The J-10CE's performance is comparable to or even surpasses that of an upgraded F-16. Its operational successes in Egypt and Pakistan further demonstrate its performance, reliability, and readiness. In addition to filling gaps in Iran's air capabilities, Iran's purchase of the J-10CE also signals its shift towards Chinese military equipment and strengthened economic and security ties with Beijing.

However, the article also noted that disagreements related to payment have stalled negotiations for the purchase of approximately 36 J-10CEs. Tehran proposed oil-for-goods trade, but Beijing sought cash payment.

The article pointed out that Iran has also expressed interest in the JF-17 Block III, a joint Sino-Pakistani developed fighter that integrates fifth-generation fighter technology but is less expensive than the J-10CE. However, the article stated that the J-10CE better meets Iran's operational needs. If Iran wishes to reduce its reliance on a single supplier, it is a modern multi-role fighter that can integrate well with future purchases of larger Russian aircraft.

**Iranian Ambassador to China: Supports Xi Jinping's Four-Point Proposal, Iran Willing to Promote Implementation of Comprehensive Cooperation Plan with China**

According to Xinhua News Agency, Iranian Ambassador to China Fazli stated in Beijing on June 27 that Iran and China have maintained close communication recently. Iran supports President Xi Jinping's four-point proposal on the current situation in the Middle East and thanks China for condemning the attacks by Israel and the United States against Iran in multilateral forums such as the UN Security Council. He also stated that Iran is willing to work with China to promote the implementation of the comprehensive China-Iran cooperation plan.

The comprehensive China-Iran cooperation plan involves a US$400 billion investment cooperation plan. According to the agreement signed in Tehran in 2021, China's investment in Iran will reach US$400 billion over 25 years. In addition to establishing free trade zones, China and Iran will cooperate on dozens of projects in areas such as banking, telecommunications, ports, railways, and global navigation systems. However, the actual implementation progress after signing has been minimal.

At a media briefing held at the Iranian Embassy in China on the same day, Fazli stated that Iran thanks the Chinese government and people for their support during Iran's most difficult times. He said that Iran is committed to promoting Iran-China cooperation and is willing to work with China to advance the implementation of the comprehensive Iran-China cooperation plan, and to jointly strive to maintain international and regional security.

Fazli is the newly appointed Iranian Ambassador to China who recently arrived in Beijing. On June 23, Assistant Chinese Foreign Minister Liu Bin met with Fazli. At that time, Liu Bin said that China is highly concerned about the development of the regional situation, opposes infringements on Iran's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and opposes escalating conflicts. China is willing to maintain communication with Iran and play a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East. Fazli responded by expressing gratitude for China's impartial stance and expressed hope that China would continue to play an active role in de-escalating the situation and upholding international fairness and justice.

In fact, the new Israeli Ambassador to China, Be'eri, also recently took office, and Liu Bin met with Be'eri on June 25.

At yesterday's media briefing, Fazli reportedly discussed Iran's recent military retaliation against Israeli and US attacks, stating that the goals of Israel and the US were to overthrow the Iranian government, destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities, and incite the Iranian people against the government, but none of these three goals were achieved. He stated that Iran's military retaliation maintained national stability and unity. He pointed out that Iran has not yet exhausted its military retaliation capabilities.

US President Trump stated on June 25 that the US and Iran would hold talks next week and might sign an agreement. Fazli responded by saying that Iran has never voluntarily left the negotiating table, but "now is not a good time for negotiations." He emphasized that Iran would only reconsider negotiations if the US and Israel abandon their oppression and bullying of Iran.
