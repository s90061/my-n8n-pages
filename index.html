            <h1>Putin criticizes US pressure on Russian trade partners, warns of possible attack on Ukrainian nuclear power plant</h1>
            <p>Russia's President Putin said today that Russia will react quickly if it feels provoked by Europe. He also criticized the United States for forcing countries like China and India, who trade with Russia, to stop buying energy from Russia. At the same time, he warned that Russia might attack nuclear power plants controlled by Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reporters say that the war between Russia and Ukraine is the most deadly war in Europe since World War II. It has also caused the biggest disagreement between Russia and Western countries since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.</p>
            <p>Today, in Sochi, a city by the Black Sea, Putin spoke at the Valdai Discussion Club. He said that Russian soldiers are moving forward along the whole battle line in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Putin also said, "All NATO countries are fighting against us."</p>
            <p>He said that NATO countries give Ukraine information, weapons, and training. He added that if Europe provokes Russia, Russia will respond quickly.</p>
            <p>Putin stated, "If anyone still wants to compete with us in military matters, as we have said, let them come and try. Russia's response will come quickly."</p>
            <p>Putin also disagreed with former US President Donald Trump, who called Russia a "paper tiger." Putin said that Russia has the strongest army in the world. He also pointed out that if Russia is a paper tiger, then NATO is too. He said that if Western countries think they are facing a paper tiger, they should try to deal with it.</p>
            <p>Putin claimed that important people in Europe continue to cause "hysterical" feelings, and this has almost led to a war with Russia. However, he said that the idea of Russia attacking a NATO country one day is "unbelievable."</p>
            <p>Putin said, "I really want to say: calm down, sleep well, and take care of your own problems."</p>
            <p>Today, Putin also criticized the United States for pushing India and China to stop their energy trade with Russia. He warned that such actions could have bad results.</p>
            <p>He said that if higher taxes are put on goods from Russia's trade partners, it will make prices around the world go up. This will also make the US central bank keep interest rates high, which would then harm the US economy.</p>
            <p>Putin also accused Ukraine today of attacking areas near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is controlled by Russia. He warned that Russia might get revenge.</p>
            <p>News reports say that when asked about the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Putin said, "They have nuclear power plants that are still working. Why should we not respond in the same way? Let them think about that."</p>
            <p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has been offline for over a week. Russia and Ukraine are blaming each other for this power cut.</p>
            <p>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has 6 reactors. Before the war, it provided about one-fifth of Ukraine's electricity. All these reactors have been turned off since Russia took control. However, the nuclear power plant still needs electricity to keep its cooling and safety systems working. This is important to prevent the reactors from melting down and causing a nuclear accident.</p>

            <h1>Musk accuses Netflix of promoting transgenderism, calls on supporters to cancel subscriptions</h1>
            <p>Today, billionaire Elon Musk said that the streaming company Netflix is supporting what he calls "transgender propaganda." He asked his 227 million followers on social media to stop their Netflix subscriptions.</p>
            <p>In his newest fight about culture, Musk joined a protest started by a conservative social media account called Libs of TikTok.</p>
            <p>Libs of TikTok asked people to stop using Netflix because of the animated show "Dead End: Paranormal Park" and Netflix's company rules about having different kinds of people working there.</p>
            <p>Hamish Steele, who created "Dead End: Paranormal Park," made comments on social media about a conservative internet star named Charlie Kirk being attacked in September. Some internet users thought his comments were disrespectful, which caused people to react negatively.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Musk shared a post from Libs of TikTok on X, his own social media platform. He wrote, "Cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>That post showed a picture from a Netflix company report. The report said that Netflix has more directors and main actors who are not white.</p>
            <p>Later, Musk posted again, telling his followers, "For the health of your children, cancel Netflix."</p>
            <p>Steele himself had posted on the social media platform Bluesky about this disagreement, but that post has now been removed. He wrote, "These are all lies and bad things said about me!"</p>
            <p>Musk has a personal connection to transgender issues. In 2022, his oldest daughter, Vivian Jenna Wilson, openly changed her gender and legally changed her name and gender identity.</p>
            <p>Musk has said before that his children were "killed" by the "woke mind virus."</p>
