            <h1>YFY Made a Profit in the Second Quarter; Few Effects from Tariffs Expected as Sales are Mostly Domestic</h1>
            <p>YFY Group (Ê∞∏Ë±êÈ§òÊäïÊéß) made a profit in the second quarter. This was thanks to its paper products business doing better than usual, which continued to add to the company's total income. The profit that belongs to the parent company was NT$73.16 million. This is a good change from the first quarter, when the company lost NT$144 million. For this quarter, the company earned NT$0.05 per share.</p>
            <p>YFY held a meeting today to talk about how the US tariffs might affect them. The company said that when the US announced possible tariffs in early April, YFY immediately started a special team. This team looked at how the tariffs could affect the group and all its businesses. They also planned how to check risks for customers and see how direct and indirect effects might happen.</p>
            <p>According to the company's own check, YFY's main businesses mostly sell products inside Taiwan. Only about 10% of their income comes from direct and indirect exports to the United States. Also, their customers and industries are not highly focused in areas or industries that are affected by tariffs. So, the company believes the overall effect on them will be small.</p>
            <p>However, the world economy is uncertain, and there are trade tariffs, changing money values, and customers who are not buying much. YFY will continue to watch how the industry's supply chain changes and will adjust to what customers need.</p>
            <p>At the same time, YFY will keep working on "renewable energy" and "green materials." They will also improve technology to save energy and reduce carbon. They will use digital and smart AI management in all their processes. They will develop valuable green products. This will help the company grow in the future and give good, long-term returns to shareholders.</p>
            <p>YFY shared its half-year report yesterday. Because of its paper products business, YFY made a profit in the second quarter. But for the first half of the year, the company still had a loss of NT$71.51 million. This is not as good as the same time last year, when they made a profit of NT$291 million. YFY said today that because of the uncertain economic situation, the company will keep offering many different products and services. They will also manage the company carefully and change their plans to make more profit.</p>

            <h1>Sports Administration Promotes Summer Sports Camps for Students; Nearly 100,000 People Have Joined So Far</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education's Sports Administration has been running summer sports camps for students since 2010. They want to help students exercise during their summer break. Almost 100,000 students have taken part in these camps. This year, they are offering 45 different camps to let students try sports that are not usually available at school.</p>
            <p>For the 2025 summer sports camps, there are three main types of classes: "mountain series," "water series," and "general series." There are more than 10 different sports activities. These activities help students train their bodies and minds in different places and learn to exercise throughout their lives.</p>
            <p>Fang Rui-wen, the Deputy Director of the Sports Administration, said at a press conference today that the summer sports camps have been going on for 16 years. Parents and students really like them every year. He said, "We mainly plan for sports that are not often found in schools, like river tracing, paintball, rock climbing, and scuba diving. Many people sign up for these."</p>
            <p>Fang Rui-wen also said that students from elementary school to high school can join the camps. Students who have financial difficulties, aboriginal students, new immigrant students, students with disabilities, or students with a high BMI can join for free.</p>
            <p>Wu Yun-wei, a 4th-grade student from Linkou Touhu Elementary School, also spoke at the press conference today. She was happy and said that she saw archery on TV during the Olympics and thought it looked fun. So, she told her mom she wanted to learn it and joined an archery camp this year.</p>
            <p>Wu Yun-wei explained that her school does not have an archery range, so she could not try this sport there. She thinks archery is interesting and helps her learn to be patient. She feels very good when her arrow hits the center of the target.</p>

            <h1>Yunlin Elementary and Junior High School Principals' Meeting: Han Kuo-yu Hopes They Keep Their Ideals to Help Students</h1>
            <p>Legislative Speaker Han Kuo-yu attended the meeting for elementary and junior high school principals in Yunlin County today. This meeting was for the 2025-2026 school year. He hoped that the principals would stay true to themselves as they teach and guide students. He wants them to keep their ideals, beliefs, and passion. He hopes they help the next generation grow in their minds and learn more knowledge.</p>
            <p>The Yunlin County Government's Education Department held the Yunlin County Elementary and Junior High School Principals' Meeting today. During the meeting, there was a special talk about teaching with AI, information about accidents at school workplaces, and teachers shared their real-life experiences. Han Kuo-yu was also invited to talk with the principals about education.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu talked with the principals about common problems they face. These included how students learn differently and issues with the school environment. He also hoped that by talking together, they could all learn from each other. This way, the next generation can grow better mentally and learn more.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that times are changing quickly, and new technology is appearing all the time. Young people can get more knowledge and understanding through technology. Sometimes, they even know more than older people. There are differences between generations, and these differences affect education. Teachers who work directly with students face many pressures. They not only teach but also need to help students solve their problems.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu hopes that principals will not lose who they truly are. He wants them to keep their ideals, beliefs, and passion. When they face different problems and have different choices, he wants them to choose what is best for everyone.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu suggested that the principals read a book called "Lee Kuan Yew's Memoirs." From this book, they can learn how Singapore managed to start its policy of teaching in two languages, even though it was very difficult. They can also learn how Singapore planned its future and how it stayed balanced between the United States and China to get the most benefits for its own country.</p>
            <p>Some public workers at the meeting asked about changes to the pension system and retirement money rules. Han Kuo-yu promised that the Legislative Yuan would discuss this in the next meeting session.</p>
