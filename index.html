            <h1>US State Governments' East Coast Meeting Supports Taiwan's Global Role</h1>
            <p>At the annual meeting of the "National Association of State Governments Eastern Conference" in Providence, Rhode Island, a resolution supporting Taiwan was passed today. This resolution goes against China's incorrect use of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758.</p>
            <p>The "National Association of State Governments Eastern Conference" met from August 17 to 20 in Providence, the capital of Rhode Island. More than 500 people, including state lawmakers, state government staff, and business people, attended the meeting.</p>
            <p>The resolution that supports Taiwan states that UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 does not talk about Taiwan's status. It also does not stop Taiwan from being part of the United Nations system. China is purposely misinterpreting and using this resolution as a weapon. This is to try and separate Taiwan and stop it from joining international groups in a meaningful way.</p>
            <p>The resolution highlights that the partnership between Taiwan and the United States is very strong. Both sides share democratic values. It supports signing an "Agreement to Avoid Double Taxation" soon and continuing talks for the "Taiwan-US 21st Century Trade Initiative." It also encourages US states to open new offices or make their existing offices bigger in Taiwan. It suggests signing agreements to allow mutual driver's license exchange without tests. These steps will make economic ties and education exchanges stronger between the two sides.</p>
            <p>Liao Chao-hung, who leads Taiwan's office in Boston, first thanked the state parliaments. He thanked them for showing support for Taiwan by passing these resolutions. He said that the support from these states is a key reason for the strong relationship between Taiwan and the US. It also gives Taiwanese people more confidence and courage to protect their democracy.</p>
            <p>Mr. Liao also thanked past US governments for helping Taiwan with defense, as stated in the Taiwan Relations Act. He said that Taiwan is on the front line of protecting democracy around the world. China keeps threatening Taiwan with military actions, economic pressure, false information, and wrong interpretations of UN Resolution 2758. These are called "grey zone tactics." Taiwan's government will keep making its defense and social strength better. It will also work with other democratic countries to protect peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The "National Association of State Governments Eastern Conference" started in 1937. Its main office is in New York. Members include 11 states and 2 areas in the eastern US, and 5 provinces in Canada. Its goal is to help state governments, businesses, and schools talk to each other. It also wants to make government better and make democracy stronger.</p>
            <p>The executive meeting on August 17 was led by the conference co-chairs, Rhode Island Senate President Valarie Lawson and House Speaker Joseph Shekarchi. About 100 leaders and officials from different state parliaments, including Illinois Senator Elgie Sims, who is the association's national chairman, were there.</p>

            <h1>Trump: Arranging Meetings for Putin and Zelenskyy, Followed by US-Ukraine-Russia Summit</h1>
            <p>Donald Trump had a very busy and important day today. After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, several European leaders joined the talks. In the evening, Trump announced that he called Russian President Vladimir Putin after the meetings. He has started to arrange a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy. After that, a summit with the US, Ukraine, and Russia will happen to stop the war.</p>
            <p>US President Trump met separately with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders at the White House today. After the meetings, he wrote on social media that the talks were "very good." Everyone talked about how to keep Ukraine safe. Many European countries would help with this, and the US would work with them.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on social media: "After the meeting, I called (Russian) President Putin. I have started to set up a meeting between President Putin and Zelenskyy. The place for this meeting is not decided yet. After that meeting, we will have a three-person talk. The two presidents and I will be there."</p>
            <p>He said these plans are good first steps for a war that has been going on for almost four years. Vice President JD Vance, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff are working with Russia and Ukraine on these plans.</p>
            <p>People are most interested in the "security guarantees" and the meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin. Trump also told reporters in the afternoon that any agreement after the war would give "a lot of help" for safety. But he stressed that Europe would be the "first line of defense," and the US would also help.</p>
            <p>Trump did not directly say if US soldiers would stay in Ukraine to keep the peace. He only said, "Maybe I'll tell you the answer later today."</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Trump Suddenly Changes Plans, Calls Putin During Meeting with European Leaders</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump held a private meeting today at the White House with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several European leaders. Reuters reported, using information from an EU diplomat, that Trump suddenly stopped the meeting with the European leaders. He did this to call Russian President Vladimir Putin, even though the call was planned to happen after the meeting.</p>
            <p>Trump first met with Zelenskyy around 1 PM. He told the reporters there, "I like the idea of a ceasefire."</p>
            <p>But Trump also said, "We can work to reach a peace agreement while they (Russia and Ukraine) are still fighting." He also mentioned that some recent peace agreements did not need a ceasefire to happen first.</p>
            <p>Trump did not directly say if US soldiers would be in Ukraine to keep the peace. He only said, "Maybe I'll tell you the answer later today."</p>
            <p>He had said that after meeting with Zelenskyy and leaders from several European countries, he would call Putin. A meeting between Trump and Putin had happened just three days before at a US military base in Alaska. This made today's meeting at the White House even more important.</p>
            <p>However, Reuters reported in the afternoon that Trump stopped his meeting with Zelenskyy and leaders from the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, the European Commission, and NATO. He stopped it to talk to Putin instead.</p>
            <p>Later, Zelenskyy's spokesperson told CNN that Trump's meeting with the European leaders had started again in the White House Oval Office. It was a meeting "for leaders only."</p>
