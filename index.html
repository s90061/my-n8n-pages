            <h1>Typhoon Kashas Damages 35 Schools; Ministry of Education Gives 18.5 Million to Fix Campuses</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education's newest report shows that Typhoon Kashas damaged 35 schools. The first estimate of the cost is 64.14 million New Taiwan Dollars. In Guangfu Township, Hualien County, many schools were badly damaged. This happened because a dammed lake in the Mata'an River overflowed. The Ministry of Education has first given 18.5 million New Taiwan Dollars to help fix the school campuses.</p>
            <p>Today, Minister of Education Cheng Ying-yao visited the areas in Hualien and Taitung that were hit by the typhoon. He wanted to check on the students and teachers. According to a Facebook post from the Ministry of Education in the evening, Cheng Ying-yao promised to quickly help children return to a safe place to learn. At the moment, 18.5 million New Taiwan Dollars are being given to help repair Guangfu Commercial and Industrial Vocational High School, Guangfu Junior High School, and various elementary and middle schools in Hualien and Taitung counties.</p>
            <p>To make sure students can keep learning after the disaster, schools at all levels have made plans to continue education. They will use online learning and other ways to get through this time.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Education's School Safety Center, as of 8 AM today, 35 schools were damaged. 15 of these schools are in Taitung County and 7 are in Hualien County. Hualien County has the highest cost of damage, at 60.53 million New Taiwan Dollars. Guangfu Junior High School alone had severe damage from flooding. This affected kitchen equipment, all wiring, facilities, school buses, the soccer field, and the track and field. The school thinks the damage costs 60 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>However, the Ministry of Education said that in Guangfu Township, Hualien, work and school have stopped for now. Many schools are full of mud, so it is hard for school staff to go in or report the damage online. Because of this, more checks are still needed.</p>

            <h1>US Expands Tariff Investigation to Include Medical Supplies, Robots, and Industrial Machines</h1>
            <p>The US government recently started national security investigations into robots, industrial machines, and medical devices. This action could open the way for new tariffs. Tariffs are extra taxes on imported goods. This might make things more expensive for regular people, hospitals, and companies that make things.</p>
            <p>The Commerce Department announced yesterday that it started an investigation on September 2. This is according to Section 232 of the US Trade Expansion Act. The investigation will check if the imported goods mentioned above are a danger to US national security.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a US news company about money, reported that this investigation now includes more items that might get higher tariffs. These include personal protective equipment like surgical masks, N95 masks, and medical gloves. It also includes other medical supplies like syringes and needles, and medicines that a doctor prescribes.</p>
            <p>The investigation also covers imported medical equipment. This includes wheelchairs and hospital beds. It also includes devices like pacemakers, insulin pumps, and artificial heart valves.</p>
            <p>These investigations could become the reason for adding more tariffs on specific industries. The goal is to bring the making of important goods for national security back to the United States.</p>
            <p>The Commerce Department is asking companies for their thoughts. This includes their guesses about how many of these products will be needed in the future. It also asks if local production can make enough, and what part foreign suppliers play. Companies are also asked to explain how foreign government help and what the government calls "unfair trade practices" affect their industries.</p>
            <p>The government of former US President Donald Trump had already used Section 232 to add tariffs on imported goods. These goods included cars and car parts, copper, steel, and aluminum. Investigations into imported items like medicines, semiconductors, and chip parts (such as silicon wafers and machines that make chips) are still going on. This shows that the US is worried about depending too much on suppliers from other countries.</p>
            <p>Data from the US International Trade Commission (USITC) shows that the US relies a lot on Mexico and China for machines. In 2023, imports from Mexico made up over 18% of all machines bought by the US, and imports from China made up over 17%.</p>
            <p>Information from the International Federation of Robotics shows that the car industry might be one of the industries most affected by these possible new tariffs. Last year, this industry put in 13,747 industrial robots. This was more than any other industry. The organization stated that most robots are bought from other countries, and only a small number are made in the US.</p>
            <p>Experts warn that if tariffs are added to medical devices and protective equipment, the costs will go up for both hospitals and patients. This will then make it harder to get important equipment and medical services.</p>
