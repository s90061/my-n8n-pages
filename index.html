            <h1>First Meeting for Shezidao Land Purchase: Groups For and Against Shouted Outside</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Government held its first meeting to buy land in Shezidao. Outside the meeting, groups who were against and for the plan shouted at each other. The Shezidao Self-Help Association asked to stop the process of buying land. The Shezidao Development Promotion Association, which supports the plan, said that land rezoning would make life better for local people.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Land Development Office held the first meeting this morning in Shezidao. It was about buying land for the "Shilin Shezidao Area Land Rezoning Project." More meetings will happen until the 20th. The Land Development Office said that the meetings are to help landowners understand the development plan and how the land buying process works.</p>
            <p>The Shezidao Self-Help Association held a press conference there. They said "No to the toxic Shezidao plan, stop the land purchase process." They also made a statement. They said the city government is not listening to the court's decision or what local people want. They are still pushing the Shezidao land rezoning plan.</p>
            <p>The Shezidao Self-Help Association's statement said that Mayor Chiang's government is following the old government's way. They are forcing the "Eco Shezidao" plan forward. This has hurt the rights of the people living there. They said again that they are against land rezoning and buying land. They want the building ban to be removed. They also want to rebuild in the same place and keep the nine main villages completely.</p>
            <p>Yu Yi-chia, the Secretary-General of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights, supported the Shezidao Self-Help Association. She said that residents are not against development. But they think that the old and forgotten basic services in the area should be made better first. If the city government makes the land rezoning bigger, the Shezidao plan might cost more than 200 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The Shezidao Residents' Rights Promotion Association also came to complain. This group supports the development. They shared a statement from residents. They said that Shezidao has had a building ban for 56 years. According to city numbers from early May last year, about 98% of Shezidao landowners agree to the land rezoning. They questioned if the people who are against it are really local residents.</p>
            <p>The Shezidao Residents' Rights Promotion Association believes that Shezidao does not have enough basic services. With the city government's land rezoning plan, public construction can be built at the same time. This will make life and the environment better for local people.</p>
            <p>The Shezidao Promotion Association said that talking about land prices is a step before land rezoning. The city government has said that it will hold public hearings for the project plan and other things in order. Then it will report to the Ministry of Interior for approval. They support the city government moving forward with land rezoning according to the law.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Land Development Office said in a press release that they are buying land according to the law. Before the environmental assessment lawsuit for Shezidao is finished, the results of the environmental assessment are still valid. They are buying land according to Article 11 of the Land Expropriation Act. This is legal and follows rules, so it is not illegal.</p>
            <p>The Land Development Office said that to make the Shezidao flood walls better and fix the water drainage problems, they need to build public facilities and provide basic services. Only then can the lives of local residents get better. They will actively work on the full development of Shezidao.</p>

            <h1>President: To Release Female Workforce, Plans to Allow Hiring Domestic Helpers with Just 1 Child</h1>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te spoke to the media and said that the ruling party will start "four adjustments" to help society rest and recover. They will continue to raise salaries, lower taxes, and increase benefits. They will bravely solve what society needs. He also told the Legislative Yuan to "put people's lives first and politics second."</p>
            <p>President Lai was interviewed by "Liberty Times." The interview was published today. They talked about many topics. These included raising workers' pay, lowering taxes, Long-Term Care 3.0, helping more women work, dealing with trade talks and how businesses react, talks between different political parties, doubts about the U.S., and relations with China.</p>
            <p>For the economy, the President said they will focus on three new areas. First, they will help small and medium businesses deal with the effects of U.S. tariffs. Second, they will help these businesses change their ways of working, use more digital tools, and aim for zero emissions. Third, they will help traditional industries join together and become stronger. They will also use the "Taiwan Sovereign Fund" to invest in or buy international sales channels. This will help traditional products reach markets around the world.</p>
            <p>The President said that the minimum wage was raised every year when former President Tsai Ing-wen was in office. He has also continued to raise it since he became president. He also raised salaries for government workers and soldiers. He asks companies that want to go public on the stock market to pay new employees a certain minimum salary. In the future, he hopes the Ministry of Labor will make new rules. When companies ask to hire foreign workers, they must first raise the salaries of their local workers to a certain level. Only then can they hire foreign workers.</p>
            <p>Talking about lower taxes, the President said that next year, young people who earn less than 620,000 New Taiwan Dollars a year will not have to pay tax. For a family of four with two children under 5, if their yearly income is less than 1,641,000 New Taiwan Dollars, they also don't pay tax. If they also take care of two older people, and their family income is over 2 million New Taiwan Dollars, they still don't pay tax. Right now, almost half of the people in Taiwan don't pay tax. Instead, the top 1% of earners pay almost half of all taxes. The government is working hard to make the gap between rich and poor smaller.</p>
            <p>The President said that the government is promoting Long-Term Care 3.0. He also encourages Premier Cho Jung-tai to work hard to solve society's needs. For example, to help more women join the workforce, problems must be solved. So, in the future, families might be able to hire a domestic helper even if they only have one child. This is a brave step to solve real-life issues that society needs help with.</p>
            <p>On tariffs (taxes on imported goods), the President said that technical agreements and talks are finished. Now, they are waiting for the last big meeting. Investing in Alaska is for energy safety. This plan was made a long time ago. Later, because the U.S. government invited them and because of tariff talks, the government did say they wanted to invest in Alaska.</p>
            <p>About doubts about the U.S., the President said that after U.S. President Trump took office, help for Taiwan in areas like foreign relations and defense did not stop or lessen. Instead, it continued to get stronger. People should feel confident once they clearly understand this.</p>
            <p>Regarding China's "gray zone" attacks, the President said that national security agencies have listed and are specially watching Chinese ships. For example, oil tankers and cargo ships that have been part of military exercises, or ships that have cut underwater internet cables. The government will soon propose seven laws and seven smaller rules to protect underwater internet cables. The Executive Yuan is discussing these now.</p>
            <p>The President said that China should not ignore or disrespect Taiwan's good intentions. He really hopes China can open its fist. There is a saying, "If you hold a hammer, everything looks like a nail." But if you hold an olive branch, you can clearly see the good intentions of the people of Taiwan. As long as China accepts that the Republic of China exists and respects what the people of Taiwan want, he believes many problems can be solved easily.</p>
            <p>When asked about the "echo chamber effect," the President said he encourages himself and his cabinet to change how they work. First, they need to respond quickly. Second, their messages should reach many different groups of people. Third, they need to go to local communities. Fourth, they should use technology well. Fifth, leaders must be at the front, protecting policies and talking to people in local areas. They must personally explain things that are misunderstood. Only then can they be effective.</p>
            <p>About the relationship between the ruling and opposition parties, the President said he hopes the legal system will work properly again. This means that the rules for the "Act Governing the Legislative Yuan's Powers" can meet legal requirements. Second, he really hopes that talks between the ruling and opposition parties can work well, so their ideas can become real. Third, the Premier should have a direct way to talk with opposition parties and even with Legislative Yuan President Han Kuo-yu. Everyone should "put people's lives first and political fights second."</p>
