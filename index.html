            <h1>Vice President Talks About Old School Canvas Donation Controversy</h1>
            <p>In 2016, when Hsiao Bi-khim was running to be a politician for Hualien, she gave large canvas banners to schools. The Hualien county government said this was politics getting involved in schools. Last night, she said she felt many things about this old story. She now knows she was never by herself. Many people in Hualien are still working hard for Hualien. She said, "Let's fight for the people of Hualien, keep going!"</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Liberty Times newspaper reported that Hu Jen-shun, a Hualien County politician from the Democratic Progressive Party, said this. He said that in 2016, Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim gave her old campaign banners to schools. But the Hualien County Government said this was "political power entering schools."</p>
            <p>Late last night, Vice President Hsiao wrote on Threads. She said she just saw this news and felt a mix of emotions. It was an old event. It happened after the 2016 election. Her simple and good idea to reuse things caused problems for the schools. At that time, she felt a little sad. But thinking back, this was normal for her many years of work in Hualien.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said she learned a lot from this hard time. Her life has now started a new part.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that the banners had her picture and the words "Fighting for Hualien people." She now understands that she was never alone. This is because many people in Hualien "are still working hard for their home. They are also working for a better Hualien. Keep going!"</p>

            <h1>People Arrested for Kaohsiung Solar Power Project Issue</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung, July 23 (Central News Agency) â€“ The solar power project in Dashu Heshanshan, Kaohsiung, has caused problems. Mr. Lin, who runs the project, and Mr. Wu, an engineer who worked on the land protection plan, were asked to be held by the police. Today, a court in Qiaotou said they could be held. The court thought the two men were not being fully honest. Also, some other people involved in the case have not been found yet. So, the court decided to hold both men and not let them have visitors.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou District Court explained that Mr. Lin only said he did some of the bad things. He might have broken important laws about keeping mountain land safe and protecting soil and water. What he said about the solar power project's land protection plan was different from what others said. Mr. Wu said he did nothing wrong. He might also have broken important laws about protecting soil and water. What he said about the project's land protection plan seemed to hide some facts.</p>
            <p>The Qiaotou Court said the judge believed that other people connected to the case had not been caught yet. Because of this, the judge thought Mr. Lin and Mr. Wu might try to talk to these people. After looking at everything, the court decided that holding them was needed. They cannot have visitors or send messages.</p>
            <p>The Dashu Heshanshan solar power project in Kaohsiung was built in a wrong way. They dug too much and did not protect the soil and water. Their permission to build was taken away. The Energy Administration and other groups asked them to remove the illegal parts and make the land look like it was before. In June, the Kaohsiung City Government sent the case to the Qiaotou District Prosecutor's Office. The prosecutors looked at information and brought people in for questions. After asking questions, they asked to hold Mr. Lin and Mr. Wu. Three workers from other companies were let go after paying money, between 80,000 and 100,000 New Taiwan Dollars each.</p>
