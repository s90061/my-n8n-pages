A growing number of employees are embracing "quiet quitting," a trend where they fulfill their job descriptions but avoid going above and beyond. This isn't about laziness; it's about setting boundaries and prioritizing work-life balance. Workers feel burnt out, undervalued, and are pushing back against the pressure to constantly overwork.

While employers might worry about productivity, quiet quitting can also signal deeper issues within a company culture. Low morale, lack of recognition, and poor communication can all contribute to employees disengaging. Instead of cracking down, companies should focus on creating a supportive environment where employees feel appreciated and motivated to contribute their best. This could involve offering flexible work arrangements, recognizing achievements, and fostering open communication channels. By addressing the root causes of quiet quitting, companies can boost employee engagement and build a more sustainable and productive workforce.

**Amazon's Drone Delivery Service Takes Flight in More Locations**

Amazon's long-awaited drone delivery service, Prime Air, is expanding to new locations in the United States. After years of development and testing, the company is starting to deliver packages to customers in more areas, offering a faster and more convenient delivery option for smaller items.

The drones, equipped with advanced sensors and navigation systems, can carry packages weighing up to five pounds. Amazon hopes to make deliveries within 30 minutes or less. This expansion marks a significant step forward for drone delivery technology, which has the potential to revolutionize e-commerce and logistics. However, challenges remain, including regulatory hurdles and concerns about safety and noise pollution. As Amazon scales its drone delivery service, it will need to address these issues to ensure its long-term success and public acceptance.

**Venice Imposes Tourist Tax and Bans Loudspeakers to Combat Overtourism**

Venice is taking drastic measures to manage the impact of overtourism. The city will soon require day-trippers to pay an entry fee, aimed at reducing the number of visitors during peak seasons. This fee is intended to help fund the upkeep of the city's infrastructure and cultural heritage, which are under strain from the constant influx of tourists.

Furthermore, the city council has banned the use of loudspeakers by tour guides, hoping to reduce noise pollution and improve the quality of life for residents. These measures reflect a growing concern among European cities about the negative effects of mass tourism. By implementing these regulations, Venice hopes to strike a balance between welcoming visitors and protecting its unique environment and cultural identity.
