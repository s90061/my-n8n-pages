Video conferencing giant Zoom announced it will cut approximately 150 jobs, representing less than 2% of its workforce. This move comes just over a year after the company laid off around 1,300 employees. The current cuts will affect teams including engineering, and are reportedly aimed at streamlining operations and focusing on artificial intelligence initiatives.

The company, which saw a massive surge in users during the pandemic, has been facing challenges as people return to in-person work and competition intensifies. Zoom is investing heavily in AI-powered features to differentiate itself from rivals like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet. A spokesperson for Zoom stated that the company remains committed to innovation and long-term growth, and these adjustments are necessary to ensure its continued success in a rapidly evolving market. Affected employees will receive severance packages and outplacement services.

**Tech Firm Zoom Cuts More Jobs to Focus on AI**

Zoom, the video call company, is planning to cut about 150 jobs. This is a small part of their workforce, less than 2%. They already cut around 1,300 jobs last year. This time, the job losses will mostly affect the engineering teams. Zoom says these changes will make the company more efficient and help them concentrate on new technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI).

Zoom became very popular during the pandemic when many people had to work from home. Now that people are going back to offices, Zoom is facing more competition. Other companies like Microsoft Teams and Google Meet offer similar services. To stay ahead, Zoom is putting a lot of money into AI. They hope AI will give them an advantage over their competitors. A Zoom representative said that the company is still dedicated to coming up with new ideas and growing in the future. These job cuts are just part of making sure they can succeed in a fast-changing market. Workers who are affected by the cuts will get money and help finding new jobs.

**Article 2: Sustainable Coffee Farming Takes Root in Colombia**

In the hills of Colombia, a growing number of coffee farmers are embracing sustainable agricultural practices. These methods, which prioritize environmental protection and social responsibility, are gaining traction as consumers increasingly demand ethically sourced products. Techniques like shade-grown coffee, which involves planting coffee bushes under a canopy of trees, not only provide habitat for wildlife but also improve soil health and reduce the need for chemical fertilizers.

Farmers are also adopting water-saving technologies and composting organic waste to minimize their environmental impact. Furthermore, many are joining cooperatives that ensure fair prices and provide access to training and resources. The Colombian Coffee Growers Federation is actively promoting sustainable practices through certification programs and educational initiatives. While the transition to sustainable farming can be challenging, many farmers believe it is essential for the long-term health of their land and the future of the coffee industry.

**Colombian Coffee Farmers Go Green to Protect the Environment**

More and more coffee farmers in Colombia are starting to use environmentally friendly ways of farming. They believe it is important to protect nature and treat people fairly, and consumers want to buy products that are made in an ethical way. One technique is to grow coffee plants under trees. This creates a home for animals, makes the soil better, and means they don't need to use as many chemicals.

Farmers are also using less water and turning waste into compost to help the environment. Many are joining groups that make sure they get a fair price for their coffee and give them training. The Colombian Coffee Growers Federation is helping farmers learn about these sustainable methods through courses and by giving them certificates. Changing to this type of farming can be hard work, but many farmers think it is important to protect their land and make sure the coffee industry has a future.

**Article 3: Record Numbers of Tourists Visit Kyoto Despite Overcrowding Concerns**

Kyoto, Japan, is experiencing a surge in tourism, with visitor numbers reaching record highs this year. The city's ancient temples, traditional gardens, and vibrant geisha districts are proving increasingly popular with international travelers. However, the influx of tourists has also raised concerns about overcrowding and its impact on local residents and infrastructure.

Popular sites like Fushimi Inari Shrine and Arashiyama Bamboo Grove are often packed with visitors, leading to long queues and a diminished experience for everyone. The city government is exploring measures to manage the crowds, including promoting off-peak travel, encouraging visitors to explore lesser-known areas, and implementing reservation systems for popular attractions. They are also working to raise awareness among tourists about responsible travel practices, such as respecting local customs and supporting local businesses. Balancing the economic benefits of tourism with the need to preserve Kyoto's cultural heritage remains a significant challenge.

**Kyoto is Overwhelmed with Tourists, Causing Problems**

Kyoto, in Japan, is seeing a huge increase in tourists. More people than ever before are visiting the city this year. People love Kyoto's old temples, beautiful gardens, and the geisha areas. However, so many tourists are causing overcrowding, which is making life difficult for the local people and damaging the city.

Places like Fushimi Inari Shrine and the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove are often full of visitors. This means long waits and a less enjoyable experience. The city government is trying to find ways to manage the crowds. They are suggesting that people visit during quieter times, explore less famous places, and book tickets in advance for popular attractions. They are also teaching tourists how to travel responsibly, like respecting local customs and supporting local shops and restaurants. It is hard to balance the money that tourism brings with the need to protect Kyoto's culture and history.
