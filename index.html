            <h1>Russia and Ukraine Exchange 146 Prisoners Each, UAE Helps</h1>
            <p>On August 24, Russia and Ukraine each exchanged 146 prisoners of war. This exchange happened with help from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This information came from Russia's Ministry of Defense and Ukraine's President Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Russia's Ministry of Defense said all the released Russians are now in Belarus. They are getting mental and medical help there. The ministry also said that Ukraine returned 8 people from Russia's Kursk region.</p>
            <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the prisoner exchange on Telegram, a messaging app. He did not say how many people were exchanged. He posted smiling photos of the released prisoners. He said most of them became prisoners after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. He also mentioned that a journalist who was captured a month after the invasion was among them.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy thanked the UAE for helping with the exchange. He wrote, "The prisoner exchange continues. Maybe this is possible because our soldiers are increasing the exchange fund for Ukraine." Zelenskyy called the Russian soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces during a quick attack in Russia's Kursk region Ukraine's "exchange fund."</p>

            <h1>Canadian Prime Minister: Sending Peacekeeping Troops to Ukraine is Possible</h1>
            <p>On August 24, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney told Ukrainian President Zelenskyy that Canada supports Ukraine's demand for strong security promises in any peace deal. He also said that Canada might send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine as part of such a deal.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the war between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for three and a half years. US President Trump is trying to lead peace efforts. Ukraine is working with its European allies to create a plan for security promises after the war. Trump has said he is open to this idea.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy held a ceremony in Kyiv city center today to celebrate Independence Day. Canadian Prime Minister Carney, who visited Ukraine for the first time since becoming prime minister in March, was there. Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, also attended the event.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy told the guests at Sophia Square in Kyiv, "We are all working to make sure that when this war ends, Ukraine will have peace guarantees. This way, our children and grandchildren will not have to suffer from war or the threat of war."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said he wants future security promises in a peace deal to be as similar as possible to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This article states that an armed attack on one member country is considered an attack on all member countries. Carney supported Ukraine's request for possible international help.</p>
            <p>At a joint press conference, Carney said, "Canada believes it is not realistic to rely only on the strength of the Ukrainian armed forces for security. It must be supported and made stronger." The two leaders also signed an agreement to work together to produce drones. Carney said Ukraine will receive over 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 22 billion Taiwan dollars) in military aid next month from a plan announced earlier.</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Wants to Talk with Putin as Peace Efforts Stop</h1>
            <p>Today, August 24, is Ukraine's Independence Day. President Zelenskyy said that talking with Russian President Putin would be "the most effective way to move the peace process forward." This comes as diplomatic efforts to end the war have stopped.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Ukraine launched a drone attack today, which caused a fire at a Russian nuclear power plant.</p>
            <p>US President Trump is trying to arrange a meeting between Ukraine and Russia. But on August 22, Russia said that a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would not happen soon. This made hopes for peace smaller. However, Zelenskyy said today that "talks between leaders are the most effective way to move the peace process forward," and he again asked for a meeting with Putin.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Western countries were trying to "find excuses to block negotiations." He also criticized Zelenskyy for "demanding an immediate meeting at any cost."</p>
            <p>During a ceremony attended by US special envoy Keith Kellogg and other Western officials, Zelenskyy promised to "force Russia to peace."</p>
