US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that Southeast Asian countries might get "better" tariff rates compared to other parts of the world. This news comes as a trade war is a major topic at the ASEAN meeting he is attending.

President Trump recently threatened over 20 countries. If they do not agree with Washington by August 1st, they will face extra taxes on their goods.

Rubio spoke to reporters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, during a meeting of foreign ministers. He said that many countries in Southeast Asia will likely have better tariff rates than other places. He added that talks would continue with Japan next week and with almost every country there.

Trump also said that tariffs, which he stopped in April, would start again after the new deadline. He has sent notices to more than 20 countries, including some in Asia, about tariffs between 20% and 50%. He also announced a 50% tariff on imported copper and is thinking about a 200% tariff on medicines.

**Pingtung Mountains: 481 People Evacuated, Chou Chun-Mi Delivers Hot Food**

Pingtung is experiencing continuous heavy rain due to a low-pressure area and southwest winds. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-Mi returned from Northern Europe and immediately went to the disaster response center. Later, she visited a shelter in Majia Township to comfort the people who had to leave their homes and brought them hot food.

The Pingtung County Government announced that Chou went to the disaster response center to understand the situation. Her team decided that nine townshipsâ€”Wutai, Sandimen, Majia, Laiyi, Taiwu, Chunri, Shizi, Mudan, and Manzhouâ€”would remain closed for work and school tomorrow. This is because the heavy rain has made the soil loose and slopes unstable, which could be dangerous.

Chou then went to the shelter in Majia Township. She gave soy milk and steamed buns to the tribal residents staying there. She mentioned that Majia Township had 500 millimeters of rain today, and over 800 millimeters in two days. She thanked the people for moving to safety and highlighted the new disaster tents that offer privacy. She hopes everyone will return home only when it's safe after the heavy rain stops.

By 9:55 PM, 481 people were moved from Sandimen, Majia, Laiyi, Shizi, and Manzhou townships. 370 of them are staying with relatives, and 111 are in shelters. Also, the Ministry of Agriculture announced financial help for farmers in Pingtung due to natural disasters. This includes papayas, bananas, bitter gourds, cucumbers, and soybeans in Hengchun Township. The county government reminds farmers to report their losses to their local township office soon.

**Taiwan's Financial Firms Make NT$63.8 Billion in June Despite Currency Rise**

All 14 financial holding companies in Taiwan made profits in June, totaling NT$63.835 billion. This is a good result, even though the Taiwan dollar kept getting stronger. The central bank worked hard to keep the currency stable, and the financial watchdog also made temporary rules to help. This meant that the losses from currency exchange were not as bad as in May.

In total, these 14 companies earned NT$219.225 billion in the first half of the year. However, this is 35% less than last year because financial markets have been more unstable.

Looking at the companies' performance, while three companies lost money in May, all 14 made a profit in June. Still, more than half of them earned less in the first half of this year compared to the same time last year.

Fubon Financial had a good June, making NT$11.85 billion after taxes, and NT$51.34 billion in the first six months. Cathay Financial made NT$7.1 billion in June and NT$45.75 billion in the first half. CTBC Financial earned NT$11.165 billion in June, mainly because of Taiwan Life Insurance, which made a lot of money from stock dividends and selling foreign funds. Mega Financial, Hua Nan Financial, and First Financial also showed strong performance among the government-owned financial groups.
