            <h1>Paper Windmill's 368 Art Show goes to Yilan, the Big Tree God tells local stories</h1>
            <p>The "Paper Windmill 368 Children's Art Project" keeps happening all over Taiwan. Today, it was in Yilan Sports Park. The Big Tree God from Paper Windmill told stories about Yilan. More than 2200 parents and children came to watch.</p>
            <p>The Paper Windmill Foundation said today that their show, "Taiwan Fantasia," has four parts. "Don Quixote" tells kids to be brave and chase their dreams. "The Attack of Leftover Food" is a funny show that teaches kids why it's important to not waste food. "The Joy of Celebration" is a magic light show with many colors that kids love to watch.</p>
            <p>This year, the Lin Deng Foundation, which helps pay for the show, is 35 years old. The Paper Windmill group also made a special "local story" for the first show in Yilan. The Big Tree God told a beautiful old story about General Turtle and Princess Kavalan. They fell in love and became Turtle Island and Lanyang Plain, watching over each other. The story also included the life of Lin Deng, a man from Yilan, showing the kind spirit of Yilan people.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian-han, who leads the Chung Hsing Security Foundation, said he is happy to work with Paper Windmill on this art project. They have worked together since 1999. He said, "Today's show has a small part about my grandfather, Lin Deng. I hope everyone in Yilan learns about how much he helped Yilan." He also showed a video to thank Ms. Zhuang Su-zhu, who used to lead the foundation, for her help.</p>
            <p>Lin Mao-sheng, who is in charge of Yilan County, said that the plays help people enjoy art and learn many things. Chen Mei-ling, the mayor of Yilan City, said, "Thank you to the three Chung Hsing Security foundations for working in Yilan for so long. We are happy that the first Paper Windmill 368 show in Yilan County is in Yilan City, bringing happiness."</p>
            <p>Ren Jian-cheng, the leader of the Paper Windmill group, said that every time they visit Yilan, the audience claps and laughs a lot. "This gives us the strength to keep going."</p>

            <h1>People's Party helps Ko Wen-je, 8 police officers get hurt; Mayor Chiang Wan-an calls to check on them</h1>
            <p>Ko Wen-je, who used to lead the People's Party, has been held for nearly a year because of a legal issue. Today, Huang Kuo-chang, the current leader of the People's Party, led a "walking event." This caused pushing and pulling with police officers, and 8 officers were hurt. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-an said he called the police chief, Li Xi-he, to ask how everyone was.</p>
            <p>The Zhongzheng First Police Station in Taipei said that Huang Kuo-chang gathered nearly a thousand people this morning. They walked towards the President's house. During the walk, he kept telling people to move forward, push police, and move fences. They tried to go into an area where protests are not allowed. Because of this, 8 police officers were hurt. This goes against the law for gatherings and protests. The police will send the case to the Taipei court for review.</p>
            <p>Before going to the Taipei International Food Festival today, Mayor Chiang Wan-an spoke to reporters. He said he called Police Chief Li Xi-he to ask about the injured police and anyone who felt sick from the heat. He asked people to be kind to the police who work hard and to keep themselves safe.</p>
