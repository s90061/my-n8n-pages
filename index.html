Many families in the UK are finding it very hard to manage their money. A recent report shows that more people are having financial problems. They are using their savings, taking out loans, or using credit cards more often just to pay for everyday things. Some families are even missing payments for important bills like electricity or rent. This situation is making many people feel very stressed and worried about their future. Experts say that the rising cost of living is the main reason for these difficulties.

**AI Will Change Jobs, Says New Report**

A new report from a group called the OECD says that artificial intelligence (AI) will have a big effect on jobs. The report explains that some jobs might disappear because AI can do the work. However, AI will also create many new jobs. For most workers, AI will change how they do their jobs. This means that people will need to learn new skills to work with AI tools. The report suggests that governments and businesses should help people get the training they need for these future jobs.

**Travelers Choose Slower Journeys**

More and more people are choosing a new way to travel called "slow travel." This means they spend more time in one place, instead of trying to visit many places quickly. Travelers want to experience local life more deeply, eat local food, and learn about the culture. They might stay in one town for a week or two, or use trains and buses instead of flying. This trend is also good for the environment, as it often means less flying and less stress. People are looking for calmer, more meaningful trips instead of rushing around.
