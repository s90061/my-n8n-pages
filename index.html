            <h1>Automation Show Starts on August 20th: Taiwanese Companies Focus on AI Robots</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Robotics and Intelligent Automation Exhibition will happen from August 20th to 23rd. The main focus will be on robots and automation technologies that use Artificial Intelligence (AI). Important companies from Taiwan and other countries will show their new products. These companies are from different areas like parts that make machines move, IT, electric machines, semiconductor equipment, industrial automation, network equipment, and smart manufacturing.</p>
            <p>The group organizing the event, the Taiwan Intelligent Automation and Robotics Association, said that over a thousand companies will join the exhibition. This year's show will include smart manufacturing, manufacturing equipment, key parts, artificial intelligence, smart services, and service robots.</p>
            <p>For smart manufacturing robot technology, the show will display industrial robots and robotic arms, driverless transport vehicles (AGV), machine vision (systems, checking, image processing, 3D models), and AI applications.</p>
            <p>For other types of robots, the show will have robots for defense and safety, home robots, special robots, and robots for education.</p>
            <p>Many companies will be there. These include: parts makers like Hiwin Group, PMI, and TBI MOTION; big IT companies like ASUS and Delta Electronics; large electric machine companies like Teco Electric and Shihlin Electric; air parts company AirTAC; semiconductor equipment maker C-Major; control system company Advantech; industrial automation solution providers like NEXCOM and ADLINK. Also, smart manufacturing equipment makers like Kuang Yu, Horme, and Syntec Technology; industrial communication network equipment company Moxa; and AI 3D vision and robot technology companies like Solomon, Techman Robot, and Taiwan Otto.</p>
            <p>Foreign companies will also join. These include Japan's Mitsubishi Electric, Kawasaki, Fanuc, and Denso. Also, Yaskawa Taiwan, Epson Taiwan, Nachi-Fujikoshi Taiwan, Panasonic Industrial Technology, KUKA Taiwan, Germany's igus, and Siemens.</p>
            <p>Delta Electronics said that their part of the show will be about "AI Powering Sustainable Smart Manufacturing." They will show smart solutions for robots, like robots that work with people and AI sensor parts. They will also show a smart manufacturing line that combines virtual and real parts. And they will show smart solutions for warehouses, shipping, semiconductors, and data centers.</p>
            <p>Teco Electric said their show will focus on "Smart Low-Carbon Manufacturing, Building Smart and Sustainable Places." They will show power system solutions, a demo of multi-legged robots moving, drone motors, and overhead transport vehicles (OHT).</p>
            <p>Moxa said their part of the show will be about "Strong Network Connecting for Green Smart Manufacturing." They will work with partners from Taiwan, Japan, Malaysia, and India. They will show many AI applications and ways to manage carbon in factories better. This includes smart warehouses, AI for predicting when machines need fixing, smart air conditioning for saving energy, managing global production from one control room, and a smart controller made with Saudi Aramco.</p>
            <p>According to the official website, NEXCOM's exhibition will focus on "AI-Powered Stronghold." They will show 7 main things: human-like robot controllers, real-time motion control, enterprise control room 2.0, smart medicine cabinets, industrial internet of things monitoring, augmented reality for mobile robots, and shared solutions for digital twins.</p>
            <p>ADLINK's show this year will be about "Helping Companies Use AI on Their Own and Control Key Smart Systems." They will show Edge AI and smart manufacturing, robots and smart displays, and designs using NVIDIA's platform. They will also show self-moving robots and smart platforms for unmanned vehicles.</p>
            <p>Horme said their show will present many real human-like robots and examples of how they are used in factories and businesses. They will also show a "one-stop business helper" that can do jobs like checking, delivering, cleaning air, and recycling. In addition, they will show smart logistics without people, using different robots for lifting, pulling, and stacking without a driver. These robots will connect to automatic sorting, shipping, and moving goods between warehouses.</p>
            <p>Syntec Group said they will work with their companies LNC Technology and ZP Laser. At the show, they will present a "two-way improvement plan": manufacturing locally plus AI management globally. This includes smart robot solutions, AI solutions for machine tools, electronics, car parts manufacturing, cloud-based ESG factory management, and sustainable production services.</p>

            <h1>At Trump's Request, West Virginia Governor Sends Hundreds of National Guard to Washington D.C.</h1>
            <p>The office of the Governor of West Virginia said today that Governor Patrick Morrisey will send 300 to 400 National Guard members to Washington D.C. This is because President Trump's government asked for them.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the governor's office said in a statement that this action "shows a promise to public safety and working together with other areas." It will provide equipment and special training. And it will "send about 300 to 400 trained people as asked."</p>
            <p>Drew Galang, who speaks for Governor Morrisey, said that West Virginia's National Guard received the order last night. They will send equipment and people to Washington D.C. They are now getting ready for this action.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, Trump said he would send hundreds of National Guard members to Washington D.C. and temporarily take control of the D.C. police department. He said this was to stop what he called a crisis of crime and many homeless people in the capital.</p>
            <p>Officials from the White House said today that more National Guard members will be sent to Washington D.C. They will "protect federal buildings and things, create a safe place for police to do their job when needed, and be clearly visible to stop crime."</p>
            <p>The White House said today that members of the Washington D.C. National Guard are already walking and driving around the National Mall and Union Station. They might carry weapons, but they will not arrest people right now.</p>
            <p>According to information from the U.S. Department of Justice, the rate of violent crime in Washington D.C. in 2024 was the lowest in 30 years. Washington D.C. is a self-governing federal area that is officially controlled by Congress.</p>
            <p>After the Washington D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb started a lawsuit to stop the federal government from taking over the D.C. police department, D.C. officials and the Trump government reached an agreement yesterday. This agreement allows Police Chief Pamela Smith, who was chosen by Mayor Muriel Bowser, to stay in her job.</p>
