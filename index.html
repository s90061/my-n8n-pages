            <h1>Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng Control Their Shouts, Advance to Round of 16 in Denmark Badminton Men's Doubles</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's men's doubles team, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng, also known as the "Cold Current duo," played in the first round of 32 at the BWF Super 750 Denmark Open today. They "controlled their shouts" and won against an Indian team, Roy and Pratheek, with scores of 21-13 and 21-17. This means they successfully moved on to the round of 16.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng are ranked 22nd in the world. Today was their first time playing against Roy (Pruthvi Krishnamurthy Roy) and Pratheek (K. Sai Pratheek), who are ranked 38th in the world.</p>
            <p>In the quarter-finals of the Finland Arctic Open last week, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng were playing against the world's second-ranked Malaysian team. They were about to tie the score in the first game, but they shouted to celebrate before the shuttlecock landed. The main referee took points away from them, and they lost the first game and then the match.</p>
            <p>Liu Kuang-heng spoke to a reporter and smiled, saying, "Today we were more careful. We tried not to celebrate too early. But honestly, not many players wait until the shuttlecock lands to shout and encourage themselves. It really depends on what the main referee thinks."</p>
            <p>In the first game today, both teams played very evenly at the beginning, with the score tied seven times. However, at the technical break when the score was 11-9, the Taiwanese team changed their strategy a little. It worked well, and they won the first game.</p>
            <p>Liu Kuang-heng said, "The shuttlecock moves very fast on this court, which is very different from the game in Finland last week. So during the break, senior partner Po-han and I talked. We decided to hit the shuttlecock with about 60-70% of our power and mainly keep it where we wanted it to go. It was quite successful."</p>
            <p>In the second game, Yang Po-han and Liu Kuang-heng started strongly, leading 11-3. At one point, they had a large lead of 13-3. Even though their opponents tried hard to catch up later, the Taiwanese team still won easily.</p>
            <p>Liu Kuang-heng emphasized, "We don't have any specific goals. We just want to win every match. After losing last week like that, it felt a bit frustrating. We hope to get a good result here in Denmark."</p>

            <h1>Chou Yu-kou Must Pay NT$3.2 Million for Saying "CTi Had the Communist Party Behind It"</h1>
            <p>Tsai Eng-meng, the chairman of Want Want China Times Group, and CTi TV channel were unhappy with media person Chou Yu-kou. She said that CTi was a "red media" and they sued her for money. A court in Taipei first said Chou Yu-kou had to pay NT$2.8 million for breaking an agreement. Today, the Taiwan High Court changed the amount. Now, Chou Yu-kou must pay NT$3.2 million. She can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>In 2017, Chou Yu-kou said that Tsai Eng-meng was a "mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party." She was sued, but then they reached an agreement and dropped the case. However, in 2020, Chou Yu-kou said things like "CTi News channel has the Communist Party behind it" and "Tsai Eng-meng respectfully reported to Wang Yi, who was the head of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and listened to his orders."</p>
            <p>Tsai Eng-meng and CTi TV felt that Chou Yu-kou's actions broke their earlier agreement. So, they filed a civil lawsuit asking for money for breaking the agreement. The Taipei District Court decided that Chou Yu-kou should pay Tsai Eng-meng NT$800,000 and CTi TV NT$2,000,000. Both sides appealed this decision.</p>
            <p>The High Court decided that Chou Yu-kou's statements meant that CTi company had close ties with the Chinese Communist government, and that Tsai Eng-meng was closely connected to the Chinese Communist government and took orders from them. She did not provide proof that she asked Tsai Eng-meng or CTi TV about these things before she said them. This means she broke the agreement and must pay a penalty. The court ordered Chou Yu-kou to pay Tsai Eng-meng NT$800,000 and CTi TV NT$2,400,000. This decision can still be appealed.</p>

            <h1>Army Commander Lu Kun-hsiu Leads Group to U.S. Army Annual Meeting to Study Latest Military Equipment</h1>
            <p>The Association of the U.S. Army's Annual Meeting and Exposition (AUSA 2025) is happening. To learn about how the U.S. military buys weapons and see the newest military equipment, the Army usually sends high-ranking officers. This year, Army Commander General Lu Kun-hsiu is leading the group. Someone also posted on the social media platform X that Lu Kun-hsiu was looking at military equipment at the BAE Systems booth.</p>
            <p>The Association of the U.S. Army's Annual Meeting and Exposition (AUSA 2025) is taking place from October 13 to 15 in Washington D.C. It is the biggest exhibition of army equipment in the world. Many thousands of military experts come to it. It is not just an exhibition; it is also a big platform that connects military leaders, international groups, and people from the industry. It shows the newest equipment, including weapons systems, vehicles, airplanes, unmanned systems, cybersecurity, and logistics.</p>
            <p>The Army usually sends high-ranking generals to attend. For example, in 2023, former Army Commander General Hsu Yen-pu attended. Last year, General Chung Shu-ming, who was the Army Commander at the time and is now the Deputy Minister of National Defense, attended. This year, Army Commander General Lu Kun-hsiu is leading the group. Also, scholars from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research are attending to observe.</p>
            <p>It's important to note that a user on social media platform "X" posted that Lu Kun-hsiu and his group were at the BAE Systems booth. There, staff explained the "Scorpio-XR" 155mm hypersonic shell to them. The user also mentioned that this equipment has a longer range and can hit moving targets more accurately. It can be used to attack enemy landing ships.</p>
            <p>According to the 2025 National Defense Budget report, the Army sent four people to the "U.S. Army Annual Meeting and Exposition." The cost was NT$1,108,000 for a total of 8 days. The purpose is to study how the U.S. military buys weapons, how these systems are changing, and what effects this has on countries that buy military equipment.</p>
