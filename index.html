Justin Bieber, a famous pop star, released his seventh album called "Swag" today. Yesterday, he shared a preview of it online. For many months, his fans were excited about a new album. Now, "Swag" is out, marking the 31-year-old singer's return to music after more than three years. The album quickly became a trending topic on social media, showing how thrilled his fans are.

According to AFP, Justin Bieber's last album, "Justice," came out in 2021. After releasing a song called "Honest" with American rapper Don Toliver the next spring, he was quiet and mostly out of the public eye. In June 2022, Justin Bieber shared that he had Ramsay Hunt Syndrome, which caused part of his face to be paralyzed. Because of this, he had to cancel 82 shows on his world tour.

Yesterday, Justin Bieber posted a video on his Instagram. It showed a large screen in Times Square, New York City, displaying the song list for "Swag." This week, posters for "Swag" also appeared on the streets of Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland. American media reported that Justin Bieber finished the album there in April this year. "Swag" has 21 songs and is 54 minutes long. Justin Bieber worked with American rappers such as Gunna, Lil B, and Cash Cobain on this album. Last August, he and his wife Hailey announced that they had their first child.

**US and Vietnam Disagree on Tariffs: Trump Changed Deal from 11% to 20%**

According to POLITICO, a US political news organization, Vietnam thought it had a first agreement with Washington to lower tariffs a lot. But then, US President Trump suddenly raised the tariffs at the last moment. Last week, Trump said on social media that Vietnam's leader, Nguyen Phu Trong, agreed to the deal. However, four people who know about it said that the Vietnamese government has not officially agreed to the most important parts of the deal. It is unclear if a real agreement was made because neither the US nor Vietnam has released documents about the terms of the deal.

On July 2nd, Trump announced the basic plan of the agreement on "Truth Social." This made it seem like Vietnam was the second country to avoid high tariffs from April 2nd. According to his post, tariffs on goods from Vietnam to the US would drop from 46% to 20%. If goods were not from Vietnam, the tariff would be 40%. At that time, Trump wrote that Vietnam "will open its market to the United States, meaning we will be able to sell American goods to Vietnam with zero tariffs." The four sources said this sudden change caused a big problem in Vietnam. Vietnamese officials who were part of the talks had thought the tariff would be around 11% and had not agreed to 20%. When Trump spoke to Nguyen Phu Trong, who was not part of the early talks, he ignored the 11% and just announced a rate that was almost double.

A person in Washington who works with Vietnam and other Asian governments said some Americans were also very surprised, including groups outside the government who were watching the talks. This person said, "Trump tricked everyone." The Vietnamese government's reaction was described as "surprised, disappointed, and angry." An unnamed White House official disagreed, saying the Vietnamese government knew about the highest tariff before the call. This official said, "My understanding is that both trade teams had almost finished the deal, and then the leaders of both sides made the final decision." However, neither the US nor Vietnam has released any documents showing the tariffs or proving a final agreement. They also haven't officially signed a deal. It is still unclear when this higher tariff will start, or if it will start at all.

**Jie Kou Fintech and Taishan Face Stock Dispute; Chairman Hu Yi-chia Seeks Solution**

Taipei, July 11 (CNA) - A problem has come up because of a disagreement about stock between Jie Kou Fintech and Taishan. Tonight, Hu Yi-chia, the chairman of Jie Kou Fintech, said that even though Jie Kou Fintech has appealed the court's decision, they will quickly try to find a solution with Taishan Company. They hope to solve their differences soon without having to go to court again.

Taishan's new management team said that their decision to invest in Jie Kou Fintech was not valid. They asked for their investment of NT$3.6 billion back, and the court agreed. On July 10, the Taipei court went to seize Jie Kou Fintech's assets, but there was no immediate result. This dispute has also caused people to lose trust in Jiekou Payment. Hu Yi-chia, the chairman of Jie Kou Fintech and founder of Jiekou Payment, spoke on Facebook tonight. He said he was sorry for the recent problems, which came from a civil court decision about Jie Kou Fintech and Taishan that was not expected. This has made the public worried and taken up news space.

Hu Yi-chia also said that Jiekou E-Payment is a financial company watched by the Financial Supervisory Commission. It has strong management rules. All money for users and businesses is handled by a special bank and kept safe. No one at Jiekou can touch it. It is completely safe. He hopes that false rumors will stop, and he thanks many businesses for not being affected by them. He said that even though there are many questions about the first court decision for Jie Kou Fintech, and no matter what the media is trying to do, running a financial company means having more responsibility. Nothing should hurt the trust of users and businesses. So, even though Jie Kou Fintech has appealed, they will immediately work with Taishan Company to find a solution. They hope to settle their differences quickly without more court cases.
