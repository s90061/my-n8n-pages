<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.‚Äôs overseas division plans to issue $10 billion in new stock. This is its largest effort yet to manage foreign exchange fluctuations, according to a company statement. This is the third such deal since 2024, and they have all occurred during periods when the Taiwan dollar tended to become stronger. These actions give TSMC Global‚Äîwhich manages overseas investments and currency hedging‚Äîmore financial flexibility to handle exchange rate risks.

The recent strengthening of the Taiwan dollar has raised concerns in Taipei about the economy‚Äôs heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency experienced its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, prompting Taiwan‚Äôs central bank to call for measures to control speculation.

Philip McNicholas, an Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco in Singapore, explained that increased currency volatility generally means banks might adjust their margin requirements. He added that issuing new shares and injecting immediate cash could help companies manage these requirements for both existing and new hedges.

TSMC, which is the primary chipmaker for companies like Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is Taiwan‚Äôs largest company and exporter, as most of its production is based domestically. A stronger Taiwan dollar negatively impacts exporters because the US dollars they earn from international sales translate into less local currency. Alternatively, they might need to increase their prices abroad, risking a drop in demand.

In June, CEO C. C. Wei informed shareholders that the company‚Äôs operating profit margin had decreased by several percentage points due to the stronger local currency.

**Susquehanna Raised the PT on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM), Keeping a Buy Rating**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/susquehanna-raised-pt-taiwan-semiconductor-205838618.html">News Link</a>

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is recognized as one of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Term. On June 17, Susquehanna increased its price target for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) from $250 to $255, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. This increased price target comes even as the market's positive outlook for AI growth is weakening, and global tariffs combined with geopolitical uncertainties are creating challenges for the company.

The firm noted that recent checks suggest increased demand for AI-related wafer shipments in the second quarter is making up for weaker shipments in the smartphone market. Furthermore, the rise in AI chip demand is a crucial factor driving growth for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), as advanced chips used in AI applications are receiving strong orders, even as traditional consumer electronics like smartphones face a period of slower sales.

Susquehanna also stressed that TSM is likely to remain the sole leading-edge foundry provider until at least 2027, thereby securing its leading market position. Additionally, Ariel Global Fund mentioned Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q1 2025 investor letter, highlighting the company‚Äôs dominant share in the global foundry industry. Despite the recent shift in AI market sentiment, the fund continues to believe the company‚Äôs earnings will benefit from long-term AI trends.

Ariel Global Fund stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q1 2025 investor letter:

‚ÄúTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) shares dropped due to declining confidence in Artificial Intelligence (AI) growth, the impact of tariffs, and global macroeconomic uncertainty. TSMC holds a dominant position in the global foundry market and is a leader in terms of size, technology, customer service, and performance. As such, we expect the company‚Äôs earnings to benefit from long-term AI growth trends. Meanwhile, TSMC is committed to returning capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends.‚Äù

While we acknowledge TSM‚Äôs potential as an investment, we believe some AI stocks offer greater potential for gains and carry less risk of losses. If you are looking for a very undervalued AI stock that could also benefit greatly from Trump-era tariffs and the trend of bringing manufacturing back to the US, please refer to our free report on the best short-term AI stock.
