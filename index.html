            <h1>Federal Reserve Hints at Rate Cut, Global Oil Prices Go Up</h1>
            <p>International oil prices continued to rise today. This happened after Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. central bank (the Federal Reserve), said on August 22 that they might lower interest rates in September. People think that if interest rates go down, it will help the U.S. economy grow. This would also mean people use more oil.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, which is for delivery in October, went up by $1.14. It reached $64.80 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>Also, the price of Brent crude oil from London, for October delivery, went up by $1.07. It reached $68.80 for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Might Visit China Soon, Threatens High Taxes on Goods If No Rare Earth Magnets</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump met South Korean President Lee Jae-myung at the White House. Trump said he might visit China this year or very soon. He also said that if China does not send rare earth magnets to the US, he will put a 200% tax on Chinese products.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump said he thinks he will go to South Korea soon for talks about trade. He also said he would be happy to go to the APEC meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea. This meeting is planned for October 31.</p>
            <p>Trump also said he might visit China this year or soon. He stated, "We will have good relations with China." President Lee Jae-myung also said he wanted to go to China with Trump.</p>
            <p>Trump also mentioned that Chinese students would be allowed to come to the US. He said, "We will get along well with China." However, in May, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said that the US would cancel many visas for Chinese students and check them more carefully.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the US and China had previously agreed not to put very high taxes on each other's goods for a while. But today, Trump said that if China does not do what it promised, the US might raise these taxes again.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that Trump warned he would put a 200% tax on Chinese goods if China does not send more rare earth magnets to the US.</p>
            <p>Trump said, "They must give us magnets. If they do not give us magnets, we will have to put taxes of about 200% on their goods."</p>
            <p>He also said, "But I do not think we will have any problems."</p>
