            <h1>Low-Pressure System Brings Heavy Rain to Hualien and Taitung</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration in Taipei announced a heavy rain warning on July 21st. A low-pressure system is causing short periods of very heavy rain. Today, Hualien County and Taitung County might have local heavy rain or very heavy rain. There is also a chance of local heavy rain on Green Island, Orchid Island, and the Hengchun Peninsula.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration warns people to be careful of lightning, strong winds, and rising river water. Be careful of flooding in low areas. Because it has been raining for many days, people in mountain areas should watch out for landslides, falling rocks, and mudslides. There is still a chance of more heavy rain in northern and northeastern Taiwan.</p>
