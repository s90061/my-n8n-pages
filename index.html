            <h1>Japanese Poll: Sanae Takaichi is Most Popular for New Prime Minister</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, July 22nd, CNA) The ruling parties in Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, did not do well in the recent Upper House election. Because of this, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who is also the head of the LDP, is being held responsible. A new poll by Japanese media shows that if the LDP stays in power, most people think Sanae Takaichi, a former Minister of Economic Security, would be the best prime minister.</p>
            <p>NNN, a Japanese TV news network, and Yomiuri Shimbun did a phone poll on July 21st and 22nd. They asked, "If the LDP-led government continues to rule, who is most suitable to be prime minister?" The results were: Sanae Takaichi, former Minister of Economic Security (26%), then Shinjiro Koizumi, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (22%). The current Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba only got 8%.</p>
            <p>Other results were: Taro Kono, former Digital Minister (7%), Takayuki Kobayashi, Minister of Economic Security (3%), Fumio Kishida, former Prime Minister (2%), Yoko Kamikawa, former Foreign Minister (2%), Toshimitsu Motegi, former LDP Secretary-General (2%), and Katsunobu Kato, Finance Minister (1%).</p>
            <p>The poll also shows that public support for Ishiba's cabinet is 22%, which is 10 percentage points lower than in June. This is the lowest support rate since he became prime minister in October last year. The disapproval rate for Ishiba's cabinet is very high at 67%, which is 14 percentage points higher than in June. This is the highest disapproval rate since he took office.</p>
            <p>In the Upper House election that just finished on July 20th, the two ruling parties, LDP and Komeito, won fewer seats than their goal of 50. Even with the seats that were not up for re-election, they do not have a majority in the Upper House. The poll shows that 54% of people think "the prime minister should resign."</p>
            <p>When people were asked which party they want to govern, 47% said "give power to an opposition-led government," and 35% said "continue with an LDP-led government."</p>
            <p>The same question was asked in a poll after the House of Representatives election in October 2024. At that time, 43% said "the government should continue," and 40% said "change the government."</p>
            <p>This poll also shows that when people were asked "if the government changes, which party would be better to rule," the most common answers were the Democratic Party for the People and the Constitutional Democratic Party, both at 23%.</p>
            <p>After that, the Participation Party got 11%, Japan Innovation Party 9%, Reiwa Shinsengumi 4%, Japan Conservative Party 2%, Team Future 2%, Social Democratic Party 1%, and Communist Party 0%.</p>
            <p>A total of 1,043 people answered this poll. 408 people answered using a landline phone, and 635 people answered using a mobile phone. (Editor: Wei-Hsu) 1140722</p>

            <h1>Cathay Financial Holdings Shows Good Results from Kaohsiung Zone Trial, Sees Hidden Wealth Opportunity in Taiwan</h1>
            <p>(Kaohsiung, July 22nd, CNA) Cathay Financial Holdings today shared the good results from its company's trial business in the Kaohsiung special zone. Cathay Life Insurance said that since July 1st, when they started offering services to wealthy clients, the insurance premiums for cases being reviewed have reached over ten million New Taiwan Dollars. These clients were not on Cathay Life's current list of wealthy people. This means there is a lot of hidden potential for business with rich people in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Financial Supervisory Commission's Asia Asset Management Center in Kaohsiung held a joint opening ceremony today. Taipei Fubon Bank and Cathay United Bank were also invited to share their experiences.</p>
            <p>Cathay Financial Holdings said that the company connects all its resources using its three main parts: banking, insurance, and asset management. Fu Bo-sheng, the head of private banking and wealth management at Cathay United Bank, shared that Cathay United Bank plans to open a new branch in the Kaohsiung zone. This will connect different parts of the company. The trial services include international financial services, loans using financial assets (Lombard Lending), new insurance policy and premium loans, and special investments for family offices.</p>
            <p>Fu Bo-sheng stated that Cathay United Bank will combine its professional experience from Taiwan and other countries, along with shared resources, to meet the varied and international needs of wealthy clients.</p>
            <p>To meet the three main needs of wealthy clients â€“ making money, keeping money safe, passing on wealth, and saving on taxes â€“ Cathay Life has actively joined the Kaohsiung asset management zone. They have created special insurance products just for wealthy clients.</p>
            <p>Cathay Life stated that in less than half a month since they started on July 1st, they have successfully attracted wealthy clients to buy insurance. The premiums for cases currently being reviewed have already gone over ten million NT dollars. These clients were not on Cathay Life's existing list of wealthy people. This shows that Taiwan has a lot of hidden potential for business with high-net-worth individuals.</p>
            <p>After the event, Zheng Shao-kai, the Vice General Manager of Cathay Life Insurance, said that wealthy clients for Cathay Life are defined as those who pay 5 million New Taiwan Dollars or more in annual premiums. Currently, there are nearly 2,000 such clients. They also consider clients who pay 3 million New Taiwan Dollars in annual premiums as "nearly wealthy" clients, and there are about 4,000 of them. In total, they aim for about 6,000 clients. Looking at the cases currently being reviewed, he believes "there are probably more wealthy clients in Taiwan than we thought."</p>
            <p>Zheng Shao-kai pointed out that for the services offered in the special zone, two people have already entered the asset certification stage. Cathay Life aims to reach 450 million New Taiwan Dollars in annual premiums from these special zone services.</p>
            <p>To support the government's plan for the Kaohsiung asset management zone, HSBC (Taiwan) Commercial Bank held a ceremony today at its Lingya branch in Kaohsiung. They announced that the Lingya branch will be HSBC's business location for the Kaohsiung asset management zone. They will use the group's resources to create special products for wealthy clients in Taiwan. (Editor: Yang Kai-xiang) 1140722</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Lands in Northern Vietnam, Authorities Warn of Heavy Rain Causing Landslides and Floods</h1>
            <p>(Hanoi, July 22nd, CNA) Typhoon Wipha landed in northern Vietnam today and became weaker. However, it brought a lot of rain, which could cause floods and landslides. So, the authorities are still being careful.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Vietnam's Central Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting Center said that Wipha was moving towards Vietnam with winds of almost 28 meters per second. But when it landed in Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa provinces this afternoon, its strongest winds had slowed down to about 21 meters per second.</p>
            <p>Wipha is the first typhoon to hit Vietnam this year. Earlier, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh ordered all coastal provinces to be ready. About 350,000 soldiers are now prepared to help.</p>
            <p>Last year, Typhoon Ma-on caused a lot of damage in Vietnam. About 300 people died, and the damage cost 3.3 billion US dollars (around 97 billion New Taiwan Dollars). Because of this, people in the area are worried about Typhoon Wipha.</p>
            <p>The weather forecast says that heavy rain will continue in Vietnam until tomorrow morning. The rainfall could be as much as 500 millimeters. Authorities are telling people to be careful of landslides in the mountains and floods in cities. (Intern translator: Zheng Qiyuan / Editor: Chang Cheng-chien) 1140722</p>
