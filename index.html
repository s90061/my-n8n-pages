            <h1>Russia to Allow Visa-Free Travel for Chinese Tourists</h1>
            <p>The Russian government said on September 29 that Russia and China are working to let Chinese tourists visit Russia without a visa. China started a trial for Russian citizens on September 15, letting them visit for 30 days without a visa. Russian President Putin had also said before that Russia would do the same for Chinese people.</p>
            <p>A Russian news agency, Sputnik, reported on September 29 that Maria Zakharova, a spokesperson for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said Russia and China are thinking about ending visa rules for Chinese visitors. She said that government departments from both countries are talking about it. Zakharova explained, "Departments in both countries are working on this, and we will share a decision when it is ready."</p>
            <p>On September 2, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, announced that from September 15, 2025, China would let Russians visit for 30 days without a visa for one year. Russians with a normal passport can come to China for business, holidays, seeing sights, visiting family or friends, or for exchanges. They can also pass through China for up to 30 days without a visa.</p>
            <p>Guo Jiakun said that the relationship between China and Russia is very good, thanks to the leaders of both countries. China wants to make it easier for people from both countries to travel and meet. This helps the strong friendship between China and Russia. At that time, Russian President Vladimir Putin was visiting China.</p>
            <p>Later, on September 4, Putin said that Russia would also make it easier for Chinese citizens to visit, just like China did for Russians. He said, "Please tell the Chinese leaders and President Xi Jinping, our friend, that Russia will certainly do the same kind of friendly thing. We will also have the same rule."</p>
            <p>Russian news also reported that since China started its visa-free plan for Russians, 50% more Russians want to travel to China. The most popular cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Sanya, and Harbin.</p>

            <h1>After Visiting Tibet and Xinjiang, Xi Jinping Says All Ethnic Groups Should Actively Join the Chinese National Family</h1>
            <p>After visiting Tibet and Xinjiang, the words of Xi Jinping, the leader of the Chinese Communist Party, will be printed tomorrow. He said that all ethnic groups must "actively become part of the big Chinese family." He thinks this is a natural and important step for history. He believes that different groups can have a better future only if they keep working together and becoming one.</p>
            <p>The Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi Jinping's speech, called "The Chinese National Family Growing Together Is What People Want and Is Right for History," comes from a meeting on September 27. Before this, Xi Jinping visited Tibet in August and Xinjiang in September. He also went to events celebrating 60 and 70 years of self-rule in these areas.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that the Chinese nation is a great nation with a history of more than 5,000 years. He said that all ethnic groups in China "worked together to make the country's large land, built a single country with many groups, wrote the great history of China, made the beautiful Chinese culture, and created a strong national spirit."</p>
            <p>He announced that the idea of a "Chinese national family" is "what people want and needs to happen." He said that all groups are connected by blood, which is why the "Chinese national family" has grown. He believes that the Chinese nation is made of many groups who have shared, talked, and mixed for a long time. He stated that only if all groups "keep working together and join the Chinese national family, can they have a better future."</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping also said that all ethnic groups have similar beliefs. This helps the Chinese nation to be a united country with many groups. He said that China's united country "was built by all groups together" and must also be "kept strong and improved by all groups." He added that all groups "share culture," which is part of what makes China's diverse but united culture.</p>
            <p>He claimed that the wonderful Chinese culture was made by all groups together. To make "new great socialist culture," people must "like Chinese culture more and help different cultures learn from each other."</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that all groups need each other for money matters. This makes China's economy strong. He thinks that all areas and groups must "join in the country's overall growth" and work together more in business. This way, they can help the country's economy grow and make their own economies better.</p>
            <p>He said that all groups feel close to each other. This is a strong link for "the Chinese nation as one family." He told all groups to value and keep making "equal, united, helpful, and friendly socialist relationships between ethnic groups." They should also keep building a good feeling among people for "the Chinese national family."</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that in China, "all groups have one common home, which is China. All have one common identity, which is the Chinese nation. All have one common name, which is Chinese people. And all have one common dream, which is to make the Chinese nation great again."</p>

            <h1>Cloud Gate 'Wanderer Project' Selects Six Young Creators Including Liao Jialin</h1>
            <p>The Cloud Gate "Wanderer Project" has reached its 19th year. With help from the Acer Foundation and its boss, Stan Shih, six young artists have been chosen this year. They include designer Liao Jialin. They will each start important trips in 2026.</p>
            <p>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre said today that these six winners are all under 30. They work in different areas such as video, music, buildings, textile art, modern art, and outdoor design. Their projects are about getting well in nature, different cultures, making art, and problems with the environment. This shows that young people are very aware of life and the land, and they are brave.</p>
            <p>One of the chosen artists is Liao Jialin, a designer. She had brain surgery when she was 22 and found strength by climbing mountains. She will travel to New Zealand for a project called "The Body Is a Healing Mountain" to show how nature helps people heal. Yang Kaiting, who helps write and make the TV show "Life Cleaner," will go to Mongolia and Turkey. She will record sounds from special ceremonies and dances to learn about art from different cultures.</p>
            <p>Artist Shi Ziting, travel brand owner Liu Zhanlun, textile artist Deng Shaochen, and architect Lin Xinyu will all connect with the land in their own ways. Their work covers topics from old factory waste to special weaving, and from island cultures to mining areas. Together, they show the many different kinds of journeys these wanderers will take.</p>
            <p>Stan Shih, the boss of the Acer Foundation, calls himself an "old wanderer." He remembers when he was in high school, his mother let him go to Taipei alone for a month. "In the 1960s, traveling from Lukang to Taipei was a very big deal!" Shih believes that "wandering means always going to new places. Your mind starts to work, you get new ideas, and you do more good things for society."</p>
            <p>Cloud Gate said that young people should travel and see new things. This helps them understand the world better and become more creative for the future. Cloud Gate thanked the Acer Foundation for helping the "Wanderer Project" for over 10 years. Since 2004, the project has helped 174 young people discover different cultures and places, giving them more chances in life.</p>
