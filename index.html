            <h1>Taiwan to Receive New Weapons Next Year, Including Mine-Laying Systems and Tanks</h1>
            <p>Taiwan is going to get many important military weapons from the United States next year. This will be a busy time for deliveries. The Ministry of National Defense's budget report shows that Taiwan will receive all 14 Volcano mine-laying systems, the first 2 MQ-9B drones, the last 5 MS-110 pods, 4 MK-48 practice torpedoes, and the last 28 M1A2T tanks. These new weapons will make Taiwan's military much stronger.</p>
            <p>Recently, China has often made threats to Taiwan. They send their planes and ships close to Taiwan's sea and air. Sometimes they cross the middle line of the Taiwan Strait and do military exercises nearby. This causes big problems for peace in the area. Taiwan's military is working hard to train more and make its own weapons. It also buys equipment from other countries to prepare for possible attacks.</p>
            <p>The government's defense budget for 2026, which was given to the parliament on August 29, shows that many important weapons bought from other countries will arrive next year. For the army, this includes 14 Volcano vehicle-mounted mine-laying systems and the last 28 M1A2T tanks. For the air force, the first 2 (out of 4) MQ-9B high-altitude drones will arrive. Also, the last 5 (out of 6) MS-110 new reconnaissance pods for F-16V (blk70) fighter jets will be delivered. For the navy, the first 4 practice torpedoes (out of 24 real torpedoes and 4 practice ones) of the MK-48 long-range heavy submarine torpedoes will come.</p>
            <p>For weapons made in Taiwan, the army will receive 24,534 new T112 rifles next year. This is the main year for delivery (out of 73,049 rifles from 2025 to 2029). For the second stage of tactical short-range drones, 130 will be delivered next year. This is also a main year for delivery (out of 201 drones from 2024 to 2026). For attack drone missile systems, 469 drones that can hurt people will be delivered next year. This is also a main year for delivery.</p>
            <p>For the air force, AIDC will give the military the last 3 Brave Eagle advanced training jets (out of 66 in total). For the navy, there will be 20 amphibious reconnaissance rubber boats (out of 47 from 2026 to 2028). These boats will help with looking at the water near the coast.</p>
            <p>It is important to know that the United States approved selling MK-48 long-range heavy submarine torpedoes to Taiwan in 2017, but they have not arrived yet. After the MK-48 practice torpedoes arrive next year, they will be used by the Hai Lung-class submarines, which have been made better. In the future, Taiwan's own new Hai Kun-class submarines might also use these same torpedoes. This will make Taiwan's underwater fighting power stronger.</p>
            <p>Also, the Volcano mine-laying systems were supposed to be delivered in two parts. The first 7 systems were planned for 2023. But because of delays from the United States, all 14 systems will be delivered at the same time next year.</p>
            <p>Before, some people said that these weapons would make Taiwan an "island of mines." But the army has explained many times that this system is used only "during a war" to block enemy vehicles on beaches. These are anti-tank mines that stop enemy armored cars. They can "move fast," "work quickly," and "have protection." They also "destroy themselves after a set time," "sense metal," and are "easy to find and remove." When they are placed, they are not spread over a very wide area or left for a long time. This helps to prevent soldiers and people from being hurt by mistake.</p>

            <h1>Former Court Clerk Grows Marijuana at Home, Punished by Court</h1>
            <p>A former court clerk named Hsiu, who used to work at the Hualien High Court, grew a marijuana plant at his home in 2024. He also had two bags of marijuana. For this, a court decided to punish him by lowering his job rank by two levels. He can still appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>Court papers explain that Mr. Hsiu worked at the Hualien Branch of the Taiwan High Court from January 2023 to April 2024. In January 2024, he grew one marijuana plant at his house in Hualien County. A friend had asked him to look after it. Then, in February of the same year, he received two bags of marijuana, which is a dangerous drug, from someone on the internet. Police from Hualien County searched Mr. Hsiu's home on March 13, 2024, and found the drugs.</p>
            <p>After the police found the drugs, Mr. Hsiu left his job. When the police were investigating, he admitted that he did these things. The Hualien District Court then gave him a punishment. For having a Class 2 drug, he had to be held for 40 days, but he could pay money instead. For growing marijuana, he was sentenced to prison for 1 year and 2 months. Both of these punishments were put on hold for three years, meaning he would not have to go to prison or be held if he did not commit more crimes during that time. Mr. Hsiu did not try to change the court's decision, so it became final. The Taiwan High Court then sent his case to the Disciplinary Court.</p>
            <p>The Disciplinary Court said that what Mr. Hsiu did made public servants look bad and hurt the good name of the courts. The court thought about how he admitted his mistakes during the police and court processes. They also saw that he was sorry for what he did. They also considered how well he worked during his time as a clerk. After thinking about all these things, they decided to lower his job rank by two levels. He still has the right to appeal this decision.</p>
