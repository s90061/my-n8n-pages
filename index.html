**Thai Political Turmoil: Bill to Legalize Casinos to Be Withdrawn from Parliament**

The Thai government wanted to make gambling legal by allowing casinos. But many people did not agree with this idea. Because of this, the casino bill could not be discussed in Parliament.

Recently, Thailand's politics became unstable after Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was suspended. A private recording was also leaked. Due to these events, the ruling political parties have decided to remove the casino bill from Parliament for now. New government members will review it again.

Gambling is mostly illegal in Thailand today, except for a few things like horse racing. The government hoped that legalizing casinos would bring more money and attract more tourists. However, a survey showed that most people in Thailand are against this plan.
