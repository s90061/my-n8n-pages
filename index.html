Many people are still finding it difficult to afford everyday things, even though prices are not rising as quickly as before. A recent report shows that families are feeling the pressure of high prices, especially for food and household goods. This means people are being more careful with their money.

They are often choosing to buy only what they really need and are spending less on things like entertainment or new clothes. This shows that the higher prices from before are still making daily life expensive. It is a big challenge for households trying to manage their budgets.

**AI Is Changing the Future of Work**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is quickly changing how we work, according to a new report from the World Economic Forum. AI tools can help people do their jobs better and faster, which might lead to new and improved ways of working. However, this also means that some traditional jobs might change or even disappear.

The report suggests that workers will need to learn new skills to keep up with these changes. Companies will also need to help their employees adapt to new technologies. While AI brings challenges, it also offers many opportunities to create new types of jobs and make work more efficient.

**Too Many Tourists: The Challenge for Sustainable Travel**

Many popular tourist destinations are struggling with "overtourism" – having too many visitors. A recent article highlights that this problem can harm local environments and make daily life difficult for people living there. For example, Venice and Amsterdam have faced challenges because of large crowds.

To solve this, more places are looking for ways to make travel more sustainable. This means encouraging visitors to be respectful of local cultures and nature, choosing less crowded times to visit, and supporting businesses that help the local community. The goal is to make sure tourism benefits everyone – both visitors and the people who live in these beautiful places.
