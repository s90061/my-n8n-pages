        const text = `**Oil Tankers Near Iran Appear in Rural Russia as Signals Jammed**

An oil tanker, the Front Tyne, was traveling through the Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates on Sunday when, shortly after 9:40 a.m., ship-tracking data showed its position jumping over 2,500 kilometers north to a rural area in central Russia. This unusual event suggests that the ship's satellite navigation system was likely interfered with.

Incidents of suspected GPS jamming and spoofing have become more frequent in the Black Sea and around the Baltic region, especially since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This interference can make it difficult to determine a vessel's true location. The United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) has previously warned about GPS interference incidents in various areas, including the Persian Gulf, where such attacks could potentially affect navigation systems and communications.

**AMD, Palantir Soar as Tech Rebounds on Iran De-Escalation**

Shares of Palantir Technologies and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) significantly increased on Monday, leading a broad recovery across the technology sector. This rebound occurred as investors shifted their focus away from recent tensions in the Middle East, particularly involving Iran.

The stock market had previously seen declines and oil prices had risen due to escalating conflicts, including strikes between Israel and Iran. However, as signals emerged suggesting a de-escalation of these tensions, investor confidence in the tech sector, especially in companies like Palantir and AMD, grew. This indicates that the market is sensitive to geopolitical developments and tends to react positively when such risks appear to lessen.
