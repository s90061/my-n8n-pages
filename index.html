            <h1>Yageo: Shibaura Electronics Officially Supports Tender Offer, Period Extended to Oct 3</h1>
            <p>Yageo (2327), a big company that makes electronic parts, has made good progress in buying Japan's Shibaura Electronics. Japanese news reported last night that Shibaura Electronics supports Yageo's offer to buy its shares. Yageo said in a press release last night that it thanks Shibaura Electronics for officially supporting its offer and telling shareholders to take part.</p>
            <p>Yageo explained that because of important changes and rules in Japan, the process for buying shares must be 10 days longer. It will now end on October 3rd. This is to make sure shareholders have enough time to think carefully about this positive change and finish the selling process.</p>
            <p>Japanese news said that Shibaura Electronics announced yesterday its support. It believes that Yageo's offer to buy shares will bring benefits, like stronger business overseas and more types of products. Today, Shibaura Electronics also officially announced its support for Yageo's offer.</p>
            <p>Japanese media also said that Yageo and Shibaura Electronics agreed yesterday that after Yageo finishes buying the shares, Shibaura Electronics will stay a separate company. Yageo will respect Shibaura Electronics' right to run its own business as much as possible. Both companies also agreed that Shibaura Electronics will keep its current employees.</p>
            <p>Yageo said last night that they had good talks and worked together well for several months. This was key to Shibaura Electronics changing its mind and supporting the offer.</p>
            <p>Yageo said it is happy that Shibaura Electronics fully agrees on the benefits they can achieve together. Yageo also believes that this cooperation will create a better future for Shibaura Electronics and its employees.</p>
            <p>Yageo officially started offering to buy Shibaura Electronics shares for 6200 Japanese Yen per share on May 9th. During this time, Yageo changed the deadline for buying shares several times. To compete with Japan's Minebea Mitsumi, Yageo announced on August 23rd that it would increase its offer price for Shibaura Electronics shares to 7130 Japanese Yen per share.</p>
            <p>On September 2nd, Yageo said it had received approval for foreign investment in Japan. It expects to finish the process in the third quarter of the year.</p>
            <p>Based on information, Shibaura Electronics mainly makes NTC thermistors (parts that sense temperature) and sells sensors for temperature, humidity, and wind speed.</p>
