Amazon has unveiled Rufus, a new AI-powered shopping assistant designed to help customers make more informed purchasing decisions. Rufus, currently in beta testing for select users, can answer detailed questions about products, compare different items, and suggest the best products based on specific needs and preferences. The assistant draws its knowledge from Amazon's extensive product catalog, customer reviews, and information available online.

This marks a significant step forward in Amazon's integration of artificial intelligence into the shopping experience. Instead of simply searching for items, users can now engage in a conversation with Rufus to clarify details and receive personalized recommendations. Early testers have praised the assistant for its ability to sift through vast amounts of information and present relevant options quickly. Amazon hopes Rufus will improve customer satisfaction and ultimately drive sales. The company plans to roll out the feature to a wider audience in the coming months.

South Koreaâ€™s K-pop industry, known for its elaborate music videos and physical albums, is starting to address its environmental impact. Concerns have been raised about the excessive use of plastic in packaging, the frequent release of multiple album versions to boost sales, and the energy consumption associated with producing and distributing music.

Several initiatives are underway to promote more sustainable practices. Some record labels are experimenting with eco-friendly packaging materials, reducing the amount of plastic used, and offering digital-only album options. Fan groups are also organizing recycling drives and advocating for more responsible practices from entertainment companies. While the industry still has a long way to go, these initial steps suggest a growing awareness of the need for change and a commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. The shift reflects a broader trend in South Korea toward greater environmental consciousness.
