<p><b>New Taiwan Dollar Jumps in Early Trading, Now in a Fight</b></p>

<p>Taipei, June 30 (CNA) â€“ Today, the stock market in Taiwan went down by over 100 points. However, the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) showed a different trend in the foreign exchange market. It got stronger because exporters needed to sell foreign money at the end of the month.</p>

<p>Soon after the market opened, the NTD went past 29.1 to one US dollar. It reached its highest point of the morning, going up by 0.132 to 29.048. Later, its rise slowed down, and it moved between 29.09 and 29.1.</p>

<p>The NTD's value has changed a lot this year. In early April, it fell to 33.196. But then it started to get stronger and reached 29. On June 27, it even touched 28 during the day, but the central bank made it go back to 29.18 by the end of the day.</p>

<p>Currency experts said that because Taiwanâ€™s exports have been good in the first half of the year, companies that export goods need to exchange their foreign money for NTD. This makes the NTD stronger. Experts also expect that if the currency market becomes too messy, the central bank might step in again later today to control it.</p>

<p>The central bank explained that the NTD has been strong recently because the US dollar is weaker in international markets. Also, Taiwanâ€™s economy is doing well, especially with the high demand for AI and other new technologies. This strong performance in high-tech exports also helps the NTD get stronger.</p>

<p><b>Before UN Meeting, Protesters Ask for Debt Help and Climate Focus</b></p>

<p>Seville, June 29 (CNA) â€“ Today, activists walked the streets in the heat in southern Spain. They were asking for countries' debts to be cancelled, for climate fairness, and for very rich people to pay more taxes. This happened before a big United Nations meeting about how to pay for sustainable development. However, some people who criticize the meeting say it does not have enough big ideas or goals.</p>

<p>Reuters reported that the fourth UN meeting on financing for development will start tomorrow in Seville, Spain, and last for four days. This meeting happens every 10 years. Its goal is to make plans to help with problems like poverty, sickness, and climate change around the world. But because the United States decided not to come, and rich countries are not giving much money for aid, many people do not expect the meeting to make big changes.</p>

<p>Members of Greenpeace used a protest prop that showed a rich person, Elon Musk, as a baby with a saw, sitting on the Earth. Other people held signs that said things like "Make Human Rights Great Again," "Tax Justice Now," or "Polluters Pay."</p>

<p>Beauty Narteh from Ghana's Anti-Corruption Coalition said her group wants a fairer tax system and asks for "dignity, not charity."</p>

<p>Sokhna Ndiaye from the Africa Development Interchange Network asked both governments and private companies to be "less selfish and show more unity with developing countries."</p>

<p>However, Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sanchez, said a few hours earlier, "The fact that this meeting is happening while there are many conflicts globally gives us hope."</p>

<p>At an event by the group "Global Citizen," Sanchez repeated that Spain will give 0.7% of its country's income for development aid. He asked other countries to do the same.</p>

<p>Jason Braganza, who is in charge of AFRODAD, a group from Africa that works on debt and development, was part of talks for the meeting's final plan. He said that countries like the US, the EU, and the UK stopped efforts to create a UN rule about government debt.</p>

<p>Braganza added, "It is sad that these countries choose to protect their own interests and the interests of those who lend money, instead of helping to save lives that are being lost."</p>

To help with the country's needs, 40 more spots have been added for electrical, information, and engineering fields, which are part of the "five major trusted industries." In total, 201 students will be chosen across 19 study areas.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education said in a statement today that these scholarships help train highly skilled people, give young students a broader view of the world, and improve their professional knowledge. The exam information is now available. Students must take the written test and an in-person interview; online interviews are not offered.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Education, for the 2025 exam, there are 92 study areas in 19 groups. 201 students will be chosen. This includes 151 general scholarship students, 10 for excellent students who need help, 20 for Indigenous students, 10 for students with disabilities, and 10 for students going to New Southbound countries (India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam).</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education added that to support the country's development, the 2025 exam will offer 40 more spots in fields linked to the "five major trusted industries," such as electrical, information, and engineering. This brings the total for these fields to 64 spots.</p>

<p>The exam includes a Chinese essay and two specialized subjects, making it three tests in total. Registration will be open from July 15, 8:00 AM, to July 29, 5:00 PM. The written exam will be on October 4, and interviews will be on December 6 and 7. The results will be announced on December 31.</p>

<p>Students who get the scholarship to study abroad for humanities can receive money for up to 4 years, and those studying science or engineering can get it for up to 3 years. The money for living costs changes based on the city they study in, with general students getting up to US$25,000 per year. The three types of special students will get a bit more money for living costs. For school fees, students who receive aid for 4 years can get up to US$120,000 in total, and those for 3 years can get up to US$90,000.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education also said that these scholarships are usually for Ph.D. degrees. However, for some areas in "Art" and "Architecture, Planning, and Design," students can get a Master's degree. For the three types of special students and those going to New Southbound countries, they can choose to get either a Master's or a Ph.D. degree in any study area.</p>
