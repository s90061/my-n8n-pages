            <h1>Nazi Symbols Found in US Republican Office; Police are Investigating</h1>
            <p>This week, two incidents involving Nazi symbols happened with the Republican Party in the United States. Police in the Capitol building are looking into a US flag that had its stripes changed into Nazi symbols. This flag was seen in the office of a federal representative. Also, messages from a group chat of a young Republican organization were shown on October 14. These messages included phrases like "I love Hitler," which made many people angry.</p>
            <p>Nazi symbols are very sensitive, and many countries do not allow them. But a US flag with Nazi symbols was hanging in the office of Dave Taylor, a Republican federal representative from the US.</p>
            <p>The event started when Angelo Elia, who works for Dave Taylor, had a video meeting yesterday. Behind him, on the wall, was a small American flag with Nazi symbols instead of its usual stripes. Next to it were a copy of the US Constitution and a calendar from Congress.</p>
            <p>Pictures from the meeting were shared on the same day. Later, Taylor put out a statement on his official website saying he was very upset. He said, "This does not show what my office, my staff, or I believe in. I strongly say this is wrong." He has started a complete investigation with the Capitol Police Department, and it is still happening.</p>
            <p>More strange information about this event came out this afternoon. Chad Pergram, a reporter for Fox News who covers Congress, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that people who knew about it said the flag had a hidden Nazi symbol in its design. What was strange was that the symbol was hard to see normally but became clearer in videos or photos.</p>
            <p>Pergram said one person called it an "optical illusion," meaning it looked different depending on how you saw it. Another person said the symbol was "easy to miss." Earlier this year, many offices in Congress got these kinds of flags from unknown groups.</p>
            <p>On Monday, another event related to Nazi symbols happened with the Republican Party. Politico, a US political news website, showed private messages from a group of leaders in "Young Republicans" across the US. These messages had racist comments and praised Hitler.</p>
            <p>Several Republican politicians have spoken out against this. For example, Michael Lawler, a Republican Congressman from New York, wrote on social media that he was "disgusted by the hateful anti-Jewish and racist words in these messages."</p>
            <p>Elise Stefanik said that Republican officials have condemned the behavior and made people responsible. She also said the Democratic Party was "making a big deal" out of it and called the news reports "bad articles" trying to make them look bad.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that US Vice President JD Vance seemed to not take the leaked messages from the Young Republicans group very seriously on the "Charlie Kirk Show" podcast yesterday. He said they were "mean, offensive jokes" made by "young people."</p>
            <p>The "Young Republican National Committee" is a political group for Americans between 18 and 40 years old. After this happened, the committee posted on social media that they were shocked by the "terrible and unforgivable words" in the leaked messages. They said that this kind of behavior does not fit what any Republican should be like. They also asked the people involved to leave their positions in their local groups.</p>

            <h1>Good Morning World: NT$10,000 Cash Payout Starts Early November, First Payments Direct to Bank Accounts</h1>
            <p>The government plans to give everyone 10,000 New Taiwan Dollars (NTD). This plan will be approved by the Legislature on the 17th. On the 16th, Minister of Finance Chuang Tsui-yun said that people can get the money in five ways: directly into their bank account, by signing up online, at an ATM, at a post office, or through a special list. The Ministry of Finance plans to start giving out the money in early November. Those who chose to have the money sent directly to their bank account will get it first. Also, the police have received two reports of people being tricked out of money because of this plan. About 560,000 NTD has been stolen. People should only use official government websites that end with .gov.</p>
            <p>Over 1.2 billion NTD has been collected to help people after the Hualien Mataian River flood. The first round of help money is now being given out. The second round, which is about helping people with their daily lives, has also begun. On the 16th, the Disaster Relief Foundation shared details about this help. Families who are struggling and families of people who were hurt or died in the disaster can get money every month for 12 months. Struggling families can get 30,000 NTD, and families of victims can get 25,000 NTD. This money will be paid all at once for the 12 months. Also, a typhoon named Fengshen might form soon. Ji Liancheng, from the Central Emergency Response Coordination Center, said they will watch the rain and river levels. People will be moved out of danger in three steps. To make sure everyone knows the rules, volunteers cannot go into the disaster area starting on the 18th.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration says that until October 18, it will be hot during the day across Taiwan. In the western part of Taiwan, it will be about 33 to 35 degrees Celsius. In the eastern part, it will be 31 to 32 degrees Celsius. There will only be short rain in areas like Keelung North Coast, the mountains of Greater Taipei, eastern Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula. A tropical storm in the south is expected to get stronger on the 17th and become Typhoon Fengshen on the 18th. This typhoon will mix with the northeast wind. Because of this, some parts of Taiwan will have a lot of rain from the 19th to the 21st. Northern Taiwan, Yilan, and Hualien should be ready for heavy rain.</p>
            <p>TSMC, a company that makes computer chips, held an online meeting with investors on the 16th. The boss, C.C. Wei, said that because more people want AI products than expected, the company's sales in US dollars might grow by almost 35% in 2025. This is the second time TSMC has raised its sales prediction this year; they raised it to 30% in July. TSMC also announced that in the third quarter, their profit margin was 59.5%, which is 0.9% higher than in the second quarter. The company made a record profit of 452.3 billion NTD for its main shareholders. Wei also said that they will start making 2-nanometer chips as planned in the fourth quarter, and these chips will sell very well next year.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump put high taxes on products from India because India did not stop buying oil from Russia. This made the plan for the US and India to work together against China harder. On October 15, Trump said that Indian Prime Minister Modi promised him that India would stop buying oil from Russia. Trump also said he would then try to convince China to do the same. However, India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not clearly say anything about this. They only said that they buy oil that is best for Indian people. But they did mention that the US wants to work more closely with them on energy.</p>
            <p>The New York Times reported that the United States uses a lot of medicine made with parts from China. A study found that for some common medicines like antibiotics and drugs for heart problems, seizures, cancer, and AIDS, China is the only country that provides at least one important chemical part. Making these chemicals can pollute the environment. Also, it costs more to make them in the US because of labor and other expenses, so it is not profitable. Because of this, the US has almost no factories that make these chemicals. Experts are worried that this reliance could put American patients in danger, especially if there is a trade war or another pandemic. This could make China stop selling these important parts again.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that China's missiles are getting better very quickly. The US military is making its base in Guam much stronger. This is to stop military action against Taiwan and to get ready for any fighting in the Taiwan Strait. Guam is closer to Beijing than Hawaii, which is also US land. Now, Guam is a very important military spot in the Pacific. Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung said on the 16th that this is surely because China's army is getting bigger. He believes this is important for the Taiwan Strait and other areas along the first island chain. Taiwan will work with other countries that have similar ideas to keep the area peaceful.</p>
            <p>The Frankfurt Book Fair has begun, with over a thousand writers and publishers from 92 countries. The Taiwan Pavilion showed works by six important writers. Their stories were about spirits and ghosts, which are big parts of Taiwan's culture. These stories interested people from all over the world and made publishers want to talk about what "ghost" culture means. For example, in a book called "The Entropy Island of Gods," the poet Wu Huai-chen used old stories to describe the first ideas about life in Taiwan. Hsiao Wei-hsuan, who writes crime novels, looked at the hidden parts of human nature, seeing "ghosts" as a reflection of what is inside people's hearts.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing a case about Jinghua City. Ying Hsiao-wei, who is one of the people accused and was out on bail, was accused on the 9th of bothering a witness from the city's urban development office during questioning. The court quickly called Ying Hsiao-wei to explain. The lawyers for the government said Ying Hsiao-wei used her power as a council member to put pressure on the witness. Ying Hsiao-wei said she did not mean to do it and only wanted to tell the mayor, Chiang Wan-an, to fix problems in the city government and not to record without permission. The judges in the court decided that what Ying Hsiao-wei said could have affected what the witness said. So, they made her pay another 5 million NTD to stay out of jail.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's High Speed Rail has had "quiet train cars" for more than three weeks. During this time, they have given advice to people over 17,000 times. On the 16th, the High Speed Rail company said that babies, small children, and people who cannot control themselves because of sickness will not be told off. From now on, staff will just gently remind and guide these passengers. Other countries' train systems also have different rules. For example, Belgium tried "quiet zones" where people could not talk, had to turn off phone sounds, and had to use headphones for music, videos, or social media. This worked well, and they made more quiet zones last year. In France, people who want quiet can choose first-class or business seats. Parents with children can choose special family areas.</p>

            <h1>Former US National Security Advisor Bolton Charged with Wrongly Handling Secret Information</h1>
            <p>John Bolton, who used to be the US National Security Advisor, has been charged today with "wrongly handling secret information." He faces 18 criminal charges, which include sharing and having national defense information. Mr. Bolton has worked in Washington for a long time. During Trump's first time as president, he was a strong supporter of using force and believed in a tough foreign policy.</p>
            <p>The charge document, which is 26 pages long, says that Mr. Bolton "used his power as National Security Advisor in a wrong way." While he worked at the White House, dealing with America's most sensitive military, spy, and international matters, he often sent more than 1,000 pages of "diary-like notes" to two people who were "close to him" but were not allowed to see this information.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors say that much of this information was marked as "Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information," which means it was highly secret. Politico, a news website, reported that each of the 18 charges could lead to up to 10 years in prison. Judges usually follow rules when deciding sentences, so the actual time in prison is often much less than the maximum.</p>
            <p>The US Justice Department had already started to investigate if Mr. Bolton's book, which he wrote after leaving the White House, used government secrets in an illegal way. Today, they showed the case to a grand jury, a group of people who decide if there is enough evidence for a trial. The grand jury decided there was enough evidence to charge Mr. Bolton. About two months ago, the FBI searched Mr. Bolton's home and office, which surprised many in American politics.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bolton has not said anything yet, but he has said before that he did nothing wrong. His lawyer, Abbe Lowell, told several American news groups today that "the basic facts of this case were looked into and solved many years ago. These charges come from parts of Mr. Bolton's personal notes from his 45 years of work."</p>
            <p>Lowell said that these notes were not secret and were only shared with his close family. The FBI knew about this in 2021.</p>
            <p>This event is an important moment in the 76-year-old Mr. Bolton's long career in government.</p>
            <p>He worked in the Justice Department when Ronald Reagan was president. He also managed arms control at the State Department when George W. Bush was president.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bolton strongly supported going to war in Iraq and often said the US should go to war with Iran and North Korea. People had different opinions about his strong style. George W. Bush even had to ignore the Senate to make him the US Ambassador to the United Nations.</p>
            <p>In 2018, Mr. Bolton was chosen to be President Trump's third National Security Advisor. But during his short time in this job, he disagreed with Trump about things like North Korea, Iran, and Ukraine. In the end, Trump fired him on social media. Mr. Bolton quickly replied on social media, saying he chose to quit.</p>
            <p>Later, in his book from 2020, "The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir," Mr. Bolton criticized Trump's foreign policy and how his government worked.</p>
            <p>Trump replied by calling Mr. Bolton a "crazy person who wants war." He said Mr. Bolton would make the US fight "World War VI." Trump also said Mr. Bolton's book had very secret information and was published without permission.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bolton is now the third person who has criticized Trump to be charged in the last few weeks. Before him, James Comey, who used to be the head of the FBI, and Letitia James, who is the Attorney General of New York State, were also charged.</p>
            <p>Today, a reporter asked Trump at the White House what he thought about Mr. Bolton being charged. Trump said he didn't know but then added, "I think he's a bad person."</p>
