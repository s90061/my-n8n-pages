            <h1>Israeli Army Reportedly Attacks Near Damascus from the Air, First Time Since Syria's Government Changed</h1>
            <p>Syrian state news said today that the Israeli army attacked an area near Damascus, the capital of Syria, last night. This attack came after Israeli forces had bombed the place several times.</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP reported that Israel did not say if they did the attack. But Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, said that the Israeli army acts "in all battle areas" to keep the country safe.</p>
            <p>If this attack is confirmed, it would be the deepest attack by air into Syria by Israel since a group of Islamists took control of Damascus in December last year.</p>
            <p>Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Israeli planes attacked an area near Kisweh, outside Damascus, on August 26. Six Syrian soldiers died in that attack. State TV also reported that Israeli planes bombed the same area again last night.</p>
            <p>After the second attack yesterday, the Syrian news agency SANA reported that Israel sent soldiers by air to attack the area.</p>
            <p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that weapons used by Hezbollah, a group from Lebanon, are stored there. Hezbollah is supported by Iran. It was a main friend of Syria's former president, Bashar al-Assad, who was removed from power.</p>
            <p>Also, both Israel and the Houthi group, who are rebels in Yemen, said that the Israeli army attacked Sanaa today. Sanaa is the capital of Yemen and is controlled by the Houthi group. Four days ago, the Israeli army had already carried out a deadly bombing against the Houthi group.</p>
            <p>The Houthi group said that Israel's air attack on Sanaa on August 25 killed 10 people and injured more than 90.</p>

            <h1>Sinner Wins Easily in Three Sets to Reach US Open Third Round, Moving Closer to Second Straight Title</h1>
            <p>Jannik Sinner, the tennis player from Italy, won his second match at the US Open men's singles. He kept his strong performance from the first round. He won against Alexei Popyrin from Australia in three straight sets. Sinner is now trying to win the championship again.</p>
            <p>AFP news agency reported that Sinner, who is 24 years old, only lost 4 games in his first match against Vit Kopriva from the Czech Republic. Kopriva is ranked 89th in the world for men's singles.</p>
            <p>In today's second round, Sinner broke Popyrin's serve five times. Popyrin is ranked 36th in the world. Sinner won in just 2 hours and 1 minute with scores of 6-3, 6-2, and 6-2.</p>
            <p>In the third round, Sinner will play against Denis Shapovalov from Canada. Shapovalov is the 27th seeded player in this tournament.</p>
            <p>After the match, Sinner said, "I always try to play my best. The first round is always different from later matches."</p>
            <p>"I am happy that I played well. When you have won two sets and break serve again, you just need to serve well."</p>
            <p>"Today, my serve and my opponent's serve were not perfect. But my return game was good, especially on the second serve. I am happy today. I hope to make my serve better in the next games. For other parts of my game, I feel very confident."</p>
            <p>Before this US Open, Sinner reached the finals in the three Grand Slam tournaments this season. He won the Australian Open and Wimbledon. However, he lost to Carlos Alcaraz from Spain in the French Open final and finished second.</p>
            <p>He is trying to be the next player to win the US Open men's singles title twice in a row, after Roger Federer. Federer, a famous tennis player from Switzerland, won the US Open five times in a row from 2004 to 2008.</p>

She won and moved to the next round after three sets. Naomi Osaka from Japan won her match easily in two straight sets.</p>

            <p>Also, Naomi Osaka, who has won the US Open women's singles title twice before, won her match today in just 70 minutes. She easily beat Hailey Baptiste from the US, who is ranked 47th in the world. The scores were 6-3 and 6-1.</p>
