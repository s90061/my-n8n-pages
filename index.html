            <h1>SpaceX Starship's 10th Test Flight Canceled, Another Problem for Musk's Rocket</h1>
            <p>Billionaire Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, has again canceled a test flight of its huge Starship rocket today. This is the latest in a series of problems after some rockets exploded.</p>
            <p>SpaceX announced on social media platform X that the 10th Starship test flight, which was planned for today, has been stopped. This is to allow time to fix a problem with the equipment on the ground. The rocket was supposed to take off from Starbase, a spaceport in southern Texas.</p>
            <p>The Super Heavy booster, which is about 70 meters tall, and the upper part of the Starship, which is about 52 meters tall, were already on the launchpad at SpaceX's Starbase. They were being filled with fuel. The launch was planned for 7:35 PM Eastern Time (7:35 AM Taiwan time) tonight.</p>
            <p>However, about 30 minutes before the planned launch time, SpaceX announced on X that the mission was canceled.</p>
            <p>SpaceX did not say when they will try the next test flight. But in the past, when flights were canceled suddenly, the problems were usually solved within a few days.</p>

            <h1>Taiwanese-Canadian MP Han Dong: Taiwan is a Key Part for Canada to Grow Trade</h1>
            <p>The autumn session of the Canadian Parliament will start soon. Han Dong, a 39-year-old Member of Parliament (MP) of Taiwanese origin, said that the ruling Liberal Party will focus on dealing with trade threats from the United States and finding more markets overseas. He said Taiwan is an important part of Canada's trade market. He will also actively work to connect Taiwan and Canada to create more chances for cooperation.</p>
            <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney recently visited Europe to make Canada's relationship with Europe stronger. MP Han Dong, who is part of the ruling Liberal Party, said that Carney has visited Europe four times since he became Prime Minister in March. This is because the relationship between Canada and the United States has changed a lot under US President Donald Trump. Canada is working hard to talk with the US about trade agreements, but it is also actively looking for more markets outside North America.</p>
            <p>He said, "Both Europe and Asia have huge potential for trade. Everyone knows it's not good to put all your eggs in one basket, but in the past, Canada was not active enough and always relied on the United States. Now, this has completely changed."</p>
            <p>As a Taiwanese-Canadian MP, Han Dong praised Taiwan's strong technology and trade. He said they are very important in the Asia-Pacific market. He believes Taiwan is a key piece for Canada to expand its trade around the world. He will work to improve the relationship between Taiwan and Canada. He said, "I know both languages and cultures. I am happy to help build bridges and connect both sides for practical exchanges and cooperation in many areas, such as religion, culture, education, trade, and technology."</p>
            <p>Han Dong is the MP for the Burnaby Central area in British Columbia, Canada. Burnaby City is one of the main technology centers in British Columbia. Its important industries include information and communication technology, biotechnology and medicine, film and digital entertainment, new media, renewable energy, and clean technology.</p>
            <p>Han Dong mentioned that well-known companies like TELUS (a telecom company) and Ballard Power (a company that makes batteries for electric cars) are located in Burnaby City. Also, famous schools like Simon Fraser University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT) are there.</p>
            <p>He gave an example, saying he recently visited BCIT. He found that the institute has many unique research results. For example, they have made big advances in areas like car electricity, AI robots, and modular housing. He thinks these technologies are very suitable for creating business opportunities by working with Taiwan. He added, "Canada has a lot of clean energy technology and important mineral resources. It can be a very good partner for Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Han Dong was born in Yilan, Taiwan. He moved to Canada with his family when he was in the 6th grade. After finishing high school in Canada, he earned a law degree from the University of Melbourne in Australia and an MBA from Oxford University in the UK. He is a qualified lawyer in Canada and Australia and knows a lot about international business law.</p>
            <p>Even though he left Taiwan when he was young, he has kept a close relationship with his family and friends there for many years. Han Dong said, "Taiwan will always be my origin. I am proud to have grown up with the humanistic education of both Taiwan and Canada because these two places really care about freedom, inclusion, and equality. From being a lawyer to now being an MP, I want to do my best to help society be more equal, progressive, and harmonious."</p>
            <p>Han Dong won his first political election, which surprised and made many overseas Taiwanese people proud. Xu Guangcheng and Lin Jiatian, a married couple, changed from being just voters to volunteer supporters for Han Dong. Lin Jiatian said, "I was his senior at school and live in the same area, so I wanted to help him at first. During the election, I found that he was very serious, knocking on doors every day to ask for votes. Even now, when he comes back to Burnaby from Ottawa, he still keeps the habit of knocking on doors and saying hello to people."</p>
            <p>Lin Jiatian also said, "Everyone knows that Taiwan's international situation is quite difficult, so having an MP of Taiwanese origin makes us very proud."</p>
            <p>Being an MP is a big responsibility. It means constantly traveling between Ottawa and Burnaby, helping voters, studying new laws, and understanding how Parliament works. The Parliament will start again in September, and Han Dong has a very busy schedule. He interacts with voters during the day and studies laws and parliamentary rules at night. He also makes time to learn French.</p>
            <p>Canada is a country with two official languages, English and French. Although MPs are not required to know both languages perfectly, Han Dong was a top student when he was younger. He hopes to learn more languages to provide even better service to his voters.</p>
            <p>Recently, Han Dong organized a summer BBQ event to meet and talk with people. Many young people came to support him. Many second-generation Taiwanese-Canadians said that Han Dong is their role model. He encourages them to join community service, and they hope to become important people in the future relationship between Taiwan and Canada.</p>
