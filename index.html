            <h1>Emergency Center Halts Meetings to Help with Heavy Rain Rescue Efforts</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, August 2nd, Central News Agency) Because of stronger southwestern winds, Tainan, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung cities have had very heavy rain since early this morning. Many coastal areas in Tainan are flooded, and roads are closed. The Executive Yuan's disaster recovery office said that their meetings for the next two days are stopped. Instead, they will help with rescue work in different areas. They also told Tainan to check roofs covered with tarpaulins, in case they come off or leak again.</p>
            <p>Li Meng-yen, who is in charge of the emergency office, said in a press release today that the southwestern winds quickly appeared late last night. It was hard to see them on radar maps. This is typical for southwestern winds, which create rain very quickly and heavily. It can rain more than 100 millimeters in one hour. This amount of rain is usually too much for current water drainage systems.</p>
            <p>Li Meng-yen explained that Tainan city was hit by Typhoon Danas and then by heavy rain. About 26,000 homes were damaged, mostly their roofs. So, the Tainan city government should pay special attention to temporary tarpaulin covers. They need to check if these covers come off or leak because of continuous strong winds and heavy rain. They also need to check on and help older people living alone.</p>
            <p>Li Meng-yen also said that if local areas need things like water pumps, help from the military, or supplies, the Tainan city government should tell the emergency office right away. The office will work hard to arrange this help.</p>
            <p>The office said that meetings planned for today in Tainan's Liuying, Dongshan, Madou, Xiaying, and Liujia areas, and for tomorrow in Houbi and Baihe areas, will be postponed. The office will fully focus on helping local areas with rescue work. (Edited by Chang Ruo-yao) 1140802</p>

            <h1>First Discovery of New Neoparadoxia Fossil in Japan, Fourth in the World, Over 14 Million Years Old</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, August 2nd, Central News Agency) A research team in Japan recently announced that they found the fossil of an extinct sea animal called "Neoparadoxia" for the first first time in Japan. People believe these animals lived between 16 and 14 million years ago.</p>
            <p>Kyodo News reported that this team, which includes Okayama University of Science, looked at fossils found in Hokkaido in the past. They found this result and published it in a science magazine.</p>
            <p>The research team explained that before this, fossils of these animals were only found on the west coast of the United States. This new discovery is only the fourth case in the world.</p>
            <p>It is believed that these animals were about 2.5 meters long. They are thought to have lived in shallow seas. However, we don't know much about how they lived. Some people say they looked like rhinoceroses or elephants.</p>
            <p>The research team looked again at three skull fossils found in Akan Town, Hokkaido (now Kushiro City), between 1996 and 2000. These fossils were previously thought to be from "Paleoparadoxia," which is another type of sea animal in the same group.</p>
            <p>But one of the fossils had strong, large bones. So, it was confirmed to be a "Neoparadoxia," which is also in the same group of animals. (Edited by Chen Yen-chun / Reviewed by He Hong-ru) 1140802</p>

            <h1>Trump Criticizes Powell for Not Lowering Interest Rates, Calls on Fed Board to Take Control</h1>
            <p>(Washington, August 1st, Central News Agency) U.S. President Trump today again criticized Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). Trump said Powell was "stubborn" because he would not lower short-term interest rates. Trump even asked the Fed's board members to take power from Powell.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Fed is like America's central bank. Its job is to keep prices stable and help as many people as possible find jobs. This year, Powell has kept the Fed's main interest rate the same. He said that Fed officials need to see how Trump's big taxes on imported goods affect prices. Because of this, Trump has been strongly criticizing him for many months.</p>
            <p>Today, Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social," that if Powell does not lower interest rates "a lot," then "the (Fed) board should take control and do what everyone knows needs to be done!"</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has seven board members. Two of them, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, were chosen by Trump. At their meeting on July 30th, the Fed decided not to change interest rates. But Waller and Bowman disagreed. They said interest rates should be lowered, even if it was not as much as Trump wanted.</p>
            <p>Waller and Bowman released a statement today explaining their view. They believe that the taxes on imported goods will only affect prices one time. But they also think the job market in the U.S. is likely becoming weaker.</p>
            <p>Trump supported what the two said and their strong disagreement with the Fed's decision. However, Trump has said in the past that the American economy is doing very well.</p>
            <p>Later today, the Fed also announced that board member Adriana Kugler will leave next week. After this, Trump said that Powell should also leave.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote, "She (Kugler) knows he (Powell) was wrong about interest rates. He should resign too!" (Translated by Li Pei-shan / Reviewed by Chang Cheng-chien) 1140802</p>
