            <h1>What to Bring and What Not to Do for the Recall Vote on July 26th at 8 AM</h1>
            <p>The recall votes for 24 Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers and Hsinchu City Mayor Kao Hung-An, who is suspended, will be held on July 26th. Voting will be from 8 AM to 4 PM. People should bring their national ID card, stamp, and voting notice to their assigned polling station. Also, on July 26th, people are not allowed to campaign or help with campaigning or recall activities. If they do, they will be fined.</p>
            <p>The recall votes for the 11th term lawmakers and the 11th term Hsinchu City Mayor will be held on July 26th. The KMT lawmakers facing recall include Fu Kun-Chi, Huang Chien-Pin, Cheng Cheng-Chien, Lin Pei-Hsiang, Wan Mei-Ling, Lu Ming-Che, Tu Chuan-Chi, Niu Hsu-Ting, Liao Hsien-Hsiang, Luo Ting-Wei, Huang Chien-Hao, Liao Wei-Hsiang, Chiu Ruo-Hua, Lu Yu-Ling, Ding Hsueh-Chung, Yeh Yuan-Chih, Wang Hung-Wei, Lee Yen-Hsiu, Hsu Chiao-Hsin, Lai Shyh-Bao, Lo Chih-Chiang, Hung Mong-Kai, Chang Chih-Lun, Lin Te-Fu, and also Kao Hung-An.</p>
            <p>People should bring their national ID card, stamp, and voting notice to vote. If you don't have a stamp, you can sign or use your fingerprint instead. If you don't have your voting notice, you can still vote. But if you remember your number on the voter list, like "page number X, serial number X," telling the staff when you get your ballot can save time.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission (CEC) also listed 7 important things to remember for voting. First, **from midnight on July 26th, you cannot campaign or help with campaigning or recall activities on social media apps like LINE, Facebook, or other media.** If you do, you will be fined between NT$100,000 and NT$1,000,000. If you do not stop after being told, you will be fined again and again. For political parties, candidates, their employees, agents, or users, the fine will be higher, between NT$200,000 and NT$2,000,000.</p>
            <p>Second, **you are not allowed to make noise, bother others, or ask people to vote or not vote within 30 meters of the polling station.** If you continue after being told to stop by security, you can be jailed for up to 1 year, or held for a short time, or fined up to NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>Third, **you are not allowed to bring mobile phones or other cameras into the polling station (but turned-off mobile devices are okay).** If you do, you will be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$300,000. Fourth, **you are not allowed to put anything other than the recall ballot into the ballot box or intentionally tear up the recall ballot.** If you do, you will be fined between NT$5,000 and NT$50,000.</p>
            <p>Fifth, **you are not allowed to use cameras to see what people voted for on their recall ballots.** If you do, you can be jailed for up to 5 years and fined up to NT$500,000. The camera will be taken away. Sixth, you are not allowed to take the recall ballot out of the polling station. If you do, you can be jailed for up to 1 year, or held for a short time, or fined up to NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>Seventh, **using a personal stamp or fingerprint to mark the recall ballot is not valid. You also cannot use your own marking tools, ink pads, or stamp pads to vote.** You must use the marking tool given by the Election Commission.</p>
            <p>According to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, for a recall to pass, the number of "yes" votes must be more than the number of "no" votes. Also, the number of "yes" votes must be at least one-fourth (1/4) of all eligible voters in that area. If it passes, the person will lose their job on August 1st, and cannot be a lawmaker or use lawmaker powers from that date.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if there are more "no" votes than "yes" votes, or if the "yes" votes are less than one-fourth (1/4) of all eligible voters, then the recall fails. If a recall fails, another recall cannot be suggested for the same person during their time in office.</p>

            <h1>Cambodian Prime Minister Wants to Accept Malaysia's Ceasefire Offer, Says Thailand's Will is Key</h1>
            <p>Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said today that he supports the plan suggested by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand. Thailand supported this plan for a short time today, but then changed its mind.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Thailand and Cambodia, two neighboring countries in Southeast Asia, are now having their hardest fighting in more than 10 years. Anwar, who is currently the head of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), is trying to stop this conflict.</p>
            <p>Hun Manet wrote on Facebook that "To solve the current fighting between Thailand and Cambodia, the most important thing is if Thailand truly wants to accept a ceasefire."</p>
