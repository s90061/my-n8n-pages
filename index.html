            <h1>China Orders Companies to Stop Buying Nvidia AI Chips; US Speaker Criticizes Beijing</h1>
            <p>China has told many of its companies to stop buying AI chips from Nvidia. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Mike Johnson, said today that China is making the relationship between the two countries worse. He also called China an "opponent" of the US.</p>
            <p>The Financial Times, a British newspaper, reported that three people with knowledge of the situation said that China's internet watchdog group told several Chinese companies, like ByteDance and Alibaba, this week to stop buying Nvidia's AI chips. They were also told to cancel orders they had already made, which included testing and buying Nvidia's RTX Pro 6000D chips.</p>
            <p>When Mike Johnson spoke on CNBC, an American business news show, today, he said: "They (China) steal our special ideas and designs."</p>
            <p>He added: "They do not care about US laws for trademarks or other rules that protect fair trade. It is not America's fault that the relationship is difficult."</p>

            <h1>Obama: US at a Turning Point After Kirk's Murder, Facing Unity or Division</h1>
            <p>Former US President Barack Obama said that after the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, the United States is at a "turning point." He hinted that the current President Trump is not trying to bring people together but is making the country more divided.</p>
            <p>According to notes from the Associated Press, Obama spoke last night at an event in Erie, Pennsylvania, organized by the Jefferson Education Society. He said: "There is no doubt here: A main idea of our democracy is that we must be able to have different opinions and even strong discussions without using violence."</p>
            <p>Obama has been quite quiet since he left office. Yesterday, he answered questions from the host and shared his thoughts on President Trump's words and actions after Kirk's death.</p>
            <p>Obama talked about how he led the country after nine people died in an African American church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015. He also talked about what Republican President George W. Bush did after the 9/11 terror attacks.</p>
            <p>Obama said he believes a president's job during a crisis is "to always remind us that we are united."</p>
            <p>Obama stated that after Charlie Kirk was killed, Trump and his team called political opponents "pests, enemies... this shows a bigger problem."</p>
            <p>Kirk was an important person in conservative politics. He started "Turning Point USA" in Arizona, which is one of the biggest political groups in the country. This made him a close friend of Trump.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that after Kirk's murder, Trump spoke more loudly, saying he would stop what he called the "radical left." This made people worry if the Republican government wanted to use the anger from Kirk's murder to stop people from disagreeing.</p>
            <p>Trump's government responded to Obama's words today. Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement: "Obama always uses every chance to create division, making Americans turn against each other. After he was president, more and more Americans felt that Obama divided the country, instead of uniting it."</p>

            <h1>Weak US Job Market Leads Federal Reserve to Cut Interest Rates</h1>
            <p>Today, the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced that it would lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. This is the first time they have lowered rates this year. This happened because the job market in the US is not strong.</p>
            <p>Recent information from the US shows that the job market is not doing as well as people thought. Last week, the US Department of Labor released early numbers. These numbers show that the number of new jobs created outside of farming in the US will be lowered by 911,000 for the year up to March this year.</p>
            <p>Since December last year, when the Fed last lowered rates, they have kept interest rates between 4.25% and 4.50%. The people who make decisions at the Fed are still watching how President Trump's taxes on imported goods are affecting prices.</p>
