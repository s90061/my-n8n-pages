Taiwan's big yearly military exercise, "Han Kuang 41," is in its third day. Late last night, the First Combat Zone practiced defending Cetiandao against special attacks. They used military vehicles and worked with local groups to show Taiwan's strong readiness for defense.

The First Combat Zone announced that this exercise was like a real fight. They pretended that enemy special forces entered a military port to cause damage. After getting the order, the Penghu Defense Command's armored unit quickly moved to Cetiandao. They worked with the local defense troops to set up a defense, block the port, patrol, guard important places, and stop enemy attacks. This showed their quick response and good teamwork.

Captain Lin, the leader of the combat unit, said that facing many dangers means the troops must always prepare well and practice working together. This helps stop enemy attacks and keeps the port and defense strong. This exercise helped the troops practice moving quickly and also made the soldiers on the island work together better, which is important for defending the islands.

The First Combat Zone stated that the local combat units will keep following the "multi-area denial, strong defense" plan. They will keep training and planning for different situations to protect the country.
