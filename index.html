            <h1>Starlux Airlines and Alaska Airlines Work Together to Add 12 More U.S. Domestic Flight Cities</h1>
            <p>Starlux Airlines announced today that it is starting a second round of partnership flights with Alaska Airlines. They are adding 12 new flight cities within the United States. This means they will now share flights to 20 cities in total.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines and Alaska Airlines started working together at the end of last year. They offered flights to 8 main cities: Salt Lake City, San Diego, Phoenix, Portland, Las Vegas, Dallas, Denver, and Austin.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines said in a press release today that they are starting the second phase of their flight partnership with Alaska Airlines. They are adding 12 new U.S. cities. These new routes include flights from Seattle to Minneapolis, Atlanta, Tampa, Anchorage, Raleigh-Durham, Orlando, Washington Dulles, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Spokane, and Boise. Also, there will be a flight from San Francisco to Newark. This will make their flight network in North America even bigger.</p>
            <p>Glenn Chai, the CEO of Starlux Airlines, said that this expansion makes their North American flight network more complete. It also gives travelers more choices and makes transfers easier. He added that Starlux Airlines and Alaska Airlines also let members use their flight miles together. This means COSMILE members can use their miles for Alaska Airlines flights, giving them more ways to plan their trips.</p>
            <p>Alex Judson, the Director of Partnerships & International for Alaska Airlines, said that by offering easy transfers in Seattle and San Francisco, this expanded partnership will continue to improve their shared promise. They want to give trans-Pacific travelers more choices and better, more convenient service.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines currently flies to 29 places and has 33 routes. Besides a lot of routes in Asia, they also fly to North American cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Ontario, California. Starlux Airlines is also working more closely with Alaska Airlines and has a flight partnership with American Airlines. After they start a new route to Phoenix, USA, on January 15 next year, travelers will be able to transfer from Phoenix to many more American cities using American Airlines' large network of domestic flights.</p>

            <h1>New York Times: Trump Government Made a Deal with Tehran to Send Back Iranians</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 30 (Central News Agency) â€“ The New York Times reported today that the Trump government is sending about 100 Iranians from the United States back to Iran. This information comes from two high-ranking Iranian officials involved in the talks and one American official who knows about the situation.</p>
            <p>According to The New York Times, two Iranian officials said that an American charter plane left Louisiana last night. It is expected to arrive in Iran today, after stopping in Qatar. An American official confirmed that the plan for this flight was almost finished. All officials spoke anonymously because they were not allowed to talk about the details publicly.</p>
            <p>The report said that this sending-back action is one of the clearest things the Trump government has done. It shows that they want to remove immigrants, no matter what human rights problems those people might face. Earlier this year, the U.S. sent some Iranians to Costa Rica and Panama. Many of these people were Christians and might face danger in Iran. These growing actions to send people back have led to lawsuits and criticism from people who support immigrants' rights.</p>
            <p>For many decades, the United States has given a safe place to people who ran away from Iran. Iran is known for its bad human rights record. It stops women's rights activists, political critics, journalists, lawyers, religious minority groups, and LGBTQ+ people from expressing themselves.</p>
            <p>It is not yet clear who these Iranians are or why they tried to move to the United States. In recent years, more Iranian immigrants have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border and entered illegally. Many of them say they faced danger in their home country because of their political or religious beliefs.</p>
            <p>The U.S. has often had a difficult choice when sending back immigrants from certain countries. This is because there are no normal diplomatic relations, and it's hard to get travel papers from the destination country in time. So, the U.S. often had to hold people for a long time or let them go into the U.S. In 2024, the U.S. sent back over 24 Iranians on a few normal flights. This was the highest number in many years.</p>
            <p>The two Iranian officials said that the people being sent back include men and women, and some are married couples. Some left willingly after being held for months, while others did not want to leave. They said that in almost all cases, their requests for safety (asylum) were denied, or they had not yet had a court hearing for their asylum requests.</p>
            <p>According to the two Iranian officials, this action to send people back is a rare time when the U.S. and Iranian governments worked together. It happened after months of talks between the two countries. One official said that Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs is helping the people return home and has promised that they will be safe and will not have problems. However, he added that many people still feel sad and even scared.</p>
