            <h1>Medical Centers Need More Pathology Doctors; Hospitals Offer Higher Pay, Better Workplaces</h1>
            <p>Linkou Chang Gung Hospital offered a high monthly salary of NT$650,000 to hire a pathology doctor, which got a lot of attention. Chen Chien-Tsung, the hospitalâ€™s head, said today that this is because work in medical centers is very busy. Some doctors prefer simpler medical jobs. So, the hospital is working to increase pay and make the work environment better.</p>
            <p>The official website of the Taiwan Society of Pathology recently posted a job ad. It said, "Linkou Chang Gung Hospital is looking for an attending physician in anatomical pathology." It promised a "guaranteed monthly salary of NT$650,000 for the first year, excellent pay, showing the value of your skills." It also offered 28 days of special leave per year and said that work tasks would be fair, and on-call times would be reasonable.</p>
            <p>This news caused a discussion among medical staff online. Chen Chien-Tsung confirmed today that the hospital is indeed looking for an attending physician in pathology. He said that not many doctors are trained in this field in Taiwan. Also, some pathology doctors from their hospital have left medical centers to work in clinics related to pathology.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that many hospitals are looking for staff, not just for pathology. Doctors in the emergency room, nurses, and pharmacists also face this problem. He explained that medical centers have a lot of different tasks, like teaching and evaluations. Some people prefer only medical work, and the hospital respects their career choices.</p>
            <p>Besides better pay, Chen Chien-Tsung said the hospital is also improving the work environment to attract staff. For pathology, they are slowly using AI tools to help diagnose diseases. They also want to make young doctors interested in research, so they find working in a medical center interesting.</p>
            <p>Cheng Yung-Ming, the head of the Taiwan Society of Pathology, said, "To keep the quality of pathology reports high, our society does not like it when hospitals try to steal staff with high salaries." He added that currently, there is a temporary shortage because new doctors are still training. However, he believes this problem will get better in a few years because the job offers a good quality of life.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Education: No More Central Subsidies for School Electricity, Return to Local Funding</h1>
            <p>The cities of New Taipei and Taipei said that the central government will stop helping public and private schools pay for electricity starting next year. The Ministry of Education said today that in 2025, the central government will pay for all extra electricity costs. This is a temporary plan. Starting in 2026, schools will go back to the normal way of paying for electricity, which is through local government budgets. The Ministry of Education also said that education policies should not be used for political reasons.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the New Taipei City government announced that the central government will stop paying for school electricity bills next year. This will affect almost 400,000 students in New Taipei City. So, New Taipei Mayor Hou Yu-Ih said that the city government will pay the yearly electricity cost of about NT$710 million. Taipei Mayor Chiang Wan-An also said today that we must not let children suffer. He asked the central government to change its mind. He also said that Taipei would first add over NT$660 million to its budget to cover these costs.</p>
            <p>In response, Cabinet spokesperson Li Hui-Chih said today that because of the new "Law on the Division of Financial Powers," local governments will get much more money next year. They will receive an extra NT$416.5 billion in shared taxes. This means local governments will have enough money to pay for education and other things. So, they should also cover the water and electricity costs for schools in their areas.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education sent out a statement today to add more information. It said that the Executive Yuan had already decided in meetings on March 27 and July 8, 2024. The decision was that local governments should pay for the special electricity prices and the cost difference for high school and elementary schools.</p>
            <p>Some news reports said that the plan for 2026 is like "cutting off all help at once." The Ministry of Education said this is not true. It explained that 2025 is a special year because there wasn't much time to plan the budget. To make sure schools can keep working without problems, the central government will pay for all the extra electricity costs. The Ministry of Education has set aside NT$5.9 billion for this to make sure all schools can operate. This is a temporary step.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education pointed out that in 2025, the central government is paying all the extra electricity costs for schools, so local governments do not have to pay anything extra. Starting in 2026, it will go back to the normal financial system, which means it is not canceling help. It is just going back to the old rules.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education stressed that it always cares about students' right to learn and their study environment. By paying for all the extra electricity costs in 2025, the central government shows it truly supports education. If people wrongly say that help is being canceled right away, it is not only incorrect but also might make people confused and worried. Education policy is about children's right to learn and should not be used for political gain.</p>

            <p>Today, the San Diego Padres played against the Los Angeles Dodgers at their home stadium. Japanese pitcher Yu Darvish pitched for 6 innings and only let one run score. This helped the Padres win the game 2-1. Now, both teams are tied for first place in the National League West division.</p>
            <p>Yu Darvish pitched for 6 innings and only gave up one run from one home run. He also struck out 5 batters and walked 1. He got the win for the game. His record for the season is now 3 wins and 3 losses, and his ERA (a measure of how many runs he allows) is now 5.36.</p>
            <p>After Yu Darvish left the game, three Padres relief pitchers â€“ Jason Adam, Mason Miller, and Robert Suarez â€“ pitched the last 3 innings without letting any runs score. Robert Suarez got his 34th save, which is the most in Major League Baseball right now.</p>
