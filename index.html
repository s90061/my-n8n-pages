            <h1>California Governor Newsom Says No to Bill Limiting AI Chatbots for Children</h1>
            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom today said no to an important new law. This law wanted to limit how children use AI chatbots.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the law would have stopped companies from offering AI chatbots to people under 18. This would only change if the companies could promise that the chatbots would not talk about sexual topics or encourage self-harm.</p>
            <p>Newsom said, "I really support the idea of protecting young people when they use AI. But this law would limit how people use AI chat tools too much. It might accidentally stop young people from using these products completely."</p>
            <p>A few hours before he said no to this law, he signed another law. This new law asks platforms to tell users when they are talking to an AI chatbot and not a real person.</p>
            <p>The new law says that platforms must remind young users every three hours that they are talking to an AI chatbot. Also, companies must have ways to stop content that encourages self-harm. If a user talks about wanting to harm themselves, the platform must send them to help services.</p>
            <p>Newsom has four children under 18. He said California must protect children and teenagers who use AI chatbots more and more. These young people might use these tools for school help, emotional support, or even personal advice.</p>
            <p>California is one of several US states this year trying to deal with worries about children using chatbots safely. These two laws are part of many artificial intelligence laws that California's government has suggested this year. These laws aim to control the fast-growing AI industry, which does not have many rules yet.</p>
            <p>James Steyer, who started "Common Sense Media," a well-known group that checks media and technology, said he was "very disappointed" that Newsom said no to the law.</p>
            <p>He said, "This law was really needed to protect children and teenagers from dangerous or even deadly AI companion chatbots."</p>

            <h1>Ke Jia-yan May Win Best Actress at Golden Bell Awards; Teases Kun Da for Not Being Nominated</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 14 (CNA) â€“ The actress Ke Jia-yan is nominated for Best Actress in a TV Series at the Golden Bell Awards for her role in "The Sequel to a Fairy Tale." She said she really liked trying new things and improving in this show. Her husband, Kun Da, played a "homebody" in "Zhenggang Police Station" but was not nominated. Ke Jia-yan joked that even after all that, he still didn't get a nomination.</p>
            <p>Li Nien-hsiu, who wrote and directed "The Sequel to a Fairy Tale," along with producer Huang Wei-hsia, executive producer Sun Chia-chi, and Ke Jia-yan, went to a party for Golden Bell nominees. Ke Jia-yan said she was happy to be nominated for Best Actress for a comedy. She felt she tried many new things and grew as an actress, and she really liked her performance. When asked about her husband Kun Da, Ke Jia-yan jokingly said, "He worked so hard playing that homebody in 'Zhenggang Police Station,' but he still wasn't nominated!"</p>
            <p>When asked if she cared a lot about winning, Ke Jia-yan smiled and said she wasn't thinking too much about it, but having a few more awards would be nice. Li Nien-hsiu also said that Ke Jia-yan's performance was very surprising this time, and the judges clearly saw it.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-chi honestly said she really wanted Ke Jia-yan to win. However, she felt that the lead actor, Liu Yi-hao, was a big surprise that was missed for a nomination. Ke Jia-yan agreed, saying, "He showed a different level of acting than before. He's a big missed opportunity in my heart." Li Nien-hsiu and Huang Wei-hsia also agreed, saying, "We chatted with Liu Yi-hao a little, and he said he would keep working hard. He took a huge step and let everyone see a different side of him. He's not just a bossy CEO; he works very hard and showed everyone a new part of himself."</p>
            <p>Li Nien-hsiu is also nominated for Best Director and Best Screenplay for "The Sequel to a Fairy Tale." She shared that for some time, she wanted to give up. She said, "I was a film editor first. Then I wrote scripts for 10 years, but for 10 years, no one noticed me. I wondered if I was good enough for this. At that time, I went to Xingtian Temple, and surprisingly, I wrote 'The Sequel to a Fairy Tale.' It was quite mysterious."</p>
            <p>Winnie is nominated for Best Newcomer for "Zhenggang Police Station." She remembered getting a lot of criticism at first. She said, "I never thought about being nominated. The director and other actors gave me a lot of feedback, and I really enjoyed it. I never thought I would have the chance to be part of the Golden Bell Awards." Winnie also thanked Ashin from Mayday, saying, "On the day I was nominated, he shared it on his Instagram story. He is a great senior."</p>

            <h1>Trade Fight Gets Worse, Affects Markets; US and China Try to Calm Things Down</h1>
            <p>Washington, October 13 (CNA) â€“ The trade fight between the United States and China is getting worse, so both countries are quickly looking for ways to calm it down. China is trying hard to make sure the meeting between Trump and Xi happens as planned, hoping to find a way to solve their problems. The US is worried about the stock market changing a lot and wants to reduce trade tensions to stop more money from being lost in financial markets. Both countries have their own plans and are trying to ease the situation because of economic pressure.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump is publicly trying to calm tensions with China to make the markets feel better. At the same time, he is still privately putting pressure on Beijing. Wall Street is watching closely to see how he manages these two different goals.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that after Trump threatened to put a 100% tax on goods from China starting November 1, he recently talked with top officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. They discussed how to tell the world that the US wants to reduce trade tension with China, according to people who know about the discussions.</p>
            <p>On October 10, Trump made this threat because Beijing announced limits on exporting rare earth minerals. This new problem caused a big drop in the US stock market. During this time, Trump even said he might not meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Trump wants to calm things down, and both the US and China have privately said they want to stop their trade arguments, at least for a while. Since Trump's second term began, tensions have gone up and down many times. This time, China is trying hard to keep the Trump-Xi meeting scheduled for later this month. Trump's team wants to stop stock prices from falling and make sure the focus on the Middle East peace agreement is not lost because of the new trade conflict.</p>
            <p>It is known that Trump's government officials have been discussing for weeks different ways to respond to China if needed. These include checking Chinese companies listed in the US more carefully and watching Chinese businesses even more closely. Also, Trump's government is thinking about using a special order to make US infrastructure stronger against China's secret actions, punishing Chinese companies that do business with Russian oil, or further limiting how much Chinese companies can invest in the US.</p>
            <p>Finally, last week, Trump, Bessent, and several senior advisors agreed to first make international financial markets stable. They also agreed to avoid immediately making things worse with China.</p>
            <p>Someone close to Bessent said that after Trump threatened a 100% tax on China, Bessent recently talked with Chinese officials. He clearly told them that Trump is open to talking about reducing tensions. But he also said that if China doesn't give in, the US might still take action against them. Another person close to Bessent stressed that the US is ready to take action against China if needed.</p>
            <p>On October 12, China's Ministry of Commerce released a statement. It did not mention any clear actions to get back at the US for the new tax threat. Instead, it promised to control new exports in a "careful and moderate" way. This meant Beijing agreed that its position on this issue was too strong.</p>
            <p>Signs that Beijing wants to calm things down can also be seen in local media: there were almost no reports about Trump's threat of a 100% tax on Chinese goods. By avoiding strong words, China kept its options open so its policy would not become a complete ban, while also saving face.</p>
            <p>Recently, Beijing has hinted that it might soften its stance on rare earth export controls. However, it has not yet shown that it wants to completely remove this policy. Not removing this measure adds uncertainty to the trade talks that are about to happen. It is also possible that both sides could again start a cycle of taking action and responding.</p>
            <p>US companies doing business in China hope that both sides will avoid starting another bad cycle of 100% taxes and responses.</p>
            <p>Sean Stein, the head of the U.S.-China Business Council, said, "The US and China can choose to enter another round of actions and responses, or they can choose to work towards calming things down and talking. For the good of the economy, US companies clearly want to see the latter."</p>
