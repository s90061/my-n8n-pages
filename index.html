            <h1>A Skilled Police Officer Who Solved Big Cases Often Made Small Mistakes; After Treatment for ADHD, He Can Now Focus Better.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 17 (CNA) Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects children, but it can also continue into adulthood. There was a police officer who was very good at handling serious criminal cases. However, he often made mistakes during his daily patrol duties. He went to the doctor and was diagnosed with adult ADHD. After getting treatment, his work performance improved greatly.</p>
            <p>About 9% of children in Taiwan have ADHD, but only 1.6% are officially diagnosed. Even fewer, about 1%, receive full treatment. Li Sung-tao, a doctor in the Department of Psychiatry at Tri-Service General Hospital, said that this means many children do not get help in time. This can cause problems with their learning, friendships, and feelings. The police officer is a common example of an adult with ADHD that doctors see.</p>
            <p>Dr. Li said that this police officer was excellent at solving major crimes, such as catching criminals or investigating murder and robbery cases. But in his everyday work, he often made mistakes because he could not focus. So, he was moved to a basic job with regular tasks. These routine tasks were hard for him. For example, he forgot to bring his keys during patrols or forgot to sign in. This seriously affected his overall work.</p>
            <p>Dr. Li also explained that the officer was checked and diagnosed with ADHD as a child, but he did not continue treatment at that time. He only sought help when his job changed and he had problems at work. After tests, including computer-based ones, he was diagnosed with adult ADHD. After treatment, his symptoms got much better. His co-workers and bosses were very surprised and felt like he had become a different person.</p>
            <p>Dr. Li said that about 78% of ADHD symptoms come from genetics. Several parts of the brain, like the prefrontal lobe and subcortical areas, do not connect properly. This causes problems with focusing, planning, being impulsive, not being able to sit still, and difficulty controlling emotions and movements. Also, the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine are lower than in most people. This means the brain cannot filter messages effectively, making it hard to concentrate.</p>
            <p>Dr. Li described children with ADHD as if they have 10 loud speakers in their brain playing different music and channels. This makes it hard for them to listen to others. Many parents think their child is just a little distracted and will get better as they grow up. But in fact, about 60% of children's symptoms continue into adulthood. They might have a bad memory, forget important plans, cannot tell which tasks are more important, and cannot plan long-term or big projects.</p>
            <p>Dr. Li urged people to remember that ADHD is more than just symptoms. It can cause children to fail in life and school, making their lives difficult. Finding it early and getting treatment early is a chance for children to use their full abilities again. Currently, medicine helps 80% to 90% of cases. Studies show that using medicine together with behavior therapy can make symptoms of not focusing and hyperactivity better, improving life and learning quality.</p>
            <p>A common worry parents have about medicine is that it might cause addiction. Dr. Li explained that the main side effect of central nervous system stimulant medicines is a reduced appetite. If a person loses a lot of weight, doctors might change to a different medicine. When taken as prescribed by a doctor, these medicines do not cause addiction. Regular use helps reduce symptoms and can even prevent children from using tobacco, alcohol, or drugs in the future.</p>

            <h1>Taipei Prosecutors Question Nine More People About a Metaverse Investment Platform That Took Money Illegally.</h1>
            <p>Taipei, September 17 (CNA) Taipei prosecutors are investigating a scam involving a metaverse investment platform. In August, they started their first investigation and two suspects were arrested. Today, the prosecutors started their second investigation. Police searched eight places and questioned nine more suspects to ask them about the case.</p>
            <p>Investigators found that a person named Liao and others created an online platform called ETmeta. They held meetings to invite people to invest in "ETM coins." They told people that if they kept ETM coins, they could earn 1% profit every day. If they kept them for 10 days, they could earn 1% to 2% profit daily. They also said that investors could take their money out at any time and that ETM coins could be exchanged for Tether (a type of digital currency).</p>
            <p>Investigators found that many people invested starting in January last year. At first, they received interest from their investments. But by September last year, the platform stopped letting people take out their money. This is when people realized they had been tricked. In total, 16 investors have reported the scam, and they lost almost 100 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>In August, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, along with the Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Justice's Fujian Province Office and the Taipei City Police Department's Criminal Investigation Division, began the first investigation. They asked the court to arrest Liao and a woman named Hung, and the court agreed.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office told the police to carry out the second part of the investigation. They searched eight homes and offices belonging to nine suspects, including a person named Wu. The police then questioned these nine people. The case is being investigated for breaking the Banking Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, and the Criminal Code's fraud laws.</p>

            <p>Taipei, September 17 (CNA) The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is getting ready for the 2026 local elections. President Lai Ching-te, who is also the chairman of the DPP, said today that the party will be very careful and responsible. They will find the best and most suitable people to run, so they can get the most support from voters. Also, to make sure the primary elections are fair, the party's Election Strategy Committee has decided that before candidates are officially chosen, they cannot use pictures, sounds, or other materials of the President, Vice President, Premier, or members of the Election Strategy Committee.</p>
            <p>The Election Strategy Committee has generally agreed to finish the party's primary elections for Tainan City, Kaohsiung City, and Chiayi County by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>The DPP held a Central Executive Committee meeting this afternoon. During the meeting, President Lai Ching-te said that the party's main office has created an "Election Strategy Committee" to handle the details of choosing candidates for next year's elections. He said that for cities and counties where everyone agrees on a candidate, the party will quickly choose that person. Except for a few special situations, all candidates should be chosen before the Lunar New Year.</p>
            <p>President Lai said that the 2026 local elections are very important for the party, for local areas, and for the country. The DPP will definitely be very careful and responsible to find the best and most suitable candidates. They want to get the most support from voters.</p>
            <p>Hsu Kuo-yung, a co-leader of the DPP's Election Strategy Committee, shared information from the meeting. He said that the committee decided to finish choosing candidates before the Lunar New Year.</p>
            <p>Hsu Kuo-yung said that to keep the primary elections fair, candidates who want to be nominated cannot use pictures, videos, or signatures of the President, Vice President, Premier, or members of the Election Strategy Committee before the nomination process is complete. If they have already used them, they must remove them. The committee will discuss when to remove these materials next week.</p>
            <p>Hsu Kuo-yung said that to complete the work for mayors and county magistrates, the Election Strategy Committee will divide the work and visit each city and county to help with coordination.</p>
            <p>It is known that the Election Strategy Committee members have been given different cities and counties to supervise. These are: Taipei City (Chuang Jui-hsiung, Chang Hung-lu); New Taipei City (Chen Mao-sung, Chang Hung-lu, Wang Ting-yu); Taoyuan City (Liu Wei-chun, Chen Mao-sung, Lin Yi-pang, Chang Hung-lu); Tainan City (Liu Wei-chun, Chang Hung-lu); Kaohsiung City (Liu Wei-chun, Chang Hung-lu, Wang Ting-yu, Chen Mao-sung); Taichung City (Liu Wei-chun, Chang Hung-lu).</p>
            <p>Also, before the Central Executive Committee meeting, DPP legislator Wang Shih-chien was asked if he wanted to run for Taipei Mayor. He replied, "Not at all." He said that the DPP has many talented people, such as Deputy Premier Cheng Li-chun, DPP legislator Chuang Duan-hsiung, and DPP Secretary-General Hsu Kuo-yung, who are all very suitable candidates.</p>
