            <h1>Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang Issues Sensitive; Thai Arts Center Removes Exhibition Works Due to Chinese Pressure</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that a major art gallery in Bangkok, the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre, changed or removed works from an exhibition. These works were about how Beijing treats minority groups and Hong Kong. This happened because China asked them to. Artists said this is another time China has tried to stop criticism from outside its borders.</p>
            <p>The exhibition at the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre was called "Constellation of Complicity: Visualizing the Global Machinery of Authoritarian Solidarity." It looked at how powerful governments in different countries work together across borders. The artworks were by artists who left their homes in places like Tibet, Xinjiang, Russia, Iran, and Syria.</p>
            <p>Today, when a Reuters reporter went to the exhibition, they saw that some works that were shown in advertisements and photos before were now gone. This included a multimedia art piece by a Tibetan artist. Also, some other works were changed. Words like "Hong Kong," "Tibet," and "Uyghur," or the artists' names, were covered up.</p>
            <p>Sai, a Myanmar artist and one of the curators, said that three days after the exhibition opened on July 24, people from the Chinese Embassy, along with officials from Bangkok City, came to the exhibition hall and asked for the exhibition to stop.</p>
            <p>Reuters saw an email from the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre dated July 30. The email said, "The Chinese Embassy put pressure on us through the (Thai) Ministry of Foreign Affairs and especially our main supporter, the Bangkok City Administration. We were warned that this exhibition might cause diplomatic tension between Thailand and China."</p>
            <p>The Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre also said in the letter that they "had no choice but to make some changes." This included covering the names of artists from Hong Kong, Tibet, and Uyghur.</p>
            <p>According to Sai, the curator, the Chinese Embassy later asked for some more works to be removed from the exhibition. He said these works included the Tibetan snow lion flag, the East Turkestan flag of the Uyghur people, several postcards showing Chinese President Xi Jinping, and one postcard showing the relationship between China and Israel.</p>
            <p>The removed work by Tibetan artist Tenzin Mingyur Paldron included a video showing Tibetans holding Palestinian flags and asking for justice for genocide. It also included a video titled "Listen to Indigenous People."</p>
            <p>The Reuters reporter saw a black screen where a video player should have been. Another video by a Uyghur artist was playing, but the artist's name was covered in black.</p>
            <p>Sai said he has left Thailand because the Thai police are looking for him. He also said that his contact in Bangkok told him that Chinese officials returned to the Bangkok Arts and Cultural Centre yesterday. They asked for a leaflet to be removed and said again that they wanted to "enforce the One China policy."</p>
            <p>Sai stated, "It is sad and ironic that an exhibition about powerful governments working together was censored because of pressure from powerful governments. For a long time, Thailand was a safe place for people who disagreed with their governments. But this event is a frightening sign for all artists and activists who live in exile in this region."</p>

            <h1>Taipei Crowned World's Most Desired City for Long-Term Living in New Survey</h1>
            <p>Gensler, a global design and architecture company, recently released its "City Pulse 2025: The Magnetic City" survey report. Taipei came in first place as the "most desired city in the world for long-term living," beating big international cities like Singapore, Sydney, and Berlin.</p>
            <p>Gensler's global survey, "City Pulse 2025: The Magnetic City," gathered opinions from 33,000 city residents in 65 cities around the world. It looked at why and where people choose to live.</p>
            <p>The survey recorded the percentage of people in each city who said they were "unlikely" to move. The results showed that the top 10 international cities where people most want to live for a long time are Taipei (64%), Ho Chi Minh City (61%), Singapore (59%), Sydney (58%), Berlin (51%), Monterrey (50%), Munich (49%), Sao Paulo (49%), Vancouver (49%), and Seoul (47%).</p>
            <p>According to Gensler's survey, among 152 factors, the top 5 most important reasons for people to stay in a city for a long time are: "I don't feel bored in this city," "I feel at home in this city," "I am proud of this city," "This city is becoming more suitable for retirement," and "My feeling of belonging to the city grows over time."</p>
            <p>For the United States, the top 10 cities where people most want to live for a long time are Minneapolis (53%), San Antonio (53%), San Diego (50%), Raleigh (49%), Chicago (47%), Tampa (47%), Portland (47%), Phoenix (46%), San Francisco (46%), and Austin (46%).</p>
            <p>Also, in this report, Taipei scored well in several areas: economic strength (73%), safety and stability (78%), city vibrancy (76%), climate readiness (69%), improving quality of life (71%), community investment (70%), helping homeless people (60%), and reducing crime (71%). All these scores were higher than the global average.</p>

            <h1>Singapore's 60th National Day Approaches; PM Wong Outlines Economic Strategy Changes to Face Challenges</h1>
            <p>Singapore's 60th National Day is tomorrow. Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong spoke tonight. He said that the world economy still faces big challenges. Right now, Singapore's economy is strong, but the future is not clear. Singapore must change its economic plans to stay competitive. This includes actively using new technologies like artificial intelligence in all parts of the economy.</p>
            <p>Singapore's National Day is on August 9th. It will be 60 years since it became an independent country in 1965. Wong gave his National Day speech tonight. He said that looking back, they can see how dangerous the situation was when the country started. But even though it was a difficult path, Singapore has built the home they have today.</p>
            <p>Wong said that big changes in the world are getting more serious. New conflicts are starting, tensions between countries are growing, trade barriers are getting stronger, and countries want to protect their own businesses more. The global order that Singapore has known and depended on for many decades is slowly being affected.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Singapore's ruling party, the People's Action Party, won in most areas and stayed in power. They received more votes than in the 2020 election, getting a clear approval from the people. Wong said that Singaporeans clearly chose the team they thought was best to lead Singapore through these difficult times. The global economy still faces big challenges, and companies everywhere are delaying their growth and investment plans. Singapore's economy is strong now, but the future is still uncertain.</p>
            <p>The Singapore government recently started an economic resilience group led by Deputy Prime Minister Gan Kim Yong. Wong said that the government is helping businesses deal with current problems, helping people keep their jobs, and continues to look at risks and make plans for the next wave of changes. Big countries will use all their resources, whether economic, technological, or political, to gain advantages. This will put more pressure on small countries like Singapore to compete.</p>
            <p>He stated that Singapore must therefore change its economic plans to stay competitive. This includes actively using new technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics in all parts of the economy. This will help people and businesses fully use these technologies to improve their competitive advantage.</p>
            <p>Recently, the tariffs imposed by the United States continue to be watched by many countries. Since the free trade agreement between Singapore and the United States started in 2004, trade between the two has grown. The U.S. has a trade surplus with Singapore. Singapore's tax rate is 10% on the list of tariffs from U.S. President Trump, which is quite low.</p>
