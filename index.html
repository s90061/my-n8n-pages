In April, people in the United States spent less money. This is a change from earlier this year. Also, prices for goods and services did not go up as quickly as before. This news suggests that inflation, which means prices increasing, is becoming less of a problem. Families are still being careful with their money, perhaps buying fewer big items like cars or furniture. They might be saving more instead. This slowdown in spending and prices can affect daily life, making it a bit easier for some families to manage their budgets, even if the economy is growing slower.

**How AI is Changing the Future of Work**
Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a big impact on jobs around the world. AI refers to computers that can learn and solve problems like humans. Some jobs might become less common because AI can do certain tasks faster and more cheaply. For example, AI can help with customer service or data analysis. However, AI is also creating new jobs. These new roles often involve building, managing, or training AI systems. Experts say that people will need to learn new skills to work alongside AI. Companies are using AI more and more to improve their work and make things more efficient, which means the way we work is changing quickly.

**International Tourism Almost Back to Pre-Pandemic Levels**
Global travel is seeing a very strong recovery. The number of people traveling to other countries is nearly as high as it was before 2020. This means that international tourism is expected to fully recover in 2024. Many people are eager to travel again after being unable to for a long time. The Middle East and Europe are two regions that have seen many tourists, even more than before the pandemic. This increase in travelers is good news for hotels, airlines, and local businesses that depend on tourism, helping economies around the world grow.
