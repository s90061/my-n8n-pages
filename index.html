            <h1>Stock Market Rises as People Expect Interest Rate Cut Next Week</h1>
            <p>News from New York (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, the main stock market indexes in the US, like the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq, reached new high points. This happened because new information about inflation and the number of people asking for unemployment money made people think that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates next week.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average went up a lot, by 617.08 points, which is 1.36%. It closed at 46108.00 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index also went up by 55.43 points, or 0.85%, ending at 6587.47 points.</p>

            <h1>Oil Prices Fall by About 2% Due to Worries About Too Much Supply and Less Demand in the US</h1>
            <p>News from New York (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, oil prices around the world fell by about 2%. This happened because people are worried that the US will not need as much oil, and that there might be too much oil available globally. These worries were stronger than concerns about oil supply problems caused by fighting in the Middle East and the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency said that Brent crude oil futures dropped by 1.12 US dollars, which is 1.7%. The price ended at 66.37 US dollars for one barrel.</p>
            <p>US West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures also fell by 1.30 US dollars, or 2.0%. The price closed at 62.37 US dollars.</p>

            <h1>Netanyahu Promises: There Will Never Be a Palestinian State</h1>
            <p>News from Jerusalem (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, spoke at a ceremony in the West Bank. At this event, where a new settlement plan was signed, he promised that he would not allow a Palestinian state to be created.</p>
            <p>Netanyahu said at the event in Maale Adumim, an Israeli settlement, "There will never be a Palestinian state. This land belongs to us."</p>
            <p>He added, "We will protect our history, our land, and our safety... We will make the number of people living in this city twice as big."</p>
            <p>The Prime Minister's office showed this event live.</p>
            <p>Israel has wanted to build on a piece of land called E1, which is about 12 square kilometers in size. However, this plan has been stopped for many years because other countries do not agree with it.</p>
            <p>Last month, Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right Finance Minister, supported building about 3,400 homes on this very important piece of land.</p>
            <p>This announcement caused many people to speak against it. The United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, said that this plan would effectively cut the West Bank into two parts. He called it a "threat to the existence" of a connected Palestinian state.</p>
            <p>Several Western countries, including the UK and France, have already said they plan to recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations later this month.</p>
