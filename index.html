<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-unit-issue-10-billion-103832527.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.‚Äôs overseas unit is set to issue $10 billion worth of new stock to shore up its forex hedging operations, making its biggest such move to counter a volatile local currency.

TSMC Global Ltd. is poised to issue the shares to help it hedge against forex swings, the company said in a statement. It‚Äôs the third such deal since 2024, and by far the largest. They occurred during periods when the Taiwan dollar tended to appreciate. The moves grant TSMC Global ‚Äî the vehicle responsible for managing overseas investments and hedging ‚Äî more capital flexibility in managing exchange rate risks.

Recent gains by the Taiwan dollar have caused worries in Taipei about the economy‚Äôs heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency notched its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, spurring calls from the central bank to curb speculation.

‚ÄúGenerally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,‚Äù said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco based in Singapore. ‚ÄúIssuing new shares, and bringing in an immediate cash injection, may help companies manage the margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.‚Äù

TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far the island‚Äôs biggest company and exporter because the majority of its production is domestic. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would translate into less of the local currency, or they would need to raise their prices overseas and risk denting demand.

In June, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told shareholders the company‚Äôs operating margin has fallen several percentage points because of a stronger local currency.

**US House unanimously passes "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act", wants Trump to support Taiwan joining IMF! Ministry of Foreign Affairs responds**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E8%AD%B0%E9%99%A2%E7%84%A1%E7%95%B0%E8%AD%B0%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E-%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E6%B3%95%E6%A1%88-%E8%A6%81%E5%B7%9D%E6%99%AE%E6%8C%BA%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%A4%E9%83%A8%E5%9B%9E%E6%87%89%E4%BA%86-072513518.html">News Link</a>

The US House of Representatives on the 23rd orally and unanimously passed the "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," jointly proposed by bipartisan lawmakers. The act instructs the United States to use its voice and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's participation in the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including economic oversight, technical assistance, and the eligibility of Taiwanese personnel to serve in the IMF. In response, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) stated today (24th) that this act has a positive meaning for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan, and it will closely monitor the subsequent development of this act.

The "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act," which calls for the US administration to assist Taiwan's participation in the IMF, was proposed and passed by the US House Financial Services Committee in March this year, and was orally and unanimously passed by the full House on the 23rd. The bill was jointly proposed by Republican lawmaker Young Kim and Democratic lawmaker Al Green.

Young Kim stated that China continues to obstruct Taiwan's participation in international forums such as the IMF because it knows that financial security is as important as military security. China may undermine Taiwan's financial system by raising tariffs, short-selling stocks, and freezing bank transfers. Joining the IMF will provide Taiwan with resources that help strengthen financial resilience and resist China's economic coercion.

In response, MOFA spokesperson Hsiao Kuang-wei stated at a regular press conference this morning that this act has a positive meaning for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA thanked the US House of Representatives for unanimously passing this act, which not only fully demonstrates the firm support of bipartisan members of the US Congress for Taiwan's participation in international organizations and expansion of international space, but also further highlights the importance of strengthening Taiwan's economic resilience and global partnerships.

MOFA stated that it will closely monitor the subsequent development of this act and will maintain close coordination and communication with friends in the US Congress and the administration to continuously increase the positive momentum for Taiwan's international participation.

Regarding this non-discrimination act against Taiwan, after its passage by the US House of Representatives on the 23rd, it must be passed by the US Senate in an identical version and then sent to the White House for the President's signature to officially become law. The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee has already passed a counterpart bill in early June, awaiting a full Senate vote.
