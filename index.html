            <h1>French President: No Embassy in Palestine Until Israeli Hostages Are Freed</h1>
            <p>The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, said in an interview shown today that France plans to recognize Palestine as a state. However, France will not open an embassy in Palestine until Hamas, an Islamist group, releases the hostages it is holding in Gaza.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Macron spoke on the American CBS program "Face the Nation" on September 18. He said, "For us, this will be a very clear and necessary condition before we open an embassy in Palestine."</p>
            <p>The interview was broadcast today as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada all recognized Palestine as a state at the same time. This planned action shows a big change in Western foreign policy after many decades.</p>
            <p>Portugal is also expected to recognize Palestine later today. France said it will follow suit tomorrow at the United Nations, along with other countries.</p>
            <p>In the interview, Macron also strongly disagreed with plans to force Palestinians to leave Gaza when the area is rebuilt.</p>
            <p>He stated, "If such rebuilding plans depend on forcing them to leave, that is simply crazy... For the international trust of America and France, we should not ignore such plans, whether we openly accept them or quietly agree to them."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Lachlan Murdoch, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell to Join TikTok Deal</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump said today that Lachlan Murdoch, the CEO of Fox Corporation, Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, and Michael Dell, the CEO of Dell Technologies, will be American investors in a deal. This deal will allow the popular short video app TikTok to continue working in the United States.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump said the U.S. and China have made progress on an agreement. This agreement states that TikTok's U.S. assets must be moved from China's ByteDance company to American owners.</p>
            <p>Lachlan Murdoch, the CEO of Fox Corporation, recently made an agreement with his family about a long legal fight over inheritance. This agreement secured his long-term control of his media companies, including Fox News and the Wall Street Journal.</p>
            <p>Trump said that Rupert Murdoch, a 94-year-old media owner, might also be part of the deal.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison, a co-founder of Oracle, is also a main supporter of the Republican Party. He has always been seen as someone who might be involved in a TikTok deal. Michael Dell is the CEO of Dell Technologies.</p>
            <p>Trump praised these business leaders as "American patriots" and a group of excellent people when he was interviewed on the Fox News program "The Sunday Briefing."</p>
            <p>Trump said, "I think they will do very well." Trump also said that TikTok helps him get more support from young voters for his 2024 presidential election.</p>
            <p>During former President Biden's time in office, the U.S. Congress passed a law. This law required ByteDance, a Chinese company, to sell TikTok's business in the U.S. If they did not, TikTok would be banned. TikTok has 170 million users in the U.S.</p>
            <p>When Trump became president, he delayed the ban many times. He included talks about TikTok as part of bigger economic talks with China.</p>

            <h1>UK, Canada, Australia Recognize Palestine; Israel to Expand Settlements in West Bank</h1>
            <p>After the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia said they recognize Palestine as a state, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised today to make settlements bigger in the West Bank, which is an occupied area. A Hamas official said this was a big win for the rights of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Netanyahu said in a statement: "For many years, even with great pressure from inside and outside the country, I have stopped this terrorist state from being formed. We did this with strong will and good political thinking. Also, we have doubled the number of Jewish settlements in the Judea and Samaria Area, and we will continue to move in this direction."</p>
            <p>The Judea and Samaria Area is the official name Israel uses for the West Bank area it controls.</p>
            <p>At the same time, a top official from Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, said today that the recognition of Palestine by the UK, Canada, and Australia is a big success for the rights of the Palestinian people.</p>
            <p>Mahmud Mardawi, a Hamas official, told AFP: "These steps show a win for Palestinian rights and that our cause is finally getting justice. They also send a clear message: no matter how many bad things the occupiers do, they can never take away our national rights."</p>
            <p>Earlier, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it rejects the "one-sided" recognition of Palestine by the UK, Canada, and Australia. It also warned that this action could make the situation in the region more unstable.</p>
            <p>These three countries today became the first G7 members to recognize Palestine. The main discussion at the United Nations General Assembly will start tomorrow in New York. France and other countries are expected to follow their example.</p>
            <p>The Israeli Foreign Ministry stated strongly: "Israel completely rejects the UK and some other countries' one-sided announcement to recognize Palestine."</p>
