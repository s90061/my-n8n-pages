Artificial intelligence (AI) is set to have a big effect on jobs, especially in richer countries, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A recent report from the IMF suggests that about 60% of jobs in advanced economies could be impacted by AI. This means AI could either take over some tasks that people do, or it could make human workers more productive.

The report highlights both the good and bad sides of AI. On the one hand, AI could lead to higher productivity, which means businesses could make more goods and services. This might also lead to higher wages for some workers. On the other hand, AI could replace some jobs, especially those that involve repeated tasks. This could make it harder for some people to find work, and it might increase the gap between rich and poor.

To deal with these changes, the IMF suggests that governments and businesses need to help people learn new skills. This "reskilling" will prepare workers for the new types of jobs that AI might create. They also say that there should be strong social support systems to help those who lose their jobs because of AI. While richer countries might see the biggest changes first, developing countries could also be affected in time, though perhaps less directly at the start.

**Earth Had Its Hottest Year on Record in 2023**

Scientists have confirmed that 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on Earth. Data from the European Union's climate service, Copernicus, showed that average global temperatures reached 1.48 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. This is very close to the critical 1.5 degrees Celsius limit that countries agreed to try and avoid under the Paris Agreement on climate change. Going past this limit could lead to even more dangerous changes in the planet's climate.

The record heat in 2023 led to many extreme weather events around the world. There were severe heatwaves, causing health problems and wildfires in places like North America and Europe. Many areas also experienced unusual droughts, which meant a lack of water for farming and daily life. At the same time, other regions suffered from heavy floods, damaging homes and infrastructure.

Scientists say that the main reason for this warming is the gases that humans release into the atmosphere, especially from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These gases trap heat and cause the Earth's temperature to rise. Experts are now calling for urgent action from governments and industries to reduce these emissions quickly and dramatically. They emphasize that every small amount of warming avoided can make a big difference for the future of the planet.

**Popular Tourist Spots Face Challenges from Too Many Visitors**

Many of the world's most beautiful and famous tourist destinations are facing a growing problem: too many visitors. This issue, often called "overtourism," is causing difficulties for local people and the environment in popular places from European cities to remote islands. While tourism brings money and jobs, when there are too many tourists, it can have negative effects.

One major problem is the impact on local residents. In cities like Amsterdam or Venice, the large number of tourists can lead to crowded streets, higher prices for daily goods, and a lack of affordable housing for locals. Some residents feel that their cities are becoming like theme parks, making daily life difficult. Transport systems can also become very busy, causing delays and discomfort.

Overtourism also harms the natural environment and historical sites. For example, too many people visiting national parks can damage plants and wildlife, while crowded beaches can suffer from pollution. Some historical buildings and landmarks can also be damaged by the constant flow of large crowds. In response, some destinations are starting to take action, such as introducing tourist taxes, limiting the number of daily visitors, or encouraging tourists to visit less popular areas to spread out the impact.`;
