A major technology company recently announced a new type of computer, called "Copilot+ PCs," designed to include advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) features directly on the device. These new computers have a special chip that helps them run AI programs very quickly and efficiently, even without an internet connection for some tasks. This means features like instantly searching through everything you've ever done on your computer, or creating new images from simple text descriptions, can happen much faster.

The goal of these new PCs is to make daily tasks easier and more creative for users. They are designed to be faster and have longer battery life than previous models, thanks to their focus on AI processing. Several well-known computer brands, such as Dell, HP, Samsung, Acer, and Lenovo, are expected to release their own versions of these new AI-powered computers later this year. This move is seen as a big step in bringing AI closer to people's everyday lives and changing how we interact with our devices.

**Four-Day Work Week Gains Popularity Across Europe**

The idea of a four-day work week is becoming more common in several European countries, with many companies reporting positive results. Instead of working five days, employees complete their usual hours in four, often with no reduction in pay. Supporters believe this system can greatly improve employees' work-life balance and overall well-being.

Trials in countries like the UK, Germany, and Spain have shown that a shorter work week can lead to higher productivity, fewer sick days, and lower staff turnover. Employees often report feeling less stressed and more motivated, which can benefit businesses. However, some challenges remain, especially for industries that require constant staffing, like healthcare or retail. Despite these difficulties, more and more companies are exploring or adopting the four-day week, hoping to create a healthier and more efficient work environment.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers to Manage Tourism**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, recently began charging a small fee for day visitors as part of its efforts to manage the large number of tourists. This new rule applies to people who visit the city for just one day and do not stay overnight in a hotel or guesthouse. The fee is being collected on specific busy days throughout the year, especially during peak seasons and holidays.

The main reason for this charge is to protect the city's delicate infrastructure and cultural heritage from overtourism. Officials hope the fee will help control crowd sizes and encourage more sustainable travel habits. Visitors need to book their visit online and receive a QR code, which can be checked upon entry. While residents and those with hotel reservations are exempt, the initiative has sparked discussions about the future of tourism in popular destinations worldwide.
