            **Thailand: Phuket Aims for 550 Billion Thai Baht in Tourism Income During Peak Season, Hopes for Pre-Pandemic Success**
            </p>
            <p>
            Phuket has set a high goal of 550 billion Thai Baht in tourism income for the upcoming busy travel season. This is because early signs show that tourism is recovering strongly, almost reaching the levels seen before the pandemic in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
            The head of the Phuket Tourist Association said that the overall future for tourism looks good. He pointed out that more international direct flights, including possibly more flights from China, are good signs for tourism to improve by the end of the year.

            **Indonesia: After Cabinet Reshuffle, 869 Million US Dollars Flow Out of Indonesia**
            </p>
            <p>
            Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto changed his cabinet, including replacing the Minister of Finance. This led to a large amount of foreign money leaving Indonesia's financial market. In just three days, 14.24 trillion Indonesian Rupiah (about 869 million US dollars) flowed out. Indonesian Rupiah securities and government bonds were the most affected.
            </p>
            <p>
            Experts believe that changes in leadership might make people think there will be changes in policy. However, if the government can clearly explain its policies, the recent outflow of money might only be a short-term reaction.

            <h1>Criminal Investigation Bureau's Central Anti-Crime Unit Finds Drug Coffee Bag Factory; Suspect Throws Drugs into Cemetery During Police Check</h1>
            <p>
            The Central Anti-Crime Unit of the Criminal Investigation Bureau today announced that they found a factory making drug coffee bags. Police said that one suspect, when stopped by police, quickly threw the drugs into a public cemetery in Changhua and then left his car to escape. However, the police still caught him and found a large amount of drugs. The case has been sent to the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.
            </p>
            <p>
            The Central Anti-Crime Unit of the Criminal Investigation Bureau held a press conference today to explain the situation. They received information that a criminal group was making and selling "Level 3" drug coffee bags in Yuanlin City, Changhua County. A special team was quickly formed with the Yuanlin Precinct of the Changhua County Police Bureau and the Sixth Precinct of the Taichung City Police Bureau. They also reported the case to the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office for guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
            Police said that after the special team found the location where the drug coffee bags were made, they started a search operation on October 14 last year. This happened at a quiet old farmhouse in Yuanlin City, Changhua County. They first caught the main suspect, a man named Zhang, who was in charge of the drug packaging factory.
            </p>
            <p>
            Police found that another main suspect, a man named Xu, ran away with finished drug coffee bags. When police tried to stop him, he drove away very fast and threw the finished drug coffee bags into a public cemetery in Yongjing Township, Changhua County. He then left his car and escaped. The police continued to look for Xu and caught him on November 13 last year at his rented home in Qingshui District, Taichung City.
            </p>
            <p>
            After a long investigation, the police found that the drug manufacturing group, led by Zhang, rented an old farmhouse in the countryside to make drug coffee bags. Then, the drugs were given to Xu to transport and sell for money. The special team found 2,398 bags of drug coffee bags, two large bags of drug pills, and one bag of the drug ingredient cathinone (weighing 269.62 grams), among other evidence.
            </p>
            <p>
            Police said that after the investigation, the case was sent to the Changhua District Prosecutor's Office. Both Zhang and Xu were charged with drug-related crimes under the Narcotics Hazard Prevention Act in August this year.
