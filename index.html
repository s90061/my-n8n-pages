Taiwanese professional golfer Yu Chun-an started strong at the PGA John Deere Classic. He made 9 birdies and 3 bogeys, finishing with a score of 65, which is 6 strokes under par. This puts him in a tie for 8th place, 3 strokes behind the leader.

The John Deere Classic golf tournament is taking place in Illinois, USA. The total prize money is 8.4 million US dollars. Yu Chun-an is the only Taiwanese player in the event.

Yu Chun-an played aggressively, especially on the three par-5 holes, trying to get eagles or birdies. He got birdies on the 2nd and 10th holes. He started from the 1st hole and got birdies on holes 2, 3, and 4. He finished the first nine holes with 31 strokes. After turning, he got 4 more birdies and 2 bogeys, but unfortunately, he had a bogey on the last hole (18th).

In the first round, Yu Chun-an hit his drives and irons very well. He hit 85.71% of his drives onto the fairway, which is tied for 7th best. He also hit 94.4% of his shots onto the green in regulation, which is the best among all 156 players.

This is Yu Chun-an's 19th tournament this year. He has made the cut in 12 of the previous 18 tournaments, and finished in the top 10 twice. He is currently 62nd on the FedEx Cup points list, which is a safe spot. He has already earned 1.96 million US dollars in prize money this year. Doug Ghim from Korea is currently leading with a score of 62.

**Labor Groups Say Government's US Tariff Talks Are Secret; Will Surround Executive Yuan if Workers are Harmed**

Labor groups in Taiwan said today that American tariffs could badly affect hundreds of thousands of workers and their families. They are upset because the government is holding "secret talks" about these tariffs. The groups said workers will not accept "funeral benefits" (money given after losing jobs) and will surround the Executive Yuan (Taiwan's main government building) if their jobs are put at risk.

US President Trump announced new tariffs (taxes on imported goods) in early April, ranging from 11% to 50% on many countries. This caused problems in the world's money markets. He later said the tariffs would be put on hold for 90 days, with only a 10% basic tariff. Countries used this time to talk with the US to get lower rates. The 90-day period for the high US tariffs will end on July 9th.

The "Taiwan Labor Alliance Against Tariff Impact" was formed on June 17th. They said the government has not talked with labor groups at all and demanded to be part of the discussions. They said they would protest if they are not included. Today, they again said the government is keeping the talks secret and has refused to talk or discuss things with labor groups.

The labor alliance said there is less than a week left until the July 9th deadline for the US tariff talks. They noted that the Executive Yuan only said in a general press release that "talks have made good progress." Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin even said that Taiwan has the power and can still create good opportunities no matter what happens.

However, the labor alliance pointed out that the government is not mentioning that different experts and research groups think the final export tariff to the US could still be at least 15% to 20%. They are also worried if the government will lower Taiwan's import tariffs from the US, which could hurt Taiwanese workers' jobs. The labor groups are very angry and worried about the government's current actions, thinking the government might have secretly decided to sell out workers' rights in the talks.

The labor alliance stated that over a hundred unions across Taiwan support them. They warned that if they find out the government plans to let workers' jobs be used as a bargaining chip or sacrificed in the tariff talks, they will gather workers from all over Taiwan to surround the Executive Yuan. They might even go inside to demand to speak with Premier Cho Jung-tai and get an explanation.

The labor alliance said that hundreds of thousands of workers and their families affected by the tariffs care most about keeping their jobs. They don't want the government's previous ideas of "strengthening workers' skills training" or "helping unemployed workers find new jobs," which only focus on support after jobs are lost, like "funeral benefits."

The labor alliance stressed that jobs are the most important thing for workers and their families to live, and they will not compromise on this. They will not accept the government selling their jobs in secret talks. They also strongly oppose any "funeral benefit" plans that assume workers will lose their jobs. They demand that the government truly promise and provide ways for Taiwanese workers to stay in their current jobs, instead of creating misleading plans to help them change jobs.

**Columbia Students Who Supported Palestine Have No Regrets, Hope Their Voices Are Heard**

Mahmoud Khalil, a student at Columbia University who supports Palestine, was arrested months ago and released on bail last month. He said in an interview that he does not regret standing up against the violence. He urged Columbia and other universities targeted by the government to listen to their students.

In March, federal immigration officers arrested Khalil at Columbia University in New York, just days after the US government started its actions against top universities.

Reuters reported that Khalil was held in an immigration prison in Louisiana for over three months. During this time, the US government increased its actions against top universities. They arrested other international students who supported Palestine and stopped billions of dollars in research funding for private universities like Columbia and Harvard, where pro-Palestine protests happened.

Less than two weeks ago, Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered Khalil, 30, to be released on bail. Khalil said in an interview from his apartment in Manhattan: "I definitely don't regret standing up against the violence... I don't regret standing up for what is right, which is against war and calling for an end to violence."

Khalil believes that the US government's attempt to silence him actually gave him a bigger platform. When he returned to New York after being released, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic member of Congress and a political opponent of the current US government, greeted him at the airport. Supporters waved Palestinian flags as Khalil reunited with his wife and son.

Two days later, Khalil spoke at a gathering on Columbia University's Manhattan campus, criticizing the university's leaders. Last week, he appeared with Zohran Mamdani, a New York State lawmaker who supports Palestine, to cheers from the crowd. Mamdani recently won the primary election and will represent the Democratic Party in the New York mayoral election this November.

Khalil said: "I didn't choose to be in this situation; ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) put me here... This has certainly greatly affected my life. Honestly, I'm still trying to understand this new reality."

He missed his graduation ceremony in May and lost his job after being released from prison. An international charity canceled a job offer for him as a policy advisor. The government could win an appeal and put him back in prison, so his main goal is to spend as much time as possible with his wife and newborn son.

Khalil was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. His wife is an American citizen, and he became a legal permanent resident of the US last year. He moved to New York in 2022 as a graduate student and became one of the main student negotiators between Columbia University and the protesting students. These students set up tents on campus and demanded that Columbia stop giving 14 billion US dollars to weapons makers and other companies that support the Israeli military.

Khalil was not charged with any crime, but the US government used a vague immigration law, saying that Khalil's words could harm US foreign policy interests and that he should be deported. However, a federal judge ruled that the government's main reason for trying to deport Khalil might be against his constitutional right to free speech. The government is appealing this decision.

Unlike Harvard University, Columbia University did not question if the government's sudden removal of funding was legal. Columbia also agreed to at least some of the government's demands, like making rules stricter for protests, as a condition for talking about getting funding back.

Khalil found Columbia's response heartbreaking. He said, "Columbia basically gave the school to the US government, letting the government interfere with every part of how higher education institutions work." Columbia said that protecting the university's academic freedom is a "red line" while they continue to talk.

Khalil urged Columbia and other universities criticized by the government to listen to their students.

He said: "Students have clear plans for how the campus can follow human rights, international law, and be open to all students, so everyone feels equal no matter their views... They (the university officials) would rather give in to political pressure than listen to the students."
