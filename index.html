<a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/taiwan-course-country-president-says-114522615.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is "of course" a country and China lacks both the historical evidence and legal proof to back up its sovereignty claims, President Lai Ching-te said on Sunday in a strong rebuke to Beijing and its stepped up political and military pressure.

China says democratically-governed Taiwan is "sacred" Chinese territory that has belonged to the country since ancient times, and that the island is one of its provinces with no right to be called a state.

Lai and his government strongly reject that view, and have offered talks with China multiple times but have been rejected. China calls Lai a "separatist".

Giving the first of 10 speeches in a series called "uniting the country", Lai drew on Taiwan's history, including the millennia-long connection of its indigenous people to other Austronesians, like native Hawaiians, to show what he said was Taiwan's separate and distinct development from China.

Taiwan's people have a record of opposing invasion, like uprisings against Japan's 1895-1945 colonial rule, and under the last imperial Chinese dynasty, the Qing, Taiwan was only considered a Chinese province for eight years, he added.

"Of course Taiwan is a country," he said at a speech to a Taiwan branch of Rotary International, pointing also to its presidential elections. "But China says no, that Taiwan is not a sovereign country."

China's Taiwan's Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment outside of office hours. China says the 1971 United Nations resolution, which took away Taipei's seat in the body and gave it to Beijing, is one of the legal bases of its claims.

Lai, who in March called China a "hostile foreign force", said it was "totally wrong" for Beijing to say that U.N. resolution had anything to do with Taiwan's sovereignty as it was only about which government was represented at the body.

China's threat to Taiwan is real, added Lai, pointing to its daily military activities around the island.

"Taiwan's future can only be decided by its 23 million people - does everyone approve of this?" he said, to a round of applause.

The defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists, and that remains the island's formal name.

**Taiwan adds China‚Äôs Huawei and SMIC to export control list**

<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/taiwan-adds-china-huawei-smic-073838565.html">News Link</a>

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) ‚Äî Taiwan‚Äôs Commerce Ministry has added Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) to its export control list, as trade and technology frictions between the self-ruled island, China and the United States increase.

Inclusion on the ‚Äústrategic high-tech commodities‚Äù list means Taiwanese companies will need to obtain export permits before selling goods to the respective companies. Other entities on the list include organizations such as the Taliban and al-Qaeda, as well as other companies in China, Iran and elsewhere.

The export control entities list was last updated on Sunday. Neither Huawei nor SMIC initially commented on their inclusion.

Huawei and SMIC have both been sanctioned by the U.S. The two companies are producing China‚Äôs most advanced homegrown artificial intelligence chips in an effort to compete with U.S.-based Nvidia and supply Chinese tech firms with the much-needed chips amid export curbs.

Taiwan is home the world‚Äôs largest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), a major supplier for Nvidia.

Last November, the U.S. ordered TSMC to halt supplies of certain advanced chips to Chinese customers as part of broader efforts to restrict China‚Äôs access to cutting-edge technologies.

China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, to be annexed by force if necessary. The U.S. is Taiwan's biggest unofficial ally and arms seller.

**SoftBank Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pitches-1-trillion-us-053937697.html">News Link</a>

(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is seeking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to realize what could be his biggest bet yet ‚Äî a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona to build robots and artificial intelligence.

Son envisions a version of the vast manufacturing hub of China‚Äôs Shenzhen that would bring back high-tech manufacturing to the US, according to people familiar with the billionaire‚Äôs thinking. The park may comprise production lines for AI-powered industrial robots, they said, asking not to be named as the plan remains private.

SoftBank officials are keen to have the Taiwanese maker of Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs advanced AI chips play a prominent role in the project, although it‚Äôs not clear what part Son sees for TSMC, which already plans to invest $165 billion in the US and has started mass production at its first Arizona factory. Nor is it clear that TSMC would be interested. A person familiar with the chipmaker‚Äôs thinking said that SoftBank‚Äôs project has no bearing on TSMC‚Äôs plans in Phoenix.

Shares of SoftBank jumped as much as 2.3% in Tokyo Friday. TSMC‚Äôs stock price rose 1.9% in Taipei.

Codenamed ‚ÄúProject Crystal Land,‚Äù the Arizona complex represents the 67-year-old SoftBank chief‚Äôs most ambitious attempt in a career that‚Äôs spanned numerous bet-the-house bids, thousands-fold-returns and billions of dollars in losses. Son, who‚Äôs often expressed disappointment in his own legacy, has repeatedly said he means to do everything he can to hurry AI development.

SoftBank officials have spoken with federal and state government officials to discuss possible tax breaks for companies building factories or otherwise investing in the industrial park, including talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the people said.

The Japanese billionaire is also personally sounding out interest among an array of tech companies, they said. The project has been floated to executives at South Korea‚Äôs Samsung Electronics Co., they said.

Representatives of SoftBank, TSMC and Samsung declined to comment. A Commerce Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Son has pulled together a list of SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio companies that might take part in the Arizona manufacturing hub, the people said. SoftBank-backed startups working on robotics and automation technologies ‚Äî such as Agile Robots SE ‚Äî may set up production facilities at the industrial complex, they said.

The plans are preliminary and feasibility hinges on support from the Trump administration and state officials. While the cost of the project as envisioned by Son may require as much as $1 trillion to execute ‚Äî a sum previously reported by the Nikkei ‚Äî the actual scale depends on interest from big technology companies. If successful, Son has floated building multiple cutting-edge industrial parks across the US.

SoftBank is exploring the Arizona project as it also moves forward on plans to invest as much as $30 billion into OpenAI and plans a $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing LLC. It‚Äôs also seeding money into the Stargate venture with OpenAI, Oracle Corp. and Abu Dhabi‚Äôs MGX, seeking to ferry hundreds of billions of dollars into data centers and related infrastructure around the world.

Those outlays come as SoftBank‚Äôs cash stood at ¬•3.4 trillion ($23 billion) at the end of March. The Tokyo-based company has since tapped its T-Mobile US Inc. stake, selling roughly a quarter of what it held in March to raise $4.8 billion this month. SoftBank also has net assets valued at ¬•25.7 trillion, of which chip designer Arm Holdings Plc makes the single largest portion, allowing it to borrow billions more as needed.

SoftBank‚Äôs exploring project financing for Stargate data centers, a model that could be adapted to a big endeavor like Crystal Land. Common for large-scale infrastructure like oil or gas pipelines, the project finance template would allow the tech investor to raise funding on a project-by-project basis and require less money upfront.

Son‚Äôs restless search for growth has resulted in projects that proceed in fits and starts, making it difficult to gauge how committed he is to any one venture. The billionaire is often goaded by the desire to boost SoftBank‚Äôs stock price and repay retail investors who‚Äôve held onto the company‚Äôs shares from before the dot-com boom and bust, people close to the SoftBank chief have said. Many investors have waited for decades for the stock to regain dot-com bubble levels ‚Äî something it‚Äôs flirted with only a few times since 2020.

If Son‚Äôs primary motivation is to clear the way for AI, it may be more cost-efficient to encourage partnerships that link manufacturing expertise with that of AI engineers and specialists in fields from medicine to robotics, and incubating smaller companies, according to Melissa Otto, head of research at Visible Alpha.

But pouring cash into data centers may help lower the cost of developing AI applications and spur broader adoption, she said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a long-term thinker, and he takes risks,‚Äù Otto said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just too early to tell.‚Äù
