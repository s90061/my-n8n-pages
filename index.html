            <h1>Cheng Cheng-chien Recall Case: "Yes" Votes Meet Minimum But "No" Votes Are Higher, So It Fails</h1>
            <p>The results of the vote to remove Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Cheng Cheng-chien from office were announced tonight. The number of votes to remove him was more than 25%, which is the required amount. However, the number of votes against removing him was much higher. The Central Election Commission's website showed that the attempt to remove him failed.</p>
            <p>According to Article 90 of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, a recall vote passes if more people vote "yes" than "no," and if the "yes" votes are 25% or more of all eligible voters in that area. If more people vote "no" than "yes," or if the "yes" votes are less than 25% of all eligible voters, then the recall attempt fails.</p>
            <p>In Hsinchu City, where lawmaker Cheng Cheng-chien was elected, there are 357,063 eligible voters. The 25% rule means that 89,266 "yes" votes were needed for the recall to pass.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission's website shared the results of Cheng Cheng-chien's recall vote tonight. A total of 210,685 people voted, which is a 59% voter turnout. There were 209,275 valid votes. Among these, 89,970 votes were to remove him from office. However, 119,305 votes were against removing him. There were also 1,410 invalid votes.</p>
            <p>Even though the "yes" votes in Cheng Cheng-chien's recall case were more than the 25% minimum, they were fewer than the "no" votes. Because of this, the attempt to remove him from office failed.</p>

            <h1>Five KMT Lawmakers in New Taipei Survive Recall Votes; Keeping Core Supporters Was Key</h1>
            <p>Today, recall votes for five lawmakers in New Taipei City all failed. Local experts say that the Kuomintang (KMT) party's organized efforts helped. Also, their plan to work with the Taiwan People's Party (TPP) helped them keep their main supporters. These were key reasons why the lawmakers stayed in office.</p>
            <p>The recall vote on July 26th in New Taipei City drew the most attention to lawmaker Yeh Yuan-chih from the 7th district (East Banqiao). The groups wanting to recall him and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) focused their attacks on Yeh. Su Chiao-hui, who leads the DPP in New Taipei City, led efforts to get people to vote. In the final days before the vote, the DPP used all its members and public workers to strongly campaign against Yeh Yuan-chih.</p>
            <p>When facing negative attacks, Yeh Yuan-chih chose a quiet approach. He worked hard to get support by visiting markets, temples, and standing on streets. With strong support from KMT Chairman Eric Chu and New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih, city council members in Banqiao helped him a lot. They held small meetings to connect with voters and keep their support.</p>
            <p>Local people believe that Mayor Hou Yu-ih and other famous politicians helped by campaigning and meeting people. Also, the organized efforts by the city council members worked well. This helped Yeh Yuan-chih keep his main supporters from the KMT, and he just managed to stay in office.</p>
            <p>In New Taipei City's first district, which includes Shimen, Sanzhi, Tamsui, Bali, Linkou, and Taishan, there are 405,060 eligible voters. For Hung Mong-kai's recall vote, 101,265 "yes" votes were needed. This was the highest number of "yes" votes needed in any district across the country.</p>
            <p>In the 2024 lawmaker election, Hung Mong-kai received 158,596 votes. This was more than half of the votes, about 58.71%, which was the highest number of votes in the country. People who know New Taipei City's politics well believe that recalling Hung Mong-kai was always going to be very difficult, based on past election results.</p>
            <p>Local people also think that even though this recall case started with civic groups, it eventually became a fight between the KMT and DPP. When the weather is bad, DPP supporters are usually more willing to vote even in the rain. KMT supporters might be less willing to go out and vote. Yesterday, it was windy and rainy. But today, there was no wind or rain, which made KMT supporters more willing to vote. This affected the final results.</p>
            <p>In New Taipei City's 12th district, which includes Xizhi, Jinshan, Wanli, Ruifang, Pingxi, Shuangxi, and Gongliao, there are 266,243 eligible voters. The New Taipei City Election Commission says that Xizhi alone has 179,536 voters. This means Xizhi has many more voters than all the other areas combined.</p>
            <p>Local experts say that in Xizhi district, there are more KMT voters than DPP voters. Liao Hsien-hsiang's family has worked in the area for a long time. His father, Liao Cheng-liang, was a council member for many years, and his mother has close ties with women's associations. Because of this, the family has many local connections and can get people to support them strongly.</p>
            <p>The recall groups strongly criticized Liao Hsien-hsiang about the budget for social housing in Baipaohu. Liao Hsien-hsiang explained that social housing must be built in the right place. He said that Baipaohu does not have good transport or environmental support. He also said that building a town there just to meet goals is not responsible. Local people believe that Liao Hsien-hsiang strongly defended himself and stopped the negative impact.</p>
            <p>When faced with attacks from the recall groups, Liao Hsien-hsiang first acted calmly. Later, he changed his plan to fight both online and on the ground. For online efforts, he posted on social media every day to answer the groups' questions. For ground efforts, he put up signs showing his achievements and asking for support. He also joined Eric Chu, Hou Yu-ih, and Taipei Deputy Mayor Li Sze-chuan to give speeches. This helped get more "no" votes against the recall.</p>
            <p>In the eighth district (Zhonghe), the KMT usually has an advantage. However, the online campaigns by the recall groups in Shuanghe and the ground efforts by DPP members created a lot of pressure for lawmaker Chang Chih-lun.</p>
            <p>Local people think that the KMT and TPP working together for campaigns clearly helped in Zhonghe district. In the 2024 lawmaker election, even with a TPP candidate running, Chang Chih-lun received 89,808 votes. This time, the number of "no" votes against his recall was 95,319. This shows that Chang Chih-lun gained more "no" votes, which means that the cooperation between the KMT and TPP increased his support.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City's ninth district, Yonghe, is seen as a strong KMT area. Lawmaker Lin Te-fu has served many terms and has worked hard with local people for a long time. For this big recall attempt, Lin Te-fu's team said they would treat it like a regular lawmaker election. Most local people believe that Lin Te-fu is good at organizing campaigns and often goes to many events. The results of the vote showed the KMT's strength, as expected, and he successfully passed the recall attempt.</p>
