<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/6885/8836895">News Link</a>

The Ministry of Education officially announced on June 27, 2025, that they have changed the rules for hiring substitute teachers in schools from high school down. The new rule says that qualified substitute teachers' work experience can now count the same as full-time teachers when it comes to salary increases. This change is a response to a decision made by the Constitutional Court last July, which said that not counting past work experience for substitute teachers was against the constitution.

In the past, how substitute teachers were paid was different in different places, and in some areas, their work experience did not count. A substitute teacher named Zhang Kaixiang was unhappy that Zhonghe High School did not count his two years of teaching experience from before. He asked the Constitutional Court to look at the law, saying that parts of the Teacher Act were unfair. The court decided that the Teacher Act was fine, but the rule about not counting previous work experience for substitute teachers was unconstitutional. The Ministry of Education was told to change the law within one year to make the rules the same across the country.

The National Substitute and Part-Time Teachers' Union said today that the Ministry of Education has now officially announced the new rules. A new part, Article 16, Paragraph 3, has been added. It says that if a qualified substitute teacher works for more than three months at a time and has a total of one year of experience, their salary can increase by one level, just like a full-time teacher.

The union said that this new rule is the first time substitute teachers are included in the salary system of the Teacher Treatment Act, Article 9. This ends the long-standing unfairness where substitute teachers' pay would not go up, no matter how long they worked. This change gives dignity and protection to substitute teachers across Taiwan.

The union also pointed out that this change has taken eight years of hard work. Zhang Kaixiang started a legal case in 2017, and then applied for a constitutional review in 2019. The union was formed in January 2023, and the Constitutional Court accepted the case. There was a discussion in March 2024, and the court ruled it unconstitutional in August 2024, giving the government one year to change the law. Now, the system has finally changed. This corrects a past injustice and helps improve the working conditions in education for the future.

The union also said that with fewer children being born and more teachers moving jobs, making sure substitute teachers are paid fairly is important. It will help keep the education system stable and keep good teachers. Having a system that counts work experience will help build a strong group of teachers and stop unfair treatment and good teachers from leaving.


**KMT Taichung Party Office Faked Signatures to Recall Green Camp Lawmakers; Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng Released on Bail for NT$1 Million Early This Morning**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/124323/8836795">News Link</a>

To fight against a big recall movement, the Kuomintang (KMT) Taichung City Party Office's First Group leader, Wu Kang-long, told 33 staff members and party workers, including Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng, to copy names from KMT member lists. They did this to create recall petitions against Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers Tsai Chi-chang and Ho Hsin-chun. They even told party members to switch between blue and black pens when copying. They faked 4,258 signatures. Yesterday, prosecutors charged 34 party members. Wu and Chen were already in custody, and after a court hearing today, they were released on bail, Wu for NT$800,000 and Chen for NT$1 million.

The Taichung District Prosecutors Office yesterday charged Wu Kang-long, Chen Jian-feng, and 32 other party members with forgery and breaking election laws. Wu and Chen were arrested in early May and had been held since then. The case was sent to court yesterday, and the Taichung District Court decided late last night to release them on bail. They got the bail money in about an hour and were released early this morning.

Prosecutors said that in mid to late January this year, the KMT Taichung City Party Office decided to fight back against calls to recall KMT lawmakers in Taichung. They also decided to start recall efforts against DPP lawmakers Tsai Chi-chang (from the first district) and Ho Hsin-chun (from the seventh district). Wu Kang-long was chosen to lead the recall efforts, and Secretary-General Chen Jian-feng was to help him.

According to the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, the recall petitions for Taichung's first and seventh districts needed 2,235 and 3,297 signatures, respectively. To quickly get enough names, Wu decided to copy names from KMT member lists to create many fake signatures.

Prosecutors found that on January 22, Wu Kang-long sent a message in the party office's LINE group. He asked executive and deputy executive officers to come to the party office the next day for a "special meeting." They were told to bring one blue pen and one black pen, and to download the lists of KMT members in the first and seventh districts to use for copying.

Prosecutors said that on January 23, the day of the "special meeting," Wu Kang-long, Chen Jian-feng, and 32 others were there. Wu explained that the recall targets were Tsai Chi-chang and Ho Hsin-chun and asked them to copy many names from the party member lists. He also told them, "Don't copy members over 80 years old, don't use simplified Chinese characters, mark down copied names on the member list to avoid copying them again, and you must switch between black and blue pens."

In total, the 34 people copied 1,710 fake recall petitions for Tsai Chi-chang and 2,502 for Ho Hsin-chun that day, making a total of 4,212. In late January and early February, Wu and Chen told party members to organize the petitions. If they saw the same handwriting appearing many times in a row, they would change the order to avoid being caught. These petitions were then sent to the Central Election Commission, with a total of 6,350 submitted.

However, after the Election Commission checked and removed invalid signatures, the recall efforts for Tsai and Ho still needed 61 and 445 more signatures, respectively. Wu and Chen then told party members to copy 10 and 36 more fake signatures to make up the difference. In the end, the Election Commission found that 2,360 signatures for Tsai's recall were valid (the minimum was 2,235), and 3,513 for Ho's recall were valid (the minimum was 3,297). But after removing the 1,720 and 2,538 fake signatures, both recall efforts clearly did not meet the minimum number of signatures.

Prosecutors said that Wu Kang-long and Chen Jian-feng, as high-level leaders in the KMT Taichung City Party Office, later deleted chat records to destroy evidence. They did not admit their guilt at first but eventually did. The other executive and deputy executive officers acted under pressure. In total, 34 people were charged with violating election laws and forgery.


**One Year After China's "22 Rules for Punishing Separatists," China's Ministry of State Security Claims to Have Caught Many Taiwanese Spies**
<a href="https://udn.com/news/story/7333/8836796">News Link</a>

It has been more than a year since China released its "Opinions on Legally Punishing Staunch Taiwan Separatists for Splitting the Country and Inciting Secession" (the "22 Rules for Punishing Separatists") in June last year. China's Ministry of State Security announced this morning that these rules clearly show its strong decision and power to protect national unity according to law. They also stated that Chinese security agencies have "caught many Taiwanese spies stealing secrets" and have broken up several spy networks.

The article also strongly criticized the current Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government. It said that for its own party's benefit, the DPP government is creating "green terror" in Taiwan, stopping others in unfair ways, and not caring about the people's well-being. It also said the DPP is trying to get close to Western countries and relying on them, throwing away national pride. The article called the DPP a "pawn" for anti-China forces. It accused the DPP of not recognizing the "1992 Consensus," twisting the meaning of "One Country, Two Systems," and treating cross-strait peace like a game, constantly seeking independence and causing trouble. The article warned that such bad actions by the DPP will only turn Taiwan into a "powder keg" and "ammunition depot," putting Taiwanese people in danger. It said that following the path of Taiwan independence will only make people tools for the DPP's private use, make them "cannon fodder" for Taiwan independence forces trying to gain independence by force, and turn them into historical criminals against the Chinese nation!

On June 28, China's Ministry of State Security said that the "Opinions" provide strong legal tools to protect national sovereignty and land, sending a clear and strong warning to Taiwan independence forces. This shows their firm decision and strong power to protect national unity according to law.

The article stated that in the past year since the "Opinions" were issued, relevant departments have used their powers fully. For example, in August 2024, the Wenzhou Intermediate People's Court in Zhejiang Province sentenced Yang Zhiyuan to nine years in prison and three years without political rights for "splitting the country." In February this year, the Shanghai First Intermediate People's Court sentenced Li Yanhe, editor-in-chief of Taiwan's Bachi Culture, to three years in prison, one year without political rights, and a fine of 50,000 RMB for "inciting secession."

Furthermore, China's Ministry of State Security and other departments named several people from Taiwan's Cyber Warfare Force who were involved in planning, leading, and carrying out cyber attacks, stealing secrets, and spying on mainland China. This strongly stopped efforts to gain independence through cyber means and created a powerful deterrent effect.

The article also mentioned that Chinese state security agencies have continued to act strongly, catching many Taiwanese spy cases and breaking up a large number of spy networks set up in mainland China. They have severely punished intelligence infiltration and divisive activities according to law, effectively protecting national security.

China's Ministry of State Security said that after the special operations "2018-Thunder" and "Thunder-2020," state security agencies will continue to strongly follow the "Opinions," fulfill their duties fully, punish illegal activities of "Taiwan independence separatists" severely according to law, and firmly stop the arrogance of "Taiwan independence forces" and foreign interference.

In August last year, China's Ministry of State Security also stated that it had "caught over a thousand Taiwanese spy cases and dismantled a large number of spy networks set up in mainland China." At that time, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded that if these "over a thousand Taiwanese spy cases" were not to exaggerate their achievements or brag, then it was another public announcement that Chinese security departments were using vague and unclear laws to illegally detain Taiwanese people who do not agree with China's political ideas and support democracy and freedom, treating them as Taiwan independence forces or spies.`;
