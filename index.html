            <h1>Jinghua City Case: Ko Wen-je Accuses Lin Chin-jung of Handling Ying Hsiao-wei's Petition, Lin Chin-jung Denies</h1>
            <p>Former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je is involved in the Jinghua City case. He accused former Taipei Deputy Mayor Lin Chin-jung of handling a petition from Taipei City Councilor Ying Hsiao-wei. Ko also hinted that Lin might have lied in court. Lin Chin-jung denied these claims today. He said that what he told the court is the same as what the Ministry of Interior believes. Lin added that Ko Wen-je is purposely attacking a witness.</p>
            <p>The Taipei District Court is hearing the Jinghua City case. Yesterday, the court watched and listened to recordings of former Taipei Deputy Mayor Peng Jen-sheng's questioning during the investigation. The court also called former Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, who is currently held in custody. Ko Wen-je wrote on Facebook about his time in court. He said that when Lin Chin-jung was Taipei Deputy Mayor and head of the Urban Planning Committee, he handled a meeting, a petition, and a discussion for KMT Taipei City Councilor Ying Hsiao-wei.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je said that Lin Chin-jung stated it was not possible to get extra building space under Urban Planning Law Article 24. However, Ko claimed that all officials from the Taipei City Department of Urban Development said it was possible. Ko Wen-je called this "lying in court" by Lin Chin-jung and stated his lawyer would give more proof.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung is now the Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor. Today, he released a statement from his office. He said he never took any petition or helped in any meeting for Ying Hsiao-wei about the Jinghua City case. From June to August 2018, the Taipei City Department of Urban Development was showing its plans for "A Full Review of Songshan District's Main and Detailed Urban Plans" to the public. During this time, the Department held public meetings, and any group of citizens could share their ideas.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung said that Jinghua City Company sent a petition during this public showing. Later, he led the Taipei City Urban Planning Committee. After all committee members shared their thoughts, the committee did not accept Jinghua City Company's ideas. They kept the first decision.</p>
            <p>Ko Wen-je said that Taipei City officials all agreed that extra building space could be given based on Urban Planning Law Article 24. But Lin Chin-jung told the court that extra building space should follow local rules or special laws for the Urban Planning Law. Lin Chin-jung replied that what he said in court is the same as a document the Ministry of Interior sent to all cities and counties on May 14 last year. It also matches what the Control Yuan said in January last year about the Jinghua City case.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung stressed that he told the court that extra building space in detailed plans should not go beyond the rules in the local laws for the Urban Planning Law. Taipei City already has the "Taipei City Urban Planning Enforcement Self-Governance Regulations" and "Taipei City Land Use Zoning Control Self-Governance Regulations." So, requests for extra building space should follow these local rules and not go beyond them. If someone asks for, or changes, a detailed plan (following the rules of Urban Planning Law Article 24) to create other ways to get extra building space, there should be clear rules for this.</p>
            <p>Lin Chin-jung believes that what he said in court is the same as the Ministry of Interior's document sent to all cities and counties on May 14 last year. It also matches what the Control Yuan said about the Jinghua City case in January last year. Therefore, Ko Wen-je's claim that Lin lied in court is clear proof that Ko is purposely attacking a witness.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: Taiwan Estimates China's 2024 Western Pacific Military Exercise Spending to Go Up by Almost 40%</h1>
            <p>Reuters reported that Taiwan's government thinks China spent about 21 billion US dollars (about 647 billion New Taiwan dollars) on military training in the Taiwan Strait, East China Sea, South China Sea, and Western Pacific last year (2024). This is almost 40% more than in 2023. Taiwan made these guesses by watching Chinese military planes and ships, and by figuring out the cost of fuel and other things.</p>
            <p>Reuters got a private study from Taiwan's military, and four Taiwanese officials said it was true. This study shows a rare look into where China might be spending its defense money. This comes as China holds bigger military exercises, which has made countries in the area and Washington worried.</p>
            <p>China's defense budget last year was about 1.67 trillion Chinese Yuan (about 7.2 trillion New Taiwan dollars). But countries in the West usually think China's official numbers are too low. China also does not say exactly how its budget is spent.</p>
            <p>Reuters said that China's Ministry of Defense and the Taiwan Affairs Office did not answer their questions. Reuters also could not check if Taiwan's estimated numbers are truly correct. Experts said that the way the study figured out the numbers is possible. But because some details are hard to check, it must have some guesses in it.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's military made a report this month about what the Chinese military is doing. It used information from Taiwan's monitoring in the Bohai Sea, East China Sea, Taiwan Strait, South China Sea, and Western Pacific to count China's navy and air force actions last year. Then, it guessed the costs based on how much fuel and supplies were used each hour.</p>
            <p>According to this report and officials who heard about the study, China's military spent about 152 billion Chinese Yuan (21.25 billion US dollars) on navy and air force training in these areas last year. This money included costs for support, repairs, and paying people.</p>
            <p>Reuters used this study to guess that these training costs were about 9% of China's military spending last year. This is more than the 7% guessed for 2023 using the same method.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense told Reuters in a statement that "China keeps making its military bigger and causing trouble in a grey area. This greatly harms peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region." The ministry did not directly talk about the military spending and numbers in the report.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hsiao Mei-chin: Praises Good Farmers' and Fishermen's Groups, Supports New Ideas for Farming</h1>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Agriculture honored farmers' and fishermen's groups that have done well in helping with money for farming. Vice President Hsiao Mei-chin said that these groups are good friends to farmers and fishermen. She also said they help new ideas in farming grow faster. She hopes these groups will help young people join farming. This will bring new life to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Agriculture held the 19th Agricultural Finance Awards today. They gave out 10 awards, including one for excellent work. 69 farmers' and fishermen's groups won awards because they did very well in their daily work, stopping cheating, and helping with farming insurance.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao came to the event today and gave a speech. She said that the Agricultural Finance Awards have been around for almost 20 years. They show how Taiwan's system for money in farming has changed and grown. She added that praising farmers' and fishermen's groups is not just about good numbers in reports. It is also about a long-term promise to the land and to farmers and fishermen. These groups are more than just places that handle money; they are the most trusted friends for farmers and fishermen.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao stated that farmers' and fishermen's groups know how farmers and fishermen live every day. They know when different crops grow and when farmers need money. If there are bad storms or changes in the market, these groups always help right away. This kind of friendly help with money is the most important thing about Taiwan's farming money system. It also helps Taiwan's farming grow well for a long time.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao pointed out that the world is changing very quickly. There are higher prices, changes in how things are made and sent, and changes in the weather. Taiwan is facing many challenges from bad weather. But with these problems, there are also new chances. For example, using more digital tools and trying to create zero carbon pollution are goals the whole world is working on. Money help for farming should not only be a good friend to farmers and fishermen but also help new ideas in farming grow faster.</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao also talked about the "battle cat" idea. She said, "We should all be like cats. We should not only catch mice in the fields but also jump quickly many times higher than we are. Sometimes, we need to watch quietly for the right time. This is like how farmers' and fishermen's groups work: they need to be flexible and strong to find chances when things change. They also need to give comfort and help when farmers need it."</p>
            <p>Vice President Hsiao said that farming is very important to Taiwan, and farmers and fishermen are the most valuable people. President Lai Ching-te and she have been working to make Taiwan better since they started their jobs. Making the farming money system modern and international is a key part of this. She hopes that, besides helping farmers and fishermen, these groups will also help young people get into farming. This will bring new energy, life, and strength to Taiwan.</p>
