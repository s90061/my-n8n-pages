Scientists have found a way to create a biodegradable plastic alternative using discarded fish parts, like scales and skin. This could offer a sustainable solution to the global plastic pollution crisis. Current biodegradable plastics often require specific, high-temperature industrial facilities to break down. This new material, however, breaks down naturally in the environment within weeks.

Researchers extracted collagen from fish waste and used it to create a strong, flexible, and transparent film. They tested its biodegradability in soil and seawater, finding it decomposed rapidly under both conditions. The research team believes this innovative material could replace single-use plastics in packaging, agriculture, and other industries. Further studies are underway to improve its durability and scalability for mass production. This breakthrough represents a significant step forward in the search for environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional plastics, potentially reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating the harmful effects of plastic waste.

**Article 2: Business - Tech Company Announces Four-Day Work Week Trial**

A leading technology firm has announced a six-month trial of a four-day work week for all its employees. The decision comes after a successful smaller-scale pilot program showed increased productivity and employee satisfaction. The company believes that reducing the work week will lead to a better work-life balance, reducing stress and burnout among staff.

Employees will receive their full salary while working only four days a week, aiming to maintain the same level of output. The company will monitor key performance indicators, such as project completion rates and client feedback, to assess the trial's effectiveness. If successful, the four-day work week could become a permanent policy. Other companies are watching the trial closely, as it could signal a broader shift towards shorter working hours in the tech industry and beyond. The CEO stated that investing in employee well-being is essential for long-term success and innovation.

**Article 3: Travel - Popular Tourist Destination Introduces Sustainable Tourism Initiative**

A popular coastal tourist destination, facing increased environmental pressure, has launched a new sustainable tourism initiative. The initiative aims to minimize the negative impacts of tourism while preserving the area's natural beauty and cultural heritage. Measures include limiting the number of daily visitors, promoting eco-friendly transportation options, and supporting local businesses that prioritize sustainability.

The initiative also focuses on educating tourists about responsible travel practices, such as reducing waste, conserving water, and respecting local customs. Information centres will provide visitors with guidelines on how to minimize their environmental footprint. The local government hopes that these efforts will encourage tourists to be more mindful of their impact and contribute to the long-term preservation of the destination. Local communities have been involved in the planning and implementation of the initiative, ensuring that their needs and perspectives are taken into account. This move represents a commitment to balancing economic growth with environmental protection.
