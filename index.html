            <h1>CDMO Business Grows; Bora Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Per Share Reaches NT$19.5 in First Half of Year</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals announced its financial results for the first half of the year. The company's revenue was NT$9.347 billion. Due to the growth in its CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) business, the net profit belonging to the parent company was NT$2.016 billion, which is an 11.9% increase from the previous year. The earnings per share (EPS) was NT$19.5, which is almost two times its capital.</p>
            <p>Bora today released a press statement. It said that because of more production capacity and new types of medicines, the CDMO business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year, reaching over NT$5.01 billion. This includes orders from inside the company. However, during a period of change, the sterile injectable plant in Maryland, USA, and the Zhunan plant in Taiwan both had delays in production, which slowed things down. But this problem got better in June, and delayed orders will be filled soon. The company has a clear view of its orders and strong long-term demand.</p>
            <p>Bora also said that it continues to invest more in its global CDMO business. The Canadian factory recently added a new production line for high-performance skin medicines. This will allow for faster, larger, and more flexible production of these orders. It will be one of the reasons for growth at the Canadian factory.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injectable production line in Maryland, USA, is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. The AST isolation filling system's automatic lines will start working in 2026. Also, in the first half of this year, clinical stage customers at the Maple Grove plant in Minnesota, USA, became stronger and long-term partners. Many drug companies have started signing contracts because they want to make their products in the USA.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheng Bao-hsi, the chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, said that the CDMO business has added 8 new customers this year. Most of these orders are handled by the Maple Grove plant, which focuses on manufacturing in North America. New orders this year are worth US$138 million, mainly from Canada and the sterile pharmaceutical plant. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego plant, which was part of the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started operations. The expansion project for 2000 liters has led many US drug companies in the later stages of development to ask about it.</p>
