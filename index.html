            <h1>FamilyMart Spends NT$15 Million on Childcare Center, Prioritizing Employee Children</h1>
            <p>FamilyMart General Manager Hsueh Tung-tu said that the company understands its employees need help with childcare. So, they will spend 15 million New Taiwan Dollars to open the "FamilyMart Childcare Center" in their main office building in Taipei City. This center will take care of babies and young children from 0 to 2 years old. It will start on September 22. Children of FamilyMart employees and their grandchildren will get to use it first. The center is also trying to become a "quasi-public" childcare center. This means it hopes to help families who do not work for FamilyMart too.</p>
            <p>FamilyMart held a visit for their new childcare center today. Mr. Hsueh said that every year, FamilyMart asks its employees what is important to them. They always say that support for childcare and flexible working hours are the two most important things. More than half of the staff at the main office are married or have young children. In the last three years, about 70 employees had a new baby each year. But for families where both parents work, or for those without family help, it is often hard to choose between caring for children and working.</p>
            <p>He said that to create a good workplace and help employees have children, FamilyMart decided to open its own childcare center. It took more than one year to plan, build, and get legal approval. The center is expected to start working officially on September 22. It can care for 52 children. It has different classrooms for different ages and play areas. Employees can easily drop off and pick up their children before and after work. The center also offers care until 7:30 PM.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsueh also said that the FamilyMart Childcare Center will ask to become a government-approved "quasi-public" childcare center. If parents and children live in Taipei City, they can apply for money from both the central government and the local government. Families with a first child could get up to 18,000 New Taiwan Dollars to help pay for care.</p>
            <p>Today, Uni-President also said that they want to create a good environment for parents. They work with childcare places to offer special prices for employees' babies or young children. This helps employees save money on childcare. Employees can also choose a center near their home or their workplace, which is good for their personal needs.</p>
            <p>In addition, Uni-President said they offer money for children's education and school scholarships. They give small gifts to pregnant mothers and their partners, gifts when a baby is born, and money for having a baby. They also have flexible work times. They have a "happiness cooperative" to help with mental and physical health and family problems. They want to help employees balance their family life and work.</p>

            <h1>Joseph Wu Writes to Swedish Media: "Taiwan Works Together" for Global Peace and Wealth</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Foreign Minister, Joseph Wu, wrote an article for a famous Swedish newspaper, "Nya Wermlands-Tidningen." The article was published on September 12. Its title was "Let 'Taiwan work together' to help global peace and wealth." In the article, Minister Wu asked people in Sweden to understand that China is wrong about how it interprets a UN resolution (Resolution 2758). He said that Taiwan is on the important "Indo-Pacific First Island Chain" and strongly protects democracy and freedom.</p>
            <p>The 80th United Nations General Assembly will begin on September 9 at the UN headquarters in New York. The main discussions will be from September 23 to 27 and on September 29.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu wrote the article to ask people in Sweden to see that China is twisting the meaning of UN Resolution 2758. He wanted to show that Taiwan, on the "Indo-Pacific First Island Chain," stands strong for democracy and freedom. He also talked about how Taiwan works with democratic countries through a "Global Democratic Value Chain." This helps to keep international rules strong. Taiwan also builds "non-red supply chains" to stop important industries from being controlled by governments that are not democratic.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu wrote in the Swedish newspaper "Nya Wermlands-Tidningen" (NWT). His article was printed on September 12, titled "Let 'Taiwan work together' to help global peace and wealth."</p>
            <p>In his article, Minister Wu said that the world is now facing many serious problems and dangers. Governments that are not democratic are using tricky ways to cause trouble. This puts international rules in danger. He said we should never think that peace will always be there.</p>
            <p>Taiwan is a very important part of the Indo-Pacific area and a necessary partner. It is located at the front of the "Indo-Pacific First Island Chain." Taiwan protects democracy and freedom against the spread of authoritarian rule. With its strong economy and complete semiconductor industry, Taiwan helps a lot with global stability and wealth.</p>
            <p>The article also said that Taiwan is the 21st largest economy in the world. It is a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor technology. Taiwan makes more than 60% of the world's chips and 90% of the most advanced chips. This means Taiwan not only helps the world economy grow but is also a key partner for development in many fields.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu stated that Taiwan is determined to protect democratic values both in Taiwan and in other countries. Through the "Global Democratic Value Chain," Taiwan makes its friendships stronger with democratic countries. This helps them together face unclear political risks, fight against authoritarian influence, promote human rights and good digital government, and keep international rules working.</p>
            <p>He said Taiwan is like an "economic sun that never sets." It leads in making semiconductors and advanced technology. This helps new ideas and progress in areas like artificial intelligence, digital technology, and healthcare. Taiwan's trade plan focuses on "non-red supply chains." This means building trusted and open networks of industries. This stops important industries from being controlled by authoritarian governments.</p>
            <p>The article also wrote that even though Taiwan helps the world a lot, other countries do not always give it enough credit. Taiwan cannot join the United Nations system. This unfair exclusion happens because China wrongly interprets UN General Assembly Resolution 2758. China connects this resolution incorrectly with its "One China Principle." It uses this resolution as a weapon to stop Taiwan from being part of international activities.</p>
            <p>Minister Wu said in his article that Resolution 2758 does not actually mention Taiwan. This resolution only decided who would represent China in the United Nations. It did not say that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China. It also did not give the People's Republic of China the right to speak for Taiwan in the UN system. However, the United Nations has given in to China's political pressure and keeps Taiwan out of international groups.</p>
            <p>He said Taiwan is actively speaking out around the world against this unfair situation and asking for international help. Now, more and more countries are saying that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important. They say this in meetings like the G7 summit. Also, many government leaders and lawmakers in different countries have openly stated that UN Resolution 2758 did not decide Taiwan's future status. And it does not stop Taiwan from joining international groups, including those in the United Nations system.</p>
            <p>At the end of his article, Minister Wu called for action. He said that as the United Nations celebrates its 80th year, and with only five years left until the UN's "2030 Sustainable Development Goals," it is a good time to include Taiwan in the international community. This would help to achieve the goals of "leaving no one behind" and "working together."</p>
            <p>"Nya Wermlands-Tidningen" started in 1837. It is the largest morning newspaper in VÃ¤rmlands LÃ¤n, a province in western Sweden. The newest survey of media in Sweden shows that the newspaper's print copy and website reach about 161,000 people every day.</p>

            <h1>Yin Yen-liang Supports Gogoro, Major Shareholder Promises NT$2.5 Billion Investment</h1>
            <p>Today, the board of directors for Gogoro announced that a main shareholder has promised to invest more money. They will invest 2.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars by 2026. This money will come from private investors. Also, the Gogoro board announced that Jiang Jia-wei, who was the acting CEO, is now the official CEO of Gogoro.</p>
            <p>Gogoro believes that its energy business will make as much money as it spends by 2026. It will start to make extra money after all costs by 2027. The business that sells vehicles is expected to make as much money as it spends by 2028.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yin Yen-liang, the head of Ruentex Group, said in a statement to the press that he has always believed in Gogoro. He strongly supports their goal of making cities sustainable (which means using resources in a way that helps the environment for a long time). He saw that the Gogoro team worked very well together and made big improvements in their business in the past year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yin Yen-liang said he feels very sure about Gogoro's future. He hopes that Gogoro will give customers even better products and services. He also hopes they will help Taiwan become "net-zero," which means not adding more greenhouse gases to the air.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tseng Da-meng, the chairman of Gogoro, said that the board will continue to help the team make their system bigger. They will focus on Taiwan first. Then, they will share their battery swapping system with countries in Southeast Asia, where there is a big chance for electric vehicles to grow.</p>
            <p>Mr. Yin Chung-yao, a member of the Gogoro board, said that helping Taiwan become net-zero and making electric scooters more common are long-term goals for Gogoro. The board thinks the team's plans, how they are growing, and their skills are very good. They fully support the team for its next step of growth.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jiang Jia-wei, the CEO of Gogoro, said that the new money will help them create new types of vehicles and batteries for the market. It will also help them find new ways to use older batteries and store energy. And it will support their plans to start in Vietnam.</p>
            <p>Gogoro explained that its leaders have improved the company's money situation and how it works this year. Gogoro keeps using special plans. These include being careful with money, organizing business tasks better, making product plans and development faster, and making the company work more effectively. The company focuses on giving long-term value to its customers and to itself. This builds a stronger foundation for growth in the future.</p>
            <p>Gogoro recently shared its financial report for the second quarter of 2025. The money the company made from its operations, after some costs, grew from 4.8 million US dollars in the first half of 2024 to 15.2 million US dollars in the first half of 2025. The company also saved about 11 million US dollars on operating costs compared to the first half of 2024.</p>
