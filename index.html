            <h1>Water Level Rises in Cat Stream in Nantou; County Chief Asks People to Move Cars from Low Areas</h1>
            <p>Nantou County has had many days of rain. Because of this, soil and rocks have become loose in many places, and some rocks have fallen. For example, a road at 13.4 kilometers on County Highway 54 has been damaged. It is now closed because it might collapse at any time. People who want to travel between Jiji and Shuili can use Provincial Highway 16 instead.</p>
            <p>The Cat Stream's water level is also going up. People are told to move their cars from low-lying areas. Taiwan's Central Weather Administration said that due to strong winds from the southwest, there will be short but heavy rain. Today, mountainous areas in Nantou County will have very heavy rain, and other parts of Nantou County will have heavy rain. According to the rain forecast at 10 AM, mountainous areas in Nantou are expected to get 100 to 190 millimeters of rain in the next 24 hours.</p>
            <p>Nantou County Chief Hsu Shu-hua said on Facebook this morning that the Cat Stream's water level is now high. She has asked the Nantou City Office to tell village leaders to announce to people to move cars from under high bridges and from low areas. They are also putting up warning tape, and water pumps are still working.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-hua also mentioned that rocks have fallen at 28 kilometers on County Highway 89. Also, the Shanlinhsi Highway is blocked due to a landslide. She has asked companies that have contracts with the government to help clear these areas.</p>
            <p>The Jiji Township Office said that the road at 13.4 kilometers on County Highway 54, before Puji Bridge, has big cracks and has sunk. It could collapse at any time. This part of the road is now closed. People going from Shuili to Jiji can use Provincial Highway 16. However, Provincial Highway 16 at 12 kilometers has been allowing only one-way traffic for several days because of a landslide on its side.</p>

            <h1>Expert Says Upgraded Kang Ding Ships with New Missile Launchers and Radar Will Improve Combat Speed and Vision</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Navy is upgrading its Kang Ding class patrol ships. These ships are now equipped with a new vertical missile launch system made by the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST), along with Sea Sword II missiles. An expert explained today that the Sea Sword II missiles can travel much farther than the old Sea Chaparral missiles. Also, the new vertical launch system does not need to move up, down, left, or right to aim at the enemy. Instead, it can fire missiles very quickly, one after another.</p>
            <p>The updated radar on the ships is a new rotating array radar. It helps the ships see the battlefield in 3D. This means they can see far away, aim accurately, and react fast. The Navy has set aside NT$43.16 billion (about US$1.4 billion) from 2022 to 2030 to upgrade the combat systems of six Kang Ding class ships. The first ship to be upgraded, the Chen De, went out for sea tests for the first time on July 28. It is expected to finish its upgrade by the end of this year and be ready for duty again. Starting next year, one ship will be upgraded each year to make the Navy stronger.</p>
            <p>The upgrades to the Kang Ding class ships include improvements to their air defense missiles, combat control systems, detection systems, towed sonar, and missile systems. For the missile system, the ships used to have Sea Chaparral short-range air defense missiles. After the upgrade, they will carry the "Hua Yang" Vertical Launch System (VLS), developed by NCSIST, which can hold 32 Sea Sword II (TC-2N) air defense missiles.</p>
            <p>The vertical launch system at the front of the ship has 8 units, and each unit can hold 4 Sea Sword II missiles. Su Tzu-yun, an expert from the Institute for National Defense and Security Research, said that the Sea Chaparral missile had a range of only about 8 kilometers. However, the Sea Sword II is expected to have a range of about 30 to 40 kilometers. It also has more missiles and can fire faster. When fighting, it does not need to move around like the Sea Chaparral missile. It can fire instantly and then turn toward the target area, and it can even fire many missiles one after another. This makes its fighting ability much better than the Sea Chaparral.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Kang Ding ships have also received the new Type 997 rotating array radar from BAE Systems in the UK. This greatly improves their ability to find things. Su Tzu-yun pointed out that the original radar on the Kang Ding ships was 2D. But the new radar is 3D, which means it can find not only the target and its distance but also its height. This gives the Kang Ding ship a full 3D picture of the battle. According to public information, it can "lock onto and track" more than 200 targets at the same time. Therefore, it can see farther, more accurately, and react faster.</p>
            <p>The Kang Ding class patrol ships are based on the French Navy's La Fayette class frigates. They belong to the Navy's 124th Fleet and their home port is Zuoying Naval Base. Their main jobs are to defend Taiwan's airspace and waters, search for submarines, protect ships, prevent blockades, and work with other surface ships to stop attacks. There are currently six ships in this class: Kang Ding (PFG-1202), Hsi Ning (PFG-1203), Kun Ming (PFG-1205), Di Hua (PFG-1206), Wu Chang (PFG-1207), and Chen De (PFG-1208).</p>

            <h1>Mercedes Driver in Guangxi Shows ID to Force Way, Causing Big Public Discussion About Special Privileges</h1>
            <p>In Guangxi, China, a man recently shared a video saying that a woman driving a Mercedes-Benz showed an "administrative law enforcement" ID to make him move his car. The man traveling with her (who was the woman's father) even knew the victim's home address and last name just from his license plate. This made the victim think that public officials were using their power wrongly. Today, the government announced their findings. They said the woman used her husband's official ID to scare the man.</p>
            <p>Media reports said that "showing off special privileges" is a serious problem. A small argument turned into a big public discussion across the country. On July 22, Mr. Li was driving in Fangchenggang City, Guangxi. When his car met a Mercedes-Benz, the female driver of the Mercedes showed an ID that said "administrative law enforcement." She forced him to give way. The man in her car (who was her father) even said Mr. Li's home address and last name directly to him, just from seeing his car's license plate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Li thought that public workers were using their power to find his private information. He was very angry and complained. But the police did not come to help. So, he put a short video about it online, and it was viewed over 10 million times. On July 31, police officers from the station came to his house late at night. They said his videos showed the woman's car license plate, which invaded her privacy. They asked him to delete the videos and apologize. He deleted the first video but then posted it again with the car plate numbers hidden, and it again got a lot of attention.</p>
            <p>At first, the police said they could not tell if the woman was a public official. But after many people complained, they announced that a special team had been formed to look into the matter.</p>
            <p>Today, the investigation team from Fangchenggang City in Guangxi announced the results of their full investigation. They said that the 28-year-old female Mercedes driver, whose last name is Hou, is not a public official herself. Her husband is a firefighter in a fire rescue station in a town in Shangsi County, Fangchenggang City. The "administrative law enforcement ID" that Ms. Hou showed was her husband's. She showed the ID to scare Mr. Li.</p>
            <p>The police are now looking into Ms. Hou's actions because they caused a bad impact on society after being shared online. Her husband, Mr. Li, did not keep his ID safe, which led to it being used illegally. The Fangchenggang City Fire Rescue Detachment has started an investigation into him for possibly breaking work rules.</p>
            <p>Regarding Mr. Li's concern that his personal information was leaked, the announcement said that Ms. Hou's family and Mr. Li's parents' family live close to each other and know each other. However, Mr. Li has worked in other cities for many years and did not know this. When the car argument happened, Ms. Hou's father got out of the car and recognized Mr. Li. That is why he knew Mr. Li's family address and other personal information at that moment.</p>
            <p>The announcement clearly stated that Ms. Hou and her father do not have access to police communication devices or other government tools that can find people's information. So, they did not look up Mr. Li's personal information at the scene.</p>
            <p>Today, Chinese media outlet The Paper commented that if a fire rescue officer's administrative law enforcement ID can be used by his wife to scare others, it shows that the idea of "showing off special privileges" still exists in some areas, and it is very common. They said that "even a very small amount of power is used to the fullest."</p>
            <p>This event also brings up questions about whether the police handled the situation and responded to people's concerns correctly. The comment said that in the age of social media, this kind of "showing off special privileges" will be greatly amplified when many people online pay attention to it. Then, it turns into a national public issue, causing a very bad image for the local area. This is a big lesson from this event.</p>
