Germany plans to work with Israel to create a shared center for cyber research. They also want to improve how their spy agencies and security groups work together. This is because threats from Russia and China are increasing. Germany wants to learn from Israel's defense skills to make its own military and civil defense stronger. Germany's interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said that military defense alone is not enough, and civil defense also needs to be greatly improved. He outlined a five-point plan to build a "Cyber Dome" for Germany's cyber defense. Also, the leader of Bavaria suggested buying 2000 missiles, like Israel's "Iron Dome" system.
