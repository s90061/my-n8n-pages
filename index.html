            <h1>Taiwanese Pool Player Wei Tzu-Chien Becomes World Number One, Thanks Her Late Mentor</h1>
            <p>Wei Tzu-Chien, a Taiwanese pool player who started playing later in life, has recently become the world's number one player for the first time. She is the fifth person from Taiwan to achieve this. She especially thanked the late famous pool player Chang Jung-Lin, also known as "Fire Cloud Evil God." She said he was like her "big senior brother."</p>
            <p>According to the newest world rankings from the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), Taiwan's Wei Tzu-Chien is now the world number one with 32076 points. She is the fifth female pool player from Taiwan to reach this high rank. The others were Liu Shin-Mei, Chen Chun-Chen, Lin Yuan-Chun, and Chou Chieh-Yu.</p>
            <p>Wei Tzu-Chien told Central News Agency that she noticed her points in the world rankings were getting closer to the top. But she became number one faster than she thought. She feels her performance this season has been good. She is learning how to win games and can now show her skills more easily during matches.</p>
            <p>Wei Tzu-Chien only started playing pool seriously at age 18. This means she began later than many professional players, which made it harder for her. After finishing university, she faced money problems. She understood that if she didn't play well in international games, she might not have enough money for her next meal. However, this made her value her time on the pool table even more. She said, "The pressure was really big back then. If I could just break even with my money, I was happy."</p>
            <p>Wei Tzu-Chien kept playing pool and never gave up. She is most thankful for a very helpful person in her life, Zou Ming-De. He is currently the head of the Women's Committee for the Chinese Taipei Billiards Federation. She said, "At first, my ranking in national games was not high. But he gave me a wild card to help me get more practice. Without him, I might have taken a long time to get better. Also, during the pandemic, I stopped playing. But his phone call made me pick up my pool cue again."</p>
            <p>Wei Tzu-Chien also mentioned Chang Jung-Lin, the famous pool player who recently passed away suddenly. She said he was like her big senior brother. They often traveled together for competitions. Chang Jung-Lin's way of motivating her was "very direct." She said, "You would never hear words of encouragement from him. But he taught me many things."</p>
            <p>Wei Tzu-Chien has always seen Chou Chieh-Yu as her goal and role model. Wei Tzu-Chien shared that without Chou Chieh-Yu, she might not be where she is today. She hopes to win a World Championship title one day. This would allow her to follow in the footsteps of other great players and truly become a "world champion."</p>

            <h1>Keeping Summer Safe: Taipei Prosecutors Office Teaches About Avoiding Drugs and Scams</h1>
            <p>To help prevent crime in communities and ensure young people grow up well, the Taipei Prosecutors Office held an event today. It was part of Guanghua Digital Plaza's anniversary celebration. The event was called "Preventing Youth Crime and Promoting Anti-Drug and Anti-Scam Awareness." Many young people joined the event, learning important lessons about law and order.</p>
            <p>This event was planned to fit the summer holiday and the many people at the shopping area. There were special booths. They used different ways to teach young people about legal dangers and common scams. These ways included asking and answering questions, quizzes with prizes, explaining real-life examples, and teaching easy phrases to spot scams.</p>
            <p>Wang Chun-Li, the head prosecutor for Taipei, said that during summer, young people have more free time and use the internet more often. This makes them easy targets for scam groups and drug dealers. The office worked with Guanghua Digital Plaza because it is a place many people know and visit often. They hope to bring legal knowledge to communities and families, helping everyone understand how to protect young people, prevent crime, and avoid scams.</p>
            <p>He said that the Taipei Prosecutors Office will continue to teach about laws in the future. They will do this by going into communities, shopping areas, and schools. Their goal is to create a safe, healthy, and law-abiding society together.</p>

China's leader, Xi Jinping, gave instructions today. He said that China has had a lot of extreme weather recently. All areas and departments must not be careless. They need to improve warnings about risks and check for hidden dangers to fix them.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that Xi Jinping first said in his instructions that heavy continuous rains caused severe flash floods in Yuzhong County, Gansu, and other places.

They need to reduce deaths and injuries as much as possible. And they should quickly fix damaged communication and transport systems.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping said that because extreme weather is happening often in China, all areas and relevant departments must completely stop being "careless."

They also need to quickly fix broken communication and transport systems. And they must move affected people to safe places without delay.</p>
            <p>He said that China is still in a very important time for flood control, from late July to early August. The National Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters in China must guide all areas and departments. They need to be more alert and take responsibility. They should improve monitoring and warnings for rain and floods. They also need to prepare for and respond to disasters. They must try their best to reduce deaths and injuries.</p>
            <p>The report also said that following Xi Jinping's instructions and Li Qiang's requests, China's Ministry of Emergency Management has sent a team to the area to help with search and rescue.
