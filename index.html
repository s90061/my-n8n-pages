A typhoon called Danas caused phones to stop working in Dingshan Village, Tainan. A politician named Kuo Kuo-wen met with phone companies and other groups. He asked them to send special cars with low-orbit satellites to help get the signal back.

He also asked for people's phone bills to be cheaper because of the problem. Mr. Kuo said that good phone service is very important when there's a disaster. He also wants the government to help companies get more satellite equipment. This way, if phone signals go out again, they can fix them quickly.

**More Teachers Needed Soon: Ministry of Education Plans for Retirements**

Taiwan's Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said that many teachers might retire around the year 2031. This is a common pattern, happening about every 30 years. To prepare for this, the Ministry of Education plans to make it easier to hire new teachers.

They want to bring in people from different jobs, especially those who work in technology. Many university students who study science and engineering choose to work in tech companies, not in schools. The Ministry also wants to help older people (around 40-50 years old) who have worked in other fields become teachers. They might offer special payments to encourage them.

The Ministry will also train more new teachers, especially for subjects like science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). They are also offering more courses for people who want to become teachers after getting their first degree. This will help make sure there are enough good teachers in schools.

**Big Shipping Companies See More Money in June**

Three large shipping companies in Taiwan, Evergreen, Yang Ming, and Wan Hai, made more money in June. This happened because of new rules about taxes in the US and many ships waiting at ports in Europe. More goods were shipped because of these tax changes.

However, the companies think that fewer goods will be shipped later because the tax rules might change back. But in the long run, they believe that the shipping industry will do well as things return to normal.

Right now, ports in Europe are still very busy, and ships have to wait for 2 to 5 days or even longer. Also, because of problems in the Middle East, most ships are still taking a longer route around Africa to stay safe.
