<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E7%BE%8E%E7%9C%BE%E9%99%A2%E9%80%9A%E9%81%8E%E4%B8%8D%E6%AD%A7%E8%A6%96%E5%8F%B0%E7%A1%A3%E6%B3%95-%E8%A6%81%E6%B1%82%E5%8A%A9%E5%8F%B0%E5%85%A5imf-220735073.html">News Link</a>

The U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed the bipartisan "Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act of 2025" on June 23. This act instructs the U.S. to use its voice and voting power to strongly support Taiwan's admission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), including its participation in economic oversight, access to technical assistance, and eligibility for positions within the IMF.

Congresswoman Young Kim, who introduced the bill, stated that joining the IMF would give Taiwan resources to strengthen its financial stability and effectively stop economic pressure from China. She emphasized that the long-standing U.S. policy toward Taiwan supports its membership in international organizations that do not require sovereign state status. Even if full IMF membership is not possible, the U.S. must continue to advocate for Taiwan's status. The bill was co-sponsored by Representative Al Green in the House and Senators Dave McCormick and Dan Sullivan in the Senate.

The U.S. has shown consistent support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in international organizations. This act reinforces that commitment by promoting Taiwan's inclusion in global financial institutions. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) responded to the bill's passage on June 24, stating that it has positive significance for supporting Taiwan's expanded international participation and countering China's pressure on Taiwan. MOFA will continue to monitor related developments closely.

**Taiwan Expo Deepens AI Cooperation with Malaysia**

<a href="https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%BD%A2%E8%B1%A1%E5%B1%95-%E6%B7%B1%E5%8C%96%E8%88%87%E9%A6%AC%E4%BE%86%E8%A5%BF%E4%BA%9Eai%E5%90%88%E4%BD%9C-213000941.html">News Link</a>

The Bureau of Foreign Trade, Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) held the Taiwan Expo this month at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre (KLCC) in Malaysia. This marks the eighth time the expo has been held, making it the largest in scale to date, focusing on AI-driven smart manufacturing and applications. TAITRA stated that Taiwan has strong capabilities in semiconductors, information and communication technology, smart manufacturing, and system integration. Meanwhile, Malaysia aims to become Southeast Asia's largest data center and accelerate its digital infrastructure development. These factors are expected to create a more extensive and complementary partnership between the two nations.

**Masa Son Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC, Trump Team**

<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-pitches-1-trillion-us-053937697.html">News Link</a>

SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is reportedly looking to partner with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to build a one-trillion-dollar industrial complex in the United States, focused on artificial intelligence. This ambitious plan, which he has also discussed with Donald Trump and his advisors, aims to create a major AI hub.

The project, named "ASI" for Artificial Super Intelligence, would involve building cutting-edge chip factories, data centers, and robotics research facilities across multiple U.S. states. The overall cost could be up to $1 trillion, with SoftBank contributing a third and the rest coming from Middle Eastern investors, U.S. debt, and other sources.

Son's vision for ASI includes manufacturing next-generation AI chips and creating humanoid robots for various tasks, from manufacturing to logistics. The initiative also seeks to bring Japanese technology companies to the U.S. to support the AI ecosystem. This massive undertaking reflects Son's belief that AI will drive significant economic growth.

TSMC, a key player in chip manufacturing, confirmed that it has received requests from various parties regarding building AI data centers and factories, and it remains open to discussions. However, the company emphasized that there are many factors to consider, including infrastructure and economic benefits, before committing to such a large-scale project.

This proposal comes as the U.S. aims to boost its domestic semiconductor production through initiatives like the CHIPS Act. Son's plan aligns with this goal by proposing a significant investment in U.S. chipmaking and AI infrastructure.
