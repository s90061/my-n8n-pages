            <h1>Ichiro Suzuki Enters Hall of Fame, Speaks in English, Says He's a "New Player" Again</h1>
            <p>(Cooperstown, New York, July 27, Central News Agency) Thousands of fans came to Cooperstown, New York, a famous baseball place in the U.S. today. They were there to welcome five great players, including Ichiro Suzuki, into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In his speech, Ichiro Suzuki joked that he was a "new player" for the third time.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ichiro Suzuki, New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia, and relief pitcher Billy Wagner joined the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame this year. Also included were Dick Allen and Dave Parker, who have passed away. All of them have touching stories about baseball.</p>
            <p>Even though many famous players were chosen this year, the most important person was 51-year-old Ichiro Suzuki. He was put into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in January this year. He is also the first baseball player to be in both Hall of Fames.</p>
            <p>As a new member of the U.S. Baseball Hall of Fame, Ichiro Suzuki said, "This is my third time being a new player." He usually used a translator when he spoke in American baseball. But this time, he gave his speech in English.</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki looked back at how he became a "new player" three times. He said, "In 1992, I was chosen after I finished high school in Japan. In 2001, when I was 27, I became a new player again. The Seattle Mariners signed me."</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki played in Japan's professional baseball league for nine years. After the 2000 season, he decided to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the U.S. He signed with the Seattle Mariners and started a great second part of his career.</p>
            <p>He joked, "I know I am a new player again... I am 51 years old, so please don't be too hard on a new player like me."</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki spoke about how he got into the Hall of Fame. He spoke in a way that was both funny and serious. He said it took a lot of preparation, being responsible for the game, and feeling like he had to do his best for the fans.</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki said he didn't think about playing baseball in the U.S. until he saw Hideo Nomo pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers on TV in Japan.</p>
            <p>He told a group of fans, including those from Japan, "My eyes suddenly opened. I wanted to try something new in a place I had never thought about. I am thankful to the Seattle Mariners for believing I could be the first player from Japan."</p>
            <p>In his first year of being eligible, Ichiro Suzuki received 99.7% of the votes. This made him the first Asian baseball star to enter the Hall of Fame. He is also the second player in history, after Yankees captain Derek Jeter, to get almost all the votes, missing only one.</p>
            <p>CC Sabathia's speech was like a love letter to all the women in his life, including his grandmother.</p>
            <p>CC Sabathia made his Hall of Fame story even better in New York. He was the winningest pitcher in Major League Baseball in 2009 and 2010. He said that signing with the Yankees was "the best decision we ever made."</p>
            <p>Ichiro Suzuki and 45-year-old CC Sabathia were chosen in their first year of being able to join the Hall of Fame. Billy Wagner was chosen in his tenth and final chance to be voted in. He played for the Houston Astros in 1999 and was named the best relief pitcher of the year.</p>
            <p>Dave Parker and Dick Allen were both chosen for the All-Star team seven times and won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. They were put into the Hall of Fame by the Classic Era Committee. Parker passed away on June 28, at 74 years old, six months after he heard the news of his long-awaited selection.

            <h1>Heavy Rain Causes Landslide on Green Island Road, Stopping Traffic</h1>
            <p>(Taitung County, July 28, Central News Agency reporter Lu Tai-cheng) Because of many days of rain, the ground became soft. This caused a landslide on the road around Green Island, near the Asahi Hot Spring. Traffic in both directions has stopped. The Green Island Township Office has sent heavy machines to fix the road quickly.</p>
            <p>This morning, people living on Green Island told reporters through messages that the ground was soft from many days of rain before. Also, it rained again last night. Early this morning, a mountain wall fell down at the 10-kilometer mark of East 90 Line in Green Island Township (near the Asahi Hot Spring on the island's road). This blocked both northbound and southbound lanes. No one or cars could pass.</p>
            <p>Residents said that police from the Green Island Police Station in Taitung County arrived. They closed the road and helped control people and cars to keep everyone safe. The Green Island Township Office said they will quickly send heavy machines to clear the road. (Editor: Hsiao Bo-wen) July 28, 2025.</p>

            <h1>Protected Sea Turtle Stuck in Net in Penghu, Coast Guard Rescues It</h1>
            <p>(Penghu County, July 28, Central News Agency) A protected Olive Ridley sea turtle was caught in an old fishing net. The Seventh Coastal Patrol Team's Qitou Inspection Station, part of the Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch, was checking the port and coast a few days ago. They heard the turtle's cries and rescued it. The turtle was sent to the Penghu Fisheries Research Institute's Sea Turtle Rescue Center for care.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Coastal Patrol Team of the Kinmen-Matsu-Penghu Branch sent out a press release. It said that on July 25, at 9:35 PM, the Qitou Inspection Station was checking the port and coast. About 10 meters from the shore, they heard a living sea turtle crying. When they went closer, they saw it was stuck in an old, broken fishing net and could not get out. It also had clear injuries. They quickly told the Penghu County Agriculture and Fisheries Bureau and the Ocean Conservation Administration's Ocean Conservation Station to help with the rescue.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Coastal Patrol Team said that the rescued sea turtle was an Olive Ridley sea turtle, which is a protected species. The turtle's shell was about 46 centimeters long and 50 centimeters wide. The coast guard and the Agriculture and Fisheries Bureau worked together to first place the turtle safely at the Qitou Inspection Station. On July 26, it was given to staff from the Ocean Conservation Station. They sent it to the Sea Turtle Rescue Center at the Penghu Fisheries Research Institute under the Ministry of Agriculture for more care.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Coastal Patrol Team stated that their staff usually patrol the sea, keep things safe, rescue people, and help citizens. They also have an important job to protect the ocean's environment. They ask people to work together to protect the valuable ocean resources. They ask people not to throw away fishing nets or other trash into the sea, because this can hurt sea animals. If you see anything illegal or need help from the coast guard, please call the "118" coast guard service line right away to help the ocean. (Editor: Chen Jen-hua) July 28, 2025.</p>
