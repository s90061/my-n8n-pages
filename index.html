            <h1>Nanfang'ao Fishing Port Cleans Over 5,000 Tons of Trash Each Year with a New Efficient Cleaning Boat</h1>
            <p>(CNA Reporter Wang Chao-yu, Yilan, October 12) Yilan's Nanfang'ao Fishing Port removes over 5,000 tons of trash every year. In the past, workers used small fishing boats to collect the trash, but this was not very efficient. Now, the fishermen's association has received money from the government. With help from the county government, they have developed a cleaning boat with a gasoline engine. This new boat makes the port cleaning work much faster.</p>
            <p>Nanfang'ao is located south of Su'ao Port in Yilan County. It has a lot of fish and is one of Taiwan's three big fishing centers. There are three fishing ports and fish markets here. According to the Su'ao Fishermen's Association, more than 5,000 tons of trash are collected from the land and water areas each year. The trash includes many different things, such as old fishing nets, old fishing tools, boat ropes, paint cans, and even boat parts made of fiberglass and broken fishing machines. Sometimes, special grab vehicles are needed to remove the trash.</p>
            <p>For the water areas, people used to rely on workers using small fishing boats to collect trash. But this was not efficient. To solve this problem, the Su'ao Fishermen's Association received government funding. With help from the Yilan County Government, they spent NT$1.97 million to build a cleaning boat with a gasoline engine. This boat started working on September 25.</p>
            <p>Wu Po-yun, the head of the Yilan County Ocean and Fisheries Development Office, told a CNA reporter today that the new cleaning boat can quickly remove floating trash from the port and nearby sea areas. She hopes it will make Nanfang'ao Fishing Port much cleaner.</p>
            <p>Wu Po-yun also said that when the county government held a party at Nanfang'ao Fishing Port this year, they also told fishermen and fishing workers not to throw trash into the port waters. If they do, they can be fined between NT$30,000 and NT$150,000 according to the Fishing Port Law. Also, there are signs in the port telling visitors to follow the rules.</p>
            <p>The Su'ao Fishermen's Association explained that the port trash could be old fishing nets from when fishermen fix their nets. It could also be trash that floats into the port with the ocean currents. The association continues to tell fishermen not to throw trash into the port. They also hope the new cleaning boat will make trash collection more efficient.</p>

            <h1>After Gaza Ceasefire, People in Europe and Australia March to Support Palestine</h1>
            <p>(CNA, London, October 12, based on foreign reports) After the Gaza ceasefire agreement started, tens of thousands of people who support Palestine marched in many European cities yesterday. Today, tens of thousands of people also marched in Sydney, Australia, to support Palestine. They felt happy about the ceasefire, but they also worried if it would last.</p>
            <p>News from AFP and Reuters says that during weekend protests, people in Europe shouted "Free Palestine" and waved Palestinian flags. Tens of thousands marched in London. About 5,500 people marched in Berlin, and about 500 people marched in Vienna to support Palestine.</p>
            <p>In Bern, the capital of Switzerland, about 2,000 people protested in the city center without permission. Some masked protesters threw fireworks. The police used tear gas and water cannons to break up the crowd, and there were fights.</p>
            <p>The Gaza ceasefire officially began at 9 AM Greenwich Mean Time on October 10 (5 PM Taiwan time on October 10).</p>
            <p>Ben Jamal, the director of the "Palestine Solidarity Campaign" (PSC), which often holds events in London during the two years of fighting between Israel and Hamas, said: "We feel happy, like the Palestinian people. But we also worry that the ceasefire may not last long."</p>
            <p>Next to the Thames River in London, many people holding Palestinian flags made a big display. On the other side, people who were against the protest waved Israeli flags and played loud music. They stood against the pro-Palestine marchers. London police said there were small fights between the groups, and "a few people were arrested."</p>
            <p>Katrina Scales, a 23-year-old sociology and psychology student who marched in Berlin, said the ceasefire was "not enough." She said she would continue to join protests in the future. Another person, Steve Headley, 50, also doubted if the ceasefire would continue.</p>
            <p>"Palestine Action," the group that organized the pro-Palestine marches in Australia, said there were about 27 marches today. The march in Sydney was the biggest, with an estimated 30,000 people. Some marchers also doubted if the ceasefire agreement would last.</p>
            <p>Pictures taken by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) showed many Australian protesters holding Palestinian flags and wearing Arab headscarves (Keffiyeh). Police said no one was arrested during the protest.</p>
            <p>Also, Israel went to Oslo, Norway, yesterday to play in a 2026 World Cup qualifying game (Europe Group I). Outside the stadium, hundreds of people gathered to protest and support Palestinians, which got a lot of attention. According to an AFP reporter, dozens of police on horses and heavily armed police officers stood outside the building.</p>
            <p>Pro-Palestine fans in the stadium briefly opened a very large Palestinian flag. Only dozens of Israeli fans waved their country's flag. One pro-Palestine activist was forced to leave.</p>

            <h1>Source Says Hamas Will Not Govern Gaza After the War</h1>
            <p>(CNA, Doha, October 12, based on foreign reports) A source told AFP today that Hamas will not be part of governing Gaza after the war. This news comes a few days after the ceasefire agreement between Israel and the Palestinian armed group Hamas started.</p>
            <p>The unnamed source said: "For Hamas, the issue of governing the Gaza area is over. Hamas will not be part of any temporary plans. This means it has given up control of Gaza, but it will still be an important part of Palestinian society."</p>
