The Central Weather Administration warned areas like Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Hengchun Peninsula, and Penghu to be very careful. They also have sea warnings for the waters around Dongsha Island, Bashi Channel, and Taiwan Strait. Ships in these areas should watch the typhoon.

Other cities and counties will continue to work and attend school as usual because the typhoon is not expected to affect them as much.

A weather expert from the Central Weather Administration said that the typhoon is getting a little stronger, and its strong wind area is getting bigger. In the next 24 hours, the strong wind area will grow to 150 kilometers. By tomorrow afternoon, it might hit Penghu and the land south of Chiayi.
