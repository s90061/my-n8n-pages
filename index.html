            <h1>TSMC Employee Steals Trade Secrets: Experts Say Impact Manageable but Image Damaged</h1>
            <p>A company that makes computer chips, TSMC, found that one of its employees might have illegally taken important company secrets. Experts in the chip industry say that this event will likely not affect TSMC's business operations too much. However, it will hurt the company's public image.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia reported that there was a possible leak of technology from TSMC. Some former employees might have taken secret information about the 2-nanometer chip process while they worked there. These employees have now been fired.</p>
            <p>TSMC said that they found unusual activity during their regular checks. After an internal check, they found that trade secrets had been leaked. They have punished the employees involved and started legal actions. TSMC did not say if the secret information was about the 2-nanometer process because the case is now with the courts.</p>
            <p>People usually think TSMC is very strict about its rules, so this event where an employee might have stolen trade secrets surprised many. Experts in the chip industry said they were surprised by what happened. But they also said that even with strict systems, it is hard to stop all bad actions by people.</p>
            <p>Experts said that TSMC has grown a lot recently and hired many new people. This makes it harder to keep the strict company culture they had before. Even though there are not enough skilled people in the chip industry, TSMC should still be careful when hiring and improve their internal checks.</p>
            <p>Experts pointed out that computer chips have become very important in recent years. They are now seen as key items for national security by many countries. TSMC is special because its advanced chip technology is the best in the world. Many countries want to work with TSMC. While TSMC expands globally, it should also be more careful to protect its business interests and its shareholders.</p>
            <p>It is still being investigated if TSMC's secret chip technology has really gone outside the company. Experts believe that if a competitor gets these secrets, they might be able to start making chips faster. However, without certain key details, it will still be hard for them to make many good chips. So, the impact on TSMC's future business should be manageable.</p>
            <p>Experts also mentioned that TSMC has sued a Chinese chip company, SMIC, for stealing their technology in the past. TSMC can also take legal action against any companies that use these trade secrets illegally this time.</p>
            <p>Experts said that this event, where an employee might have taken secret information, will surely damage the image of TSMC and others connected to it. TSMC should handle this carefully and explain the situation to the public.</p>
            <p>TSMC stated that it will continue to make its internal rules and monitoring stronger. It will also work with law enforcement when needed to make sure the company stays competitive and stable. To help employees understand more about protecting secret information, TSMC will teach them more about its Secret Information Protection (PIP) rules.</p>

            <h1>Singer Chang Hsiu-ching Holds First Concert After 45 Years, Cries Over Husband's Support</h1>
            <p>Singer Chang Hsiu-ching released her first music album when she was 11 years old. After 45 years in music, she is finally holding her dream concert. Her husband, Wang Guo-zan, who is 12 years younger, strongly supported her. He told her, "The only thing you're missing in your life is to have your own concert, and your husband will pay for it." This made Chang Hsiu-ching cry.</p>
            <p>Chang Hsiu-ching will have her "Hot Girl Arrives Concert" on August 23rd at the Greater Tainan Exhibition Center. Today, she rehearsed songs with special guests, the Taiwanese singer Tsai Hsiao-hu, Wang Cai-hua, and Wu Chun-hung. Chang Hsiu-ching and Wang Cai-hua have known each other for over 30 years. At the press conference, the two women jokingly kissed. Wang Cai-hua was happy and said she had waited a long time for her good friend to have a concert. She felt very honored to be invited as a guest. She joked, "Chang Hsiu-ching cannot stop once she has the microphone, so I need to control her."</p>
            <p>Tsai Hsiao-hu spoke with emotion, "We have a very close brother-sister friendship. I call her 'Silly Hsiu-ching.' I like that she is honest and natural, very naturally silly. She is my happy maker. We have different personalities; her directness and my shyness will create excitement on stage." Tsai Hsiao-hu also joked, "Even though the red envelope (money gift) is small, I don't mind supporting my sister!"</p>
            <p>Recently, there have been rumors that he is not well. This has bothered him a lot. He said he exercises every day and cooks often. He lives a very regular life. When he heard the rumors online, Tsai Hsiao-hu said directly, "Of course I'm not happy. I'm living well and full of energy every day!"</p>
            <p>Wu Chun-hung said, "When my godmother decided to have a concert, I felt very honored to be invited right away. I am very excited to perform on the big stage with her. I really look forward to it."</p>
            <p>With only two weeks left until the concert, Chang Hsiu-ching is very thankful for the support from her husband and good friends, including Jacky Wu. Chang Hsiu-ching has been exercising a lot for the concert. She said, "I often go to the gym for boxing, weight training, yoga, horseback riding, and very slow jogging at home. I drink bird's nest every day to protect my voice. I sleep very well. I hope I will be very energetic and make sure everyone feels they got their money's worth!"</p>
            <p>The "Chang Hsiu-ching Hot Girl Arrives Concert" will take place on August 23rd at the Greater Tainan Exhibition Center. Tickets are available for sale on KKTIX and at FamilyMart convenience stores.</p>

            <h1>Demand from Governments Like Taiwan Helps Starlink Rival Eutelsat's Revenue Exceed Expectations</h1>
            <p>Eutelsat, a French satellite company that owns the OneWeb low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite service, announced today that its total income for the year ending June 30 was better than expected. This was because more governments, like Taiwan, and businesses needed its satellite internet services.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that European governments want their own satellite solutions. They want to rely less on American satellite service providers, such as Elon Musk's Starlink. This has made Eutelsat very important this year.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat announced that its total yearly income from video services, internet connections, and government services was 1.23 billion Euros. This is about 42.5 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This amount is 0.8% higher than last year and more than the 1.21 billion Euros that experts thought it would be.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat wants to get a share of the satellite internet service market, which Starlink mostly controls. This is to make up for the money it loses from its video business, which is decreasing.</p>
            <p>However, Jean-FranÃ§ois Fallacher, the CEO of Eutelsat, told reporters today that they "will not directly compete with Starlink or Amazon's Kuiper for individual customers." Instead, they will focus on areas where they are strong, such as services for governments, internet connections on airplanes, and services for ships at sea.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat reported that its low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite business income went up a lot, by 84.1%, to 187 million Euros. Mr. Fallacher said that the increase in government service income came from their services in Ukraine and from more demand in other countries outside the United States, especially Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Even so, Eutelsat still lost 1.1 billion Euros (about 38 billion New Taiwan Dollars) for the whole year. Part of this loss was because the value of its GEO (geostationary orbit) satellites went down.</p>
            <p>Eutelsat has 34 GEO satellites and more than 600 LEO satellites. The LEO satellites are managed by OneWeb, a British company that Eutelsat bought in 2023.</p>
