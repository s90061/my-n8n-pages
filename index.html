            <h1>Ukrainian Army Hits Russian Oil Refineries, Causing Stoppages; Ukraine's Intelligence Says Western Sanctions Must Continue</h1>
            <p>Ukraine has recently increased its attacks on Russia's oil refining factories. Reports say that since August, about 10 oil refineries have stopped working completely or partly. This has made Russia keep its ban on gasoline exports until the end of this year and limit some diesel exports. Ukraine's intelligence warns that if Western countries relax their sanctions, Russia's oil industry could recover. This would be a danger in the war.</p>
            <p>News from Ukraine and other countries says that Ukrainian drones have often attacked Russian oil refineries in the past two months. For example, the "Gazprom Neftekhim Salavat" refinery, which is about 1200 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, was attacked twice in late September. An oil refinery in the Volgograd region has been attacked 6 times this year and stopped working for a month. A large "Ryazan" facility near Moscow has also been hit 5 times since January.</p>
            <p>According to a report by "The Kyiv Independent" on October 1st, Benedict George, an editor at Argus Media, an energy information group, said that since August, about half of Russia's oil refineries have been attacked by Ukraine. "Information on oil shows that Russia's diesel and gasoline exports have gone down by about 30%." He explained that if Russia usually exports 4 million tons of diesel each month, at 600 US dollars per ton, the losses are big.</p>
            <p>"Ukrayinska Pravda" reported, quoting Russian media, that by September 28th, 38% of oil refining capacity was not being used, and this capacity continued to drop, falling by 18% in September alone.</p>
            <p>BBC reported that since January, oil facilities making up 55% of all of Russia's capacity have been attacked. The attacks became more frequent from August. Reuters noted that at times, production dropped by half. This situation has affected daily life. In many parts of Crimea, gas stations are only giving fuel to business vehicles. People are also waiting in lines for gas in Moscow and St. Petersburg.</p>
            <p>Vladimir Milov, who used to be Russia's Deputy Energy Minister and is now living outside Russia, said that the Ukrainian army is not only targeting civilian places but also refineries that provide fuel to the Russian army. Experts say that Ukraine has aimed at energy places as a war goal since the beginning of the war. The recent attacks are happening more often, which means these attacks are working.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in September that attacking Russian oil refineries and storage places is the fastest way to use sanctions effectively. Ukraine's attacks on Russia's oil industry put more pressure on Russia.</p>
            <p>Russia is a main oil-producing country in the world. Oil is very important for its economy and for getting resources for its army. But Russia has not shared how much damage its refineries have suffered. Also, Russia uses "shadow fleets" to sell oil and avoid sanctions. Because of this, it is hard for people outside to know the exact economic effects.</p>
            <p>The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), an American research group, said that to stop Russia's military power, Russia needs to lose 40 to 50 billion US dollars. This is about three times what Russia earned from oil exports in July. Such a loss would seriously hurt its economy. The group suggests lowering the price of Russian oil exports to 44 US dollars per barrel. Even if China and Turkey do not help, this could still affect 60% of Russia's exports and is expected to work within one year.</p>
            <p>The report also suggests that the United States should add tariffs (extra taxes) on some countries that buy Russian oil, like India. This would make Russian oil less competitive and reduce Russia's profits from selling it abroad.</p>
            <p>Separately, "Ukrayinska Pravda" reported earlier that, according to information from Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service (FISU), Russia's Ministry of Economic Development believes that the growth in Russian oil prices next year might slow down. This is because global demand is decreasing, and countries in the Middle East and South America are producing more oil. This would put financial pressure on the Kremlin. The ministry also thinks that if Western countries lift sanctions and remove Russian companies from blacklists, Russia's economy and oil industry could recover faster.</p>
            <p>Finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) countries said on October 1st that they will work together to put more pressure on Russia. They will focus on those who continue to buy more Russian oil and help Russia avoid sanctions. In August this year, the US government put a 50% import tax on India because India kept buying Russian oil products.</p>

            <h1>Peng Jin-long: Long-Term Insurance Policies Can Be Designed Without Long-Term Guarantees, Not Without Long-Term Protection</h1>
            <p>Peng Jin-long, the head of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC), said today that new long-term insurance policies in the future can be designed without "long-term guarantees." However, this does not mean they will be without "long-term protection." For example, a period for checking and possibly changing fees could be set, perhaps every 5 or 10 years. But this change might not always be an increase. Fees could also go down if death rates change. The goal is to create a fair system for the market.</p>
            <p>The FSC held a press conference today for the Mid-Autumn Festival, led by Peng Jin-long. He talked about new rules for future insurance products.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long explained that banks do not offer 30-year fixed deposits; at most, they offer 3 years. But insurance contracts often cover very long periods. If there is no clear data or enough money, promising specific rates for 20 or 30 years in an insurance policy is not scientific and does not follow good risk management rules. Future risk factors, such as death rates, illness rates, and expense rates, can change a lot. If companies only make promises because of competition, their ability to continue running may be in great danger.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long said that the FSC wants to build a fair system. Long-term insurance policies can be designed without "long-term guarantees," but not without "long-term protection." The idea of removing long-term guarantees is still being studied. If it is put into practice for product design, everyone will need to discuss it together. The plan is for new products in the future. Long-term policies, based on their own conditions, might have a "fee adjustment period," for example, 5 or 10 years, to check conditions and see if adjustments can be made.</p>
            <p>He further explained that this adjustment might not always be a price increase. It could also be a price decrease. For example, if death rates go down, life insurance policies should cost less. This is a fair way to manage the market. It is not like the stock market's circuit breaker system. He will also ask the Insurance Bureau and the Insurance Institute to study this.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-long explained that people look at "insurance" in two ways: as an insurance system and as an insurance contract. The government body in charge must consider both. If it is about an insurance contract, the main purpose is to protect consumers. If the contract does not include a way to change fees, "there is nothing more to say; the company must deal with future possible risks."</p>
            <p>As for the insurance system, Peng Jin-long thinks that if a product continues to operate and might affect the whole insurance system, even if individual consumers are protected, it might not be good for commercial insurance companies to leave the market. So, they are also thinking about how to make the insurance system work in a stable way.</p>
            <p>Cai Huo-yan, the Deputy Director of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, pointed out that most life insurance policies are designed for many years. These policies include a promise of a fixed interest rate. Interest rates can change due to the country's economic situation. These changes might be different from what the companies first expected. This is why the Insurance Institute has been asked to study whether it is possible to agree in advance on a way to adjust the insurance amount or fees in the product design and policy terms. The Insurance Institute is still studying this, and they will look at the possibility after they receive the research.</p>
            <p>The Insurance Bureau added after the meeting that for long-term policies like whole life insurance and annuity insurance, the contract must state what conditions would allow for fee adjustments and how much they can be adjusted. If these details are not written in the contract, then adjustments cannot be made. Currently, only a few long-term health insurance products have this kind of design. For one-year medical insurance, which people are interested in, if the terms say that when renewing, the fees will be set according to the rates reported to the government body, it means the fees can be adjusted and are not guaranteed.</p>

            <h1>Hau Lung-bin Invites Cheng Li-wen and Lo Chih-chiang to Be Vice Chairmen; Chang Ya-chung Calls It 'Making Sweet Dumplings'</h1>
            <p>The KMT (Kuomintang) party chairman election will be held on October 18th. Today, media held a TV debate. Candidate Hau Lung-bin said that if he is elected chairman, he will ask two other candidates, Lo Chih-chiang and Cheng Li-wen, to be vice chairmen. They would work together to make decisions for the party and unite different generations. This would also bring out different strengths. However, another candidate, Chang Ya-chung, criticized this idea, calling it "palace politics" and "making sweet dumplings" (meaning secretly making deals). He asked Hau Lung-bin to take back his words.</p>
            <p>The KMT chairman election will have voting on October 18th. Six people have signed up to run. These include former legislator Cheng Li-wen, KMT legislator Lo Chih-chiang, former Changhua County Commissioner Cho Po-yuan, former Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin, former National Assembly member Tsai Chih-hung, and Sun Wen School President Chang Ya-chung.</p>
            <p>TVBS and UDN held the KMT chairman election debate tonight. Hau Lung-bin said in his opening speech that he would sincerely invite Lo Chih-chiang and Cheng Li-wen to be vice chairmen. They would work together on party matters, bring different generations together, and use their different skills. He said that if he becomes party chairman, his goal is to bring in new generations. But he added that changing generations should not be a tool for fighting, where one generation replaces another. Instead, it should be about generations working together.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-bin stressed that in the first 100 days after becoming party chairman, he would do three things. These include setting up a big data center for election battles; completing a plan for how different cities and counties will work together, following the main strategy of "strengthening the north, stabilizing the middle, and helping the south"; and starting a team of 100 young fighters to train more young people to help win elections.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen mentioned that when the new party chairman takes office, they must actively unite all of Taiwan. They must bring together the true opinions of most Taiwanese people. She said the party must say no to Taiwan independence and the "two states theory." They must also say no to the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's policies and ideas that want to start a war or sell out Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen stated that now is not a time to be comfortable. The KMT's job is not just to argue in the Legislative Yuan. The KMT must work hard for peace and economy in Taiwan. So, if she becomes party chairman, in the next three years, she will defend peace in the Taiwan Strait, fight against a "tariff tsunami" (a large number of tariffs), protect Taiwanese industries, farmers, and workers, and make sure that there can be a peaceful change of political party in 2028.</p>
            <p>Cho Po-yuan explained that to solve Taiwan's current problems, he believes the best solution is to suggest moving the United Nations headquarters to Taiwan. This would change Taiwan from a place of regional conflict to a place where world peace begins. If he becomes party chairman, he will use party diplomacy to invite Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump to Taiwan. They would discuss moving the UN headquarters to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>During the media Q&A part, when asked about how to deal with young people not supporting the party, Chang Ya-chung said that it's not just young people. Even he, a professor at National Taiwan University, came in second in the last party chairman election, but the party leaders ignored him. The KMT cares about whose team you are on. Isn't Lo Chih-chiang where he is today because of former President Ma Ying-jeou? Isn't Cheng Li-wen where she is today because of former Chairman Lien Chan? Isn't Hau Lung-bin where he is today because of his father?</p>
            <p>Chang Ya-chung also said in his closing remarks that Hau Lung-bin was making deals during the election. He asked if this was not "palace politics" and "making sweet dumplings." He hoped that Hau Lung-bin would publicly withdraw his statement about appointing vice chairmen. He also hoped that Lo Chih-chiang and Cheng Li-wen would publicly say they do not accept this kind of political "sweet dumpling making." He said that the election has just started, and they are already working together in this way, which is a sad thing for the KMT.</p>
