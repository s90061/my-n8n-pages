            <h1>Israel Bombs a High-Rise in Gaza City Again, Third Time in Three Days</h1>
            <p>On September 7, Israel's army bombed a tall residential building in Gaza City, which is the biggest city in the Gaza Strip. They said they were attacking a place used by Hamas, a Palestinian group. This was the third residential building in Gaza City that the Israeli army has bombed in three days.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his government agreed in August to take over Gaza City. But Israel has not officially said they have started a big attack yet. Still, the Israeli army has bombed and fought more in Gaza City recently to put more pressure on Hamas.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army said in a statement today that they attacked a tall building in Gaza City, called Al-Roya Tower. They said Hamas used this building to watch where Israeli soldiers were.</p>
            <p>The Israeli army had already told people two times to leave this building and the areas around it. They asked them to go to a "safe area" in Al-Mawasi, a place near Khan Yunis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>According to Al-Quds Hospital in Gaza City, one person died in this bombing. Hamas has said before that they do not use residential buildings for military purposes.</p>
            <p>A few hours before this, Netanyahu said at a meeting with his government that the Israeli army had increased its attacks on Gaza City. He stated, "We are doing more in the areas outside and inside Gaza City... we are destroying terrorist high-rises that we have found."</p>

            <h1>Teng Kai-wei Strikes Out 8 in First 4 Innings Against Cardinals, But Walks in 5th Lead to Loss</h1>
            <p>On September 7, Taiwanese pitcher Teng Kai-wei, who plays for the San Francisco Giants in American baseball, started a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. He struck out 8 players in 4 innings, matching his personal best for strikeouts in one game. But in the 5th inning, he lost control and walked three players in a row, which filled the bases. Then, another player hit a ball, and Teng had to leave the game. He was given the loss.</p>
            <p>Teng Kai-wei, who is 26 years old and wears number 66 for the Giants, played away against the St. Louis Cardinals today. He played very well in the first 4 innings, getting 8 strikeouts. This tied his own record from his last game against the Colorado Rockies. It also came close to the high level of strikeouts that another Taiwanese pitcher, Kuo Hong-chih, showed 17 years ago when he struck out 8 players in 3.2 innings.</p>
            <p>However, in the 5th inning, he walked three players in a row, which meant all bases were full. Then, a player hit a single, and runs were scored. Teng had to leave the game. The Giants lost the game 3 to 4. Today, Teng pitched for 4 innings, giving up 3 hits, getting 8 strikeouts, and walking 5 players. He allowed 4 earned runs, and his ERA for the season went up to 7.54.</p>
            <p>Teng threw a total of 77 pitches, and 41 of them were strikes. He did not let the other team score much in the first 4 innings and got many strikeouts, without giving up any runs.</p>
            <p>Teng gave up 4 runs in the 5th inning. He walked three players in a row, making all the bases full. Then, Lars Nootbaar, the first batter for the Cardinals, hit a single. This scored the first runs for either team in the game.</p>
            <p>Teng left the game when the score was 0 to 1 and the bases were full. Jose Butto, who replaced him, also gave up a hit and walked a player. This allowed the 3 players Teng had left on base to score. These 3 runs were added to Teng's record.</p>
            <p>Teng took the loss. This season, he has played in 6 games in Major League Baseball and has a record of 2 wins and 4 losses.</p>
            <p>Teng showed his great ability to strike out players in the first 4 innings. He got 2 strikeouts in the 1st inning, 1 in the 2nd, 2 in the 3rd, and all 3 outs in the 4th inning were strikeouts.</p>
            <p>After 4 innings, Teng had thrown 57 pitches. He had a chance to try for the record of most strikeouts in one game by a Taiwanese pitcher in Major League Baseball. Chen Wei-yin holds this record, with 12 strikeouts in 5.2 innings on July 29, 2021, against the Athletics, and 12 strikeouts in 6.1 innings on May 11, 2016, against the Brewers.</p>
            <p>But Teng's 8 strikeouts in 4 innings are already a very good performance for a Taiwanese pitcher in Major League Baseball. It is very close to the high level of strikeouts that Kuo Hong-chih showed in 2008.</p>
            <p>On May 6, 2008, Kuo Hong-chih pitched in the middle of a game against the New York Mets. He took over from the starting pitcher and got 8 strikeouts in 3.2 innings, earning the win. Kuo faced 13 batters and struck out 8 of them. Today, Teng Kai-wei faced 15 batters in the first 4 innings and struck out 8 of them.</p>

            <h1>Bolsonaro's Supporters Protest in Many Cities Before Supreme Court Coup Ruling</h1>
            <p>Thousands of supporters of Brazil's far-right former president, Jair Bolsonaro, protested in many cities today. This happened just before the Supreme Court is going to decide on a case about an attempted coup that Bolsonaro was involved in.</p>
            <p>News reports say that the Supreme Court will decide this week if Bolsonaro secretly planned to stay in power after he lost the 2022 election to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a left-wing politician.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro is 70 years old and used to be an army captain. If he is found guilty, he could go to prison for up to 43 years. This case has made his friend, former US President Donald Trump, angry.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro has been under house arrest since August, so he was not at today's Independence Day protests. These protests took place in big cities like BrasÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro, and SÃ£o Paulo. His loyal supporters gathered in the afternoon on Paulista Avenue in the center of SÃ£o Paulo. They wore clothes in the green and yellow colors of the national flag.</p>
            <p>Some supporters held signs that supported Bolsonaro and were against Lula and the Supreme Court judges. Others held signs that said, "Thank you, President Trump."</p>
            <p>The protesters asked for forgiveness for hundreds of Bolsonaro's supporters. These supporters broke into the Supreme Court, the President's office, and the Congress in BrasÃ­lia on January 8, 2023. They hope that Congress will vote to pass a law that would give forgiveness, which could eventually include Bolsonaro, even if he is found guilty.</p>
            <p>Bolsonaro was president from 2019 to 2022. He questioned Brazil's voting system but did not show any proof. Because of this, he is not allowed to run for president until 2030.</p>
