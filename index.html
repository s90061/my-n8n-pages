Many people are now using artificial intelligence (AI) apps to help with their mental well-being. These apps offer easy and private ways to get support for stress, anxiety, and other emotional issues. Users can chat with AI programs that give advice, offer calming exercises, and help track moods. People choose AI apps because they are available at any time, day or night, and can feel less intimidating than talking to a person. However, experts say that while these apps can be useful for light support, they are not a replacement for professional human therapy. There are also concerns about data privacy and how accurate the AI's advice might be. Overall, AI mental health tools are growing fast, providing a new option for self-care, but they should be used carefully alongside other forms of help.

**AI Expected to Change Millions of Jobs Worldwide**

A new report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) will significantly change many jobs around the world. The report states that AI could affect about 60% of jobs in richer countries and 40% of jobs globally. This means that AI might take over some tasks that people do now, making some jobs disappear or change completely. While some jobs might be at risk, the report also highlights that AI can make workers more productive and even create new jobs. To prepare for these changes, people might need to learn new skills. This shift is seen as a major challenge and opportunity for economies everywhere, urging governments and businesses to help workers adapt to the new digital age.

**Travel Industry Focuses on Sustainable Tourism**

The way people travel is changing, with a growing focus on protecting the environment and local communities. As more people travel, popular destinations can become crowded, and the increased number of tourists can harm natural places. To fight this, the travel industry is developing new ideas like "slow travel" and "regenerative tourism." Slow travel means staying longer in one place to truly experience it, reducing the carbon footprint from frequent transport. Regenerative tourism aims to leave a place better than you found it, by helping with conservation or supporting local businesses. Hotels are using less plastic, and transport companies are looking for greener ways to operate. Tourists are also becoming more aware, choosing eco-friendly options. The goal is to make travel enjoyable for everyone while ensuring the planet and local cultures are preserved for the future.
