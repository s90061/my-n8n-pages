            <h1>Washington Post: After US-Israel Bombing, Iran Continues Building Mysterious Underground Nuclear Facility</h1>
            <p>The Washington Post looked at satellite pictures and special reports. They found that since June, when the US and Israel badly damaged Iran's main nuclear sites, Iran has seemed to build an old underground base faster. This shows that Iran might not have stopped its plan to make nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Satellite pictures show that Iran is still building a deeper military base at a place called "Pickaxe Mountain." This place is south of Natanz, a nuclear site bombed by the US and Israel on June 22.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post said that since 2020, Iran has been digging tunnels under the Zagros mountains. These tunnels are about 1.6 kilometers south of the Natanz nuclear site.</p>
            <p>We don't know the real purpose of the Pickaxe Mountain site. International inspectors have never visited it. Rafael Mariano Grossi, who leads the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that Iran did not answer his questions about the site earlier this year.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that the rooms under Pickaxe Mountain could be about 79 to 100 meters deep. This is even deeper than the Fordow nuclear site, which the US military bombed with large bunker-buster bombs in June. In 2020, when Iran announced the Pickaxe Mountain project, it said it would build a factory there to make centrifuges. These centrifuges would replace a production site destroyed by an attack earlier that year. Centrifuges are fast-spinning machines needed to enrich uranium.</p>
            <p>An expert from Maxar company said that work on the tunnels at Pickaxe Mountain started in December of the same year. The size and depth of the site make experts think it might have another use. It could be a new secret place to enrich uranium, or a safe place for Iran to store uranium for weapons.</p>
            <p>However, experts also say that building work inside and outside the mountain does not mean Iran is quickly rebuilding its damaged nuclear weapons program or making bombs faster.</p>
            <p>Before the June bombings, Iran had collected almost 900 pounds of uranium. This uranium was enriched to 60% purity, which is close to the 90% needed for weapons. After the bombings, nobody knew where Iran's stored enriched uranium went. This makes people worry that Iran might keep gathering important materials to make nuclear weapons over time.</p>
            <p>The new building work at Pickaxe Mountain seems to be partly to make the site stronger against future attacks. During the US and Israel bombings of Iran's nuclear sites in June, the Pickaxe Mountain site was not hit.</p>
            <p>Jeffrey Lewis, an expert from the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, said: "After being attacked, Iran might decide to make this site bigger and move more activities underground."</p>
            <p>Experts asked by the Washington Post to look at satellite pictures pointed out three important changes at the Pickaxe Mountain site after the US military bombing on June 22. These changes show that work is still happening: first, stronger outside protection; second, a stronger tunnel entrance; and third, more dirt dug out, which means underground building continues.</p>
            <p>Sarah Burkhard, an expert from the Institute for Science and International Security, said that strengthening and covering the tunnel entrance makes it harder to bomb. This means it will be more difficult to destroy the entrance and make the entrance collapse.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says Gaza Deal Near, Can End War Lasting Nearly Two Years</h1>
            <p>US President Trump said today that he believes a deal to end the war in the Gaza Strip is coming soon. He said this after talking with Israel and Arab countries recently.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Trump told reporters at the White House, "I think we have a deal."</p>
            <p>He also said, "It looks like we have a deal for Gaza. I believe this deal will free the hostages and end the war."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump did not give more details.</p>
            <p>This week, leaders from around the world met at the United Nations headquarters in New York. While they were there, the US announced a 21-point peace plan for the Middle East. The goal of this plan is to stop the war between Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian armed group, which has been going on in the Gaza Strip for almost two years.</p>
            <p>According to Steve Witkoff, a special representative from the US, this plan was given to officials from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan on the 23rd.</p>
