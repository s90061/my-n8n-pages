            <h1>Dapu Community in Pingtung Keeps Hakka Culture Alive with Rooster Competition for Bobo God's Birthday</h1>
            <p>The Dapu community in Nanzhou Township, Pingtung County, is known as a Hakka 'dialect island'. Its main religious center, Dapu Fude Temple, is celebrating the birthday of Bobo God. A castrated rooster competition was held yesterday, and tonight there will be an award ceremony and a celebratory feast. This continues a tradition from when northern Hakka people moved south hundreds of years ago.</p>
            <p>According to the Dapu Community Development Association, Dapu community is a Hakka 'dialect island' in Nanzhou Township. It is only two neighborhoods of Wanhua Village, with about 70 to 80 households and more than 300 people. The villages around it mostly speak Taiwanese. The early residents here moved from the Hsinchu and Miaoli areas. They brought northern Hakka culture with them.</p>
            <p>Dapu Fude Temple, the main temple of the Dapu community, celebrates Bobo God's birthday every year on the second day of the eighth lunar month. Besides two days of religious plays, a competition for the heaviest castrated rooster is held the day before. The roosters are then used for the birthday celebration. This year, the winning rooster weighed 14.1 catties (about 8.46 kg). It was raised by 73-year-old Zhuang Huan-xin, who often wins this competition.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Huan-xin said that it is hard to raise chickens now because of the weather. If it's too hot, they need a fan. If it's too cold, they need a lamp. The temperature must be kept at about 26 degrees Celsius. The winning chicken was raised by him for a whole year with great care. He said it was 'harder than taking care of a child.' He is a wax apple farmer. The prize money for the rooster competition is only NT$3000. He raises the chickens not for money, but to pass on the Dapu Hakka spirit.</p>
            <p>Dai Xiao-ping, a Nanzhou Township representative and a daughter of the Dapu community, said that her ancestors moved here from Hsinchu and brought Hakka culture. In the past, older people in the village were farmers. They raised chickens, ducks, and geese in their traditional courtyards. What was special was that Hakka people raised castrated roosters that could grow very fat. They raised them for a whole year to offer to the gods. Now, Fude Temple has been built for 40 years, and the younger generation must continue these traditions. This year, they held the rooster competition and religious plays again. But for the first time, a follower sponsored a bluefin tuna, and there was a tuna cutting show at the celebratory feast.</p>
            <p>According to the Dapu Community Development Association, the Dapu community was a riverbed of the Shalaun River around 1912. It was empty and wild grass grew along the riverbanks. Dai Ran, a person who moved from a Hakka village in Hukou Township, Hsinchu County, placed a stone under the bamboo behind the big banyan tree where the temple now stands. He honored it as the God of Earth. The temple was built and finished in 1985.</p>

            <h1>Famous Moose Travels Across Europe, Caught in Austria and Released Near Czech Border</h1>
            <p>A young male moose named Emil became very famous this summer. He traveled through several countries in Central Europe and even gained almost 26,000 followers on Facebook. But yesterday, Austrian officials caught him and set him free near the border with the Czech Republic.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Emil likely traveled south from Poland or the Czech Republic all the way to Austria. In the past few weeks, he was in many international news stories. People also followed his every move on social media.</p>
            <p>However, Emil's journey ended yesterday. He was getting dangerously close to a busy highway in Upper Austria. Wildlife officials in Austria used tranquilizers to catch him.</p>
            <p>Emil was fitted with a GPS device. Then, he was released back near the border between Austria and the Czech Republic. Austrian officials said they will watch where Emil goes for 30 days.</p>
            <p>The Austrian wildlife officials released Emil near Sumava National Park in the Czech Republic. This park is on the edge of the Bohemian Forest, which is home to a small group of moose.</p>
            <p>The Austrian newspaper 'Kurier' reported that Emil's departure 'was not completely his own choice.' Local media compared this event to Austria's strict rules for sending people out of the country.</p>
            <p>Tierschutz Austria, an animal welfare group in Austria, criticized the capture of Emil. They said the action 'was not clear enough.' They also said that there should be clear hunting rules to better protect wild animals.</p>
