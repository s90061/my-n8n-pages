            <h1>Former US National Security Advisor Looks at US-Russia Summit: Trump Did Not Lose, But Putin Won</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 15 â€“ After US President Trump and Russian President Putin finished their talks about the war between Russia and Ukraine in Alaska today, John Bolton spoke. He was the White House National Security Advisor during Trump's first time in office. Bolton said that Putin was clearly the winner of these talks.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that John Bolton said, "Trump did not lose, but Vladimir Putin clearly won. Trump did not get anything else, only more talks."</p>
            <p>Bolton also said that Putin "made big progress in making the relationship better. I always thought this was his main goal."</p>
            <p>Bolton pointed out, "He avoided sanctions, and he did not have to agree to a ceasefire. Also, the next talks were not planned. Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, did not know anything before this press conference. It is still too early for things to end, but I would say Putin achieved most of his goals. Trump got very little."</p>
