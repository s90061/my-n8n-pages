            <h1>Memory Outlook Is Good, Micron Reaches New High, Phison Leads Other Companies to Rise</h1>
            <p>The demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is very strong. This means the future of the memory market looks good. Micron, a big memory company, reached a new very high price for its shares. This also made the share prices of other memory companies, like Adata and Phison, go up a lot. For example, Phison's share price went up to its daily limit, reaching 644 New Taiwan Dollars. This is the highest it has been in 16 months.</p>
            <p>Micron's business with data centers is growing a lot. People think Micron will continue to benefit from the high demand for AI. This pushed Micron's share price up a lot. On September 11, it reached its highest price ever at 156.26 US dollars. It closed the day at 150.57 US dollars, which was a 7.55% increase.</p>
            <p>Because Micron's shares did so well, other memory companies like Phison also saw their share prices go up today. Phison's shares hit their daily limit, reaching 644 New Taiwan Dollars. This is the highest it has been in 16 months.</p>

            <h1>Microsoft and OpenAI Sign Agreement, Allowing OpenAI to Become a For-Profit Company</h1>
            <p>Microsoft and OpenAI announced today that they have signed an agreement. This agreement allows OpenAI to change into a company that aims to make money. Eventually, OpenAI wants to become a normal company and offer its shares to the public. This means their partnership is entering a new stage.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the exact details of this new agreement are not yet known. However, both companies said they are working to finish the final terms. OpenAI and Microsoft have been talking for a long time, and these discussions have made progress. OpenAI wants to raise money to develop artificial intelligence under a more typical company structure, and finally, to go public.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Microsoft invested 1 billion US dollars in OpenAI, which was a new company. In early 2023, Microsoft added another 10 billion US dollars. Based on their earlier agreement, Microsoft had the special right to sell OpenAI's software tools using its Azure cloud computing platform. Microsoft also had the right to use OpenAI's technology first.</p>
            <p>Microsoft used to be the only company providing computing resources to OpenAI. But this year, Microsoft allowed OpenAI to have more freedom. OpenAI can now build its own data centers as part of its "Stargate" plan. This plan includes a large contract worth 300 billion US dollars with Oracle and another cloud agreement with Google.</p>
            <p>As OpenAI's income has grown to billions of US dollars, it started looking for a more common company structure. It also started working with other cloud providers. This helps OpenAI sell more and make sure it has enough computing power for its needs.</p>
            <p>Microsoft, on the other hand, wants to keep using OpenAI's technology even if OpenAI says it has reached a human-like level in the future. This is because, according to their earlier agreement, if OpenAI's board decides that its AI has achieved Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the partnership could end.</p>
            <p>Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI, wrote in a memo that the non-profit part of OpenAI will get over 100 billion US dollars under the current agreement. This amount is about 20% of the 500 billion US dollars it is looking for from private investors. This will make OpenAI a non-profit organization with a lot of money.</p>
            <p>The two companies did not say how many shares Microsoft will own in OpenAI. They also did not say if Microsoft will still have the special right to use OpenAI's newest models and technology.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Bank Lowers Home Loan Approval Rule from 200% to 180%</h1>
            <p>To give more financial help to people who do not own a home and want to buy one, Taiwan Bank announced on September 11 that it will change a rule. For people who want to buy their first home, the bank will lower the income-to-debt ratio from 200% to 180%. This means the bank will still manage risks carefully.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank sent out a press release on the evening of September 11. It explained that this change is in line with a new government rule. This rule states that the Youth Home Loan, which started on September 1, will not be counted in the limits of Article 72-2 of the Banking Act. To provide more financial support for people who want to buy a home to live in, the bank will lower the income-to-debt ratio for these buyers from 200% to 180% starting from that day. The bank will still check for risks in giving loans.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank stated that when checking loan applications, it will follow the rules from the Bankers Association and other government bodies. The bank will look at each person's credit history, what the money will be used for, how they will pay it back, and how the loan is secured. Then, it will decide on the right amount and terms for the loan.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank added that the income-to-debt ratio is a key measure of a person's ability to pay back a loan. This change means that people who do not own a home can borrow more money for a house, if their income and other conditions are the same. However, the maximum loan amount will still not be more than 80% of the purchase price or the assessed value, whichever is lower. The bank hopes this will make it easier for people who do not own a home to get money to buy one, helping more of them to have a stable home.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank stressed that to help people manage their money risks, it actively cares for and reminds loan applicants. It advises them to think about their own financial situation and plan their household income and expenses. This is to avoid financial ups and downs that could affect their quality of life and ability to pay back the loan, and to keep good credit.</p>
