            <h1>Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group Supports Taiwan; Lin Chia-lung: Work Together to Build a Democratic, Non-Red Supply Chain</h1>
            <p>Warsaw, September 30 (CNA) â€“ Today, Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung went to a party hosted by the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" in Poland. More than 20 senators and representatives from different political parties in Poland came to show their strong support for Taiwan. Lin Chia-lung said that Taiwan and its like-minded partners in Europe, including Poland, will work together to make democracy stronger. He also hopes to work with Poland to create a strong, democratic supply chain that is not controlled by certain countries.</p>
            <p>Many important people were at the party. These included MichaÅ‚ Kaminski, the Vice Speaker of the Polish Senate; Krzysztof Truskolaski, the leader of the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group"; Beata MaÅ‚ecka-Libera, the vice leader; and MichaÅ‚ Gramatyka, another vice leader who is also a deputy minister for digital affairs. It was special because more than 20 members of the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" traveled from different places to Warsaw for the party, even though the parliament was not meeting.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung spoke at the event. He said that Taiwan and Poland are partners who share the same ideas. He truly thanked the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" for releasing a joint statement in April. This statement supported Taiwan's participation in international groups and helped keep peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. It was also the first time they referred to a European Parliament decision. This decision said that China was wrong to interpret UN Resolution 2758. It stressed that this resolution did not mention Taiwan and did not make any decisions about Taiwan's status.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung also said that Taiwan not only believes in freedom and democracy but also helps the world through working together in economy and technology. Taiwan will continue to use "total diplomacy" to work with its like-minded partners in Europe, including Poland. They will make democracy stronger and build a strong alliance based on shared values that benefits everyone.</p>
            <p>Lin Chia-lung pointed out that trade between Taiwan and Poland has improved this year. Michal Jaros, a deputy minister from Poland's Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, has visited Taiwan twice with large groups. This shows that Poland really wants to improve trade cooperation. In June this year, Taiwan agreed to let fresh blueberries from Poland be sold in Taiwan. This will help Polish farmers and Taiwanese buyers. Also, Taiwan and Poland can work together well in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, advanced computer chips, and defense industries. He hopes both sides can create a strong, democratic supply chain that is not controlled by certain countries.</p>
            <p>MichaÅ‚ Kaminski, the Vice Speaker of the Polish Senate, said that Taiwan and Poland share the same values of freedom and democracy. They will work together against authoritarian powers like China and Russia. He said the two countries are the best partners, and the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group" will keep working hard to improve their relationship.</p>
            <p>Krzysztof Truskolaski, the leader of the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group," welcomed Lin Chia-lung to Poland again. He said his group is the largest group in the Polish parliament that focuses on a single country. This shows that the Polish parliament, with members from different parties, strongly supports Taiwan. The group will continue to support Taiwan's involvement in international affairs and peace in the Taiwan Strait. They will show their strong support for Taiwan with real actions. They will also help make cooperation stronger in areas like trade, science, and culture.</p>
            <p>Beata MaÅ‚ecka-Libera, a vice leader of the "Poland-Taiwan Parliamentary Group," also spoke. She said she has been part of the Polish parliamentary group that supports Taiwan for 16 years. Lin Chia-lung's visit to the Warsaw Security Forum this time shows that their connection is becoming even closer.</p>
