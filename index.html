            <h1>Zelensky Hopes Trump Can Help Stop Russia-Ukraine War Like Middle East Truce</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelensky spoke with US President Trump today. Zelensky said he hopes Trump can help stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, similar to how he helped create a truce in the Middle East. Zelensky wants Trump to bring peace to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that if Trump can stop one war, he can stop other wars too.</p>
            <p>Russia attacked Ukraine's power systems yesterday. This caused power outages in Kyiv and nine other areas. Zelensky called Trump today after these attacks.</p>
            <p>Zelensky wrote on Facebook that his call with Trump was "very good and helpful." He also praised Trump for his "excellent" work on the Middle East truce plan.</p>
            <p>Zelensky added, "If a war in one area can end, then wars in other areas can definitely end too, including the war with Russia." He asked Trump to put pressure on Russia's government (the Kremlin) to start peace talks for the Ukraine-Russia war.</p>
            <p>Trump and Zelensky had a disagreement when they met in the White House in February. But now, their relationship seems much better. Lately, Trump has been stronger against Moscow and has shown understanding for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In September, Trump wrote on his social media, "Truth Social," that Kyiv should try to "take back" all its occupied lands with help from Europe and NATO.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, former US First Lady Melania Trump said that she has a special way to talk with Russian President Putin. She said this connection helped free Ukrainian children who were taken by Russia.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian officials reported that Russia attacked the Odesa region in southern Ukraine today. At least 5 people died, and some areas lost power.</p>

            <h1>Wu Der-rong: Hot Days Until October 18, Northeast Monsoon Arrives on October 19</h1>
            <p>Today, the weather agency released a warning about high temperatures. Five areas, including Greater Taipei, should be careful of temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that it will be mostly hot during the day until October 18. He expects a northeast monsoon, bringing cooler air, to arrive on October 19. Also, there is a tropical weather system forming east of Taiwan. We need to watch how these two systems will affect the temperature drop and rain.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration gave a high-temperature warning today. It will be sunny and hot across Taiwan. New Taipei City, Yunlin County, Tainan City, and Pingtung County have an orange warning, meaning temperatures might stay above 36 degrees Celsius for a while. Taipei City has a yellow warning, meaning temperatures could reach 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote in his column today. He said that the newest European weather models show mostly sunny to partly cloudy weather today and tomorrow. It will be quite hot during the day, so people should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. In the afternoon, there might be small, scattered showers in the mountains.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu also noted that the latest European models show sunny to partly cloudy and hot weather from October 12 to 18. In the afternoons, there will be local, short rain showers in the mountains. The eastern part of Taiwan might also have some scattered rain.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong explained that different weather models now show that the northeast monsoon, carrying cold air, will generally move south starting from October 19. Areas facing the wind will get rain, and temperatures will slowly drop. However, another tropical weather system is developing on the east side of Taiwan. The interaction of these two systems (cold and hot) makes the weather predictions more uncertain. Key things to watch are if the "co-effect" will influence Taiwan, how low temperatures will go, and how much it will rain.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also mentioned that the latest path prediction from the weather agency shows that Tropical Storm Nakri is south of Japan today. It is moving faster towards the east-northeast and will miss mainland Japan.</p>

            <h1>Partly Cloudy to Sunny with Scattered Showers in Eastern Taiwan; Afternoon Thunderstorms in Mountains and South of Chiayi</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Administration says that most areas today will be partly cloudy to sunny. The eastern part of Taiwan and Hengchun Peninsula will have small, short rain showers. In the afternoon, areas south of Chiayi and other mountain areas will have local, short thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>For temperatures, eastern Taiwan will be about 31 to 32 degrees Celsius. Western Taiwan will be 32 to 35 degrees Celsius. In some parts of Taipei and New Taipei, Yunlin, Tainan, and Pingtung, temperatures might reach or go above 36 degrees Celsius. If you are outside, please protect yourself from the sun and drink plenty of water.</p>
            <p>For the outlying islands: Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will be sunny to partly cloudy. Temperatures will be around 26 to 32 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Nakri, the 23rd typhoon of the season, is northeast of Ryukyu. It will move towards the east-northeast, south of Japan. It will not directly affect Taiwan's weather.</p>
            <p>According to the Ministry of Environment's air quality forecast: Today, the wind will mainly come from the east. The wind in western Taiwan will be a bit weaker, so pollution might build up more easily. In the afternoon, ozone levels might go up because of sunlight and chemicals. The air quality in Yilan, Hualien, Taitung, and Penghu will be "good." Hsinchu-Miaoli, Central, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Matsu, and Kinmen will have "normal" air quality. Northern Taiwan will have "orange alert" air quality.</p>
