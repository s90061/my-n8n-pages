Taipei, July 15 (CNA) San Yuan Energy, a company owned by TCC Group, had a fire at its Xiaogang factory on July 14. TCC Chairman Chang An-ping stopped his work trip abroad and quickly came back to Taiwan. He went to the factory and said they will fully check why the fire started and hold people responsible. This is to make sure their high-tech customers around the world can still get their orders and business continues as usual.

Also, TCC announced today that the San Yuan Energy battery factory has completely stopped working. It is not yet clear if they will be fined. The company is still checking how this will affect their money and business.

A press release from TCC said that after Mr. Chang An-ping arrived at the factory today and listened to reports from senior managers, he learned that the factory had not talked much with the local community. He asked senior managers from the main office and San Yuan Energy to form a special group. This group will rebuild how they talk to neighbors to make sure information is clear and to answer the community's worries.

Mr. Chang An-ping pointed out that even though the San Yuan factory had many automatic sensors in the area where the fire started (called the formation area), with over 332,800 temperature sensors and 17,400 smoke sensors, and a multi-step disaster plan, it is clear that the system did not work as expected during this event.

Mr. Chang An-ping stressed that a special investigation team has been formed. The most important thing now is to go back into the factory after it cools down to find computers and cameras. They will check all the information, look at all past records of how the equipment worked and its settings. They need to find out why the system's reaction was different from what happened at the scene. They will fully investigate if it was a problem with management, human error, or if the machines themselves had problems.

Mr. Chang An-ping said that inside the company, they will hold people strictly accountable. If there were any mistakes in management or if staff were responsible, they will be dealt with according to company rules. Outside the company, they will also hold the equipment makers responsible, especially since the equipment for the San Yuan factory came from very famous companies worldwide. These companies should have a lot of experience in making battery equipment. They will deeply investigate if the equipment had any problems or design faults. They will also take legal action right away to ask for fair payment and for the companies to fix their issues.

Mr. Chang An-ping noted that Molicel, the company's battery cell brand, is Taiwan's only important top-tier battery supplier for international clients. These clients need a lot of Molicel's advanced batteries. This event could have a big effect on the global high-tech industry. He hopes to reduce the problems for customers getting their orders as much as possible. E-ONE Moli Energy, the parent company of San Yuan Energy, has already started checking and moving production capacity at its factory in Tainan Science Park. They want to make as many batteries as possible to help with the orders that are affected.

***Starbucks in North America Requires Employees to Work in Office 4 Days a Week; Those Who Disagree Can Leave***

Seattle, July 14 (CNA) The American coffee company Starbucks today told some of its managers who work from home to come back to the office. Also, all company employees will need to work in the office four days a week, instead of the previous three days.

The Associated Press reported that Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol wrote in a letter to employees that starting in early October, staff must work in the office four days a week, not three as before.

Starbucks, whose main office is in Seattle, said that its "people leaders" (managers who oversee staff) must come back to work at the Seattle main office or the Toronto office within 12 months. In February this year, the company only asked managers who were Vice Presidents or higher to work in Seattle or Toronto.

Starbucks said that the individual employees who work under these managers will not be told to move to the office. However, for all new jobs and job changes in the future, employees will need to work in Seattle or Toronto.

Niccol wrote in the letter: "We are building our office culture again because working together brings the best results. We will share ideas better, use our creativity to solve problems, and act faster."

Niccol said that if employees who are affected do not want to move, they can choose a "voluntary separation program" and receive severance pay.

Many employees got used to working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, in the past year, more and more companies have asked employees to come back to the office. Big employers like Amazon, AT&T, and the U.S. federal government have asked employees to work in the office five days a week. Jobs that allow full-time remote work are very popular.

Lori Torgerson, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said she could not say how many employees are currently "people leaders" or are allowed to work remotely. Starbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, including coffee roasters and warehouse staff.
