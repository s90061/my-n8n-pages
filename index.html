            <h1>13 National Forest Recreation Areas Offer Half-Price Tickets During National Day Holiday</h1>
            <p>The Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture announced today that 13 national forest recreation areas will offer half-price tickets during the National Day holiday from October 10th to 12th. People can enjoy the colorful scenery of the national forests, where green trees slowly change to autumn colors.</p>
            <p>The 13 national forest recreation areas managed by the Agency include Taipingshan, Neidong, Manyueyuan, Dongyanshan, Lalashan, Dasyueshan, Baxianshan, Aowanda, Alishan, Kenting, Shuangliu, Zhiben, and Chihnan.</p>
            <p>The Agency said that in early autumn, different national forest parks show many beautiful views. The beech trees along the Taipingshan trail are turning golden, creating a shining golden path. The green maple trees in Manyueyuan are turning red like autumn clothes. In Dongyanshan, Lalashan, Baxianshan, and Alishan, red maple leaves decorate the trails, bringing a strong feeling of autumn. Aowanda's beautiful bald cypress trees are also turning red, matching the red maple leaves in the forest. In Dasyueshan, you can often see wonderful clouds and sunsets in the evening. The autumn colors appearing among the green mountains show the rich and varied beauty of the forest recreation areas.</p>
            <p>For national forest recreation areas at lower altitudes, such as Neidong, Shuangliu, Kenting, Zhiben, and Chihnan, the weather becomes cool and pleasant in autumn. Neidong and Shuangliu have waterfalls with many negative ions. Kenting has silver leaf buttress roots that protect the forest quietly. Zhiben has huge banyan trees with many roots. Chihnan keeps the important Halun forestry culture. All these are good places for a relaxed forest trip in autumn.</p>

            <h1>Man from Miaoli Released from Prison and Attacks People Again; Village Head Calls Him a "Time Bomb"</h1>
            <p>A 48-year-old man, Mr. Chiu, from Miaoli City, hurt two primary school children and one man with a knife yesterday. He had done a similar random attack 10 years ago. Now, he has done it again. The local village head sadly said he is like a "time bomb." He wondered how such a person could be changed.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou Wen-cheng, the head of Shangmiao Village in Miaoli City, told Central News Agency today that the event happened in front of the convenience store across from his office. Yesterday afternoon, when school ended, a teacher from the after-school care center nearby rushed over with the injured girl, Ms. Ting. The teacher was scared and shouted, "He's killing people! He (Mr. Chiu) has attacked several people!"</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou said that the girl's chest was bleeding a lot. He and others there quickly called 119 and the police. They used two towels to help stop the bleeding. The girl felt weak and almost fainted. Her situation was dangerous.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou added that a neighborhood leader saw the attacker randomly hurt people with a knife and then leave on a motorcycle. The leader tried to follow but could not catch him. Later, he gave the license plate number to the police. The police quickly found out that the attacker was Mr. Chiu, who had done a random attack in the same convenience store 10 years ago. Many police officers then went to Mr. Chiu's home and arrested him.</p>
            <p>In 2015, Mr. Chiu was thought to be confused after taking drugs. He went into a convenience store with sharp scissors and randomly stabbed people who were shopping. Four people, including a police officer, were hurt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chou said that Mr. Chiu was sentenced to more than 8 years in prison. He was released in March this year and only recently returned to Miaoli City. The local community felt peaceful for a few months. But yesterday, he did the same thing again. This made everyone feel scared and worried. Mr. Chou truly does not know how such a person can be "reformed."</p>
            <p>Please love life and stay away from drugs. You can call the Drug Hazard Prevention Center hotline at 0800-770-885 for information on quitting and professional help.</p>

            <p>Digital change is happening now in industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching net-zero carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and businesses. They are important for Taiwan's future ability to compete. The Central News Agency's team reports how the government and different industries use AI to make production better and create new green ideas. They show Taiwan's industry growing stronger again.</p>
