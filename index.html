Many people in the United States are changing how they spend money. This is happening because prices for many things are going up, a situation known as inflation. Even though people are still buying goods and services, they are becoming more careful with their budgets.

Instead of buying expensive, well-known brands, many shoppers are now choosing cheaper store brands. For example, they might buy a supermarket's own brand of cereal instead of a famous national brand. This change is clear in places like grocery stores.

Also, people are thinking more about how they eat out. Some are choosing to eat at restaurants less often, or they are picking places that are not as expensive. Companies that sell goods and services are noticing these changes in customer behaviour. This shows that families are trying to make their money last longer in today's economy.

**How AI Technology is Changing Jobs**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a new technology that is having a big effect on the world of work. A recent report explains which jobs might change the most and which might be safer because of AI.

Jobs that involve simple, repeated tasks or working with a lot of data are more likely to be affected by AI. For example, jobs like data entry, customer service, and some types of administrative work might see more changes. This is because AI can do these tasks quickly and accurately.

However, many jobs are less likely to be taken over by AI. These include jobs that need strong human skills like creativity, working closely with other people, or solving complex problems. For instance, doctors, nurses, artists, teachers, and managers are generally safer from AI because their work requires human understanding, emotions, and unique thinking.

Experts say that workers will need to learn new skills to work alongside AI. The goal is not for AI to replace all jobs, but to change how we work and make some tasks easier.

**"Skip-Gen" Travel: Grandparents and Grandchildren Traveling Together**

A new and popular way of traveling is becoming common: "skip-gen" travel. This means that grandparents take trips with their grandchildren, but without the children's parents. This trend is growing in popularity around the world.

There are several reasons why families choose "skip-gen" trips. Often, parents are very busy with work or other responsibilities and cannot join every family holiday. Grandparents, on the other hand, might have more free time and money to spend. They also want to build stronger relationships and create special memories with their grandchildren.

These trips can be anything from a simple weekend getaway to a long international adventure. For grandchildren, it's a chance to explore new places and bond with their grandparents in a unique way. For grandparents, it brings joy and keeps them active. This trend shows how different generations are finding new ways to connect and enjoy travel together.
