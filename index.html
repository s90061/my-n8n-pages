NATO announced that its Secretary-General, Mark Rutte, will visit Washington D.C. on July 14 and 15. He will meet with U.S. President Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.

The reason for Rutte's visit was not stated. However, Trump recently told NBC News that the U.S. is willing to help Ukraine with weapons through NATO. He also said he would make a "major statement" on July 14.

So far, the weapons sent to Ukraine by the Trump government were approved by the previous Biden government, which strongly supported Kyiv.

**Jensen Huang: US Re-industrialization Helps Taiwan**

Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, an American AI chip company, said in a CNN interview that the U.S. should "rely less on other countries" and bring technology manufacturing back home. He thinks this "re-industrialization" of manufacturing in the U.S. is the "right thing to do."

Huang also mentioned that the U.S. should invest in manufacturing because there are "missing parts" in the industry right now. He added that the ability to make things is very good for economic growth and a stable society. People don't need a PhD to have a good life and career.

The Trump government has used tariffs to try and restart American manufacturing, hoping to help the car and energy industries and encourage investment in technology. Huang believes that moving manufacturing back to the U.S. would also make things easier for Taiwan.

Taiwan is home to TSMC, the world's largest chip maker. In March, Trump said that TSMC would invest at least $100 billion more to build factories in the U.S. Huang stated that having a complete industry and manufacturing system makes the U.S. stronger and reduces its dependence on other countries, which he sees as a smart move.

**Hsieh Su-wei Loses in Wimbledon Women's Doubles Final**

Taiwanese tennis star Hsieh Su-wei and her partner Jelena Ostapenko from Latvia lost in the Wimbledon women's doubles final today. They played for almost two and a half hours but were defeated 6-3, 2-6, 4-6 by Elise Mertens and Veronika Kudermetova. Hsieh missed her chance to win her 10th major title.

Hsieh, who is 39 years old, has won 9 Grand Slam doubles titles (women's and mixed doubles). She is known as the "Queen of Mix-and-Match" because she has won women's doubles with four different partners.

At the start of the match, Hsieh and Ostapenko were down 1-3 in the first set but then won five games in a row, taking the set 6-3. In the second set, Mertens and Kudermetova quickly got ahead 5-1 and won it 6-2. In the final set, Hsieh and Ostapenko were leading 4-2, but Mertens and Kudermetova played more aggressively and won four straight games to take the match.

After the match, Hsieh joked that she should go back to playing singles. She also said she was happy with how they played and thanked the fans. Mertens has won Wimbledon and the Australian Open with Hsieh before. Kudermetova won her first major doubles title.
