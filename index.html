            <h1>UN Summit to Be Held, US Refuses to Issue Visas to Palestinian Officials</h1>
            <p>The United States said today that it will not give visas to members of the Palestinian Authority who want to attend the UN General Assembly in September. France is leading efforts to recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, this unusual step brings the Trump government closer to the Israeli government. The Israeli government strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state. It tries to link the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank with Hamas, an opposing group in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The US State Department said in a statement: "Before the UN General Assembly, Secretary of State Marco Rubio refused to give and also cancelled visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority."</p>
            <p>The State Department added: "The Trump government has stated that holding the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority responsible for not keeping their promises and harming peace is good for our national security."</p>
            <p>When Trump faced legal problems after leaving office, he used the term "lawfare" to describe his situation. Now, the State Department uses this idea to accuse Palestine of fighting a "lawfare" by making complaints against Israel to the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.</p>
            <p>The State Department asked the Palestinian Authority to stop "trying to get one-sided recognition for an imagined Palestinian state."</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority released a statement through its official news agency, WAFA. It said that the Palestinian Authority "asks the US government to think again and take back this decision." It also said this action "clearly breaks international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement."</p>
            <p>Gideon Saar, the Foreign Minister of Israel, posted on social media platform X. He thanked the Trump government for "taking this brave step and standing with Israel again."</p>

            <h1>Super Micro Reveals Weaknesses in Financial Controls, Stock Price Drops Nearly 5% During Trading</h1>
            <p>Super Micro Computer, a company that makes special servers for AI, said again that it still has problems with how it manages its money and financial reports. Today, its stock price fell by almost 5% during trading in the US market.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Super Micro shared in documents submitted on August 28th that unsolved problems could "negatively affect" the company's ability to report its business results on time and correctly.</p>
            <p>In its yearly report for the period ending June 30th, Super Micro repeated a similar statement it made in its May quarterly report. The company also said it is working to fix these problems.</p>
            <p>Last year, Super Micro, which is based in San Jose, California, missed the deadline in August to give its yearly financial report. Then, in October, Ernst & Young, an accounting firm, stopped working with Super Micro. This happened because they had worries about how the company was managed and how open it was.</p>
            <p>Super Micro submitted its delayed yearly report earlier this year.</p>
            <p>Today, Super Micro's stock price dropped a lot during trading. If the fall continues, the company could lose more than 1 billion US dollars from its market value, which is about 26 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Dell, a company that competes with Super Micro, also saw its stock price drop by about 10% today. This happened because making AI servers is expensive and there is more competition. This took away from good hopes about the demand for AI technology.</p>
