            <h1>Ji Lian-cheng: Hualien County Government Must Finish Local Evacuation Plan</h1>
            <p>Ji Lian-cheng, who is the main coordinator for the Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center's forward command post, said today that there are four conditions to remove the red alert for the landslide dam lake. Today, they will ask the Hualien County Government to complete its local evacuation plan. The Ministry of Interior will hold a meeting for the central government's part.</p>
            <p>The landslide dam lake in Mata'an Creek, Hualien, has caused serious damage to Guangfu Township. Ji Lian-cheng said at a press conference this morning that the landslide dam lake is still under a red alert. The current water volume is 6.4% of what it was before the overflow, which is about 5.85 million tons. There are four conditions to remove the red alert.</p>
            <p>He explained that the first condition is whether the water flow from the landslide dam lake will cause harm. The second is that the 2,860-meter-long safety dike has been repaired and made 5 meters higher. It now has three layers of protection, with the last layer of earthen dike covered with steel mesh and cement for strength. The third is to clear the area; 200,000 to 300,000 cubic meters have already been dug out, and more will be dug deeper. The last condition is the evacuation plan. Today, they will ask the county government to finish the local evacuation plan, and the Ministry of Interior will hold a meeting for the central government's part.</p>
            <p>Ji Lian-cheng also said that today's work has four main points. These include cleaning all side ditches in the disaster area, with all cleaning expected to be done by the 18th. Fozu Street, from the beginning to Bao'an Temple, has been made a separate area of responsibility. A military colonel will be in charge of rescue work for the area north of Fozu Street, and Fozu Street is expected to be fully recovered in two days.</p>
            <p>He added that Fenglin Township has been made the 8th disaster rescue area. Today, inspection teams went to check everything. Starting tomorrow, Fenglin Township will be an important area. Central and county government units, volunteers, and soldiers will go to Fenglin Township, and a military lieutenant colonel will be in charge of the rescue work.</p>
            <p>Ji Lian-cheng stated that relevant construction associations will start helping with safety checks today. They will check if damaged houses are safe and possible to live in. After the safety checks are done, repair work will begin.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Ji Lian-cheng said that Guangfu Junior High School, Dajin Elementary School, and Guangfu Elementary School will reopen tomorrow. The conditions for reopening are all met. Dajin Elementary School is still housing affected residents. The school has agreed to keep the residents and students in separate areas so they don't bother each other. Some grades at Dajin Elementary School were originally supposed to study at Tabalung Elementary School, but today it was confirmed that all grades will study at their original school.</p>
            <p>He said that Guangfu Vocational High School is in a severely affected area. Even though the teaching spaces are ready, due to safety concerns, online classes will be held tomorrow. In-person classes will start on the 13th.</p>

            <h1>Huang Kuo-chang Plans to Run for New Taipei Mayor; White Camp Confirms Looking for Office Location</h1>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan, a New Taipei City councilor from the Taiwan People's Party, said today that party leader Huang Kuo-chang has said many times that he wants to be the best choice for New Taipei. Recently, Huang Kuo-chang asked Chen Shih-hsuan to find a good place in New Taipei to set up Huang Kuo-chang's campaign office for mayor.</p>
            <p>In a press release, Chen Shih-hsuan said that when he was on a radio show today, the host Huang Yang-ming asked him about Huang Kuo-chang's campaign plans in New Taipei City. Chen Shih-hsuan replied that Huang Kuo-chang is preparing for the 2026 New Taipei mayoral election as planned.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan also said that the Taiwan People's Party's service centers in different New Taipei areas are still working in their communities. Also, a team for city policy research is being formed. They will discuss important issues about New Taipei.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-hsuan stated that Huang Kuo-chang will open a campaign office for the New Taipei mayoral election. He has been asked to help find a suitable place for the campaign team to work from. This shows that Huang Kuo-chang is serious about running for mayor.</p>
            <p>When asked if there are now "two suns" in the Taiwan People's Party after former leader Ko Wen-je was released on bail, Chen Shih-hsuan said that from what he has seen, Ko Wen-je and Huang Kuo-chang work well together. In the past, people said the Taiwan People's Party was a party with only one strong leader. But now, with Ko Wen-je's leadership experience and Huang Kuo-chang's strength, their combined effort will only help the party.</p>

            <h1>E-Signature for Referendum to Change Constitutional Litigation Act is Stuck; Group Plans to Set Up Signature Station in Banqiao</h1>
            <p>A group of ordinary people called "People Are the Masters Volunteer Group" has started a referendum to change the Constitutional Litigation Act. This is the first time in history that a referendum has used electronic signatures. However, after more than two months, less than 10,000 signatures have been collected in the second stage. The volunteer group plans to set up a regular stand in Banqiao starting in late October. They hope many people will sign to reach their goal of almost 300,000 signatures.</p>
            <p>The "People Are the Masters Volunteer Group" has proposed four referendums about the Constitutional Litigation Act and the Act on Recall and Dismissal of Public Officials. These acts were passed by the Legislative Yuan last year. The referendum on the Constitutional Litigation Act wants to remove the limit on the number of judges in the Constitutional Court. The time to collect signatures for this is from the end of July this year to the end of January next year. There are three referendums on the Act on Recall and Dismissal of Public Officials. These want to remove the rule that you must include a copy of your ID card when proposing or signing a recall, and also remove the punishment for using someone else's personal information to sign. The time to collect signatures for these is from the end of September this year to the end of March next year. For all four referendums, more than 293,228 signatures are needed in the second stage. If they get enough signatures, the referendums will be held on August 28, 2027.</p>
            <p>Zhao Wei-cheng, a member of the "People Are the Masters Volunteer Group" and the main person for the referendums, told CNA today that they are mostly using volunteers to spread the word by going around, or working with some shops to set up signing points. However, the number of signatures is not very good. All four referendums are still far from reaching 10,000 signatures, which was unexpected.</p>
            <p>Zhao Wei-cheng said that collecting over 2,000 paper signatures in the first stage was easier. At that time, they set up stands at Yonglian Temple in Luzhou or at Qingniao events, and many people were willing to sign. Electronic signatures should be a better way because they are more environmentally friendly, convenient, and faster, and people can do it from home. But perhaps people don't know about the referendum signature news. Also, they need to pay NT$250 to get a Citizen Digital Certificate to use a card reader for electronic signatures, which has become a barrier.</p>
            <p>He mentioned that they plan to set up a stand outside a McDonald's at the corner of Fuzhong Road and Nanmen Street in Banqiao, starting in late October. Volunteers will be there every day from 10 AM to 10 PM with computers and card readers. People can bring their Citizen Digital Certificate to sign there. They also hope to have stands in other cities and counties starting in November for people to sign.</p>
            <p>Zhao Wei-cheng stressed that people can get a Citizen Digital Certificate at any household registration office in 5 to 10 minutes. In the future, this certificate can be used not only to apply for passport renewals online or register household changes online, but also for electronic signatures in referendums. Electronic signatures are very accurate and protect personal information well, so they should become the main way to sign for referendums. He, as the main person for the referendums, must use his own Citizen Digital Certificate to log in to the website provided by the Central Election Commission. This allows him to see the total number of signatures, the first few numbers of the signers' ID cards, and the signing time. He cannot see any other information.</p>
            <p>Zhao Wei-cheng emphasized that people have the right to vote on unfair laws. He hopes that people across the country or interested groups will value this chance to speak out through a referendum vote. If, after their best efforts, people nationwide still decide not to pass the referendums, they will accept that result together. However, during the process, they want to try their best.</p>
