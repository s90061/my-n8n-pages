            <h1>UN Supports Palestinian State Without Hamas; Israel Calls It Shameful</h1>
            <p>Today, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution. It supports a "two-state solution" for Israel and Palestine. But the resolution says Hamas cannot be part of it. Israel said this decision would make Hamas want to continue fighting.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the UN General Assembly voted for the resolution. 142 countries said yes, 10 countries (including Israel and the United States) said no, and 12 countries did not vote.</p>
            <p>The resolution clearly said that Hamas is wrong. It also asked Hamas to give up its weapons.</p>
            <p>The resolution is officially called "New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution." It clearly states that "Hamas must free all hostages." The UN General Assembly also said Hamas's attacks on civilians on October 7, 2023, were wrong.</p>
            <p>The resolution also asked for "group action to stop the war in Gaza." It wants a fair, peaceful, and lasting solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, based on the two-state solution.</p>
            <p>Hussein al-Sheikh, who is a high-ranking official in the Palestinian Authority, welcomed the news. He said it "shows that countries around the world want to support our people's rights." He also said it is an important step to end the occupation and create an independent state.</p>
            <p>But Israel said the UN General Assembly's vote to support a "Palestinian state without Hamas" was shameful. They believe it will make Hamas continue the war.</p>
            <p>Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry, wrote on social media platform X: "This resolution does not help bring peace. Instead, it makes Hamas want to continue the war. Israel thanks all the countries that did not support this shameful decision in the Assembly."</p>

            <h1>Trump: Will Send National Guard to Memphis to Fight Crime</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump said he will send the National Guard to Memphis, Tennessee. This is his newest plan to stop crime. However, some people who do not agree with him say this move is like a dictator's action.</p>
            <p>The President, who is from the Republican Party, has already sent the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington. He promised to send them to other cities too, like Chicago and New York.</p>
            <p>Some people living in these cities like the National Guard being there. But other people complain that the National Guard is not good at dealing with crime. They also said this action mainly targets immigrant groups.</p>
            <p>Trump spoke on Fox News and said: "We are going to Memphis. Memphis has a big problem. The mayor is happy, and the governor is happy... We will fix the problem like we did in Washington."</p>
            <p>Memphis is a city where most people are Black. It has a Democratic mayor. The governor of Tennessee is from the Republican Party.</p>
            <p>This week, Trump's government started a new action against immigrants in Chicago. They are looking for people they call "the most dangerous criminals." Trump has also often said he would send the National Guard to Chicago. He has argued with Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, who is a Democrat, on social media.</p>
            <p>Trump said that sending the National Guard to Washington and Los Angeles and removing people had stopped crime by immigrants in those cities. This is one of his main promises for his election campaign.</p>

            <h1>WB Boxing World Championships: Chen Nien-chin Gets Bronze Medal After Semi-Final Loss</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's "anti-cancer female boxer" Chen Nien-chin fought in the WB World Boxing Championships in Liverpool, UK, today. She competed in the semi-finals of the women's 65kg division. She fought against Navbakhor Khamidova from Uzbekistan until the very end. Sadly, Chen lost 2-3, but she still won a bronze medal.</p>
            <p>This was the first World Championship organized by World Boxing (WB) after it was recognized by the International Olympic Committee. More than 60 countries and 500 boxers took part.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's good boxer, Chen Nien-chin, faced Khamidova in the semi-finals today. They had fought before in the Paris Olympics quarter-finals last year, where Chen won 5-0.</p>
            <p>Today, they fought again, and Khamidova was ready. In the first round, she threw many strong punches that hit Chen well. Four out of five judges gave Khamidova 10 points.</p>
            <p>In the second round, Chen Nien-chin attacked more. Both boxers hit each other many times in the middle of the ring. It was not clear who was doing better. Still, three out of five judges gave Khamidova 10 points. After two rounds, Chen Nien-chin was behind by a score of 1-3.</p>
            <p>In the final round, Chen Nien-chin tried to turn the fight around. Also, Khamidova seemed a little tired. Chen hit her opponent many times at the start of the round. But in the last minute, her opponent defended better, making it hard for Chen to attack. Even though four judges gave Chen Nien-chin 10 points in the third round, she still lost by a total score of 2-3.</p>
            <p>Coach Ko Wen-ming told CNA that falling behind in the first round was key. He said Khamidova was an experienced boxer, so it was hard to catch up. He felt it was a shame, but he still wanted to praise Chen for winning a bronze medal.</p>
            <p>After Chen Nien-chin stopped at the semi-finals, only Huang Hsiao-wen from Taiwan is left in the women's 54kg semi-finals. She is expected to fight Lim Ae-ji from South Korea, who won a bronze medal at the Paris Olympics, at 7:45 PM Taiwan time.</p>
