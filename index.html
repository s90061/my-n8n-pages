Taiwan's stock market went up 534.34 points last week, and foreign investors bought a lot of shares, over NT$117.2 billion. Investment firms say that Nvidia's stock reaching a new high has made AI-related stocks popular again. However, because of the conflict between Israel and Iran, and because the US tariff exemption will end on July 9, the market is waiting to see what happens next. Also, worries about currency exchange losses later on mean that the Taiwan stock index might go up and down a lot in the third quarter.

On June 27, the Taiwan stock market moved little but ended at its highest point, 22580.08, up 87.74 points (0.39%). The market is doing well because people feel more positive about investing. This week, the market went up 534.34 points (2.42%), with an average daily trading amount of NT$377.755 billion.

Looking at what big investors did: only local dealers sold stocks for the sixth week in a row, selling NT$21.475 billion. Foreign investors and investment trusts both bought stocks again. Foreign investors bought a lot, NT$117.204 billion, which is the most they've bought in one week this year. Investment trusts bought NT$7.48 billion for the seventh week in a row. In total, the three main types of investors bought NT$103.209 billion worth of stocks.

Liao Ping-Kun, a fund manager at PGIM Securities, said that Nvidia's stock reaching a new high has made AI-related stocks popular again. Electronic stocks have recovered and gone above their average prices, which has also helped the Taiwan stock market stay above 22266 points. He expects the market to keep growing steadily as different types of stocks take turns doing well.

However, Liao Ping-Kun also said that because the conflict between Israel and Iran is still going on, and because the US tariff exemption ends on July 9, the market is waiting to see what happens. Also, if the currency keeps getting stronger, it could cause losses when companies report their income in July and their second-quarter financial results. He advises people to watch if investors' feelings are affected by these risks.

Liao Ping-Kun explained that because of tariff changes and currency strength, the Taiwan stock index is very likely to go up and down a lot in the third quarter.

President Securities Investment Consulting Co. said that after going down and then up a lot in April and May, most investors thought the market would stay flat in June. But in June, the Taiwan stock market kept going up, passing 22000 points and its yearly average. TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) was the main reason for this.

President Securities Investment Consulting Co. said that after US President Trump announced "equal tariffs" on April 2, the market changed a lot. Then he said he would wait 90 days. Now, July 9 is the day that period ends. If Trump gives up his original plan and just puts a general 10% or 20% tariff on things, then the tariff war might end. They also said to watch the financial reports of US companies in mid-July, such as Google, Microsoft, and Meta, as they are important for showing how the AI market is doing.

**Strengthening Construction Site Safety: Taoyuan's 3 New Site Management Measures Start in July**

Taoyuan City's Building Management Office will start new rules on July 1 to make construction sites safer. These rules include showing monitoring data for deep excavations, daily uploading of construction reports to a cloud system, and stronger checks by outside experts for earth retaining walls. This will make information about construction sites clearer and make managing them smarter.

The Taoyuan City Government Building Management Office announced today that the director, Chuang Ching-Chuan, said three new management measures will start in July. First, for construction sites digging more than 9 meters deep, monitoring data must be uploaded to a cloud system right away. Also, a "Safety Monitoring Data Sign" must be put near the main entrance of the site. People can scan a QR Code on it to see the latest digging data, making all safety information public.

For the other two new rules, Chuang said the focus is on making internal site management and control better. One rule is to make "construction reports" stronger. According to the "Construction Industry Act," site managers must upload daily reports to a cloud system. These reports will record how much work has been done, how many workers are there, and how much material is used. This will help trace every step of the construction process.

Chuang also said that they will require "safety checks for earth retaining walls." For deep digging sites, independent experts and architecture groups must check the site. These outside experts will review and approve plans to make sure that the basement walls are stable and that the support system for holding back the earth is safe. By having strict checks from the start, the risk of site collapses will be much lower, keeping nearby residents and workers safe.

Chuang stated that Taoyuan will continue to make its construction site management better and use smart technology to improve every part of construction. By making information systematic and clear, people will trust construction site safety more. The large amount of data collected will also help guide future building management policies.

**CPBL Draft: Yu-Hao Chang Aims for Catcher Top Pick; Sheng-Jie Tsai, Cheng-You Liu, Meng Chu Each Have Advantages**

The Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) new player draft will take place on June 30 in Taichung. This year's draft is seen as a "small draft" with 180 players qualified, but over 70 high school graduates joining, which is a new high. Teams hope to find good players or "rough diamonds" that fit their team and training plans. Huang Wei-Chieh, a 31-year-old pitcher who is the only player with experience playing overseas, is a key focus. Pu-Men High School catcher Yu-Hao Chang, New Taipei Caesar pitcher Wei Hung-Liang, and National Taiwan Sport University pitcher Tseng Wei-Che are all thought to be top picks for the first round.

Taipei, June 29 (CNA) â€“ For this year's CPBL draft, there are good field players to watch. Yu-Hao Chang is trying to be the first catcher chosen in seven years. Cheng-You Liu and Sheng-Jie Tsai are known for their power hitting, and Meng Chu, a shortstop, has high potential. All of them are likely to be chosen in the first round.

The CPBL draft is tomorrow. This year, 76 high school graduates (2 with national team experience, 2 recommended by teams) are joining, a new record. Also, 27 catchers are in the draft, which is also a record. Among the catchers, high school graduates Yu-Hao Chang, Ting-Yi Chiang, and Tzu-Chieh Chiao are getting a lot of attention. Yu-Hao Chang is even considered a possible top pick.

**Three High School Catchers Are Exciting; Yu-Hao Chang Aims to Be the First Catcher Pick in 7 Years**

Yu-Hao Chang only started playing catcher in junior high. His high school coach at Pu-Men High School said he is a smart catcher who uses his mind well. Even though he is tall, he is agile.

Last year, Yu-Hao Chang played for the Asian Youth National Team, which helped him learn how to handle game situations. He has a strong arm for throwing, and he hits well, with good power and accuracy. American baseball teams even watched him for a while. Though he couldn't play overseas, he chose to join the CPBL draft and is trying to be the first catcher chosen, which hasn't happened since Dai Pei-Feng in 2018.

Ping-Jen High School's Ting-Yi Chiang has played for national teams from elementary school to high school and has a lot of experience in big games. He is good at all parts of playing catcher and makes pitchers feel calm. His only weakness is his size, but he has been hitting for more power. He often gets important hits in tough situations and is good under pressure.

Hsi-Yuan High School's Tzu-Chieh Chiao had many important hits in the finals of this year's Yu Shan Cup Youth Baseball Tournament and won the catcher award for the competition. He hits with power and can hit for distance. He is considered the best hitter among these three catchers.

**Sheng-Jie Tsai, Cheng-You Liu Are Good Hitters; Meng Chu Has "High Potential"**

Sheng-Jie Tsai, a left-handed hitter from Ku-Pao Home Economics & Commercial High School, is good at both infield and outfield. He is listed as a second baseman but can also play outfield. He is good at both positions and could be a "utility player." Last year, he hit a home run at Tianmu Baseball Stadium, a professional field, during the Yu Shan Cup. He is expected to improve his hitting consistency in professional baseball and could be a power hitter chosen in the first round.

Cheng-You Liu, a left-handed outfielder from Ku-Pao Home Economics & Commercial High School, is one of the top hitters among the field players in this draft. He hits well, is fast, and covers a large area in the outfield. He is good at hitting, running, and fielding, and is also considered a top pick for the first round.

Meng Chu, a talented shortstop from Taitung Physical Education High School, was also watched by American baseball teams during high school. He is not fully developed yet, but he has "high potential," good physical ability, and natural talent, which makes scouts excited. He hits with power and is seen as a top pick for the first round, but whether he reaches his expected "potential" might affect where he is chosen.

Wu Cheng-Hao, a left-handed second baseman from Hsi-Yuan High School, hits well. His swing is simple and effective. His fielding is average but solid, and he also has a chance to be chosen. Wang Hsun-Yu, a right-handed second baseman from Mailiao High School, swings fast and can hit to all parts of the field. He is above average at hitting, running, and fielding, and is also a promising player.

Huang Tien-Tzu, a shortstop from Ping-Jen High School, has often played for national teams in youth baseball. He is considered more developed than Meng Chu at this stage, and his throwing and catching are steady. He is quick in fielding and has good ball sense. He is better at fielding than hitting and also has potential.
