        const text = `**Iran Resumes J-10C Fighter Jet Purchase Talks with China; Russian Expert Estimates Iran Needs 400 Aircraft**

Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily reports that Iran has restarted negotiations with China to buy J-10C fighter jets after the 12-day war with Israel. According to Iranian and Russian financial media on Thursday (June 26), this 4++ generation medium multi-role fighter, developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, is expected to address the Iranian Air Force's long-standing shortage of combat capabilities.
Reports indicate that although talks between Iran and China over the past two decades have failed multiple times, Iran is now eager to strengthen its air force after its air defense capabilities were weakened during the 12-day conflict with Israel. The demand could reach 400 aircraft. Currently, Russia's production capacity is limited by its domestic needs for the war in Ukraine. Russian think tanks acknowledge that Chinese fighter jets are clearly the best solution.
Sing Tao Daily, quoting Russia's Kommersant newspaper, reported that as early as 2015, both sides were close to signing a deal for up to 150 J-10C fighters, but the deal fell through due to disagreements over payment methods. At the time, China did not accept oil or natural gas as payment, and Iran faced foreign exchange shortages and UN sanctions, making a deal difficult. After the arms embargo was lifted in 2020, negotiations briefly resumed but were ultimately halted for the same reasons.
In early May, an air combat incident between Pakistan and India gained global attention when Pakistan used Chinese J-10CE fighters paired with PL-15 air-to-air missiles to shoot down five Indian military aircraft, including three French-made Rafale jets, at the border.
The J-10CE is a single-engine multi-role fighter developed and produced by China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, with 'E' denoting the export version. It is considered an economical alternative to the F-16V and Sweden's JAS-39 Gripen E. Its unit price ranges from 40 million to 50 million US dollars (approximately 310 to 390 million Hong Kong dollars), depending on the configuration and training package. In contrast, Russian Su-35 and MiG-35 aircraft are more expensive and present greater challenges regarding production capacity and delivery.
The report, citing data from the British IISS think tank's "The Military Balance 2025," states that before the recent conflict, Iran had approximately 150 serviceable fighter jets, mostly old US-made models from the 1970s, such as the F-4, F-5, and F-14. Their maintenance relies on locally produced parts, making operations difficult. Other aircraft, like the MiG-29s acquired in the late 1980s, are also in poor condition due to a lack of spare parts.
Iran had planned to expand its military through a Su-35 procurement deal signed in 2023, ordering 50 units, but has only received four so far. As most of Russia's production capacity is allocated to the war in Ukraine, it is difficult for them to fulfill the contract in the short term, forcing Iran to seek alternative solutions.
The report notes that Israel's air strikes on June 13 highlighted the weakness of Iran's air defense system. The US's agreement on June 24 to allow China to legally purchase Iranian oil could enable Iran to trade oil with China, accelerating the J-10C procurement process.
Ilya Kramnik, a strategic researcher at the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, pointed out that even if Iran successfully receives the Su-35s, it still needs a large fleet to support full air defense capabilities, estimating a demand of 400 aircraft. The lower-cost, stable-supply J-10C is currently the only viable option. He also mentioned that while the Russian-made MiG-35 is a potential choice, this model has not yet entered mass production, making it unsuitable as a primary supplementary aircraft.
Brigadier General Hamid Vahedi, Commander of the Iranian Air Force, met with high-ranking Chinese Air Force officials and inspected the J-10CE during the 2024 China Airshow. The J-10CE's performance is comparable to, or even surpasses, that of an upgraded F-16. Its operational victories in Egypt and Pakistan further prove its performance, reliability, and readiness.
Additionally, according to a recently published article by observer Umud Shokri from the American conservative think tank "Middle East Forum," Brigadier General Hamid Vahedi, Commander of the Iranian Air Force, met with high-ranking Chinese Air Force officials and inspected the J-10CE during the 2024 China Airshow. The article suggests that the J-10CE's performance is comparable to, or even surpasses, that of an upgraded F-16. Its operational victories in Egypt and Pakistan further prove its performance, reliability, and readiness. Besides filling the gaps in Iran's air capabilities, Iran's purchase of the J-10CE also signals its shift towards Chinese military equipment and a strengthening of economic and security ties with Beijing.
However, the article also points out that payment-related disagreements have stalled negotiations for the purchase of approximately 36 J-10CEs. Tehran proposed payment in oil, but Beijing is seeking cash.
The article also noted that Iran has expressed interest in the JF-17 Block III, a joint Sino-Pakistani developed fighter that incorporates fifth-generation fighter technology but is priced lower than the J-10CE. However, the article states that the J-10CE better meets Iran's operational needs. If Iran wishes to reduce its reliance on a single supplier, it is a modern, multi-role fighter that can integrate well with larger Russian aircraft purchased in the future.

**Lai Ching-te's "Third-Degree Kin Rule" Draws Criticism, DPP Postpones Proposal at National Congress**

Today marks the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) National Congress. It was initially expected that under Chairman Lai Ching-te's leadership, a "third-degree kin rule" proposal would be presented to amend the party charter, prohibiting family members of DPP public representatives from serving as publicly funded assistants. However, due to significant opposition within the party, the DPP Central Party Headquarters did not submit this proposal today, effectively postponing its implementation indefinitely.
In February of this year, several public representatives were investigated for assistant expense fraud. President Lai Ching-te, who also serves as DPP Chairman, ordered at a Central Standing Committee meeting that DPP public officials should adhere to the highest standards. He stated that the assistant teams of public representatives should follow the "Civil Service Employment Act," which prohibits the employment of spouses and relatives within the third degree of kinship by blood or marriage. While family members could volunteer, they should not be employed as publicly funded assistants. This statement immediately sparked backlash within the party.
Taipei City Councilor Chien Shu-pei was reportedly overheard privately criticizing the system as "stupid." Several other Green Camp councilors also admitted that the Central Party Headquarters' order, issued without prior communication, caught public representatives across northern, central, and southern Taiwan off guard. They questioned who would assist them after work, especially since councilor assistants are on call 24 hours a day.
According to Article 26 of the Civil Service Employment Act, heads of government agencies are prohibited from employing their spouses or relatives within the third degree of kinship by blood or marriage within their own agency, or appointing them as heads of directly subordinate agencies. Furthermore, spouses and relatives within the third degree of kinship by blood or marriage of departmental heads within the agency should be avoided in employment within their supervisor's unit.
Party insiders stated that after Lai Ching-te ordered the study of internal rule amendments in February, Party Secretary-General Lin Yu-chang also indicated that he would follow Lai Ching-te's instructions to research whether to amend the party charter and incorporate clear regulations. According to DPP regulations, any amendment to the party charter must be proposed at the National Congress and passed by national party representatives to take effect.
While Lin Yu-chang was still in the research phase, many within the DPP had already criticized the Central Party Headquarters. New Taipei City Councilor Lin Ping-yu of the DPP found the logic far-fetched, questioning why such a "nonsense" idea would be planned for inclusion in the party charter, and if someone thought governing was too easy and wanted to increase the difficulty. Taipei City Councilor Chien Shu-pei was also reported to have called the policy "super stupid."
Party insiders pointed out that public criticism was just the tip of the iceberg, with numerous Green Camp public representatives appealing to the Central Party Headquarters, stating that this amendment would definitely cause problems and should be avoided at all costs. The most frequently raised opinion was that the focus should remain on how to resolve and reduce the risk of assistant expense fraud, rather than throwing the baby out with the bathwater. After all, political staff and assistants cannot work standard nine-to-five hours like typical jobs and often rely on family members who have a high degree of understanding. This is common in local politics, and in fact, with family assistance, politicians often operate more smoothly.
According to party insiders, considering the collective opinions within the party, the Central Party Headquarters has decided not to propose this issue at today's National Congress. As long as no party representative suddenly raises the issue during the ad-hoc proposal session, this matter will essentially be postponed indefinitely.

**Iranian Ambassador to China: Supports Xi Jinping's Four-Point Proposal, Iran Ready to Implement Comprehensive Cooperation Plan with China**

According to Xinhua News Agency, Iranian Ambassador to China, Fazli, stated in Beijing on June 27 that both Iran and China have maintained close communication recently. He expressed Iran's support for President Xi Jinping's four-point proposal on the current Middle East situation and thanked China for condemning Israeli and American attacks on Iran in multilateral forums, including the UN Security Council. He also stated that Iran is willing to work with China to promote the implementation of the comprehensive China-Iran cooperation plan.
The comprehensive China-Iran cooperation plan is an investment cooperation project involving 400 billion US dollars. According to the agreement signed in Tehran in 2021, China's investment in Iran will reach 400 billion US dollars over 25 years. In addition to establishing free trade zones, China and Iran plan to cooperate on dozens of projects in sectors such as banking, telecommunications, ports, railways, and global navigation systems. However, little progress has been made in its actual implementation since it was signed.
During a media meeting at the Iranian Embassy in China on the same day, Fazli thanked the Chinese government and people for their support during Iran's most difficult times. He said that Iran is committed to promoting Iran-China cooperation and is willing to work with China to implement the comprehensive Iran-China cooperation plan and jointly strive to maintain international and regional security.
Fazli is the newly appointed Iranian Ambassador to China, who recently took office in Beijing. On June 23, Liu Bin, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, met with Fazli. At that time, Liu Bin stated that China is highly concerned about regional developments, opposes actions that infringe upon Iran's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and opposes escalating tensions and expanding conflicts. He added that China is willing to maintain communication with Iran and play a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East. Fazli responded by thanking China for its fair stance and expressed his expectation that China would continue to play an active role in de-escalating the situation and upholding international fairness and justice.
In fact, the new Israeli Ambassador to China, Be'eri, also recently took office, and Liu Bin met with Be'eri on June 25.
At yesterday's media briefing, Fazli reportedly discussed Iran's recent military retaliation against Israeli and American attacks. He stated that the goals of Israel and the United States were to overthrow the Iranian government, destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities, and incite the Iranian people against their government, but none of these three objectives were achieved. He asserted that Iran's military response maintained national stability and unity. He also indicated that Iran has not yet exhausted its military response capabilities.
US President Trump claimed on June 25 that the US and Iran would hold talks next week and possibly sign an agreement. Fazli responded by stating that Iran has never voluntarily left the negotiating table, but "now is not a good time for negotiations." He emphasized that Iran would only reconsider talks if the US and Israel abandon their oppression and bullying tactics against Iran.
