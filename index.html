            <h1>Machinery Association: Exchange Rate Affects Machine Tool Exports More Than Tariffs</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Association of Machinery Industry announced today that the value of machinery exports in September was 2.647 billion US dollars. This is 9.4% more than last year and shows growth for the eighth month in a row. When calculated in Taiwan dollars, the export value in September grew by 3.9% compared to last year. The association said that the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar is more important than the effect of US tariffs on exports.</p>
            <p>The association explained that the Taiwan dollar has not lost as much value against the US dollar since 2021 as the Japanese Yen has. Because of this, Taiwan's equipment used to be 20% to 30% cheaper than Japan's, but this price difference is now gone. This has especially affected the export of machine tools and is a main reason why export orders have dropped a lot.</p>
            <p>The association reported that Taiwan's machinery exports in September were 2.647 billion US dollars. This is 9.4% more than the 2.42 billion US dollars exported in September 2024. In Taiwan dollars, the amount was 80.464 billion, which is 3.9% more than the same time last year.</p>
            <p>The association's analysis showed that machinery exports kept growing in September, marking eight months of continuous growth. However, statistics show that machine tool exports in September were only 170 million US dollars. Although this is 5% higher than the same period last year, it is mainly because last year's starting point was low. Current export amounts are still lower than in the past. The machine tool industry is still affected by global uncertainties, and market orders are not high.</p>
            <p>Looking at machine tool exports to the United States, the association said that these exports are affected by matching tariffs. At first, the US delayed these tariffs for 90 days. Companies sent out goods early because of this. In May, Taiwan's machine tool exports to the US grew by 17.1%. In June, they grew by 57.4%. But in July, exports to the US fell by 26.4%. In August, they fell by 32.1%, and in September, they fell by 19.9%.</p>
            <p>From January to September this year, Taiwan's total machinery export value was 23.259 billion US dollars, which is a 6.6% increase compared to last year. In Taiwan dollars, this was about 725.07 billion, a 3.8% increase from last year.</p>
            <p>Looking at the main markets for exports, the association noted that the top three countries Taiwan exported machinery to from January to September this year were the United States (26.3%), China (22.8%), and Japan (7.6%).</p>
            <p>The association said that the United States and China are still the two biggest markets for Taiwan's machinery exports. From January to September this year, Taiwan's machinery exports to China grew a little by 4.3%, and exports to the United States grew by 13%.</p>
            <p>The association explained that starting August 7, the US began to use matching tariffs for countries worldwide. For Taiwan, the temporary tariff rate is 20%. Compared to competing countries like Japan and South Korea, which have a 15% tariff rate, the 20% US tariff for Taiwan will make it harder for Taiwan's machinery products to be exported to the United States.</p>
            <p>The association analyzed that the US at first delayed the matching tariffs for 90 days. Companies sent goods earlier to prepare. In May, machinery exports to the US grew by 19%. In June, they grew by 23.6%. In July, they grew by 14.8%. However, in August, when the matching tariffs started, export growth clearly slowed down to 7.6% compared to last year. In September, exports actually fell by 0.9%.</p>

            <h1>KMT Chairman Election Debate: Candidates Aim to Win Southern Taiwan in 2026</h1>
            <p>The KMT party will choose a new leader on October 18. Today, they held a debate in Kaohsiung. Lo Chih-chiang and Hau Lung-pin said they would quit if they don't win one of the two main cities in southern Taiwan in the 2026 elections. Cheng Li-wen thinks the KMT has a good chance to win in Kaohsiung. Tsai Chih-hung said he would quit if the party loses seats for city and county leaders.</p>
            <p>Six people are running for KMT leader: Hau Lung-pin, Chang Ya-chung, Lo Chih-chiang, Tsai Chih-hung, Cheng Li-wen, and Cho Po-yuan. They all spoke at the debate in Kaohsiung today. The election will be held on October 18.</p>
            <p>Hau Lung-pin said during his speech that new leaders should not replace old ones completely. Instead, people from different generations should work together. He believes it is the leader's job to give young people chances to show what they can do so the KMT can become stronger. He also said that many fake accounts and messages have attacked him. He hopes people will support him and not believe bad rumors.</p>
            <p>For the 2026 elections, Hau Lung-pin said his plan is to "protect the north, stabilize the middle, and win the south." He wants to win in the north and middle, and at least one of the two big cities in the south. If he becomes party leader and cannot win one of these two southern cities, he will resign. In the past, elections were often decided in central Taiwan. He hopes the 2028 election will be decided in southern Taiwan. He also thinks that the KMT should work with the Taiwan People's Party, but it is more important for the KMT to be strong on its own.</p>
            <p>Chang Ya-chung stated that the KMT needs to find its spirit and character again if it wants to govern. Without clear ideas and a soul, it cannot attract young people. He still believes that other candidates for party leader lack this party spirit. He also said that if Hau Lung-pin wins, the party's structure will not change. He asked everyone to vote for a leader who can help the KMT find its original ideas again, like when former President Chiang Ching-kuo led the party.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang said that if he becomes party leader, he will make a strong promise. He will make sure the KMT wins at least one of the two big cities in southern Taiwan in the 2026 elections, or he will quit as party leader. He also said this election is about two different ideas. One idea is that the party leader should be trustworthy, reliable, and loyal. The other idea is that new, strong leaders should take over. He believes he fits both descriptions.</p>
            <p>Lo Chih-chiang also said there are many rumors recently about people giving up votes for some candidates to support others, saying he supports someone else. But he said he supports himself. He wants everyone to vote calmly and not worry about these rumors. He also stressed that he is a strong fighter. He has always been active, whether in the Legislative Yuan or helping party members with their election campaigns. If he becomes party leader, he can do even more. He hopes to remove the Democratic Progressive Party from power and bring back a KMT government.</p>
            <p>Tsai Chih-hung stated that the situation between Taiwan and China is very dangerous right now and could lead to war at any moment. If there is a war in the Taiwan Strait, people will not be able to live and work peacefully. If he is elected, he will try to arrange meetings between the leaders of the KMT and the Communist Party of China. He will suggest that talks should be based on "one China" and mutual understanding. He also promised to resign immediately if the KMT loses seats for city and county leaders in the 2026 elections.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen said she would not be a party leader who just stays in an air-conditioned office in Taipei. She wants to be a leader who understands ordinary people. She believes the Democratic Progressive Party has led southern Taiwan for too long. The KMT needs to break this "green spell" next year and change who governs southern Taiwan. She also noted that the KMT has several female city and county leaders, like Lu Shiow-yen. She hopes a woman can also become the party leader.</p>
            <p>Cheng Li-wen also said that the chance to win the Kaohsiung mayoral election next year is very good. This is because the Democratic Progressive Party is divided and has internal problems. So, the KMT must come together to defeat the proud and divided Democratic Progressive Party. She added that since she announced her plan to run for party leader, everyone in Taiwan and around the world is watching. This is because the KMT is changing and wants to stand strong again to win the support of young people and voters in the middle.</p>
            <p>Cho Po-yuan said that the KMT needs to get younger and train new talents. He suggested that Cheng Li-wen and Lo Chih-chiang, who are the youngest of the six candidates, should run for president and vice president. He thinks the other three candidates could become top advisors for the KMT. This way, everyone can use their skills and help the party.</p>
            <p>Cho Po-yuan stressed that there is a third way for Taiwan and China, besides unification or independence. This third way is for the United Nations to move to Taiwan. If he becomes party leader, he will invite Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump to Taiwan to drink bubble tea. He will also try to get both the US and China to agree that the United Nations should move to Taiwan. He also plans to raise money so that party members do not have to pay membership fees, encouraging a million members to return to the party.</p>
