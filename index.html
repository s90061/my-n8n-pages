            <h1>Trump adds 25% tax on goods from India, starting August 27th</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump signed a new order. He said that India buys oil from Russia, either directly or indirectly. Because of this, the US will add another 25% tax on goods from India. India's goods sent to the US will now have a total tax of 50%, because there was already a 25% tax before. This new tax will start on August 27th.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Donald Trump said, "We put a 25% tax on India, but I think I will make it much higher in the next 24 hours, because they are buying Russian oil."</p>
            <p>So, Trump signed an order today. It says that because India buys Russian oil, the US will add 25% more tax on Indian goods sent to the US. With the previous 25% tax, which was supposed to start on August 7th, Indian goods will now have a 50% tax.</p>
            <p>The White House announced that the extra 25% tax on India will begin on August 27th.</p>
            <p>Earlier, foreign news reported that on August 4th, India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the US and EU were "targeting" India for buying Russian oil. But India felt these actions were "not fair" and that India would protect its own interests.</p>
            <p>India buys a lot of oil from Russia. This oil is a main source of money for Moscow's military actions in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The war between Russia and Ukraine has continued for more than 3 years, and there is no clear end in sight. Trump had said before that he would put "secondary tariffs" on countries that continue to trade with Russia, like China and India.</p>

            <h1>Hezbollah refuses Lebanese cabinet's decision to disarm by year-end</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Lebanon's government met and decided to ask the military to make a plan. This plan is to disarm Hezbollah, a strong group supported by Iran, by the end of the year. But today, Hezbollah said they will not follow this decision. They also said the government's decision hurts Lebanon's power.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Lebanese government made this difficult decision yesterday. It was after a nearly 6-hour meeting led by President Joseph Aoun, under strong pressure from the United States.</p>
            <p>This decision will also help to carry out the ceasefire agreement made between Lebanon and Israel last November. That agreement was meant to stop the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, which lasted for over a year and included two months of full war. After the war, Hezbollah became much weaker, their weapons were badly damaged, and many top leaders were killed.</p>
            <p>Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam announced at a press conference after the meeting yesterday that the government has asked the military to give a plan by the end of the month. This plan will be discussed and approved by the government. The goal is that by the end of the year, only the national army and other state forces will be allowed to have weapons.</p>
            <p>However, Lebanon's Information Minister Paul Morcos said that the Health Minister Rakan Nassereldine, who is linked to Hezbollah, and the Environment Minister Tamara Elzein, who is linked to Hezbollah's ally "Amal Movement," both left the meeting because they did not agree with the government's decision.</p>
            <p>Hezbollah is the only group in Lebanon that still has weapons after the civil war from 1975 to 1990. They say they keep weapons to fight Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>
            <p>During yesterday's cabinet meeting, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem spoke on TV. He said that they would not give up their weapons as long as Israel's attacks continue.</p>
            <p>Today, Hezbollah released another statement. They said they will act "as if the cabinet's decision does not exist." They also said, "The Salam government's decision to make Lebanon give up its weapons against the enemy Israel is a serious mistake. This harms Lebanon's power and allows Israel to do what it wants regarding safety, land, politics, and future existence."</p>
            <p>Hezbollah has been the strongest political group in Lebanon for a long time. Their opponents say they use their weapons to force their will in national affairs. But after the recent fighting with Israel, Hezbollah's influence has become weaker.</p>
