            <h1>Asian Stocks Mostly Rose Despite U.S. Government Shutdown</h1>
            <p>The U.S. government officially stopped some operations today because the U.S. Congress did not agree on a budget. Today, the price of gold reached a new high. Futures in Wall Street went down, and the U.S. dollar became weaker. But even with these issues, most stock markets in Asia went up a little.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, the idea that some U.S. government services would close was stronger than the hopeful feeling that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates again.</p>
            <p>Most government shutdowns do not last long and do not affect the market much. However, investors are still worried. This is because the shutdown might delay the non-farm employment report, which is important for the Federal Reserve's decisions about interest rates. This report is expected on the 3rd.</p>
            <p>Michael Brown, a senior research strategist at Pepperstone Group, an Australian financial company, said: "I still believe investors should look past political problems and focus on long-term trends. Basically, the government budget stopping will not greatly harm the economy. An agreement will be made eventually, the government will start again, and any delayed economic information will be released on time."</p>
            <p>Stock markets in Taipei, Singapore, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok, and Wellington closed higher today. Stock markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong were closed because of holidays.</p>
            <p>The Tokyo stock market in Japan closed lower. Banking stocks led this fall. The main Nikkei index went down by 0.9% and closed at 44550.85 points. Stock markets in Sydney and Jakarta also closed lower.</p>

            <h1>NTNU Helps Students Join Hualien Guangfu Rebuilding with Money for Travel and Living</h1>
            <p>A landslide dam disaster on the Matai'an Stream caused a lot of damage to Guangfu Township in Hualien County. National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) has started a "Warm Sun Action Subsidy Program." This program gives money for travel, daily needs, and equipment. It encourages students to form volunteer groups or work alone to help in the Guangfu area.</p>
            <p>NTNU sent out a press release today. It said that rebuilding Guangfu in Hualien after the disaster needs more than just physical things. It also needs people to support and be with each other. The Office of Student Affairs at NTNU started the "Warm Sun Action Subsidy Program." It encourages and helps students in the university to create volunteer teams or go alone to Hualien. They will help in the Guangfu area. Through their actions, every act of care will turn into power for rebuilding.</p>
            <p>NTNU also said that students who want to help rebuild Guangfu can apply for money. For travel, they can get money for a round-trip train ticket from Taipei to Hualien on a Ziqiang-go train (which costs 1376 NTD). For daily needs, they can get 400 NTD for food and basic living costs. There is also money for equipment. Students can ask for money to buy necessary tools and supplies for their volunteer work (they need to show proof of purchase and the university's tax ID number, 03735202).</p>
            <p>This program also includes students who have already finished their volunteer work. Each person can apply for the subsidy only one time. The last day to apply is October 19th at midnight (24:00). About 200 people are expected to apply. NTNU also thanked the alumni group from the 50-60 year reunion for their kind donations. These donations helped the program start smoothly.</p>
