            <h1>Memory Chip Outlook Is Good: Micron Hits New High, Phison and Others Rise</h1>
            <p>The demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI) is strong. This makes the future of the memory chip market look very promising. Micron, a big company, reached its highest stock price ever. This also made other memory chip companies like Adata and Phison see their stock prices go up. Phison's stock price went up by the daily limit, reaching NT$644. This is its highest price in 16 months.</p>
            <p>Micron's business in data centers is growing a lot. People believe Micron will continue to benefit from the strong demand for AI. This caused its stock price to increase greatly.

            <p>Because Micron performed very well, the stock prices of other memory chip companies like Phison also went up today. Phison's stock price hit the daily limit, reaching NT$644, which is the highest in 16 months.</p>

            <h1>Microsoft and OpenAI Sign Agreement for OpenAI to Become a For-Profit Company</h1>
            <p>Today, Microsoft and OpenAI announced they have signed an agreement that is not legally binding. This agreement will allow OpenAI to change into a for-profit company. In the end, it plans to become a public company with a more normal business structure. This shows a new stage in their partnership.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the details of this new agreement are not yet public. However, both companies said they are working hard to finalize the terms. OpenAI and Microsoft have made progress in their long talks. OpenAI wants to raise money for developing artificial intelligence under a more normal way of running a company, and eventually become a public company.</p>
            <p>In 2019, Microsoft invested one billion US dollars in OpenAI, a new company. In early 2023, Microsoft added another ten billion US dollars. Based on their old agreement, Microsoft had the special right to sell OpenAI's software tools using its Azure cloud computing service. Microsoft also had the first choice to use OpenAI's technology.</p>
            <p>Microsoft used to be the only company providing computing resources to OpenAI. But this year, Microsoft changed this rule. It allowed OpenAI to build its own data centers, which is called the Stargate project. This project includes a three hundred billion US dollar long-term contract with Oracle and another cloud agreement with Google.</p>
            <p>As OpenAI's income grew to billions of US dollars, it started looking for a more common business structure. It also started working with other cloud providers to sell more and make sure it had enough computing power for its needs.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Microsoft wants to keep using OpenAI's technology, even if OpenAI says it has reached a human-like level in the future. This is because, according to the old agreement, if OpenAI's board decided its AI had reached Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), their partnership could end.</p>
            <p>Bret Taylor, the chairman of OpenAI, wrote in a memo that under the current agreement, OpenAI's non-profit part will get over one hundred billion US dollars. This amount is about 20% of the five hundred billion US dollars it is looking for in the private market. This will make OpenAI a very rich non-profit organization.</p>
            <p>The two companies did not say how much of OpenAI Microsoft will own. They also did not say if Microsoft will still have the special right to use OpenAI's newest models and technology.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Bank Lowers Mortgage Income-to-Expense Ratio from 200% to 180%</h1>
            <p>To help people who do not own a home get financial support for buying one, Taiwan Bank announced on September 11 that it will lower the income-to-expense ratio for home loans. For people who do not own a home and want to buy their own house, the ratio will change from 200% to 180%. This is based on their current ways of managing loan risks.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank sent out a press release on the evening of September 11. It explained that this change is to support the government's new Youth Home Loan Program, which started on September 1. This program's loans will not count towards the limits in Article 72-2 of the Banking Act. To give more financial help to people who want to buy their own homes, the bank will lower the income-to-expense ratio for those without a home. It will go from 200% to 180% for self-use home loans, starting from that day, while still managing lending risks.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank said that when it checks loan applications, it will follow the lending rules from the Bankers Association and other government rules. It will look at each person's credit, what the money is for, where the repayment will come from, and how the loan is protected. Then, it will decide on a suitable loan amount and conditions.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank also added that the income-to-expense ratio is a very important way for them to check if someone can pay back a loan. Lowering this ratio for people who do not own a home means that if a person has the same income and other conditions, they can borrow more for their home loan. However, the loan amount will still not be more than 80% of the purchase price or the estimated value, whichever is lower. The bank hopes this will make it easier for people who do not own a home to get money to buy a house and help more of them achieve their dream of owning a home.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank stressed that to help people manage risks, it actively cares for and reminds loan applicants. It advises them to check their own financial situation and plan their household income and expenses. This way, they can avoid financial risks that might affect their daily life and ability to pay back, and keep a good credit score.</p>
