            <h1>Volunteer Steals NT$130,000 from Disaster Victim in Hualien; Police Arrest Suspect</h1>
            <p>The Hualien County Police Department got a report that a disabled person in Guangfu Township lost NT$130,000. This money was very important for their survival after a disaster. Police found out that a volunteer, Mr. Huang, who delivered meals, was the thief. They also learned that Mr. Huang was a former police officer who lost his job 15 years ago because of stealing.</p>
            <p>The 65-year-old victim, Mr. Huang, cannot speak or hear well and had a stroke. He lives alone. After the disaster, he was stuck in his home. People thought he was trapped for 7 days, which made his story known.</p>
            <p>On October 8, Mr. Huang told the police that NT$130,000 in cash and some gold jewelry were stolen from near his bed. This money included aid he had just received, which was his life-saving fund after the disaster.</p>
            <p>The Hualien County Criminal Investigation Brigade and Fenglin Police Station formed a special team to investigate. Many security cameras around Mr. Huang's home were broken by the flood, making the investigation hard. From the few working cameras, they saw a 60-year-old man in a white shirt and thought he was the main suspect.</p>
            <p>Police said that by checking the camera videos, they confirmed the man was Mr. Huang, the volunteer who delivered meals and cleaned. Today, police went to Mr. Huang's home in Fenglin Township with a search warrant. They found over NT$70,000 of the stolen money, the gold jewelry, and a mobile phone. After questioning, Mr. Huang was sent to the Hualien District Prosecutor's Office for serious theft.</p>
            <p>Police found out that Mr. Huang used to be a police officer. He was removed from his job 15 years ago because of stealing.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Health and Welfare Helps Volunteers Get Insurance; "Shovel Supermen" Now Covered by Government Funds</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) Minister, Mr. Shih Chung-liang, said today that insurance companies were worried about losing a lot of money. But after discussions, they agreed to include regular volunteers, called "Shovel Supermen," in disaster relief insurance. This means these volunteers can now get insurance with some conditions. Mr. Shih sounded relieved when he shared this news.</p>
            <p>The insurance plan for disaster relief volunteers in Hualien started today. Before, only volunteers chosen by the government to help with disaster recovery, as stated in Article 32 of the Disaster Prevention and Protection Act, could get this insurance. So, people who went to help on their own, the "Shovel Supermen," were not covered.</p>
            <p>However, a few hours later, the Central Emergency Operation Center's forward coordination office announced that the Hualien Guangfu disaster area volunteer insurance would cover "Shovel Supermen" starting from 1 PM today. These volunteers need to go through the army or the Hualien County Government to be grouped, just like professional volunteers. Each person will get NT$1 million in insurance. You can sign up near Guangfu train station.</p>
            <p>The change in the insurance plan happened after a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental Hygiene Committee on Wednesday, October 8.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shih told the Central News Agency today that many lawmakers asked questions on Wednesday about the lack of protection for volunteers. This became very important after a sad event where a forklift company owner from Taoyuan went to help in disaster relief, got stabbed, and died from a serious infection. People realized that he was not covered by any legal volunteer insurance, nor did he qualify for special relief funds.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shih explained that volunteers who follow the "Disaster Prevention and Protection Act" are insured by different levels of government. Volunteers who follow the "Volunteer Service Act" are insured by the organizations they work with, like Tzu Chi or World Vision.</p>
            <p>But the "Shovel Supermen" did not fit into these two groups. They usually go to help by themselves, not through the government or an organization. This meant they had no insurance coverage.</p>
            <p>The MOHW and the Financial Supervisory Commission quickly talked to insurance companies. They hoped to offer group insurance to give basic protection to disaster relief volunteers.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shih said many companies did not want to join. Developing insurance plans is complicated, and companies must think about the size of the group and the risks. They were afraid of repeating the problems of the COVID-19 pandemic insurance. In the end, only one company, KGI Life, agreed to offer the insurance. The MOHW will manage the plan, and the Disaster Relief Foundation will help with the money.</p>
            <p>The MOHW quickly created a QR code system in one day. People just need to scan the QR code, upload their information and a photo of their ID to get insured. However, figuring out who qualifies as a disaster relief volunteer was another problem, as it is hard to guess how many people will help and what risks they might face.</p>
            <p>"The companies were also very scared of huge losses!" Mr. Shih said. That is why they first limited the insurance to volunteers mentioned in the "Disaster Prevention and Protection Act." But today morning, after several hours of talks with insurance companies, they finally agreed to change the rules and include the "Shovel Supermen" in the insurance plan.</p>
            <p>Mr. Shih wants everyone to know that to get insured, volunteers must go to the volunteer service center big tent next to Guangfu train station and sign in. They must be sent to help by the army or the Hualien County Government. Then, they can scan the QR code to get insurance, just like professional volunteers. The sign-up time is from 8 AM to 4 PM every day.</p>
            <p>Each insurance period is for 3 days. Mr. Shih said they will keep reviewing the plan and make changes if needed. He stressed that the reason for needing to be assigned to a task is that the government departments in charge of disaster areas consider factors like risk levels and if special skills are needed. This makes sure that people are used effectively and that volunteers are safer.</p>
