            <h1>Will Trump Try to Please or Be Tough When He Meets Putin in Alaska?</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 15 â€“ In 2018, when Donald Trump was the President of the United States, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland. Their friendly meeting surprised other countries because Trump disagreed with his own intelligence agencies and sided with Putin on the issue of Russia interfering in the US election.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Trump will fly to Alaska to meet with Putin. However, the mood is different this time. Trump is tired of Moscow not wanting to talk about ending the war in Ukraine. He is also angry about Russian missiles attacking Ukrainian cities.</p>
            <p>The world is waiting to see which Trump will appear at the summit in Anchorage: the tougher Trump we see now, or the old real estate businessman who tried to please the clever former KGB agent.</p>
            <p>The answer to this question could have a big effect on European leaders. They are worried that if Russia is allowed to take over parts of Ukraine, Moscow will become even bolder towards nearby NATO countries like Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.</p>
            <p>It is even more important for Ukraine to know which Trump will meet Putin, because Ukrainian forces are losing ground after three and a half years of fighting.</p>
            <p>Even though Trump has seemed tougher towards Putin in recent months, he has tried to calm Putin down more often. When Russia started invading Ukraine in 2022, Trump refused to criticize Putin directly. On the other hand, Putin, who many US presidents have ignored, strongly praised Trump's efforts to improve relations between Russia and the US.</p>
            <p>People who watch the Kremlin are waiting to see if Trump will again be charmed by Putin and change his mind about Russia having the right to control Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Dan Fried, a diplomat who worked for several US presidents and is now at the Atlantic Council in Washington, said, "It is reasonable to worry that Trump might be tricked by Putin and make a bad deal that hurts Ukraine."</p>
            <p>But Fried also said that another outcome is possible. He said, "It is also reasonable that the US government realizes Putin has been tricking them until now."</p>
            <p>Trump's team has tried to lower people's expectations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the media on August 12 that this meeting will be a "chance to listen."</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters on August 13 that if the Alaska meeting goes well, he might set up a second meeting that includes both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>There are no signs that Russia is ready to give in. Ukraine is worried that Trump might make a deal without asking Kyiv's opinion. Zelenskyy has said he wants a ceasefire first, then security guarantees.</p>
            <p>The world is watching this meeting closely. For Trump, making a deal at such an important event is very appealing.</p>
            <p>This year, Trump has publicly sought the Nobel Peace Prize, saying his diplomatic successes earned it. However, his strong desire to achieve a peace agreement for Ukraine has made US allies nervous. They worry that the outcome might make Putin feel more confident to do as he pleases.</p>
            <p>Trump has said that Moscow and Kyiv must exchange land to reach a peace agreement. This has recently caused protests from Ukraine and European leaders.</p>
            <p>Russian forces currently control Crimea and large parts of eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian forces have fully left Russian territory they once controlled. Because of this, people are asking what Russia and Ukraine can actually exchange.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Trump insists that only he can end this war because of his personal relationship with Putin.</p>
            <p>John Bolton, who was a national security advisor in Trump's last government and is now critical of Trump, said he is worried that Putin has "started to work his magic on Trump."</p>
            <p>Bolton stated, "Personal relationships can help in diplomacy, just like in other areas. But for someone as tough as Putin, who is one of the toughest people in the world, decisions are not made based on feelings. They are made through cold, hard calculations. Trump has not understood this important point."</p>
