People in Britain bought less in April. This happened because prices are still high, so shoppers are spending less money. Experts thought sales would go down a little, but they went down much more.
Shops selling clothes and other non-food items had a big drop in sales. Online shopping also decreased a lot. But supermarkets sold a bit more food. This is probably because people are cooking at home more instead of eating at restaurants. This shows that high prices are making people change how they spend their money.

**How AI is Changing Our Jobs**
AI, or Artificial Intelligence, is quickly changing jobs around the world. It's creating new kinds of jobs and also changing old ones. For example, new jobs like AI trainers (who teach AI), prompt engineers (who write instructions for AI), and people who make sure AI is used fairly are appearing.
AI also helps people by doing boring, repeated tasks. This means workers can spend more time on creative and important work. Companies now need employees with "soft skills" more, like thinking carefully, solving problems, and being able to change easily, because AI can do many technical jobs. Some people worry AI will take jobs away. But many experts think AI will mostly change what people do in their jobs, not make whole jobs disappear.

**Venice Starts New Entry Fee for Day Visitors**
The city of Venice in Italy has started a new rule: people who visit for just one day must now pay a small fee of â‚¬5 to enter. This is a trial, meaning it's a test to see how it works. The main idea is to control the number of tourists and stop too many people from visiting at busy times.
If you stay overnight in a hotel in Venice, you don't have to pay this fee. This new rule is causing some discussion. Some people say it might stop tourists from coming. But others think it's important to protect Venice's special history and buildings. Other popular places around the world are also thinking about similar plans. They want to find a good balance between the money tourists bring and keeping life good for local people.
