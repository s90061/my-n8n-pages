            <h1>Female Lawyer in Tainan Held for Being Part of Fraud Group</h1>
            <p>Tainan, July 16 (CNA) â€“ A female lawyer named He in Tainan has been arrested. She is involved in a fraud case and is seen as a helper for a fraud group. After questioning her, the Tainan District Prosecutors Office asked to hold her. The Tainan District Court decided tonight to keep her in custody and not allow her to meet or talk with anyone.</p>
            <p>The Tainan District Court said tonight that Ms. He is suspected of breaking several laws. These include laws about organized crime, fraud, money laundering, and sharing secrets. The court believes she is very likely guilty.</p>
            <p>Also, Ms. He was both a member of the fraud group and a lawyer for the people who reported the crime. She used her chance to be with people during questioning to find out secrets and share them. This helped the fraud group. Her actions were serious. Her statements were not clear, and she avoided important points. The court is worried that she might hide proof or talk to other people involved in the crime and witnesses.</p>

            <h1>Taipower: Hard Work of Employees After Typhoon Should Not Be Called Fake Photos</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 16 (CNA) â€“ Taipower, the main power company in Taiwan, said today that its workers' hard work to fix power lines after the typhoon should not be called "fake photos." This was in response to a group called the Taiwan Power Industry Union. Taipower said that the photos taken at the work sites were real records of the repairs and not fake. Taipower also said that the "Taiwan Power Union" has nearly 29,000 members, which is over 99% of its employees. This union truly represents most workers' opinions. The "Power Industry Union" only has about a hundred members.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused great damage in southern Taiwan. The Taiwan Power Industry Union said today in a statement that low-level employees worked extra hours to fix things after the typhoon. They were even asked to pose for photos while eating. The union said that high-level government officials then used these photos to promote the idea of giving Taipower "billions of dollars."</p>
            <p>Taipower said tonight in a press release that all repair photos released to the public were real pictures taken by workers randomly during their actual work. There were no orders or requests for fake poses. Only sometimes, when news reporters came to film, they might have asked workers to help a little for their reports.</p>
            <p>Taipower also said it understands and respects what employees want for their working conditions. This typhoon caused damage to power systems in the Chiayi-Tainan area that has never been seen before. Almost 3,500 power poles fell down, which is a very serious problem. More than ten thousand people have worked to fix these problems, and they are still working now.</p>
            <p>Taipower said the company greatly respects and thanks all its employees for their hard work. It will also continue to make working conditions better for repair workers. This includes giving them bonuses, extra time off, and danger pay. Taipower hopes that everyone in society will keep giving the repair workers on the front lines a lot of support.</p>
