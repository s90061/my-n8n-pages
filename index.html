            <h1>Northern Taiwan to Expect 38-Degree Heat; Expert Says Tropical Depression Not a Threat to Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that it will be very hot today and tomorrow. Northern Taiwan will have high temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius. A tropical depression is slowly getting stronger in the South China Sea. There is a slightly higher chance (60%) it will become a typhoon before August 30th, but it will not affect Taiwan. Next week, other tropical weather systems will be active far east of Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Bureau defines "high temperature" in its "High Temperature Information" as when the highest ground temperature reaches 36 degrees Celsius or more. Depending on how high the temperature is and how long it lasts, there are three levels: yellow, orange, and red.</p>
            <p>Associate Professor Wu Der-rong from the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University writes in the "Tian Ji Classroom" column for the Meteorological Applications Promotion Foundation. He stated that the newest European weather model (ECMWF) shows that today and tomorrow, most areas will be sunny with some clouds and very hot. Northern Taiwan will see temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius. Around noon, the UV index will be dangerous. People should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. The Hengchun Peninsula and Hualien/Taitung might have some short local rains. In the mountains, there could be local showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, Wu Der-rong said that today, northern Taiwan is expected to be 24 to 38 degrees, central Taiwan 23 to 37 degrees, southern Taiwan 24 to 35 degrees, and eastern Taiwan 21 to 35 degrees.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also mentioned that the latest European model shows that from August 31st to September 2nd, there will be a little more moisture from the south. Most areas will be sunny with clouds. High temperatures will drop slightly, but northern Taiwan will still be warm. The eastern part of Taiwan and Pingtung might have some short local rains. In the mountains, there will be local showers or thunderstorms in the afternoon, and sometimes these might spread to some flat areas. People should be careful about strong local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that on September 3rd and 4th, most areas will be sunny with clouds. It will be hot, and the UV index will be dangerous around noon. People should protect themselves from the sun and heatstroke. The Hengchun Peninsula and Hualien/Taitung might have some short local rains. In the afternoon, there will be local showers or thunderstorms, mostly in the mountains. People still need to be careful about strong local thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong pointed out that the newest European ensemble model shows a tropical depression slowly developing in the South China Sea. The chance of it becoming a typhoon before August 30th has increased slightly to 60%. Although it looks like a swordfish, its strength is much weaker, and it will not affect Taiwan. He added that the latest model also shows that next week, other tropical systems will be active far east of Taiwan. The Northwest Pacific is still in the season for typhoons to form often.</p>

In the first seven months of this year, life insurance companies made a profit of NT$23.2 billion. This is a big decrease of 92.3% compared to the same time last year.</p>
            <p>Adhesive company Tex Year held an online meeting on August 28th. They said that their factories in Vietnam and India cannot keep up with demand. Their second factory in India will start making products this year. Also, the board of directors recently decided to invest more money in their Vietnamese subsidiary to build a second factory there.</p>
            <p>Solar energy company TSEC announced on August 28th that Mr. Kung Ming-hsin, who represented a corporate director and is also the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, has resigned. This change will take effect on August 31st. TSEC explained that he resigned because Mr. Kung will become the new Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>
