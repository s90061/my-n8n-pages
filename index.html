            <h1>Wang Chi-Lin and Chiu Hsiang-Chieh Beat 4th Seed in BWF Denmark Open First Round</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese men's doubles players Wang Chi-Lin and Chiu Hsiang-Chieh, also known as the "Lin-Jie pair," won their first match today at the BWF Super 750 Denmark Open. They beat the 4th seed Danish team with scores of 21-17, 13-21, and 21-15. This means they have moved on to the second round of the men's doubles competition.</p>
            <p>Wang Chi-Lin and Chiu Hsiang-Chieh are ranked 21st in the world. In their first match at the BWF Denmark Open, they played against the 5th-ranked home team, Kim Astrup and Anders Skaarup Rasmussen from Denmark. This season, the two teams had played three times before, and the "Lin-Jie pair" had won one match and lost two.</p>
            <p>Even though the Danish team had the advantage of playing at home, Wang Chi-Lin and Chiu Hsiang-Chieh started strongly in the first game. In the middle of the game, they scored six points in a row and got a big lead. The Danish team saved two points, but Wang Chi-Lin then hit a strong shot to win the point. So, the "Lin-Jie pair" won the first game 21-17.</p>
            <p>However, Wang Chi-Lin and Chiu Hsiang-Chieh could not keep their strong performance in the second game. They could not stop the Danish team's attacks and were behind from the start. They lost the second game 13-21.</p>
            <p>Luckily, the "Lin-Jie pair" played well again in the third and deciding game. After a short break, they changed their strategy many times, making it hard for their opponents to hit the shuttlecock. This created chances for them to attack. They then scored six points in a row to take the lead. Wang Chi-Lin and Chiu Hsiang-Chieh also made several winning shots. Their lead grew bigger, and finally, their opponents hit the shuttlecock out of bounds. The "Lin-Jie pair" won the game 21-15 and passed the first round.</p>
            <p>Also, another Taiwanese men's doubles team, Lee Jhe-Huei and Yang Po-Hsuan, who are ranked 13th in the world, played against the Japanese team Daiki Hoshikawa and Kyohei Yamashita in their first match today. They lost the first game 17-21. But then, Lee Jhe-Huei and Yang Po-Hsuan found a way to beat their opponents. They won the next two games 21-13 and 21-15, making a comeback victory. They also moved on to the second round of the men's doubles competition.</p>

            <h1>EVA Air Apologizes After Asking for Leave Certificate from Deceased Flight Attendant</h1>
            <p>A flight attendant from EVA Air worked while sick and later died after returning to Taiwan. Reports say that the company still sent a message asking for proof of family care leave. Today, EVA Air said that they helped the employee with leave applications when she was in the hospital. The mistake happened because an employee was not familiar enough with their job duties. EVA Air has apologized to the family.</p>
            <p>An EVA Air flight attendant became sick while working and passed away after coming back to Taiwan. EVA Air stated that they will quickly find out what happened. The Taoyuan City Labor Inspection Office recently checked the airline. They found that the working hours and rest times between shifts followed the Labor Standards Act. EVA Air did not stop flight attendants from taking leave. However, some types of leave can affect an employee's performance review.</p>
            <p>It was reported that after the flight attendant died, her phone received a message from an EVA Air employee. The message asked if she had given in the certificate for family care leave for September 27th and reminded her to do so. EVA Air replied in writing that they are very sorry for causing trouble to the family. The company said that they helped the employee with her leave applications while she was in the hospital. This mistake happened because an employee was not familiar enough with their job. EVA Air will review this issue carefully and make changes. They again offered their deepest apologies to the family.</p>

            <h1>Israeli Couple Captured by Hamas for 2 Years Reunite, Plan to "Heal Together"</h1>
            <p>On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, and an Israeli couple, Avinatan Or and Noa Argamani, were captured. After 738 days apart, Argamani, who was freed earlier, finally reunited with her boyfriend. She wrote on social media, "It's time to start healing together."</p>
            <p>According to reports from the BBC and Reuters, Avinatan Or, 32, and his girlfriend Noa Argamani, 28, were taken from the Nova Music Festival. A scary video of Argamani being pulled onto the back of a motorcycle became one of the most famous images from the attack.</p>
            <p>On June 8, 2024, Israeli soldiers rescued Argamani. Or, who was held in a different place in the central Gaza Strip, was set free on October 13 this month.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump helped arrange a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas. This led to Hamas releasing 20 living Israeli hostages, and Or was one of them.</p>
            <p>The day after her partner was freed, Argamani posted a touching message in Hebrew on Instagram. She also shared the first photos of them together since 2023.</p>
            <p>She wrote, "It has been two years since I last saw Avinatan, my love. Two years ago, terrorists took us, pushed me onto a motorcycle, and forced us apart in front of the whole world."</p>
            <p>Argamani said that she was held in a house with other women and children, while her boyfriend was kept in a tunnel. She added, "Hamas released videos and signs that I was alive, but there was no news about Avinatan."</p>
            <p>She said that now they can start to heal. "We won our personal war, and the whole world fought with us to make this moment happen. Now is the time for us to start our future life together."</p>
            <p>Argamani also thanked Trump for helping the Israeli hostages return home and for helping them "overcome the darkness."</p>
            <p>Or's father, Yaron Or, said in an interview that his son had "very little food" during his time as a prisoner. He was alone for long periods, chained in tunnels or small spaces. Or, who is almost 2 meters tall, was even held in a place only 1.8 meters high and just a little longer than his bed mattress.</p>
            <p>Yaron told reporters that during those days, his son had "no books to read, no one to talk to, nothing." He only got a Rubik's Cube to pass the time. He had almost no information from the outside world. He did not know where his girlfriend was, and he did not fully understand the Hamas attack or Israel's response.</p>
            <p>Yaron said that his son's guards had relatives who died in Israeli army airstrikes. He said, "I think it's a miracle they didn't hurt him." Only once, when he tried to escape, he was caught and beaten.</p>
            <p>The old father also said that his son is now very thin. "His body still needs to recover, but mentally, thank God, he is still the Avinatan we know â€“ just as funny and strong."</p>
