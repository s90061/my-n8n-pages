New artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming very common in creative fields like art, writing, and music. Many artists and designers are now using AI programs to help them with their work. For example, AI can quickly create images, write basic texts, or even generate musical ideas. This can save a lot of time and help people create more content faster.

However, the rise of AI in creativity also brings new challenges. Some people worry that AI might take jobs away from human artists and writers. There are also concerns about who owns the rights to AI-generated work, especially if the AI learned from existing human art. Another important question is whether AI tools will change what we think of as original or truly creative. As these tools become more advanced, societies will need to discuss these important issues about work, copyright, and the future of human creativity.

**Cities Worldwide Adapt to Hotter Summers**

Many cities around the world are facing much hotter summers because of climate change. These extreme heatwaves can be dangerous for people, especially the elderly and young children. They also put a lot of stress on city services like electricity, as more people use air conditioning. Because of this, city leaders are looking for new ways to keep their residents safe and cool.

One common solution is to plant more trees and create more green spaces. Trees provide shade and help to cool the air naturally. Some cities are painting roofs white or using special materials that reflect sunlight, which helps buildings stay cooler. They are also setting up public cooling centers where people can go to escape the heat. These efforts show how cities are changing their infrastructure and daily practices to protect citizens and prepare for future weather challenges.

**The Four-Day Work Week: A Growing Global Trend**

More and more companies around the world are trying out a four-day work week instead of the traditional five days. In this model, employees work the same number of hours, but they are spread over four days instead of five. This usually means longer workdays for four days, followed by a three-day weekend. Many companies that have tested this system report positive results.

Supporters say that employees are happier and less stressed with a longer weekend. This can lead to better mental health and a healthier work-life balance. Surprisingly, many businesses also find that productivity does not go down; in some cases, it even increases. Workers might be more focused and efficient because they have more time to rest. While it doesn't work for every type of job, the idea of a shorter work week is gaining popularity as companies look for new ways to attract and keep good employees and improve overall well-being.`;
