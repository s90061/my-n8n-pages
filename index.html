            <h1>Report: Government to Apply Income Limits for Cash Payments; Officials Say Some Parts of Law May Not Be Legal</h1>
            <p>The government in Taiwan is planning to prepare a special budget for a new law. This is because of new taxes from the United States. News reports say that the government will also change another law. This change will add a rule that only people who are not rich will get money from the government. An official from the government said today that they will quickly prepare the budget based on the law. But some parts of the law might not follow the constitution. So, the government will ask the court to decide if these parts are legal at the right time.</p>
            <p>A special law to make Taiwan's economy, society, and national security stronger was recently passed. This law plans to use 545 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Out of this money, 235 billion will be for giving money to people. 150 billion will be for making the country's security stronger. 93 billion will be for helping the economy because of the new taxes from the U.S. And 67 billion will be for social support. The plan to give 100 billion to Taipower (the power company) was removed.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, the President's office announced the special law to make Taiwan stronger. Premier Cho Jung-tai also asked different government departments to quickly think of more ways to help. He asked them to prepare the special budget within a week and send it to the Parliament for review. Also, after the final decision on the new taxes is made, the government will suggest changes to the special law again. This will depend on Taiwan's economic situation and what industries need help.</p>
            <p>News reports say that the government meeting on August 7th will approve the 545 billion dollar special budget. This budget will then be sent to the Parliament for review. This money includes the 235 billion for giving money to people. After the final tax numbers are known, the government will also suggest changing the special law. This change will add a rule that says only people who are not rich will get the money.</p>
            <p>A government official said that the special law was announced by the President and became effective today. To quickly help businesses and groups affected by the new U.S. taxes and to make the country's security stronger, the government will quickly prepare a special budget based on this law. However, because some parts of the law might not follow the constitution, the government will ask the court to decide if they are legal at the right time.</p>
            <p>Regarding future changes to the special law, the government official said they will make clear, specific, and effective changes. These changes will consider the country's financial situation, important tasks, and talks between political parties. The government will also quickly send the special budget for the "Special Law for Strengthening Economic, Social, and National Security Resilience in Response to International Situations" to the Parliament for review.</p>

            <h1>Wang Hung-wei Says Stock Exchange Was Asked to Give Money to Da Zhi; Cultural Association Says Everything Followed Rules</h1>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei, a lawmaker from the KMT party, said today that from 2023 to 2025, the stock exchange gave 10 million NT dollars to the rapper Da Zhi. However, the online views of his work were not good enough to spread messages. Wang Hung-wei said that the stock exchange gave this money because the General Association of Chinese Culture (GACC) asked them to. The president is the head of the GACC. So, President Lai Ching-te should explain this to the public.</p>
            <p>The GACC replied that what the lawmaker said is not true. The GACC is a non-profit group. Their work with the Taiwan Stock Exchange is like how they usually ask companies to support Taiwanese culture. The money given was handled by rules for applying, using, and checking the funds. There was no special treatment. And it is not possible that the president chose someone for the money.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei said on Facebook today that yesterday she revealed that Da Zhi's company, which has only 100,000 NT dollars in capital, received money. From 2022 to 2025, the Ministry of Culture gave Da Zhi's company, "Every Human Has Skills Music Studio," 10,297,019 NT dollars. And the stock exchange gave 10 million NT dollars from 2023 to 2025.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei said that from 2023 to 2025, the stock exchange gave Da Zhi 3 million, 3.5 million, and 3.5 million NT dollars each year. This means more than 3 million dollars of taxpayer money was spent each year. Some internet users found that this money might have been used for Da Zhi's rap songs on the Taiwan Stock Exchange's YouTube channel. Two years ago, he made a song called "Fraud" about stopping financial scams. One year ago, he made "ETF" about investing in ETFs regularly. And seven months ago, he made "Odd-Lot Trading and Behind-the-Scenes Interview" about trading rules. But no matter the art, these videos did not get enough views to spread their messages well.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei also said many people wonder why the stock exchange gave money to Da Zhi's company. She said the answer is that it was asked by the top. The 10 million dollar help from the stock exchange came because the General Association of Chinese Culture, where the president is the head, sent a letter asking for a "free donation." This means that Da Zhi was chosen by former President Tsai Ing-wen and President Lai to receive "legal money." It is then easy to understand why he would use government money to attack the KMT party, Mayday, and B'in Music.</p>
            <p>Wang Hung-wei believes that when news came out about Mayday giving 9 million NT dollars to people affected by disaster in Tainan, they also did many other good things secretly. But she said these singers who work for the DPP party take taxpayer money every year to create political attack works. She thinks that this "free donation" of over 3 million NT dollars each year could be better used. She suggests that even half of it could go to people in need or for public good, instead of supporting political allies.</p>

            <h1>Jiuzhize Hot Spring Now Privately Run, Promotes "From Taipingshan to the Pacific Ocean" Tours</h1>
            <p>The Jiuzhize Hot Spring in Taipingshan National Forest Recreation Area started new operations on August 1st. The company that won the bid will spend over 35.89 million New Taiwan Dollars to repair it. They will also add a new idea called "From Taipingshan to the Pacific Ocean." This means they will add shuttle buses to connect Taipingshan with popular places along the coast in Yilan.</p>
            <p>The Yilan branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency said today that the Jiuzhize Hot Spring project (which includes rebuilding and operating the area) has a new company in charge. Lian Da Construction Co., Ltd. was chosen as the best company. Starting August 1st, Lian Da Jiuzhize Co., Ltd. will be responsible for running the hot spring and providing services.</p>
            <p>The Yilan branch stated that this project includes five areas at the Jiuzhize Hot Spring: the main building, the hot spring SPA area, private hot spring rooms, the public hot spring area, and the egg-boiling section. The company will manage these for 8 years. If they do well, they can extend the contract for another 7 years. During the 6-month repair period, the egg-boiling section and some hot spring facilities will still be open. Other facilities will open as soon as they are fixed.</p>
            <p>The Yilan branch said that this project especially combines the idea of "From Taipingshan to the Pacific Ocean" for eco-tourism. The company will add shuttle buses to connect Taipingshan National Forest Recreation Area with coastal spots in Yilan. For example, they will go to Guishan Island and Wushi Port in Toucheng Township. The route will also pass through the Atayal tribe villages in Datong Township. This will create a "Lanyang Mountain and Sea Eco-Tour" package that offers rich nature and culture. In the future, visitors can enjoy the mountains and the sea in one day. They can feel the special natural beauty and culture of Yilan.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Yilan branch said that the company will add a free hot spring foot bath area and charging stations for electric cars. This will make the facilities better and more friendly. People living in Sanxing and Datong townships will also get discounts for using the hot springs. The company has also promised to give 1 million NT dollars each year to the Datong Township Office. This money will help with local public buildings and improve life for people there.</p>
