            <h1>After Lin Yu-ting, Algerian Boxer Khelif Also Misses WB World Championships</h1>
            <p>The head of the World Boxing Federation (WB), Boris van der Vorst, said today that Algerian boxer Imane Khelif will not join the World Championships. This is because she did not sign up. The WB asks all boxers to have a gender test to compete. Khelif can appeal against this rule.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Khelif and Lin Yu-ting from Taiwan won gold medals at the Paris Olympics last year. There were questions about their gender to compete. Less than a year later, in May, the WB made a new rule. It said all boxers must have a gender test before they can join its events. The WB will also manage boxing for the 2028 Olympics.</p>
            <p>Khelif wants to change this rule from the WB. So, she has complained to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which is a high court for sports problems.</p>
            <p>Van der Vorst said today, "She has the right to do that. But we must say that we made this test a rule to make sure the matches are safe and fair. This way, everyone can compete fairly."</p>
            <p>The WB World Championships will start tomorrow in Liverpool, UK. When reporters asked Van der Vorst if Khelif did not pass the gender test, he answered, "It's too soon to say now. This is because she did not even represent her country's group to compete in Liverpool."</p>
            <p>The Algerian Boxing Federation did not answer Reuters' questions right away.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the WB said that Lin Yu-ting from Taiwan will also not join the Liverpool World Championships. Van der Vorst said today, "I know she was also not put on the list of participants by her national group."</p>

            <h1>Putin Says He Is Ready for Talks if Zelensky Comes to Moscow</h1>
            <p>Today, Russian President Putin said he is ready to meet with Ukrainian President Zelensky in Moscow. But he also said it is not clear yet if such a meeting would be helpful.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Volodymyr Zelensky has been trying hard to meet with Vladimir Putin. He wants to talk about ways to make an agreement. Former U.S. President Trump has also been working to help with a peace plan. He said he hopes the two leaders can meet.</p>
            <p>Putin talked to reporters after his visit to China. He said he is always open to meeting Zelensky. But he repeated that the Kremlin believes such talks must be well-prepared. Also, they need to lead to real results.</p>
            <p>Putin said, "About meeting Zelensky, I have never said no to this idea. But will it be useful? We will see."</p>
            <p>Putin added that, for him, Ukraine needs to do a few things first to make progress. These include ending martial law, holding elections, and having a public vote about land issues.</p>
            <p>In 2022, Moscow said it had taken over four regions in southeast Ukraine. But Kyiv and most Western countries said no to this. They believe Russia started a war to take land illegally.</p>

            <h1>After US Tariffs, Taiwan Can Use a Special Fund to Invest in America</h1>
            <p>Today, Wei Chi-lin, the chairman of SinoPac Financial Holdings, said that the time of free global trade has ended after the pandemic. Because of new US tariff rules, Taiwan should think about starting a sovereign wealth fund. This fund could invest in US industries. This would help reduce the pressure on Taiwan's old industries and local service businesses.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin said today that the government is working hard on "Ten New AI Projects." They want all kinds of businesses to use AI, which is artificial intelligence. After the pandemic, there was a big change in trade. The time when goods moved freely between countries is over. This greatly affects Taiwan, a country that makes money by selling things to other countries. But Taiwan has good workers. It imports products, adds more value to them, and then sells them. This has helped Taiwan do very well.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin said that Taiwan has earned more from trade than it has spent for many years. Taiwan has almost 600 billion US dollars in foreign money saved. This is a lot for Taiwan's economy. Recently, many businesses in Taiwan are facing problems because of new US tariffs. Wei suggests that Taiwan can start a special fund, a sovereign wealth fund, to invest in America. It doesn't have to be in physical things, but can also be in stocks and bonds to deal with the changes.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin explained that the Taiwan sovereign fund could start with 100 to 200 billion US dollars. The National Development Council would watch over it. At first, Taiwan could ask foreign teams to manage some of the money and learn their investing ways. If Taiwan uses this fund well to invest in the US, it can become closer to the US.</p>
            <p>Wei Chi-lin is also the Vice Chairman of the Taiwan AI Academy Foundation. He also said that the government announced 2017 as the "first year of AI" for Taiwan. At that time, they saw how much AI and Nvidia could grow. So, with the idea of a public good, they decided to train more AI experts for Taiwan. Now, 13,000 students have taken these courses.</p>
            <p>Tsai Ming-shun, the head of the Taiwan AI Academy, said that the Taiwan AI Annual Conference, organized by the Taiwan AI Academy, will happen this year. It will be from September 9th to September 10th at the Academia Sinica Humanities and Social Sciences Building. About 1,500 people are expected to attend.</p>
