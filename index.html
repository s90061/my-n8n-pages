            <h1>TPBL Warm-up Games Start Oct 3 in Pingtung to Benefit Fans in Non-Pro Basketball Counties</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Professional Basketball League (TPBL) will have official warm-up games from October 3rd to 5th. These games will be at the Pingtung County Stadium. Deputy Secretary-General Cheng Po-jen said that the league wants to play in places where there are no existing team home courts. This will help fans in counties that do not have professional basketball teams.</p>
            <p>The first TPBL season ended successfully in late June. After that, the league started talking with P.LEAGUE+ about working together. However, the talks failed, and both leagues decided to go their own ways again.</p>
            <p>The TPBL is actively getting ready for the new season. They will start their official warm-up games from October 3rd to 5th at the Pingtung Stadium. Seven teams will each play two games. The games are planned as two games on the first day, three games on the second, and two games on the third. The main opening game will be between the New Taipei Kings and the Kaohsiung Aquas. This will be a repeat of last season's championship final.</p>
            <p>TPBL Deputy Secretary-General Cheng Po-jen told reporters that the league had been discussing venues for the new season's warm-up games since the end of last season. Chairman Chuang Ruei-hsiung also talked directly with the seven teams. They wanted to move away from the home cities of the current teams. This was to let more people experience the excitement of professional basketball. So, they asked about venues in Pingtung and Taitung. Because the Taitung County Stadium needed repairs, they finally chose Pingtung.</p>
            <p>Cheng Po-jen said that they paused warm-up game plans while discussing cooperation between the two leagues. After the cooperation talks failed, they quickly confirmed the venue's availability. They also got support from the Pingtung County Government. The games will be co-hosted with the Pingtung County Government. The Pingtung Stadium has just been renovated, and the environment is very good. He said, "We hope to benefit fans in counties that do not have professional basketball teams."</p>

            <h1>Taiwan's MAC says China's claims on WWII contributions are "ridiculous" and against history</h1>
            <p>Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO), used numbers to say that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) helped a lot in the War of Resistance against Japan. Today, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) responded. They said these numbers are not true, and they go against history. MAC called these claims "self-deceiving and ridiculous." MAC added that the CCP cannot say which big battles it started or joined. So, making up numbers is truly funny.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon of the 10th, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officially denied the numbers given by China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) at their press conference. Earlier on the 10th, Chen Binhua claimed at a regular press conference that the CCP led the battle behind enemy lines. He also said they worked with the Kuomintang (KMT), who led the main battlefront. Together, he claimed they killed more than 697,000 Japanese soldiers.</p>
            <p>The MAC stated that the TAO's false claim that "the CCP was the main force in the War of Resistance" is completely against history. The TAO said that different CCP army units killed more than 170,000 and over 527,000 Japanese soldiers, totaling more than 697,000. The MAC said these claims show again that the TAO is trying to deceive people.</p>
            <p>The MAC pointed out that in 1964, Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare released numbers. They said about 502,400 Japanese soldiers died in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Manchuria. General He Yingqin, who was the Army Commander-in-Chief during the war, wrote a book called "The Course of Eight Years of Resistance." In this book, he recorded that about 480,000 Japanese soldiers died.</p>
            <p>The MAC mentioned that killing more than 697,000 Japanese soldiers would need many large battles. The government of the Republic of China has clear records of 22 major battles. On the other hand, the CCP still cannot say which big battles it started or joined. It also cannot say how many enemies it killed in each battle. So, making up the number of over 697,000 soldiers killed is truly ridiculous.</p>
            <p>The MAC stressed that the Republic of China government led the War of Resistance. The CCP only used this chance to grow its own power. They "wandered but did not attack, resisted but did not fight." Spreading false stories cannot hide the historical truth that the CCP did not contribute to the war. The numbers provided by the TAO do not match historical facts. They also wrongly credit the CCP army for all Japanese soldiers killed in mainland China. This is self-deceiving and makes them a laughingstock.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 10th, Chen Binhua claimed at a regular press conference: "During the long and difficult 14-year War of Resistance, the Chinese Communist Party showed excellent political leadership and correct strategies. These guided the direction of China's resistance." He also said, "The battlefront led by the Chinese Communist Party behind enemy lines and the main battlefront led by the Kuomintang worked together to attack the enemy."</p>
            <p>Chen Binhua used numbers and data to say: "From September 1931 to September 1945, the anti-Japanese soldiers and people in Northeast China killed more than 170,000 Japanese soldiers. The Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and anti-Japanese guerrillas in South China killed more than 527,000 Japanese soldiers. This greatly hurt the Japanese invaders and made people more confident in the resistance. The large battlefront behind enemy lines fought against 60% of the invading Japanese army and slowly became the main battlefield."</p>

            <h1>Blue-White Counties Call for Consolidated Allocation Funds and General Subsidies to Only Increase, Not Decrease</h1>
            <p>A new version of the Public Finance Act has started, and many county leaders have concerns. Today, leaders and deputy leaders from 15 "blue-white" counties held a press conference. They asked that local governments have their own money decisions. They also said that funds given by the central government and general subsidies should be given fairly by law. These funds should only increase, not decrease, compared to before the law changed.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Executive Yuan spokesperson Lee Hui-chih said that the new Public Finance Act has a problem with how it divides money horizontally. Because of this, more than 30 billion NT dollars cannot be given out. The central government wants to give the money but cannot. So, the law needs to be changed again. She also said that next year, the total money the central government gives to local governments will be the highest ever. The central government must rethink how power and money are divided between central and local levels. Premier Cho Jung-tai also said he will invite county leaders to talk about the Public Finance Act.</p>
            <p>People who know about the situation said that on the 4th, the Executive Yuan already had a first understanding of the ideas from some green-camp counties. Currently, the related government departments are checking everything. After their preparation work is done, they will quickly invite county leaders in groups to discuss. Besides talking about dividing power and changing the Public Finance Act, they also expect to discuss the consolidated tax allocations, general subsidies, and special project subsidies each county gets. They hope counties that have already received a lot of money will think carefully about this.</p>
            <p>Based on details from the Ministry of Finance about how central government funds are given to local governments, and population data from the Ministry of Interior in July, Taipei City will get the most next year. It will receive over 114.92 billion NT dollars, which means each person gets 46,000 NT dollars. But New Taipei City, which has the most people, will get less than 24,000 NT dollars per person. Also, because of a problem with the new Public Finance Act's formula, Lienchiang County's funds will decrease next year. So, the central government has decided to help Lienchiang County to make up the difference so it gets the same amount as before.</p>
            <p>Today, counties led by the "blue" and "white" parties held a press conference in Taichung. Mayor Lu Shiow-yen of Taichung brought them together. The event was called "Fifteen Counties Stand Up! Defend Local Subsidies." They released a three-point statement together.</p>
            <p>1. The goal of changing the Public Finance Act is to make sure local governments can make their own money decisions. Funds given by the central government and general subsidies should be given fully and fairly, as the Public Finance Act intends. Also, it must be guaranteed that both types of money for each local government will only increase, not decrease, compared to before the law changed.</p>
            <p>2. General subsidies should be given using a clear, fair, and open formula. They should not become a system where the central government makes all the rules and checks without discussion.</p>
            <p>3. General subsidies and project subsidies that the central government has already approved for local governments should be protected. They should not be reduced, removed, or delayed without good reason. They asked the central government to quickly provide the full and correct amount. This is to avoid serious problems with local government work.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City Mayor Hou Yu-ih suggested that how power and duties are divided is very important. He asked if the central government should start to make changes. He said they should not use a system where the central government "invites" and local governments "pay." Instead, they should have full discussions, explain clearly, and face problems together. Second, general subsidies should not be based on applications. They should be calculated using a public and clear formula. This way, making budgets and doing work will be easier to follow. He also said that the 34.5 billion NT dollars that have not been given out yet should be given fairly. This money should also help rural areas and counties that have money problems.</p>
            <p>Taipei City Mayor Chiang Wan-an said directly, "Today, we stand here to surround the central government. We want to fight for the right of local governments to manage themselves. We don't want to be controlled by the central government everywhere or have to please them." He said they are speaking up for local disadvantaged people, for education, and for important railway budgets that affect people's lives.</p>
            <p>Changhua County Magistrate Wang Huei-mei stressed that local governments must control their own money. They should not get less money than before the law changed, or even become poorer. Yunlin County Magistrate Chang Li-shan said that power should be given to local areas. She said that trying to cut money is not good for everyone. Chiayi City Mayor Huang Min-hui asked that the process not become a secret or based on political party.</p>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said, "We hope the central government will stop cutting local government subsidies and allocated funds. They should follow the law's intention and use formulas that are open and clear, like how they gave money to local areas in the past." She added that if local governments do well, the central government will also do well, and the country will be better. Everyone should work together.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, during interviews with reporters, the media asked about Premier Cho Jung-tai's earlier statement. He said that if the Executive Yuan's reconsideration had been accepted, these problems could have been solved. They also asked if it was too late to invite county leaders for discussions. Chiang Wan-an replied that this was avoiding the real issue. He said that if they truly want to give local governments more power and fix the money problems between the central and local governments, they should face the problems and solve them. He suggested less political talk and more real solutions.</p>
            <p>In addition, the media asked about the formula in the Public Finance Act. Wang Ming-chu, the Deputy Mayor of Taoyuan City, replied. He said the Executive Yuan mentioned that the formula had a problem. But after Taoyuan City's Finance Department checked, they believe the formula is fine. The formula is simple: the total amount for each of the 19 counties and cities is 90.5%. For cities like Taipei, Taichung, New Taipei, and Taoyuan, the percentages are very clear. So, the formula has no problems. However, if the Executive Yuan wants to cause trouble and not give money, they will reduce funds. This is not good for the country or for local areas.</p>
