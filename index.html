            <h1>Ceiling Falls in Keelung Home; Engineer Thinks It's Because of Rusty Steel Bars</h1>
            <p>In Keelung City, on Baisan Street, a concrete ceiling fell down yesterday in the living room of a home on the third floor of a five-story apartment building. Luckily, no one was hurt. A civil engineer checked the building today. He said it might be because the steel bars inside the concrete were rusty. The engineer added that a special company needs to check the whole building's safety carefully.</p>
            <p>The concrete ceiling in the living room of the third-floor apartment fell suddenly yesterday morning. No one was injured, which was good. The floor in the fourth-floor apartment above it looks okay for now. But the city government has helped the 8 people from these two homes to stay in a hotel. The night before, there was a 6.0 magnitude earthquake near Yilan. The strongest shaking in Yilan County was level 4.</p>
            <p>Today, the Keelung City Government's Urban Development Department went to the building with civil engineers and structural engineers. They went to see what caused the ceiling to fall.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jiang Zhi-huang, who is in charge of the Keelung office for the Taiwan Provincial Civil Engineers Association, talked to a reporter. He said that after looking at the building, they think the ceiling fell because the steel bars in the third-floor ceiling were rusty. Also, the apartment on the fourth floor had new polished quartz tiles installed on its floor. This made the floor heavier. They are not sure if the strong earthquake in Yilan also caused the problem.</p>
            <p>He also said that the rusty steel bars in the third-floor concrete ceiling might have too much chloride. They need to do a chloride test to see if it's a "sea sand house." This is a type of building people worry about. The floor between the third and fourth floors is dangerous right now and should be removed first.</p>
            <p>The head of the Keelung City Government's Urban Development Department, Mr. Hsieh Hsiao-kun, said the apartment building got its permit in 1987. So, the building is 38 years old. After checking the building today with other groups, they believe the whole building is not in immediate danger. But the government will help with a full check of the building later.</p>

            <h1>Longest Meeting of Parliament Ends; Han Kuo-yu Asks All Parties to Work Together</h1>
            <p>Today was the last meeting of the 11th Legislative Yuan's third session. The head of the Legislative Yuan, Han Kuo-yu, said that even though different political parties had different ideas during this session, they still passed many important laws. These laws help the country and its people, such as the special budget for rebuilding after the typhoon. Next week, the fourth session will begin. He asked all political parties to forget their disagreements. He wants them to look at the problems Taiwan is facing, both inside and outside the country. He asked them to find solutions together and work hand in hand.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu gave a speech on the speaker's stand in the parliament hall just before he announced the end of the meeting at about 4:50 PM. First, he thanked all the party leaders and all the members of parliament. He said that during this session, even though they had different ideas, they talked and worked together. Because of this, they were able to pass many important laws that help the country and its people.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said that during this session, the Legislative Yuan passed 77 important items. These included 41 new laws, 18 budget plans, 4 reconsideration requests, 1 approval for a person to take a job, 1 internal rule for the Legislative Yuan, and 12 other items.</p>
            <p>He said the most important thing they did was to pass a special law and budget. This was for rebuilding after Typhoon Danas and the heavy rains on July 28. With all the party leaders and members of parliament working together, they quickly passed this law. It will be used to help rebuild the areas affected by the disaster. This is very important.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu said he wants to ask everyone again: democracy is hard to get. So, it's important to respect each other, be less mean, stay calm, and talk nicely. These things help democracy work well. Next week, the fourth session will begin. He asked all political parties to put their differences aside. He wants them to look at the many challenges Taiwan is facing and work together to find solutions.</p>
            <p>Han Kuo-yu also said he wants to especially thank the staff and meeting helpers of the Legislative Yuan for their hard work. He also thanked all government departments for helping the Legislative Yuan. They all worked together to do the best for the people of the country. He thanked everyone again. After that, Han Kuo-yu announced the meeting was over.</p>
            <p>After the meeting ended, Premier Cho Jung-tai and others came to the hall. They shook hands with the members of parliament from all parties who were there. Han Kuo-yu also came down from the speaker's stand and shook hands with Premier Cho. Then, they took a picture together with everyone.</p>
            <p>The parliament usually meets from February to the end of May, and from September to the end of December each year. On April 18, the KMT political party suggested extending this session until July 31. The KMT and the smaller white party worked together and voted to pass this on May 20. Then, on June 13, the Taiwan People's Party suggested extending it even further, until August 31. The Legislative Yuan voted and passed this second extension on July 18.</p>

            <h1>Army Creates New Drone Unit; Experts Hope It Will Set Important Rules</h1>
            <p>The Army has created a new group called the "Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit." Experts said today that the Army will probably use drones the most. They suggest this unit should be important in making rules for how the Army uses drones. They also hope the unit will create a "technology tree." This means finding new automatic ways to make the army stronger in the future, especially if there are not enough soldiers.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of National Defense released a report called "Five-Year Force Building and Policy Plan." In this report, they said that they are looking at how wars will be fought in the future. To make a modern army, they are changing how defense money is used, when new weapons are bought, and how military service works. They are also getting new weapons like drones. Because of this, the Army Headquarters has added the "Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit" and made other changes to its army structure.</p>
            <p>Su Tzu-yun, an expert from the National Defense and Security Research Institute, which is a think tank for the Ministry of National Defense, said that the Army's action follows the idea of "asymmetric warfare." This means fighting in unexpected ways. Compared to the Navy and Air Force, which mostly use drones for bigger, planned fights, the Army will use drones at a smaller, "combat" level. This means that small groups of soldiers like squads, platoons, and teams might all use drones. So, the Army will use drones in the most ways.</p>
            <p>Su Tzu-yun also mentioned that from what we learned in the war between Russia and Ukraine, drones are used up very quickly. So, they need to buy many drones that are not expensive. Because of this, the Army's unmanned equipment should not only include drones but also unmanned vehicles.</p>
            <p>Su Tzu-yun also said that the Army Headquarters' Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit will surely work with other Army groups. These groups include those that develop rules and training schools for soldiers. Together, they will choose the right and easy-to-use drones. The new unit will also be very important in creating rules for how drones are used.</p>
            <p>Shu Hsiao-huang, another expert from the National Defense and Security Research Institute, believes that the "Five-Year Force Building Report" aims to tell people and the Legislative Yuan about the military's plans. These plans are based on the threats Taiwan faces. When looking at China's military growth, we see it includes very stealthy and automatic equipment. Taiwan faces very serious challenges. Because of the war in Ukraine, Taiwan's main military equipment and old ways of fighting are now facing big difficulties. So, it is necessary for the Army to create a special "Air Defense and Unmanned Systems Unit."</p>
            <p>Shu Hsiao-huang explained that different parts of the military need different types of drones. For example, the Air Force needs drones that can search large areas of air and sea for a long time. The Navy needs drones that can find targets to help attack enemy ships. The Army needs drones for fighting beyond what soldiers can see. These drones will be used by brigades, battalions, and even smaller combat groups. They will send information back to the units that fire weapons so they can attack.</p>
            <p>Shu Hsiao-huang stressed that, for the Army, when Chinese ships are moving across the water, the Taiwanese army finds it hard to attack them. Also, the Chinese army's defenses are not strong at that time. So, drones can be a very powerful weapon to fight against them. He suggested that this Army unit should create different rules for different types of Army groups to follow. They should even think about a "technology tree." This means finding new automatic ways to make the army stronger when there are not enough soldiers in the future.</p>
