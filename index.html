            <h1>Portable Long-Acting Antibiotics Expected to Be Available in November, Allowing Patients to Receive Treatment at Home</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare started a new plan in August. Now, people can get antibiotic injections at clinics instead of staying in the hospital. Today, Minister Shih Chung-liang talked about the next step. They are thinking about including portable long-acting antibiotics that people only need to take once a day. This could start in November. Then, patients might be able to get antibiotic treatment at home.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang attended the "2025 Integrity Forum" by the Taiwan Research-based Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association today. He said that in the past, patients needed to stay in the hospital for antibiotic treatment. This was because they had to get injections three times a day, every eight hours. They could also get them at clinics, but it was very inconvenient. It was hard to ask people to come to the clinic three times a day. So, most people chose to stay in the hospital.</p>
            <p>Shih Chung-liang explained that long-acting injections have appeared. These solved the problem of needing three injections every day. But doctors found that most of these long-acting injections were for serious infections. Companies then suggested a light, portable pump. This pump can give the antibiotics for common infections in one go, instead of many times.</p>
            <p>Taiwan has many elderly people. This new method helps older people stay in the hospital for less time. It also lowers their risk of getting infections. They can go back home earlier and stay active. Shih Chung-liang believes this new technology will not only stop strong bacteria from growing, but also let people take their medicine home. They can finish the injection in one go. This technology is waiting for a review meeting this week. It might be available for treatment as early as November 1st.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu, the Director-General of the National Health Insurance Administration, sent a message to reporters. She explained that this week's review meeting will discuss portable infusion devices. Before, for "Outpatient Parenteral Antimicrobial Therapy (OPAT)", medical teams often chose strong antibiotics given once a day. This did not allow for quick changes. Portable infusion devices can give medicine continuously for 24 hours, making the treatment very exact. This lets medical teams change the medicine based on the patient's infection. It also helps control the quality of infection treatment.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu further explained that "Non-hospital intravenous antibiotic treatment (OPAT)" is an effective and easy treatment. It is especially good for mild to medium infections. This new OPAT treatment allows patients who usually need to stay in the hospital for antibiotic injections to go home for treatment. This helps hospitals use their beds better and lets patients move more freely.</p>
            <p>Chen Liang-yu said that the Emergency Medicine Association suggested this plan. The National Health Insurance Administration worked with medical groups like the National Physicians' Association and the Infectious Diseases Society of Taiwan. The plan started in August. Currently, 23 hospitals and 8 clinics have joined. 215 people have finished their treatment. Hospitals and clinics have said that the results are good.</p>

            <h1>Taichung Green Museum and Library Preview: Mayor Lu Shiow-yen and Japanese Architects Open It</h1>
            <p>The Taichung Green Museum and Library will open at the end of the year. Today, Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen, along with Japanese architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, gave a special preview tour of the building. Mayor Lu said that the Green Museum and Library will become an important landmark not only for Taiwan but also for the world of culture.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, the Taichung Green Museum and Library held its preview. It is the first building in Taiwan to combine a city art museum and a city library. Mayor Lu, the main architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa, and Taiwanese architect Liu Pei-sen were all there. They guided everyone to explore the spaces inside the building. The main visual design for the opening was also shown.</p>
            <p>The tour started in the main hall of the Green Museum and Library. When the doors opened, two round glass rooms could be seen. One is the information desk for the Green Museum and Library. The other leads to an underground public area. This is one of the "mixed spaces" in the building. A bridge above the main hall offers different views of the building. From up high, visitors can see the art piece "Reproduction" by artist Lin Ming-hong. In the middle of the main hall, there is a stainless steel water pool. It is made of curved stainless steel. It can reflect the green outside and the light around it. It also helps control the temperature inside the building.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that Taichung is known as a city of culture. But it did not have a city art museum and library. After she took office, she wanted to make this dream come true. A team of Japanese and Taiwanese architects planned this world-class cultural landmark. She believes it will be an important cultural site for both Taiwan and the world.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu pointed out that the money for the Green Museum and Library comes 100% from Taichung City. She said that during her time as mayor, people have doubted and criticized every project, like the Taichung Shopping Festival and the Hot Pot & BBQ Festival. She thanked the citizens for their support. The Green Museum and Library is a gift to the citizens. She believes that if citizens have dreams, they can build this world-class landmark.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu described the Green Museum and Library as a beautiful, see-through, and elegant building. People outside cannot see inside, so there is privacy. But people inside can see the outside view. The exhibition halls are 27 meters high. This means large art pieces can be shown there in the future. The two parts of the building can be seen through each other, which was very hard to build.</p>
            <p>Kazuyo Sejima said that the location of the Green Museum and Library itself is very special. It is in a large central park and combines an art museum and a library. She believes that this space will definitely create new culture in the future. After it opens, as citizens use the space, their energy will create even more things that people cannot imagine now.</p>
            <p>Ryue Nishizawa said he hopes this building will be like a park. Even if citizens come here not to read, they can still spend a nice time here. Even if they don't go into the museum to see art, they can still feel inspired by art and enjoy art-related experiences. His goal is for the whole space to feel like a park.</p>

            <h1>Sheltered Workshops Face Difficulties, Ministry of Labor Expands Subsidies for Rent and Staff</h1>
            <p>Sheltered workshops are important places for people with disabilities to work. But high rents and other costs make it hard for these workshops to run. Today, the Ministry of Labor announced that it will give more money to sheltered workshops. This money will help with rent, management fees, and staff for marketing. The goal is to help sheltered workshops continue their work.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Labor held its regular work report. Liu Yu-yi, head of the Employment Group for People with Disabilities and Specific Groups at the Workforce Development Agency, Ministry of Labor, said that to lower the costs for sheltered workshops, the Ministry has a plan. It is called the "Program to Subsidize Local Governments for Employment Services for People with Disabilities in Sheltered Workshops." This plan helps sheltered workshops with starting and running costs, equipment repair and replacement, staff salaries, rent, and marketing costs.</p>
            <p>However, to meet the needs of sheltered workshops, Liu Yu-yi said that the plan has been changed recently. The changes include more subsidies for sheltered workshops, more flexible rules for hiring staff, and a longer time for employees to return to the workshop after trying a regular job. These changes aim to improve how sheltered workshops are run and increase the training services they offer.</p>
            <p>Regarding the increased subsidies for sheltered workshops, Liu Yu-yi said that for rent for buildings, land, or vehicles, sheltered workshops can get up to NT$40,000 per month. This amount will no longer decrease each year. Also, to help with running costs, an extra NT$6,000 to NT$30,000 per month will be given for management fees, depending on the number of people served. If equipment needs repair due to natural disasters or other unexpected events, the rule of only getting a subsidy once every three years will not apply.</p>
            <p>For more flexible staffing rules, large workshops with more than 24 employees can apply for money to hire a second marketing person, as they need to sell products. Also, the rules for who can be a technical advisor or a business marketing person have been made easier. This helps sheltered workshops find staff.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-yi also said that to encourage sheltered employees to try working in regular jobs, the time they can return to a sheltered workshop after trying a regular job has been made longer. It was 3 months, and now it is 6 months. This helps sheltered employees feel more confident when they move to regular jobs.</p>
            <p>According to data, as of July 2025, there are 164 sheltered workshops in Taiwan, employing 2021 people with disabilities.</p>
            <p>Liu Yu-yi stated that this year, NT$360 million was set aside for the plan to help local governments run employment services for people with disabilities in sheltered workshops. Next year, NT$420 million will be set aside. This is to meet the needs of sheltered workshops.</p>
