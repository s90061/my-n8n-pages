            <h1>US Tariff Talks Not Fully Clear, Report Expects ASEAN+3 Economic Growth to Slow</h1>
            <p>Discussions about US tariffs are not completely clear yet, and people are watching if they will include more goods. Experts from the ASEAN+3 (China, Japan, South Korea) macroeconomics office said that during a time of unstable global trade, the region has been quite strong. However, US tariffs and slow progress in talks are still affecting the economic outlook. They expect economic growth in ASEAN+3 to slow down this year and next year.</p>
            <p>The ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) released its quarterly report today. It predicts that the ASEAN+3 economy will grow by 3.8% this year and 3.6% in 2026, showing a slower growth rate.</p>
            <p>Muhammad Najib Razali, an expert in global economics and an associate professor at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, told CNA that for Malaysia, the US is a big buyer of its semiconductors, computer parts, and similar products. The electronics and electrical industry makes up about 40% of Malaysia's exports, so the related supply chains will be affected. Tariff rules are expected to make many industries worry about stricter checks and higher costs. He asked ASEAN countries to trade more quickly with places like the EU and India. They can learn from the EU's experience in bringing countries together to make trade stronger.</p>
            <p>Ho Dong, AMRO's chief economist, stated in a press release that ASEAN+3 has remained quite strong during this time of global trade problems. Most countries' leaders quickly took action to reduce the impact of trade issues, and the region's financial markets are also strong.</p>
            <p>However, AMRO pointed out that big uncertainties still affect the economic future of ASEAN+3. The biggest risks are the US increasing its tariffs and slow progress in tariff talks, which might involve more goods. This could further disrupt trade and slow down economic growth in the region.</p>
            <p>Ongoing political tensions and changes in the US and European economies might also further slow down future economic growth. Ho Dong said that as global trade becomes more broken up, regional cooperation has become urgent and important. By making regional cooperation stronger, while still being open to the world and firmly supporting international rules, ASEAN+3 can better resist outside problems and create new chances for growth.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump announced that tariffs on Japan will drop to 15%, and Japan will invest 550 billion US dollars in the US. The US also "finished a trade agreement" with the Philippines. The Philippines will open its markets to the US and have no tariffs, while the US will put a 19% tariff on goods from the Philippines.</p>

            <h1>KMT Reveals Cao Hsing-cheng Met with Chinese Officials in the Past; Recall Group Criticizes KMT Lawmakers for Disrespecting Voters</h1>
            <p>The KMT (Kuomintang) party said today that Cao Hsing-cheng, the former chairman of UMC (United Microelectronics Corporation) who is involved in the big recall effort, met with Chinese Communist Party officials in 2013. If we follow Cao Hsing-cheng's own rule that "meeting Chinese officials means selling out Taiwan or supporting the Communist Party," then Cao Hsing-cheng is not just a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party, but one of their own.</p>
            <p>Today, the KMT held a press conference. Ling Tao, the deputy executive director of their think tank, showed a photo of Cao Hsing-cheng meeting Chinese officials in 2013. He said that Cao Hsing-cheng went to Beijing for talks and even said, "Unification might not be bad for Taiwan." The person sitting next to Cao Hsing-cheng at that time was Sun Ya-fu, who was the deputy director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office. They met to talk about a "Law for Peaceful Coexistence Across the Taiwan Strait." Based on Cao Hsing-cheng's own words, this makes him not just a supporter of the Chinese Communist Party, but one of their own.</p>
            <p>Yang Chih-fu, a spokesperson for the KMT, said that Cao Hsing-cheng and the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) have been using "resisting China to protect Taiwan" to trick all Taiwanese people. At the end of the big recall campaign, they are still trying to trick people who don't support them into changing their minds about voting.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Alliance of Volunteers to Resist Communism and Protect Taiwan held a press conference this morning called "No Attendance, No Success," revealing where lawmakers were during the recall explanation meetings they missed. Taoyuan City Council members Peng Chun-hao and Hsu Chia-jui, along with representatives from various recall groups in Taoyuan (Taoyuan 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th recall groups), were present.</p>
            <p>Peng Chun-hao showed charts and pointed out that KMT lawmakers Chang Chih-lun, Lin Te-fu, Tu Chuan-chi, Lu Ming-che, Wan Mei-ling, Lu Yu-ling, Chiu Jo-hua, and Ting Hsueh-chung all missed the public TV recall explanation meetings. They were seen at funerals, banquets, and other places. This shows their disrespectful attitude and how they ignored the most open and clear platform for explaining policies.</p>

            <h1>Japan's Economy Minister: New US-Japan Trade Deal Does Not Include Steel and Aluminum Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Akazawa Ryosei, Japan's Minister for Economic Revitalization, who is in charge of talks with the US about tariffs, said today that the 50% tariffs the US charges on steel and aluminum imported from Japan are not part of the trade agreement the two countries announced earlier.</p>
            <p>Akazawa Ryosei told the media in Washington, D.C., "If you ask if this agreement includes steel and aluminum, the answer is no."</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Akazawa Ryosei also said today that the new trade agreement between the US and Japan does not cover defense spending.</p>
            <p>He stated, "This agreement does not include anything about defense spending."</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump had asked Japan, a close friend, to spend more on its military. Because of this, some people thought that defense spending might be part of a bigger trade deal.</p>
