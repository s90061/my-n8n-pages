            <h1>Volunteer Soldier Allowance Not Budgeted; Defense Minister Hopes for Agreement</h1>
            <p>The central government's budget for 2026 did not include money for two things: changes to soldiers' pay and rules for police and firefighters' pensions. This caused many discussions. Today, Minister of National Defense, Gu Li-hsiung, said that the Ministry of National Defense follows the Cabinet's instructions. He also said that there is no agreement between the government and the lawmakers on raising the allowance for volunteer soldiers to NT$30,000. He hopes they can talk about it.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai led heads of government departments to the Legislative Yuan. They reported on the extra budget for 2025 and answered questions. Before the meeting, Gu Li-hsiung made the statements above.</p>
            <p>The Legislative Yuan approved a pay raise for soldiers, but the Cabinet did not put it in the main budget. Gu Li-hsiung said that the Ministry of National Defense follows the Cabinet's rules. He also said that there is no agreement between the government and lawmakers on raising the allowance for volunteer soldiers to NT$30,000. He hopes they can reach an agreement through a legal explanation of the Constitution or other ways. If they agree later, the Ministry will follow the Cabinet's instructions.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked what "other ways" meant and if not including the money was against the law. Gu Li-hsiung said that the government and lawmakers have not agreed yet, and he hopes they will talk about it more.</p>
            <p>Gu Li-hsiung pointed out that preparing the budget is the Cabinet's job. The Ministry of National Defense supports the Cabinet's plans. The Cabinet has to think about the whole country's money and fairness when making the budget. The Ministry of National Defense respects and accepts this.</p>
            <p>Gu Li-hsiung said that Taiwan must show it is ready to defend itself because of serious threats. This means the defense budget needs to increase. President Lai Ching-te promised that the defense budget would reach 3% of the country's total income (GDP). The defense budget has three main parts: money for staff, money for operations, and money for military investments. These three parts should be balanced and not ignored. The Cabinet supports a 20.1% increase in the yearly budget. In the future, they will also keep improving soldiers' benefits and living conditions. They will also quickly buy new weapons and equipment, make sure equipment is well-kept, and provide good training. They will also gradually review and adjust pay increases.</p>
            <p>Gu Li-hsiung said that one important task President Lai instructed the Ministry of National Defense to do is to improve the pay of the military, including benefits for soldiers and their families. This will make soldiers feel proud when they protect the country. In fact, in April, June, and July of this year, the Ministry of National Defense increased special allowances for volunteer soldiers, combat units, cyber warfare, electronic reconnaissance, and air traffic control. The Ministry of National Defense will continue to plan how to adjust these allowances based on the skills needed by the troops, the nature of their tasks, and the level of danger.</p>
            <p>Also, yesterday, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) released a rare statement about its meeting with Minister of National Defense Gu Li-hsiung. This caused public discussion. Gu Li-hsiung repeated that military talks between Taiwan and the US always help keep peace and stability in the region. Talking with AIT is part of these military discussions. Besides AIT, Taiwan will also continue to talk closely with the US government and lawmakers. As for what was discussed with AIT, it will not be made public, as both sides have agreed.</p>
            <p>In June of this year, the Legislative Yuan passed some changes to the military pay law. It clearly states that volunteer soldiers in the military will receive an extra NT$30,000 each month. This is an increase of over NT$10,000 compared to the current extra pay, which is between NT$13,000 and NT$15,000. These changes will start on January 1st next year.</p>

            <h1>Washington D.C. Immigrant Community Worries About Deportation Orders Affecting Schoolchildren as New School Year Begins</h1>
            <p>The new school year for public schools in Washington D.C., USA, began today. Neighbors, volunteers, and parents were busy taking their children to school. They want to protect these students from the effects of President Trump's orders to deport immigrants without papers.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, there are worries that immigration officers might target schools. Because of this, groups have been formed all over Washington D.C. to walk students to school. They have also arranged carpools and neighborhood watches.</p>
            <p>The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said that they will not target schools in Washington D.C. today. However, they might still do safety checks in schools for children who do not have papers or are alone. The Trump government said it is important to save these children from human trafficking and forced labor.</p>
            <p>Last week, Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told NBC News, "You will not see ICE officers doing sudden arrests or large searches on the 25th. But our goal is to find the 300,000 children without papers and young people who came here during the last government's time."</p>
            <p>Selene, a Mexican-American community organizer, said she thought about not sending her daughter to school. This is because even Latino families who live in the U.S. legally have been arrested and targeted.</p>
            <p>Selene, who did not want to share her last name, said, "It's not about your legal papers. It's about how you look, right? When you walk on the street and look Latino, sadly, you become a target."</p>
            <p>According to information from the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, about 25,000 immigrants without papers lived in Washington D.C. in 2023.</p>
            <p>Public schools in Washington D.C. do not collect information about students' citizenship. However, The Washington Post reported in 2022 that some city council members estimated there were "3,000 to 4,000 students without papers" in public schools in Washington D.C.</p>
            <p>According to the National Education Association, in California, which has the most immigrants in the U.S., more students have been missing school. This has happened since ICE started more raids after Trump returned to the White House in January this year.</p>
            <p>Jeffrey Freitas, the head of the California Federation of Teachers, mentioned an important court decision from 1982. This decision said that states cannot stop children without papers from going to public schools.</p>
            <p>Lora Ries from the Heritage Foundation, a group that supports conservative ideas, said, "According to the Supreme Court's decision, children can go to public school no matter their immigration status, and they will not be in danger because of it." But she also added, "If someone is living in the country illegally, the law should be followed."</p>

            <h1>Former Rung Chen Paper Employee Accused of Leaking Secrets, Taipei Prosecutors Office Indicts Him Under Trade Secrets Act</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office accused a former quality control worker, surnamed Wang, from the listed company "Rung Chen Paper." He is accused of illegally copying company secrets, like paper-making formulas, using Chinese software before he left his job. Then, he went to work for a competing company, YFY Inc. He is now charged under the Trade Secrets Act.</p>
            <p>According to the document from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, Mr. Wang used to work at Rung Chen Paper. He was a quality control worker for industrial paper at their R&D chemical institute. His jobs included managing material mixing, calculating costs, and doing project research. He also signed an agreement with the company to keep information secret.</p>
            <p>The accusation states that from August to November 2024, Mr. Wang is believed to have installed Chinese software like "Baidu Wangpan" and "Baidu Cloud Manager" on his company laptop. He then illegally copied company secrets, such as quality control project details and paper material formulas. In late November of the same year, he moved to work for YFY Inc., a company that competes with Rung Chen Paper.</p>
            <p>After Rung Chen Paper found something strange, they called the police. When Mr. Wang was questioned, he said he did not do anything wrong. He said he only sent the information to other people inside Rung Chen Paper, not copied or reproduced company secrets. However, his statement was not believed.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor believes that Mr. Wang illegally copied trade secrets without permission or beyond his allowed duties, which is against the Trade Secrets Act. He is also accused of breach of trust under the criminal law. The prosecutor has asked the court to punish him more severely under the Trade Secrets Act. Today, he was officially charged according to the law.</p>
