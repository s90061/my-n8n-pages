People in the United States spent less money in February, which shows a slowdown in how much consumers are buying. This is happening while prices for many things are still getting higher, a problem known as inflation. The Federal Reserve, America's central bank, is watching these numbers closely. They want to see inflation go down to a comfortable level of 2%. If people spend less, it might help to lower prices over time. But for now, families are still feeling the pinch of higher costs for everyday items.

**Fewer People Claim Jobless Benefits in US, Showing Strong Job Market**

The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits has dropped to its lowest point in five weeks. This suggests that the job market in the United States is still very strong. When fewer people need jobless claims, it means more people are working, or can find work easily. This positive sign for the economy is good news for workers. However, the Federal Reserve, which sets interest rates, is still trying to manage inflation. A very strong job market can sometimes make it harder to bring prices down. Even so, the latest numbers show that finding a job in the US remains relatively easy.
