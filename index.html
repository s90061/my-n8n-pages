            <h1>22-Year-Old Suspect Arrested for Shooting American Conservative Online Star Kirk, Charges Expected Next Week</h1>
            <p>A well-known conservative American internet personality, Charlie Kirk, was recently shot in Utah. A 22-year-old man named Robinson has been caught and is now in jail. He will likely be officially charged next week with serious crimes like aggravated murder.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that on September 10, a sniper shot Kirk while he was giving a speech at Utah Valley University. After the shooting, local and national police quickly started a big search for the person who did it.</p>
            <p>Kirk is an important supporter of the US President, Donald Trump. He is also famous online and a leader for young conservatives. Millions of people follow him on social media. He is popular because his videos are clever, and he is good at handling people who cause trouble or disagree with him.</p>
            <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox announced at a press conference today, "We caught him."</p>
            <p>Kash Patel, the head of the FBI, told reporters that the suspect is Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old who lives in Utah. He was arrested last night, about 33 hours after the shooting. By this morning, the FBI had received more than 11,000 tips. This is the most tips they have received since the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013.</p>
            <p>Governor Cox said that a family member of Robinson and a friend of the family told the local police that Robinson had said or "suggested that he did the crime." This information helped the police to arrest him.</p>
            <p>Cox did not want to talk about why Robinson might have killed Kirk. However, he did say that police found a bullet shell at the scene with "Hey, fascist! Take that!" written on it.</p>
            <p>Court papers also show that the bullet that killed Kirk had a popular internet saying about online role-playing games written on it.</p>
            <p>More information about Robinson's life is becoming clear today. Cox mentioned that Robinson has lived with his family for many years in Washington County. This area is in the southwest part of Utah, close to the borders of Arizona and Nevada.</p>
            <p>NBC News looked for Robinson's name and birth date in government records. They did not find any criminal history for him. He is registered to vote but does not belong to any political party.</p>
            <p>At the time of the event, he was a third-year student in a program to become an electrician at Dixie Technical College. This college is part of Utah's public university system. Before this, he got a four-year scholarship to Utah State University but only went there for one semester.</p>
            <p>A neighbor named Steven Green said he knew Robinson's family because they attended the same Mormon church.</p>
            <p>Cox said that a family member, who police talked to, stated that Robinson had become more interested in politics in recent years. This relative also said that Robinson told another family member that he did not like Kirk and his ideas.</p>
            <p>Based on the sworn statement from the investigators, Robinson was arrested for serious crimes. These include aggravated murder, shooting someone to cause serious harm, and trying to stop justice. According to Cox, he is currently held in Utah County Jail and will likely be officially charged early next week.</p>

            <h1>After 480 Days as Culture Minister, Li Yuan Speaks as a Writer for the First Time in the Czech Republic</h1>
            <p>Li Yuan has been Taiwan's Minister of Culture for 480 days. For the first time, he spoke as a writer, and this special event took place in the Czech Republic. Someone at the event asked him how he would describe Taiwan if he were the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Li Yuan answered that both Taiwan and the Czech Republic have experienced a history of being ruled by dictators and having their language controlled. He said, "I hope to get understanding and support from the Czech Republic."</p>
            <p>On the evening of September 12, Li Yuan joined two other writers, Chen Sihong (a Taiwanese writer living in Germany) and Kateřina Tučková (a Czech writer), and Táňa Dluhošová (who leads a research institute in the Czech Academy of Sciences). They held a literary talk called "Scenery in Words: Where Taiwanese Stories Flow" at the Havel Library. They had to keep adding more seats because so many people came, going from 40 to over 100. Less than 20% of the audience were from Taiwan. This shows how interested and fond Czech readers and writers are of Taiwanese literature.</p>
            <p>The person leading the event was Petr Vizina, a well-known cultural figure in the Czech Republic. When he introduced Li Yuan, the Taiwanese people in the audience cheered loudly. Vizina was surprised and said that in the Czech Republic, people usually don't cheer for politicians because "no one likes politicians." Li Yuan then joked that during his time as Minister, he learned "not to say what's really true" and "to talk in a way that means nothing was said." Everyone laughed.</p>
            <p>During the discussion, Vizina asked Li Yuan how he would introduce Taiwan if he were the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Li Yuan gave a funny answer. He said he would first explain that Taiwan and the Czech Republic both went through times of dictatorship and when their language was suppressed. He felt that their histories and experiences were similar. He added, "I hope to gain the Czech Republic's sympathy."</p>
            <p>Li Yuan explained that he would use movies, books, and other arts to help the Czech Republic learn about Taiwan. He said that Taiwan has been influenced by major cultures such as Western, Japanese, and Chinese. Taiwan has taken these influences and become what it is today. He also said that Taiwan is already different from China. He joked, "If we look at it from a cultural point of view, China is actually a part of Taiwan. From the Ice Age, Taiwan and China have never been together. These are the things a Minister of Foreign Affairs would say." This showed his funny side.</p>
            <p>A reader also asked if the old treasures in the National Palace Museum truly belong to Taiwan. Li Yuan replied that culture does not stay the same forever. After 50 or 100 years, Chinese culture has developed in two different ways. One way is in China, where they still keep old imperial and strict ideas. The other way is on a free and democratic island, Taiwan, where people look at these treasures with their own special views. He concluded, "These two cultures are already completely different."</p>
            <p>Li Yuan said that China uses Chinese culture for its own purposes. In the past, they changed traditional Chinese writing to simpler forms, destroyed old buildings, and harmed Chinese culture. He stated, "Now they suddenly claim Chinese culture is theirs, which I have never understood."</p>
            <p>Today, Li Yuan will travel to the Moravian Library in Brno to sign an important agreement. He will also visit old underground water storage buildings in the Czech Republic. This is the last stop on Li Yuan's trip to Europe.</p>

            <h1>New Tree Planting Plan (Reforestation Incentive 2.0): Time Cut to 6 Years, NT$200,000 Reward for First Year per Hectare</h1>
            <p>The Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Agriculture, has changed its rules for encouraging people to plant trees. The new plan means that people will plant trees for 6 years instead of 20 years. For every hectare of land, people will get NT$200,000 in the first year. After that, they will get NT$60,000 each year. Over 6 years, the most money someone can get is NT$600,000.</p>
            <p>The Taitung office of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency has recently been holding many meetings with farmers who own forests. They are sharing information about new rules and plans for forestry. They also held meetings on September 11 and 12 to explain the "Reforestation Incentive 2.0" plan. Many people were very interested in this new plan.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taitung office announced that the most important changes in the new "Reforestation and Guidance Incentive Program" are: the planting time is shorter, the money paid as an incentive is higher, there are more choices for what to plant, and managing the forest is more flexible.</p>
            <p>The Taitung office explained that in the past, the reward for planting trees was given for 20 years. The new plan shortens this to 6 years. For each hectare, people will get NT$200,000 (New Taiwan Dollars) in the first year. From the second year to the sixth year, they will receive NT$60,000 every year. In the sixth year, there is also an extra NT$50,000 if the trees are growing well, and another NT$50,000 if the wood can be used for building. This means that over 6 years, people can get up to NT$600,000.</p>
            <p>The Taitung office said that for the year 2025, people can apply until December 31. For the year 2026 and all years after that, applications will be accepted from January 1 to April 30. The smallest area you can apply for is 0.1 hectares if the land is on a slope, and 0.3 hectares if it is flat land. The land must be one piece and not split into different areas.</p>
