            <h1>People Say Locusts Are Appearing in New Taipei; Agriculture Bureau Says It's a Normal Seasonal Event</h1>
            <p>People living in New Taipei have recently reported seeing many locusts. Today, the New Taipei City Agriculture Bureau said that experts believe locusts grow quickly in the hot weather of August. This makes them appear more often. It is a normal seasonal event in nature. If people are worried, they can use pesticides at home to control them.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture Bureau sent a message saying that after talking to a researcher from the Taoyuan District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, they learned that the number of locusts will slowly go down when the weather gets cooler or when it rains. People do not need to worry.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, some people posted photos on the social media site Threads. They said they often saw locusts in Zhonghe District and Yonghe District in New Taipei. Other people replied that they also had this "insect problem." They reported the same situation in Xinzhuang District, Tucheng District, Shulin District, Banqiao District, Sanchong District, Xindian District, and Taishan District.</p>
            <p>The Agriculture Bureau stated that the central government has not listed the "differentiation sugarcane locust" as a pest that harms crops. After checking with farmers' associations, no farmers have reported damage to their crops. Therefore, there is no need to report this to the Plant Protection and Quarantine Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

            <h1>Weak US Job Numbers Make Stocks Drop Sharply; Dow Jones Falls 600 Points</h1>
            <p>(New York, August 1st, CNA) Today, the United States released new job numbers that were weaker than expected. This made investors even more worried about the US economy. They were already worried about new taxes on goods from other countries. Because of this, the three main US stock indexes dropped by at least 1.5% in early trading today. The Dow Jones index lost more than 600 points.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the US Department of Labor announced today that only 73,000 new jobs were created in the US in July. Also, the number of new jobs for May and June was much lower than first thought. After this news, the interest rates on US government bonds quickly dropped. Futures markets now also expect the US central bank (the Fed) to lower interest rates in September.</p>
            <p>About 25 minutes after US stock markets opened today, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5% to 43477.54 points. The S&P 500 index dropped 1.7% to 6231.49 points. The Nasdaq index fell even more, by 2.3% to 20644.16 points.</p>
            <p>For individual company stocks, Amazon, a large US technology company, released its financial outlook. This made people worry that its big investments in artificial intelligence (AI) would harm its finances. So, its stock price quickly dropped by 7.0% in early trading today.</p>

            <h1>Slovenia is the First EU Country to Completely Stop Arms Trade with Israel</h1>
            <p>(Ljubljana, August 1st, CNA) The government of Slovenia has announced that it will completely stop trading weapons with Israel. This decision is because of the war in the Gaza Strip. Slovenia says it is the first country in the European Union (EU) to do this.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that the Slovenian government released a statement late last night. It said, "Slovenia is the first European country to stop importing, exporting, and moving weapons to Israel."</p>
            <p>The statement also said that Slovenia acted "alone." This is because the EU "could not take clear steps because of disagreements and lack of unity among its members."</p>
            <p>The Slovenian government's statement also mentioned that during the very damaging war in Gaza, "people are dying because they are regularly denied humanitarian aid." It added that "it is the duty of every responsible country to act, even if it means doing it before other countries."</p>
