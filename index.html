            <h1>Huwei University of Science and Technology and Quanta Hold "Living Painting Market" Exhibition in 12 Schools</h1>
            <p>Huwei University of Science and Technology and Quanta Culture and Education Foundation are working together on a project called "Art for Fun." This project shows an exhibition named "Living Painting Market: Enjoying a Thousand Years of Art." It will travel to 12 schools in Yunlin. It lets people see art from ancient Chinese markets all the way to modern daily life in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Huwei University of Science and Technology announced today that the "Art for Fun" project has been running for 18 years. It has held 177 exhibitions in Yunlin, and almost 230,000 people have visited them. This year, the first stop for the exhibition is Huwei University of Science and Technology, where it started today. Over the next year, it will visit 11 other local primary and middle schools. This helps to make art education stronger for children.</p>
            <p>Ms. Wu Wan-chuan, an assistant manager at Quanta Culture and Education Foundation, said this exhibition is different. It does not just talk about artists from art history. Instead, it focuses on ideas. The theme is "Living Painting Market." It connects art to children's daily lives through food, clothes, housing, transport, education, and entertainment. This helps them understand that everyday local industries can also be art. It also helps them learn more about local culture.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Ta-cheng, the vice president of Huwei University of Science and Technology, said that art is not just for special people. It should be closer to people's lives. The theme "market" for this exhibition is a good way to show the real environment of a city. It also shows people's culture and how society changes.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chen Ta-cheng added that the exhibition has four main areas. They are "Busy Market Opens," "Something New and Interesting Here," "Decorating for Festivals," and "Finding Treasures in the Market." There are 23 artworks in total. These include rubbings of Han Dynasty market bricks, the famous Song Dynasty painting "Along the River During the Qingming Festival" by Zhang Zeduan, and "Market Entrance" by Li Shih-chiao, an important modern Taiwanese painter.</p>
            <p>The exhibition is open from now until September 29th on the first floor of Building 3 at Huwei University of Science and Technology. After that, it will travel to Gukeng Junior High School and Elementary School, Jiaxing Elementary School, Gongcheng Elementary School, Yunlin Elementary School, Feng-an Elementary School, Douliu Elementary School, Guangxing Elementary School, Yuanzhang Elementary School, Xinsheng Elementary School, Zhongzheng Elementary School, and Lunbei Elementary School.</p>

            <h1>Over 100,000 People Visited Doctors for Flu-like Illnesses; CDC Says Flu Season May Start This Week</h1>
            <p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said today that last week, more than 100,000 people went to clinics or emergency rooms for flu-like illnesses. In total, 10.9% of all clinic and emergency room visits were for flu-like illnesses. The CDC thinks that the flu season will start this week. Also, the COVID-19 situation is still low.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tseng Shu-hui, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health and Welfare's CDC, said in her regular report today that from September 7th to 13th, there were 100,909 visits for flu-like illnesses. This is a 10.4% increase from the more than 90,000 visits the week before. The number of cases is growing. Because 10.9% of visits were for flu-like illnesses last week, the CDC expects this number to go over 11% this week, meaning the flu season will begin.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tseng Shu-hui explained that the flu season in 2022 to 2023 started in the 35th week. This year, it is expected to start in the 38th week. In past years, the flu season usually started after October, but in recent years, it has been starting earlier.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lee Chia-lin, the deputy director of the CDC's Outbreak Intelligence Center, said that the recent increase in cases might be because schools have just started, and children are in close contact. In the past, there were also increases before the new flu season in October. However, the peak of the flu usually happens from December to the Lunar New Year. We still need to watch if the increase in mid-to-late September will continue or go down.</p>
            <p>Regarding COVID-19, Ms. Tseng Shu-hui explained that the number of cases went down after reaching its highest point in late May and early June this year. Now, it is still low and changing slightly.</p>
            <p>This year, flu and COVID-19 vaccinations will begin in phases starting October 1st. Ms. Tseng Shu-hui pointed out that the plan for free COVID-19 vaccines has changed. Before, everyone could get vaccinated. Now, it focuses on people who are more at risk. There are three reasons for this change.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tseng Shu-hui explained that the first reason is that the COVID-19 illness has changed. In the beginning, the virus caused more serious illness and deaths. So, many people needed vaccines to get strong against it. But as the virus changed, the Wuhan virus caused about 2% to 3% deaths, Alpha virus about 2%, and Delta virus about 1%. Now, the Omicron virus causes about 0.2% deaths. This means the number of serious cases and deaths has gone down a lot.</p>
            <p>Ms. Tseng Shu-hui also said that the second reason is that in the past few years, many people have either been sick or had a vaccine. This means that people in general are much stronger against the virus than when it first started. Giving many vaccines to people who are not at high risk is not as helpful as it was before. Also, big groups like the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Union have all changed their plans from vaccinating everyone to vaccinating those at higher risk. So, after looking at how helpful the vaccine is and the risks, the plan was changed.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Chinese Orchestra Finishes Successful Tour in Czech Republic, Thousands Enjoy Taiwan's Culture</h1>
            <p>The National Center for Traditional Arts' Taiwan Chinese Orchestra traveled around the Czech Republic from September 9th to 15th. They played at the opening ceremony of a special exhibition at the National Palace Museum. They also performed two music shows called "Formosa Banquet" and held an opera workshop and cultural talks. They brought traditional Taiwanese art to the Czech Republic, showing the lively spirit and warmth of Taiwanese culture.</p>
            <p>The "Sound of Formosa: Taiwan Chinese Orchestra 2025 Czech Tour" attracted over a thousand people. On September 11th, the orchestra was invited to play at the opening of "One Hundred Treasures and Their Stories from the National Palace Museum." They played songs like "Beehive Fireworks Festival," "Longing for the Spring Breeze," "Moonlight on the Lake," "Taiwanese Folk Song Medley," and "Green Mountain." These gentle Chinese orchestra pieces showed Taiwan's traditional festivals and beautiful nature and people.</p>
            <p>For an encore, the Taiwan Chinese Orchestra played the second part of Czech composer AntonÃ­n DvoÅ™Ã¡k's "New World Symphony," called "Goin' Home." Taiwanese longing for home and Czech feelings came together in the music. Everyone clapped loudly for a long time. This added a special cultural moment to the opening ceremony.</p>
            <p>On September 12th and 13th, the Taiwan Chinese Orchestra performed "Formosa Banquet." This show was about a "daughter's wedding banquet." It showed the whole process, from the wedding ceremony and cooking to sending the daughter off and a happy ending. The orchestra members also acted as "helpers" in the play. Especially in the "cooking" part, they brought kitchen tools like knives, cutting boards, woks, rice spoons, and orange water buckets onto the stage. They used these to make many different sounds, turning the stage into a busy kitchen.</p>
            <p>The lively scene and warm family feelings, full of a taste of home, made many Taiwanese people living abroad miss their hometowns deeply. They also felt the sadness of a father marrying off his daughter. Many audience members had tears in their eyes and said, "It was just like being at a banquet back home." Fathers with daughters also said, "It felt like I was really there, feeling the sadness of my daughter getting married." For local people seeing it for the first time, the music and play helped them feel the lively spirit and warmth of Taiwanese culture.</p>
            <p>Besides the stage shows, the Taiwan Chinese Orchestra also held an "Opera Workshop" and a talk called "Taiwanese Banquet Culture and Chinese Orchestra Music." They used art to help people understand each other. This helped Czech audience members learn more about Chinese orchestra music and Taiwanese folk culture.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Chinese Orchestra's tour in the Czech Republic showed the strong performances of Chinese orchestra music and Taiwanese opera. It also brought together the Ministry of Culture's "Fashion Plan," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the National Palace Museum. They successfully shared the stories of Taiwan in the heart of Europe. This made the "Voice of Taiwan" heard clearly in Prague, making the connection between Taiwan and the world stronger.</p>
