US President Donald Trump announced that the US will impose strict tariffs on Russia if a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. EU Foreign Minister Kaja Kallas welcomed Trump's strong stance but noted that 50 days is "a very long time," especially given the daily loss of innocent civilian lives in Ukraine. Trump made this statement after meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, also stating that billions of dollars in weapons, including Patriot air defense systems, would be sent to Ukraine, with NATO allies covering the costs. He expressed disappointment with Russian President Putin for not fulfilling a previous agreement. Trump clarified that he meant "secondary sanctions" rather than "secondary tariffs" when discussing the 100% tariff threat.

**Trump Considers Sanctions on Russian Energy Buyers; China and India Most Affected**

US President Donald Trump stated that if Russia does not agree to a ceasefire within 50 days, the US will impose "secondary tariffs." This term likely refers to "secondary sanctions" aimed at countries that buy Russian energy. If these sanctions are put in place, China and India, Russia's two largest energy buyers, would be hit the hardest. Trump expressed frustration with Russian President Putin, saying that talks with Russia are pointless. Experts explain that secondary sanctions target countries trading with sanctioned nations, meaning any country, company, or person involved could face US penalties. This has already caused many banks and financial institutions to stop trading with Russia or Iran to avoid losing access to the US market. In 2024, Russian oil made up 35% of India's total oil imports and 19% of China's.

**Gold Group Buy Leader Detained in Taichung Murder Case**

In the Taichung Fengyuan case where five family members were found dead, the court has ordered the detention and ban on visits for Ms. Li, the leader of a gold group buying scheme. Ms. Li was previously released on bail of NT$150,000. However, prosecutors gathered new evidence, leading to her re-arrest. The investigation suggests that the deceased family joined Ms. Li's gold group after being introduced by a beautician. They were told they could earn commissions by using credit cards to buy gold. After a year, the family's debt grew more than their earnings. Ms. Li then demanded NT$5 million in compensation, claiming the family broke a contract. She also took them to a pawn shop in Changhua to borrow NT$2 million by mortgaging their house, and the family later pawned their cars and motorcycles. The court decided to detain Ms. Li due to strong suspicion of fraud, using fake documents, and extortion, and the necessity of detention.
