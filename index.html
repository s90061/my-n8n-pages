The Taipei District Prosecutor's Office is looking into a case where a prosecutor was threatened. Two people, Dai Ruining and Lin Huizhu, are involved. They are accused of threatening the prosecutor and using their personal information illegally. The court in Taipei decided early today that these two people should be kept in custody and not allowed to see anyone. This is because the court believes they might hide evidence or talk to others involved in the crime.

The Jinghua City case is important to many people. Some individuals posted the name and photo of the prosecutor handling the case on social media. They also added frightening pictures, like blood splashes, and messages saying things like "life for a life" and "remember their names and faces." This caused a lot of discussion.

Police and security agencies investigated and found that Dai Ruining, a 39-year-old IT engineer, was the person who posted the original threats online. They also found that Lin Huizhu and her boyfriend made changes to these pictures and shared them on social media. Lin Huizhu was also detained for possibly encouraging others to commit crimes, while her boyfriend was released.

**Big Surprises at Wimbledon Women's Singles; 6th Seed Keys Is Out**

Madison Keys, a top American tennis player who won the Australian Open this year, lost her match at Wimbledon today. She was the 6th seed in the women's singles tournament but was unexpectedly defeated by Laura Siegemund from Germany in the third round. Keys is ranked 8th in the world, while Siegemund is ranked 104th. This makes Keys the latest big name to lose early at Wimbledon.

According to news reports, Siegemund won easily, with scores of 6-3, 6-3. This year's Wimbledon women's singles has seen many top players lose earlier than expected.

Other highly-ranked players who have already left the tournament include Coco Gauff (2nd seed), Jessica Pegula (3rd seed), Jasmine Paolini from Italy (4th seed), and Zheng Qinwen (5th seed). The top seed, Aryna Sabalenka from Belarus, is still playing in the tournament.
