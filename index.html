            <h1>US Stocks Close Lower as Market Watches Trade Talks</h1>
            <p>Investors were closely watching ongoing trade talks today. This happened before US President Trump announced new tariff rates that will start on August 7. Because of this, the stock market was careful, and Wall Street stocks ended the day lower.</p>
            <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 61.90 points, or 0.14%, closing at 44111.74 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index fell slightly by 30.75 points, or 0.49%, ending at 6299.19 points.</p>

            <h1>Global Oil Prices Fall as Concerns About Oil Supply Lessen</h1>
            <p>International oil prices were lower today. This happened because worries about oil supply became smaller. Earlier, foreign news reported that Russia might make a deal with the United States. This deal could include stopping air attacks with Ukraine. This would help Russia avoid new punishments on its oil exports.</p>
            <p>The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery dropped by 1.13 US dollars, or 1.70%, closing at 65.16 US dollars per barrel.</p>
            <p>The price of Brent crude oil for October delivery in London fell by 1.12 US dollars, or 1.63%, closing at 67.64 US dollars per barrel.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Wants to Run for President Again, Claims Americans Like His Tariff Policy</h1>
            <p>Today, when asked if he would run for president again, US President Trump first said "maybe not." But then he changed his mind and said he hoped to run again. He also said that American people are happy with his government's tariff policies and the trade deals Washington made with other countries.</p>
            <p>Trump, who returned to the White House earlier this year, spoke on the CNBC program Squawk Box by phone today. He mentioned that in last year's US election, he got the most votes ever in Texas. He said, "This is a record, and they say it won't be broken unless I run again."</p>
            <p>When the host asked if he would run for president again, Trump first said, "Maybe not." But then he changed his mind and said, "I hope to run." He also said that American people like his government's tariff policies. They also like the trade deals the US made with other countries, which stopped other countries from taking advantage of the US.</p>
            <p>He said again that for many years, many countries took advantage of the US. He added, "Whether they are friends or enemies, friends are worse."</p>
            <p>Before this, Trump told NBC News in March that he was "not joking" about trying for a third term as president.</p>
            <p>Trump was first president of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He returned to the White House earlier this year. The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution says that a person cannot be president more than two times. To change the Constitution, two-thirds of both houses of Congress and three-fourths of the states must agree. Most people think it is not likely to happen.</p>
            <p>Also, last week, Trump finished setting his equal tariff policy, which he had delayed. This policy aims to make global trade fairer, as he believes it is not fair to the US. The new tariffs for nearly 70 countries range from 10% to 41%. For Taiwan, the tariff rate is 20%. The new rates are expected to start officially on August 7.</p>
            <p>A list of facts from the White House showed countries and areas that have made agreements with the US. These include the European Union, Japan, the United Kingdom, South Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. The New York Times reported that these countries promised to buy a lot of American energy and planes, invest more in the US, and allow more American farm and factory products into their markets to please Trump.</p>
