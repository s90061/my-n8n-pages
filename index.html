Many households are finding it harder to pay their bills because of rising interest rates. When interest rates go up, it means borrowing money becomes more expensive. This especially affects people with mortgages, which are loans to buy homes. Their monthly payments for housing are now higher.

This adds to the already difficult situation caused by high prices for food and energy. Families are seeing their budgets stretched thin, meaning they have less money for other things. Experts say that these rising costs are making life very challenging for many people, who are struggling to manage their daily expenses.

**Artificial Intelligence is Changing the Way We Work**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a big effect on the world of work. Experts say that while AI might cause some jobs to disappear, it will also create many new types of jobs. This means the job market will look different in the future.

Businesses are quickly starting to use AI tools, which can help them do tasks more efficiently. For workers, this means it will be important to learn new skills to work alongside AI. Many believe that AI can improve productivity, allowing companies to achieve more with their resources. The goal is often for AI to assist human workers, not completely replace them, though some roles may change significantly.

**Global Travel Expected to Fully Recover This Year**

The global travel industry is showing strong signs of recovery and is expected to return to its pre-pandemic levels by the end of 2024. A report from the United Nations tourism body states that 2023 saw a very good recovery, with many people travelling internationally again.

This positive trend is due to several reasons, including a strong desire for people to travel after the pandemic, and an increase in the number of flights available. The reopening of China for international travel has also played a big part in boosting numbers around the world. Experts are hopeful that the travel sector will continue to grow and become stronger in the coming months.
