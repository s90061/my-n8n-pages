            <h1>Czech Republic Plans World Literary Museum Directors' Conference, Invites Taiwan</h1>
            <p>In 2026, the Czech National Museum of Literature will hold the "World Literary Museum Directors' Conference." This meeting will discuss the role of literary museums in the 21st century. When the director, Michal StehlÃ­k, met with Taiwan's Minister of Culture, Li Yuan, he invited Taiwan to join. He believes that Taiwan's ideas, along with European experiences, can bring new perspectives.</p>
            <p>On September 12, Michal StehlÃ­k, the director of the Czech National Museum of Literature, said that the "World Literary Museum Directors' Conference" will talk about how to present literature and how to use new technology to make things digital and work together. He said, "These are challenges that every director of a literary museum must face." StehlÃ­k hopes Taiwan will take part. He believes that Taiwan's views from Asia can offer new ideas.</p>
            <p>According to news from the Ministry of Culture, the Czech National Museum of Literature is part of the Czech Ministry of Culture. It is a national literary organization. Its status, type, and purpose are very similar to the National Museum of Taiwan Literature.</p>
            <p>The Czech National Museum of Literature started in 1952. Since then, its job has been to collect, organize, record, and show the development of Czech literature and book culture. Its collection includes the lives, works, and legacies of important writers and famous people from the 18th century until now. It is seen as the most important place in the Czech Republic for saving and studying literature.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan said that in 2024, the "Czech Writers' Month" event chose Taiwan as its main country for the first time. This was the first time in 25 years that an Asian country was chosen. During his visit to Europe, he specifically went to the Czech National Museum of Literature to learn from them.</p>
            <p>Li Yuan added that the National Museum of Taiwan Literature, which started in 2003, is quite new compared to the Czech National Museum of Literature. He said, "From the point of view of running a literary museum, Taiwan has many things it can learn from the Czech Republic."</p>
            <p>StehlÃ­k said that to keep up with the age of technology, the Czech National Museum of Literature has collected many artworks and videos related to writers since its beginning. In their exhibitions, they include art and interactive videos, and they use AI technology to show literature in many different ways.</p>
            <p>StehlÃ­k said that the total length of the Czech National Museum of Literature's collection is more than 7 kilometers. If they wanted to make everything digital, they might need three times more staff and it would take 70 years to finish. However, with AI technology, reading and processing text has become faster. But he also warned, as a historian, that in the future, it will be harder to tell if a literary work was written by a human or by AI. He said that history might have a problem where it is unclear whether something was "written by a person or by AI."</p>
            <p>Li Yuan shared his own experience, saying that in 2003, he started creating works using his mobile phone. He said, "In the past, literary museums mainly collected and showed handwritten papers or letters between writers. But now, people create works using phones and computers. So, how to collect and show these new forms of writing is a new challenge for literary museums in the next stage."</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Symphony Orchestra Apologizes for Adult Ads on Facebook Page</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taipei City Symphony Orchestra (TSO) said sorry. This is because people said that a short link in a post on their official Facebook page led to an advertisement for adult products. The TSO apologized for letting people see these improper advertisements.</p>
            <p>Chen Chung-wen, a Taipei City Councilor from the Kuomintang party, asked a question in writing. He said he received complaints that when people looked at the TSO's Facebook page and clicked on a short link in a post, an adult product advertisement appeared. He stated that the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs should tell the TSO to fix this problem and check if other posts have similar issues.</p>
            <p>The TSO explained that they use short links on their official Facebook page to help them see how well their posts are doing. They thought that the original long links, which had tracking codes, might make the Facebook page harder to read. To make the posts look better and organized, they used a free short link service.</p>
            <p>The TSO stated that these free short link services from other companies add advertisements when they direct users to a webpage. This means the TSO could not control what advertisements appeared. To stop this from happening again, they will now only use official links that they can control.</p>
