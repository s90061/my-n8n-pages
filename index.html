            <h1>Two Men Lost on Mt. Baxian in Taichung, Located and Rescued with Help from Other Hikers</h1>
            <p>Two men from Taichung went hiking together on Mt. Baxian on September 26. They reached the top but then could not be found. The fire department received help from another hiker to find their location. They rescued the two men yesterday, and they arrived at the mountain entrance early this morning. One of the men was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Fire Department said they got a report on September 26. A 58-year-old man named Zhu and a 71-year-old man named Zhang were hiking Mt. Baxian. They went missing after reaching the top at 3 PM. After receiving the report, the Guguan and Heping fire teams were sent.

            <h1>US Government Faces Another Shutdown Risk; Trump to Meet with Congress Leaders on the 29th</h1>
            <p>The US federal government's money will run out on September 30. White House officials said today that President Trump will meet with important leaders from both political parties in Congress on September 29. They will talk about how to fund the government. This is to stop the government from having to close down.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump had previously posted on his social media. He said he would not talk with Democratic leaders, Chuck Schumer from the Senate and Hakeem Jeffries from the House. They were supposed to discuss the government money problem before the September 30 deadline.</p>
            <p>Jeffries and Schumer sent out a joint statement tonight. They confirmed they would meet with Trump on September 29. They also said, "We really want to stop the government from closing down."</p>
            <p>The main disagreement is about "discretionary spending." This is about a quarter of the US$7 trillion federal budget. If Congress cannot agree by September 30, it will be the 15th time the US government has closed down since 1981.</p>
            <p>The House of Representatives had already passed a temporary bill to keep the federal government working until November 21. But Democratic senators did not want to move forward with it. They asked the Republican party to work together on a plan that both parties could agree on. This plan might include giving more time for help from the "Affordable Care Act," which is ending soon.</p>
            <p>The US political news website "Punchbowl News" was the first to report today that Trump would meet with Congress leaders on September 29.</p>

            <h1>Russian Foreign Minister Criticizes Israel, Saying It Wants to Start a Big Conflict in the Middle East</h1>
            <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said today that Israel wants to "start a big conflict" in the whole Middle East. He criticized Israel for its recent military actions against Iran and Qatar. He also disagreed with the idea from Israel's right-wing politicians who want to take over the West Bank.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that Lavrov spoke at the United Nations General Assembly. He said, "Israel's illegal use of military force against Palestinians, and now its aggressive actions against Iran, Qatar, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, are putting the entire Middle East region in danger."</p>
            <p>Lavrov strongly spoke against the far-right allies of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. These allies want to take control of the West Bank. This would stop any chance for a Palestinian state to be created.</p>
            <p>He said, "There is no good reason to take over the West Bank. What we are really seeing is a hidden plan. They want to completely ignore the United Nations' decisions about creating a Palestinian state."</p>
            <p>In the last week, several Western countries, like France and the United Kingdom, have officially recognized a Palestinian state. They are showing their unhappiness with Israel's ongoing war in Gaza.</p>
            <p>The United States is an ally of Israel and strongly opposes recognizing a Palestinian state. However, after some Arab allies showed their concern, US President Trump also suggested to Netanyahu not to take over the West Bank.</p>
            <p>Lavrov spoke with sarcasm about the timing of Western countries recognizing a Palestinian state. He asked, "Why are they only making this decision now?"</p>
            <p>He suggested that maybe these countries thought they would announce their decision when the UN General Assembly meets. He said, "By then, because of Israel's attacks, there would be nothing left of Gaza, and no Palestinians."</p>
            <p>Russia has recognized the state of Palestine since the time of the Soviet Union. Even so, Israel tries to keep good relations with Moscow. This is because Russia has power in the Middle East, and there is a large Jewish community living in Russia.</p>
