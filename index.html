            <h1>Brazil's Da'an Church Celebrates 55 Years</h1>
            <p>The Da'an Presbyterian Church in Brazil celebrated its 55th anniversary today in SÃ£o Paulo. They had a special service, showed old photos, and played a documentary. These activities looked back at how Taiwanese immigrants have kept their faith and culture alive in Brazil. It also showed how the church helps its local community and cares about the world.</p>
            <p>This year is 70 years since Taiwanese people started moving to Brazil. The Da'an Church started in the early 1970s. Pastor Wu Tian-bao helped build it. It became a very important place for Taiwanese immigrants to practice their faith and be part of a community in Brazil. Pastor Wu, with his strong belief and purpose, helped immigrants with language and cultural problems. He helped them find a spiritual home in a new country.</p>
            <p>Zhu Yi-jing, who is the head of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office in SÃ£o Paulo, gave a speech. She said the Da'an Church is not just a place of faith but also a link between religion and culture. Yu Zheng-cai, the director of the SÃ£o Paulo Cultural Center, said that immigrants don't just move to find a living; they also create warm communities.</p>
            <p>During the event, Zhu Yi-jing gave a gift to the current pastor, Chen Jin-hong, to show thanks and good wishes. Lin Zi-ying, a flute player, traveled from Taiwan to play music. The choir sang many beautiful songs. The event ended with "Hallelujah" from "Messiah," which touched everyone.</p>
            <p>Pastor Liu Xiao-ting spoke in his sermon. He said, "Faith is not just an idea; it's a living part of history." He hopes that this journey of faith in Brazil will continue for many generations. He wants it to keep the spirit of Taiwanese immigrants alive.</p>
            <p>At the end of the event, the church gave flowers to past pastors to show respect. They also cut a cake with the guests to celebrate. After that, they showed "The 55th Anniversary Documentary of the Da'an Presbyterian Church in Brazil." This film showed Pastor Wu Tian-bao's work and old pictures of early church meetings. It showed how he built a faith home for Taiwanese people with faith and love, even when things were difficult.</p>
            <p>It's important to mention that the Da'an Church has helped with international missionary work and social care for a long time. It actively supports many missionary projects. One project, "Ximo Missionary Project," helps poor communities in Mozambique buy land and build schools. This gives children there a chance to get an education. This shows how Taiwanese churches truly help and care about people around the world.</p>

            <h1>Air Canada Stops Plans to Bring Back Flights After Flight Attendants Refuse to End Strike</h1>
            <p>Air Canada has stopped its plan to bring flights back. This happened today after the union for Air Canada's 10,000 flight attendants said they would not go back to work. This strike has stopped almost all of the company's flights. It has also messed up summer travel plans for Air Canada passengers all over the world.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, the government stepped in. The Canada Industrial Relations Board then decided that the around 10,000 flight attendants on strike must go back to work by 2 PM local time today. Air Canada then said it would start flights again tonight.</p>
            <p>Air Canada put out a statement. They said the union for the striking flight attendants decided to continue the strike, even though the government told them not to. Because of this, "Air Canada... has stopped its plan to slowly bring back some flights for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge... The airline will start flights again tomorrow night."</p>
            <p>Air Canada said that the Canada Industrial Relations Board had earlier "told Air Canada to start flying again. It also told all Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge flight attendants to continue doing their jobs by 2 PM on August 17, 2025."</p>
            <p>Air Canada cabin crew started their strike on the morning of August 16. This happened after they said no to a new contract offer from the company.</p>
            <p>Air Canada flies to 180 cities around the world. The company thinks about 130,000 passengers are affected every day.</p>

            <h1>Spain's Government Sends 500 More Soldiers to Fight 20 Large Wildfires</h1>
            <p>Today, there are 20 big wildfires burning across Spain. The very hot weather is making it hard to fight the fires. The government has quickly sent 500 more soldiers to help put out the fires.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that in Galicia, which is in the northwest of Spain, several small wildfires have joined together to become bigger and stronger fires. This has made them close roads leading to the area and stop train services.</p>
            <p>Southern Europe is having one of the worst wildfire seasons in 20 years. Spain is one of the countries most affected. In just the last week, three people have died in fires, and over 115,000 hectares of land have burned. The country next to Spain, Portugal, is also fighting many fires.</p>
            <p>The Spanish national weather agency (AEMET) said that temperatures in some areas are expected to reach 45 degrees Celsius today.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez spoke at a press conference in Ourense, an area badly hit by fires. He said, "There will be many more difficult days, and sadly the weather is not helping us."</p>
            <p>He announced that more soldiers would be sent to help. Now, a total of 1,900 soldiers are helping with disaster relief across Spain.</p>
