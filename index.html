A chairman of a land redevelopment group in Taichung, Mr. Wang, has been sentenced to two years in prison. He paid people to hurt two city government officials because he was unhappy about land development work.

In July 2023, Mr. Wang paid NT$150,000 to a man named Zhang. He asked Zhang to find others to hit a section chief from the land department with sticks and record it. The section chief was injured.

In August 2023, Mr. Wang paid Zhang another NT$150,000. This time, Zhang and his friends waited outside another official's home, pretending to have a car accident. Then, they hit the director with their hands. The director had cuts on his head and hands.

The court found Mr. Wang guilty of assault. Mr. Zhang was also sentenced to 1 year and 4 months in prison. Both can appeal the decision.

**Group Wants Public Workers to Have Same Safety Rules as Other Workers**

After a 57-year-old manager in Miaoli County died, a group that supports civil servants is asking for changes. They say that public workers should have the same safety and health protection as other workers.

The group held an event to remember the manager. They believe the death shows problems in the workplace for civil servants. They want the government to include public workers in the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

The head of the group, Mr. Hung Ruei-hao, said that stress and other issues at work can be very difficult for civil servants. Another activist, Mr. Chen Qi-zhong, said that often, the skills of public workers are not respected. They hope the system will change to protect civil servants better.
