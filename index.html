Businesses around the world are putting much more money into Artificial Intelligence (AI). They hope AI will help them work better and create new things. A new study by McKinsey & Company shows that over half of the companies they asked now use AI in some part of their work. This is a big increase from just five years ago.

AI is being used a lot in customer service, checking large amounts of information, and making daily tasks automatic. Some people worry that AI might take jobs away. However, the study also says that AI is creating new kinds of jobs. For example, there is a need for people who can teach AI systems or ensure AI is used fairly. Companies are now training their employees to learn new skills for this change. It seems that working together with AI will be important for future business success.

**Extreme Heat Affects Many Parts of the World**

This summer, very hot weather has hit many areas in the northern half of the world. Temperatures have reached new high levels, affecting daily life and important services. Countries in Southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia have had temperatures hotter than 40Â°C (104Â°F) for a long time. This has led to many health warnings and put a lot of pressure on electricity systems.

The extreme heat has also caused large forest fires, especially in wooded areas. These fires have forced people to leave their homes and caused much harm to the environment. Scientists say that these hot weather events are happening more often and are stronger because of climate change. They are asking governments and people to work faster to lower gases that warm the planet and to get ready for a hotter world. People living in affected areas are told to drink a lot of water, stay in the shade, and check on older or weaker neighbors.

**New Trends in Travel and Work Life**

As international travel comes back, people are looking for different things from their trips. They are more interested in travel that is good for the environment and offers real local experiences. After the pandemic, travelers often choose places that let them experience the local culture and have eco-friendly choices, rather than big tourist spots. We can see this trend in the growth of farm tourism, trips that help local communities, and ethical animal encounters.

Airlines and hotels are changing to meet these needs. They are starting greener programs and working more with local businesses. At the same time, the way we work, mixing office and home work, is also changing how we travel. Many people are adding vacation time to their work trips. This is called 'bleisure' travel. They stay longer to see more of the place. This freedom also helps more people become 'digital nomads,' who work from different places around the world. This makes the difference between work and holidays less clear.`;
