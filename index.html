            <h1>Taipower: Our Workers Work Hard After Typhoons, Not Just Posing for Photos</h1>
            <p>Taipower, the main electricity company in Taiwan, has responded to claims from the Taiwan Power Industry Union. The union said that Taipower workers were forced to pose for photos while fixing power lines after a typhoon. Taipower strongly said that their workers work very hard during typhoon repairs. They said it is wrong to say these efforts are just for show. The photos shared are real records of the repair work, not staged. Taipower also added that the Taiwan Power Labor Union has nearly 29,000 members, which is over 99% of their staff. This union truly represents most workers. The Power Industry Union, however, has only about a hundred members.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Dianmu caused serious damage in southern Taiwan. The Taiwan Power Industry Union stated today that regular workers had to work extra hours to fix things after the typhoon. They were also told to pose for photos while eating. The union said that high-level government officials used these photos to promote the idea of giving Taipower a lot of money.</p>
            <p>Taipower issued a press release tonight. It said that all repair photos released to the public are real pictures taken by workers at the repair sites. There were no orders or requests for workers to pose. Only sometimes, when news reporters came to film, they asked workers to cooperate a little for their reports.</p>
            <p>Taipower said they understand and respect that their employees care about their working conditions. This typhoon caused damage to power facilities in the Chiayi-Tainan area like never before. Nearly 3,500 power poles fell or broke. More than 10,000 workers have been involved in the repairs, and they are still working.</p>
            <p>Taipower expressed great respect and thanks for the hard work of every employee. They also said they will keep improving the benefits for repair workers, such as giving them bonuses, time off, and special pay for dangerous work. They hope the public will continue to support the frontline repair workers.</p>

            <h1>Israel Bombs Syrian Military Headquarters, Warns Against Attacking Druze People</h1>
            <p>Israel bombed the Syrian military headquarters in Damascus today. This happened after Israel warned the Syrian government, which is led by Islamic groups. Israel told them not to bother the Druze minority group in Sweida province, where many Druze people live.</p>
            <p>An organization that watches events said that fights between different groups in Sweida province, southern Syria, have killed almost 250 people.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, more than 100 people died in fights between the Druze people and local Bedouin tribes. The Syrian government army went into Sweida city yesterday. This city has many Druze people. The army said they went there to watch over a ceasefire agreement made with Druze leaders.</p>
            <p>However, witnesses said that the government army and Bedouin people worked together to attack Druze fighters and regular people. They killed many in the city.</p>
            <p>This conflict is the worst violence since battles between government forces and Druze fighters happened in April and May. Those fights took place in Sweida province and near Damascus and killed over 100 people.</p>
            <p>Since December of last year, when they removed the former long-time president Bashar al-Assad, the Islamic-led government in Syria has had problems with religious and ethnic minority groups.</p>
            <p>Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, asked the government in Damascus "not to interfere with the Druze people in Sweida province."</p>
            <p>He demanded that the Syrian army leave. He promised that the Israeli army would not stop its attacks until they leave. Katz stressed that "if this message is not understood," Israel will "increase the level of its response against this (Syrian) government."</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Israeli military said they had attacked the Syrian military headquarters.</p>
