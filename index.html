            <h1>Taitung Rain Lessens, Roads in Nanè¿´ and Nanheng Areas Reopen</h1>
            <p>Taitung County, July 21 (CNA) â€“ The rain in Taitung has become lighter. Road workers are fixing the roads quickly. Because of this, the Shangwu and Nanxing parts of the Nanè¿´ Highway, and the Xiama part of the Southern Cross-Island Highway, are now open again for traffic.</p>
            <p>The highway authority stated that today, in Dawu Township, at section 420k+950 of Tai 9 Line (Shangwu Chaoyong Bridge), the river water rose too high in the morning. After 10:30 AM, the water went down a bit. Workers cleaned the bridge deck and removed dirt. Now, people can drive on it normally. Also, at section 425K+100 of Tai 9 Line (Nanxing part) in Dawu Township, the mudslide has been cleared. The road has been open again since 11:00 AM.</p>
            <p>Lin Jin-fang, who is in charge of the Guanshan Highway Section, told CNA at noon that there was a landslide today morning at the Xiama part of the Southern Cross-Island Highway (Tai 20 Line, 168 kilometers). Because the rain in the mountains became lighter, the road is now open again. (Edited by Chen Jen-hua) 1140721</p>

            <h1>Almost 20% of Teenagers Struggle to Refuse Smoking; Smoking Does Not Bring Ideas, Only Lasting Brain Damage</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 21 (CNA) â€“ Sometimes in movies, smoking looks cool and seems to give people great ideas or make them look like heroes. But the Health Promotion Administration (HPA) warns that these are tricks from tobacco companies. A survey shows that almost 20% of teenagers find it hard to say no to smoking, which can cause permanent damage to their brains.</p>
            <p>According to a survey on youth smoking habits from 2023, done by the Ministry of Health and Welfare's Health Promotion Administration, 82.1% of junior and senior high students said they would never smoke. However, almost 20% of students could not firmly refuse smoking. Most studies show that when smoking is shown in popular media, or when teenagers see their friends smoking, it makes them more interested in trying tobacco products.</p>
            <p>Summer holidays are a time when students are free from school work. But this time also brings a risk that teenagers might try tobacco products, including new ones like e-cigarettes. The HPA said in a press release today that 90% of people who smoke regularly started before they were 18. Tobacco products and e-cigarettes have nicotine, which is very addictive. Do not think it is a small thing or that you can control it easily. Many people try it just once and then become addicted.</p>
            <p>The HPA shared research showing that teenagers are more sensitive to nicotine. They also become addicted to it faster than adults. The teenage years are a very important time for the body and mind to grow. Smoking causes even more harm to teenagers, especially lasting damage to their brains. This can make it harder for them to learn and remember things. It can also make them feel angry, easily upset, worried, or sad.</p>
            <p>The HPA offers four ways to say no to smoking, and people can practice them. Not smoking is the right and normal thing to do, so you don't need to feel bad about it. The first way is to be the main planner for social gatherings and choose places where smoking is not allowed. The second way is to have friends who also do not smoke. Agree with your friends beforehand not to smoke, and support each other. If someone offers you a cigarette, your friends can help you say no.</p>
            <p>The third way is to have reasons ready to refuse. For example, you can say, "My throat is sensitive, so smoking makes it hurt," or "My family is sensitive to the smell of smoke, and I worry they will get asthma if I smell like smoke." The fourth way is to "simply and firmly refuse." The HPA says you can explain why smoking is harmful and clearly state that you do not smoke. True friends will respect your choice.</p>
            <p>The HPA also explains that if you know a friend who is struggling with smoking, you can suggest they quit. The government has many ways to help people quit smoking. People can call the free quit-smoking helpline at "0800-636363." Expert counselors can offer support and help create a personal plan to quit. Or, people can go to about 2,700 hospitals, clinics, health centers, and pharmacies across Taiwan for help. (Edited by Chen Jen-hua) 1140721</p>

            <h1>EU's 18th Round of Sanctions Against Russia Includes Chinese Companies; Beijing Is Very Unhappy</h1>
            <p>Shanghai, July 21 (CNA) â€“ The European Union (EU) recently approved its 18th set of sanctions against Russia. These sanctions aim to put more pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The new sanctions affect some Chinese banks and companies. Today, China's Ministry of Commerce said it is very unhappy and strongly against these sanctions.</p>
            <p>On July 21, China's Ministry of Commerce responded to the EU's 18th set of sanctions against Russia, which includes Chinese banks and companies.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce said that the EU ignored China's many discussions and disagreements. It continued to put some Chinese companies on the list for sanctions and sanctioned two Chinese banks with "made-up" reasons. China is very unhappy about this and strongly against it.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce pointed out that China has always been against sanctions that are not based on international law or approved by the United Nations Security Council. The EU's actions go against what EU and China leaders had agreed upon. These actions also cause serious negative effects on trade and financial cooperation between China and the EU.</p>
            <p>The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stressed, "China asks the EU to immediately stop putting Chinese companies and banks on this wrong list. China will take necessary steps to strongly protect the fair and legal rights of Chinese companies and banks."</p>
            <p>The EU recently approved its 18th set of sanctions against Russia. Kaja Kallas, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said then that the EU had just approved one of its toughest sets of sanctions against Russia so far. She added that the EU will keep adding pressure until ending the war is the only choice for Moscow.</p>
            <p>According to news from DPA, this set of sanctions includes, for the first time, a ban on doing business with two Chinese financial institutions. The reason is that these institutions helped Russia avoid earlier sanctions. The EU also sanctioned other Chinese companies that are supporting Russia in the war in Ukraine.
