New Taipei City's 9th Legislative District is a place that usually votes for the KMT party. Now, a group is trying to remove Legislator Lin Te-fu from his position. This group is working with the DPP party, using both online and in-person methods to try and change the voting results. Mr. Lin, on the other hand, is visiting many people in the area to get them to vote against the recall.

In the last election, Mr. Lin Te-fu from the KMT party got 98,260 votes (57.73%). Mr. Chuang Ming-yuan from the DPP party got 50,613 votes (29.73%).

For a recall to pass, more people must vote "yes" to remove the person than "no." Also, the "yes" votes must be at least one-fourth of all eligible voters. In the 9th district, there are 238,299 voters. This means at least 59,575 "yes" votes are needed.

The group leading the recall says Mr. Lin pushed for laws that favor China, used too much power, cut budgets, and did not do a good job as a legislator. They want people to vote to remove him to protect democracy and local development. Mr. Lin said he has worked hard and helped pass laws for long-term care and youth. He asks people to vote "no" so he can continue to help the area and check the government's power.

The DPP party in New Taipei City is helping the recall group. They are holding events to get more people to support the recall. City Councilor Hsu Chao-hsing said that the Yonghe area is a traditional KMT voting area, so the recall group needs to work very hard. She also said that two KMT legislators in the area have been less visible recently, perhaps to avoid problems. She asked people to share information online to make the recall more known.

Legislator Lin Te-fu has made videos with famous politicians who support his work. His office said they are working as hard as they would for a regular election, visiting many places and putting up signs.

KMT Legislator Huang Chih-hsiung said that just online efforts are not enough. He believes they need to talk to people directly, work with local leaders, and get their supporters excited to vote. He said they have held 10 small meetings to help voters understand the recall rules better and prevent people from thinking that not voting means they don't support the recall. He believes that by getting their supporters to vote, they can reduce the risk of the recall passing.

**Last Year's Champion, Steven Moya, Pulls Out of Home Run Derby Due to Collarbone Injury**

Steven Moya, who won the Home Run Derby last year, was chosen to play in this year's All-Star game with the most votes. But today, he said he will not join the Home Run Derby. He has been having some pain in his collarbone. He is worried that swinging the bat too much could make it worse. He said, "I am honored to be chosen, and thank the fans for voting."

The All-Star games will be on July 19th and 20th. The players for the Home Run Derby were chosen by online votes. The top 8 players with the most votes were Steven Moya, Lin An-ke, Chi-Li-Chi-Lao Kung-Kuan, Chang Yu-cheng, Lin Chih-sheng, Hsu Chi-hung, Chang Chih-hao, and Tseng Sung-en.

Last year, Moya, who plays for the TSG Hawks, hit 18 home runs in 3 minutes to win the Home Run Derby. But this year, both Moya and Chang Yu-cheng have decided not to play. Moya explained today, "It's not that I don't want to join. I'm very honored to be chosen. But I've had some collarbone pain during the season. It doesn't stop me from playing in regular games, but if I join the Home Run Derby, it might get worse."

Moya said that because of recent rain, many games were canceled, which gives his collarbone time to heal. He doesn't want to risk making it worse because he wants to play well in the second half of the season. "If I join, I would want to win with all my strength. The Home Run Derby needs a lot of swings, which can make my body tired and affect how I use other parts of my body. I don't want to risk making the situation worse."

However, Moya will still play in the All-Star game. He said, "I'm very happy to be in the All-Star game. It's cool to have players who are usually my rivals become my teammates." Moya also thanked his fans. "It feels great to be supported. Thank you for your votes. I will play my best so fans can enjoy this summer baseball event."

**Recall Groups Use Street Talks and Online Campaigns; Liao Hsien-hsiang Focuses on Visiting Local Areas**

The first votes to recall legislators will happen on July 26th. In New Taipei City's 12th Legislative District, which is very large, the group trying to recall KMT Legislator Liao Hsien-hsiang is using street talks and live online broadcasts to spread their message. Mr. Liao, on the other hand, is putting up signs about his achievements and visiting many local areas. Both sides are working hard to get their supporters to vote.

Citizen groups have started recall actions across Taiwan. Many of these cases are now in the third stage of voting. For a recall to pass, more people must vote "yes" than "no," and the "yes" votes must be at least one-fourth of all eligible voters in the area.

In New Taipei City, votes to recall legislators will happen in 5 districts on July 26th. The 12th district includes 7 areas like Xizhi and Ruifang. The recall group is using both in-person and online methods, while Mr. Liao is focusing on in-person efforts.

For example, in the last election, the 12th district had 265,111 eligible voters. This means at least 66,278 "yes" votes are needed for the recall to pass, and "yes" votes must be more than "no" votes. The New Taipei City Election Commission said that the number of voters will be officially announced 3 days before the voting day.

Chen Cheng-ching, who started the recall against Legislator Liao Hsien-hsiang, listed 5 main reasons for the recall. These include Mr. Liao proposing to cut money for a large housing project in Xizhi and not being professional enough. Mr. Liao has responded to each point, saying that the accusations are twisted and that the recall is a political attack with chosen information.

To counter the recall group's actions, many signs about Mr. Liao's achievements can be seen in Xizhi, such as his work on the Xidong metro line and getting an elevator for Xizhi Train Station.

Mr. Liao said in an interview that he is not a legislator who seeks attention. His plan is to focus on in-person efforts, using flyers to explain his achievements. He will also join his party's events against the recall and continue to visit local areas, asking voters to vote "no."

The recall group is still looking for volunteers for street talks and is working with DPP legislators to visit areas and broadcast online to keep the recall efforts strong. With support from the DPP, the group has enough people for their in-person efforts. Chen Cheng-ching said they will continue both in-person and online strategies and will keep telling people in the local areas why Mr. Liao is not suitable, for example, about cutting the budget for the housing project.

Local people say that based on how people usually vote, Xizhi and Ruifang areas mostly vote for the KMT, while Jinshan, Wanli, Pingxi, Shuangxi, and Gongliao areas mostly vote for the DPP. Xizhi has more than half of the voters in the district, making it a very important area for the election. For example, in the last election, Mr. Liao only won in Xizhi, getting 67,649 votes, or 54.43%. He won the election with 92,489 votes, or 50.83%. This shows that Xizhi is a key area. Therefore, local people believe that whether the housing project budget issue affects voters in Xizhi will be an important factor.
