            <h1>Guardians Face Injuries: Shen Hao-wei Twists Ankle, Chang Yi Has Hip Pain and Moves to Minor League</h1>
            <p>The Fubon Guardians baseball team has many injured players. Yesterday, their outfielder Shen Hao-wei hurt his ankle. He stepped on the other team's training equipment when he was playing in the outfield. Also, pitcher Chang Yi felt pain inside his hip and was sent to the minor league team. The Guardians brought infielder Chen Zhen and infielder Wang Nien-hao to the main team.</p>
            <p>The Fubon Guardians played against the Rakuten Monkeys yesterday at Xinzhuang Baseball Stadium. In the seventh inning, Shen Hao-wei, the left fielder for the Guardians, made a great catch near the foul line. He caught Chen Chen-wei's hit. But he stepped on the Monkeys' training equipment in their bullpen area. Shen Hao-wei felt bad right away, so he left the game in the eighth inning. In the end, the Guardians lost to the Monkeys with a score of 1 to 3.</p>
            <p>The Guardians' head coach, Chen Chin-feng, said today that Shen Hao-wei will go to the minor league team to rest. He will rest for 10 days, and they will see how he feels. Shen Hao-wei already had an injury in his leg. Yesterday, after he stepped on the training equipment, his other foot also got a little twisted. This is the third time Shen Hao-wei has gone to the minor league team this season. Before yesterday's game, Chang Chin-te also suddenly felt pain in his lower back and went to the minor league team. The Guardians are having a difficult time with many injured players.</p>
            <p>Chang Yi, the Guardians' closing pitcher, also went to the minor league team today. Coach Chen Chin-feng said that the team's medical staff just told him today that Chang Yi felt pain inside his hip. So, this problem is not connected to how he has been playing recently. About who will be the closer after Chang Yi went to the minor league team, Coach Chen Chin-feng said they will decide during each game. The closer might not be the same person every time.</p>
            <p>This season, Chang Yi has played 33 games in the main league, starting 7 of them. He has pitched for 59 innings. He has won 4 games and lost 9 games. He has saved 8 games and helped in 1 game. His ERA (earned run average) is 5.34.</p>

            <h1>US Job Data Is Not Good, But Semiconductor Index Still Rises; Taiwan Stocks Look at Semiconductor Expo Before Fed Meeting</h1>
            <p>The US released bad job numbers, showing fewer people working outside of farms. Most major US stock markets went down. But the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which is closely linked to Taiwan's stock market, went up by 1.65%. Also, TSMC's shares in the US (ADR) went up by 3.49%. Experts believe that three upcoming events will help Taiwan's stock market get stronger. These are the Taipei International Semiconductor Exhibition, the Taipei International Aerospace & Defense Industry Exhibition, and Apple's new product launch.</p>
            <p>Experts think that good news, like the semiconductor exhibition, will keep coming. Taiwan's stock market might even reach a new high before the US Federal Reserve lowers interest rates in September. However, at this time, Taiwan's stock market is still moving within a big range, with both good and bad feelings from investors.</p>
            <p>When the US released bad job numbers, investors worried about the future of the economy. But because people expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates more, US stock market losses became smaller today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 220.43 points, or 0.48%, closing at 45400.86 points. The S&P 500 Index dropped by 20.58 points, or 0.32%, closing at 6481.50 points. The Nasdaq Index, which mainly has technology stocks, dropped by 7.30 points, or 0.03%, closing at 21700.39 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, however, went up by 93.541 points, or 1.65%, closing at 5761.398 points.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-kuang, the chairman of Fubon Securities Investment Services, said in a phone interview that TSMC's US shares (ADR) are worth over 22% more than their shares in Taiwan. This means TSMC can help push Taiwan's stock market higher. Also, people expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in September, which will bring more money into the market and help stocks go up. With good news from the semiconductor exhibition, the defense industry exhibition, and Apple's new product launch, Taiwan's stock market is likely to try and reach a new high again.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-kuang also said that Taiwan's stock market went up by about 7200 points from April's low of 17306 points to August's highest point ever of 24570 points, after the US announced matching taxes. If we count from the start of the year to August's highest point of 24570 points, it went up by over 6%. Even though investors worry about buying when prices are high, people are still buying and selling quickly, which makes Taiwan's stock market slowly climb higher.</p>
            <p>He explained that before the US Federal Reserve's meeting in September, Taiwan's stock market has good news from events like the semiconductor exhibition. We should watch if the market index can rise sharply with a lot of trading. We should also be careful if the price goes up but the number of trades goes down, which can be a bad sign. But right now, the feeling in the stock market is still hopeful.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Environment: 17,000 Waste Solar Panels in Chiayi County Fully Removed by Company</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas recently caused a lot of damage in central and southern Taiwan. A total of 135,000 solar panels across Taiwan were damaged. Among these, 17,000 panels were piled up along the flood retention pond in Chiayi County. Yesterday, the time given to clean them up ended. The Ministry of Environment said today that they checked with the Environmental Protection Bureau and confirmed that all the panels have been removed.</p>
            <p>The Danas typhoon damaged about 135,000 solar panels at 33 different sites across Taiwan. The Ministry of Environment said earlier that after sorting them, nearly 50,000 panels have been sent to special places for disposal. Almost 68,000 panels have been collected and temporarily put in legal storage areas. This means 88% of the damaged solar panels have been properly placed and handled.</p>
            <p>However, 17,000 solar panels from Yuan Yu Company were still piled up along the Xinzhuang flood retention pond in Chiayi County. Because the company was slow to clear them, they were fined a total of 9 million New Taiwan Dollars. Yuan Yu later submitted a cleanup plan on August 22nd. On August 28th, the Chiayi County Environmental Protection Bureau approved the plan. This allowed the company more time, until September 5th, to finish moving the panels.</p>
            <p>The deadline for Yuan Yu Company to clean up was yesterday. Yen Chen-ho, the director of the Southern Regional Environmental Management Center of the Ministry of Environment's Environmental Management Administration, told reporters today that they checked with the local Environmental Protection Bureau. They confirmed that all 17,000 solar panels have been removed. They were moved to legal storage places or legal disposal and recycling factories.</p>
            <p>According to information from the Ministry of Environment, solar panels are mainly made of glass, aluminum frames, silicon wafers, EVA film, and plastic backsheets. Companies in Taiwan now have the technology to separate these materials very well during the recycling process.</p>
            <p>For example, the glass is crushed and sorted to get clean glass. This clean glass is then sent to recycling centers to be used again. Clean pieces of silicon wafers are sent to factories to get metals from them. Clean plastic backsheets can be recycled as plastic. Or they can be used to make things like ceramic raw materials or ceramic clay powder, which are then sold to tile factories to make tiles. More than 90% of the useful materials can be taken out of the solar panels. They are not just burned or buried in landfills.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment said that Taiwan is actively working on recycling used solar panels to get valuable materials from them. There are four companies that can recycle these materials. They are allowed to process up to 2,915 metric tons each month. Also, more companies with technology to recycle these materials will start working in the future.</p>
