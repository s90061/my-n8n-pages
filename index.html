            <p>A press release from the Dongyin Area Command said that today's anniversary party invited local people. The event included many different parts, like a military parade, skill shows, joint military training exercises, group performances, and displays of strength.

            <p>Commander Feng Shao-yi said that the Zhongyi Unit has done many great things since it was started. For this 65th anniversary, they not only honored the people who came before them but also hope that all soldiers will get better at their jobs, work together, and continue to protect the country's northern border.</p>

A hundred residents and visitors came to watch.</p>
            <p>The Township Office press release said that "Walking on the Sea" used live music and a special storytelling style. It created a "land and sea meeting point" using a clear swimming pool, swimming rings, and the area's natural features. The people watching were not just viewers. They were invited to go into the story and experience leaving home, looking back, duties, hurts, old stories, and real life with the characters.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Tapah is Coming: Hong Kong and Macau Raise Storm Signal No. 8 Tonight, All Hong Kong Schools Close</h1>
            <p>A mild typhoon called Tapah is now in the northern South China Sea. It is expected to hit the western coast of Guangdong Province in China tomorrow morning, September 8th. Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan have already warned people and are getting ready for the typhoon. Hong Kong and Macau will also raise Typhoon Signal No. 8 starting at 9 PM tonight. This signal means there are strong winds or storms. All primary schools, secondary schools, and kindergartens in Hong Kong will close tomorrow.</p>
            <p>News from Hong Kong and Chinese media says that weather offices in both places reported that Typhoon Tapah's strongest winds near its center became stronger to level 10 at 5 PM today. Chinese weather experts also think Tapah might hit the western part of Guangdong tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>According to reports, the Hong Kong Observatory said this evening that Typhoon Tapah's winds will get even stronger tonight. It will move closer to the western coast of Guangdong and pass within 200 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong tomorrow morning. Winds in Hong Kong will get stronger tonight. There might be heavy rain, strong winds, and thunderstorms until tomorrow. Also, there will be big waves at sea, and some low-lying coastal areas might flood tomorrow morning.</p>
            <p>Because of this, the Hong Kong Observatory said it will put out the Strong Wind or Gale Signal No. 8 at 9:20 PM tonight. It will stay in place until at least 11 AM tomorrow, September 8th. The Hong Kong Education Bureau therefore announced this evening that all primary schools, secondary schools, and kindergartens in Hong Kong will be closed tomorrow for one day. They will announce tomorrow if evening schools will also close.</p>
            <p>Because Typhoon Tapah is coming, some flights between Hong Kong and China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia will not fly tomorrow. Also, some high-speed trains between Hong Kong and Zhanjiang, Guangdong, will only run between Hong Kong and Guangzhou. Some ferry services have already stopped today.</p>
            <p>In Macau, the Macau Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau also announced this afternoon that it will put out Signal No. 8 at 9 PM tonight.</p>
            <p>In China, officials in Guangdong Province think that Typhoon Tapah will bring strong winds and heavy rain to Guangdong in the next few days. So, at 11 PM on September 6th, they raised their typhoon emergency response from level 4 to level 3. Primary schools and kindergartens in Zhuhai City already closed this afternoon.</p>
            <p>Also, the Guangxi Maritime Safety Administration started its level 4 typhoon response this morning. Passenger and cargo ferries from Haikou City ports in Hainan Province to Guangdong will stop running from 2 PM tomorrow. All train services going into and out of Hainan will stop tomorrow.</p>

            <h1>Ukrainian Commander Says Drone Attack Seriously Damaged Russian Oil Pipeline</h1>
            <p>Robert Brovdi, a commander of Ukraine's drone forces, said on Telegram today that Ukrainian forces attacked the "Druzhba" (Friendship) oil pipeline in Russia's Bryansk region. This attack caused a bad fire and serious damage to the pipeline.</p>
            <p>Reuters could not check if this information is true on its own. Russia has not replied immediately yet.</p>
            <p>This pipeline carries Russian oil to Hungary and Slovakia. Other European Union countries stopped buying Russian energy after Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022. But Hungary and Slovakia still continue to buy it.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for MOL, a Hungarian oil and gas company, said that their country is still getting crude oil as planned. A spokesperson for Transpetrol, an oil pipeline company in Slovakia, did not reply right away when asked for a comment.</p>
            <p>Kyiv says that these attacks on Russia's energy places are revenge for Moscow's ongoing attacks on Ukraine. The goal is to make Russia weaker in its overall ability to fight.</p>
            <p>In recent weeks, Ukraine has attacked this pipeline many times. It runs from Russia through Ukraine to Slovakia. These attacks have often stopped oil from being transported.</p>
            <p>The Druzhba oil pipeline was built in the 1960s. It was a very important way to export energy during the Soviet Union time. It is also one of the biggest oil pipelines in Europe. It was named "Friendship" to show "friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries."</p>
