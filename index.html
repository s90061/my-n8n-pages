The United States is considering ending exceptions that currently allow foreign chipmakers, such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC, to use American technology in their manufacturing operations in China. These exceptions were initially granted after the U.S. imposed broad export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022. For South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies, having production in China is crucial to their business, as China is the world's largest market for semiconductors. This potential decision to remove these exceptions for allies' operations in China marks an important moment in U.S. technology policy.
