            <h1>China Starts Investigation on Pea Starch from Canada</h1>
            <p>China's Ministry of Commerce announced today that it has started an investigation into pea starch imported from Canada. This is an anti-dumping investigation. Before this, China added a 100% tax on imported peas from Canada starting March 20th. This was to get back at Canada for adding taxes on Chinese electric cars, steel, and aluminum products. Both countries' problems are still being looked at by the World Trade Organization.</p>
            <p>Canada sends out the most peas in the world. It is also a main producer of pea starch. China buys the most peas in the world and is the largest producer of processed peas. Pea starch is mainly used to make vermicelli and jelly noodles. It can also be made into things like thickeners and stabilizers. These are used in many areas, like food, medicine, and animal feed.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Commerce said in its announcement that on June 26, 2025, it got a formal request to investigate from six companies, including Yantai Shuangta Food Co., Ltd. These companies represent the pea starch industry in China. The Ministry checked the information from these companies. It found that the total amount of pea starch made by the companies meets the rules. The request also had all the necessary details and evidence for starting an anti-dumping investigation.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that China's Ministry of Commerce decided to start the anti-dumping investigation on pea starch from Canada on August 12, 2025. The period for checking if dumping happened is from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. The period for checking if the industry was harmed is from January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2024.</p>
            <p>The announcement said that this investigation started on August 12, 2025. It should usually finish before August 12, 2026. In special situations, it can be extended for six more months.</p>
            <p>According to a press release from China's Ministry of Commerce, a spokesperson said that this anti-dumping investigation started because the local industry asked for it. The product being investigated is pea starch. The companies asking for the investigation showed early evidence. This evidence suggests that in recent years, a lot more pea starch has been imported from Canada at very low prices. These prices are lower than what local products sell for. This has made it hard for the local industry to do business, and they are losing money.</p>
            <p>The spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce also said that after getting the request from the local industry, the investigation body checked the request. They did this according to China's laws and the rules of the World Trade Organization. They believe the request meets the conditions to start an anti-dumping investigation, so they decided to start it. The investigation body will do the investigation according to the law. They will make a fair decision based on what they find.</p>
            <p>Finally, the spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce said that anti-dumping investigations follow World Trade Organization rules. They are fair trade actions to protect local industries. The spokesperson said, "China's investigation into pea starch imports from Canada is very different from Canada's recent actions against China, which do not follow World Trade Organization rules."</p>
            <p>Canada added a 100% tax on electric cars imported from China starting October 1, 2024. Then, from October 22, 2024, Canada also added a 25% tax on steel and aluminum products imported from China.</p>
            <p>To get back at Canada for these new taxes, China's Ministry of Finance added a 100% tax. This tax is on imported peas, rapeseed oil, and oil cake from Canada, starting March 20th. They also added a 25% tax on seafood and pork.</p>
            <p>In June, the World Trade Organization created a group of experts. This group will look into these two trade problems between China and Canada.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon and Heavy Rain Damage 78 Cultural Sites, Bureau of Cultural Heritage Helping with Repairs</h1>
            <p>Recently, typhoons and heavy rains have caused problems in many places. Many old buildings and important historical sites were also damaged. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage under the Ministry of Culture has counted the damage. They found 71 cultural heritage sites were damaged by "Typhoon Danas." And 7 sites were damaged by the "July 28th heavy rain." This makes a total of 78 damaged sites. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage is now working hard to help fix them.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage's report, as of the 11th, shows the damage to cultural sites in different areas. There are 13 national historical sites, 28 historical sites in special cities, 5 historical sites in counties, and 2 historical sites in cities. Also, 29 historical buildings and 1 group of traditional village buildings were damaged.</p>
            <p>The areas with the most damage are Tainan, Chiayi, Penghu, and Yunlin. For example, in Tainan, parts of the "Nankunshen Daitian Temple" decorations broke and fell off. At "Kaiyuan Temple," the stone drums at the main gate moved. In Chiayi, the "Old Chiayi Prison" was damaged. In Yunlin, the "Taisugar Shigueixi Bridge" piers are tilted, and the train tracks on the bridge are twisted. In Penghu, "Tianhou Temple" has severe water leaks inside. Also, the walls of "Magong Ancient City" are hollow.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage told the Central News Agency that the Ministry of Culture has asked the Bureau to help. They also created special teams for national historical sites in different areas. These teams work with local city and county governments. They visit the sites to check the damage. They help the people in charge of the sites plan quick fixes and repair plans. This will make the repair process faster.</p>
            <p>The Bureau of Cultural Heritage also said that a special law is being planned. It's called the "Special Act for Post-Disaster Recovery and Reconstruction after Typhoon Danas and July 28th Heavy Rains." This law will include money to help fix cultural heritage sites. The Bureau will work with the Legislative Yuan's decision. They will fully help with recovery and repairs in all affected areas.</p>
            <p>Also, during the typhoon, many people saw pictures online of "Lukang Longshan Temple" flooded with water. Many people were worried about it. The Bureau of Cultural Heritage said that the leaks at "Lukang Longshan Temple" are due to old parts of the building, not from the recent typhoon. They are now taking bids for a repair project.</p>
