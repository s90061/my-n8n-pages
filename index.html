            <h1>Former Workers Say Meta Cares More About Money Than Children's Safety in VR</h1>
            <p>Two people who used to work at Meta, the company that owns Facebook, told a US government meeting today that Meta cares more about making money from its virtual reality (VR) products than keeping users safe.</p>
            <p>Cayce Savage, who was a researcher for Meta, said that Meta stopped a study. This study showed that Meta knew children were using its VR products and seeing bad content.</p>
            <p>Ms. Savage said at the meeting, "You cannot trust Meta to tell the truth about how safe their products are or how they are used."</p>
            <p>Recently, the news agency Reuters reported that Meta let its chatbots talk to children in romantic or suggestive ways. This made government officials angry.</p>
            <p>Jason Sattizahn, another former researcher for Meta, also spoke today. Senator Marsha Blackburn asked him if he was surprised that Meta allowed these kinds of talks between chatbots and children.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sattizahn answered, "No, not at all."</p>
            <p>Meta had said before that the situations Reuters reported were against their rules and had been fixed.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported yesterday about the complaints from Ms. Savage, Mr. Sattizahn, and other current and past Meta workers.</p>
            <p>Ms. Savage said that researchers were told not to look into how VR might harm children. This was so the company could say they didn't know about any problems. Ms. Savage said she found during her work that children were bullied, sexually attacked, and asked for naked pictures.</p>
            <p>Meta's spokesperson, Andy Stone, said in a statement that these claims are based on "documents that were chosen on purpose and partly shared. They were selected just to create a false story." He also said that the company "never completely stopped studying young people."</p>
            <p>Senator Blackburn said at the meeting that what the former workers said makes it even more important to pass the "Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA)." This law passed the Senate last year but did not pass in the House of Representatives.</p>

            <h1>Israel Attacks Hamas Base in Doha, Kills 6; Qatar Says It Will Still Help with Gaza Peace</h1>
            <p>Israel attacked a Hamas base in Doha, the capital city of Qatar. Six people died in this attack. Qatar's Prime Minister said that even though this was a "clear attack," they will keep trying to help stop the fighting in Gaza and free the people who were taken.</p>
            <p>The news agency AFP reported that Hamas said the attack killed the son of Khalil al-Hayya, who is a person helping to talk about a ceasefire. It also killed one staff member and three security guards. Hamas said, "the enemy did not manage to kill our team members who are negotiating."</p>
            <p>This attack, which had not happened before, also killed one Qatari security guard. This makes it even harder to find a solution, as talks were already stuck.</p>
            <p>Qatar's Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, said today that Qatar has the right to "answer this clear attack." He called this air strike "a very important moment in the area."</p>
            <p>But he also said, "No matter how hard the situation in the area becomes, it will not change our strong will to keep helping with talks."</p>
            <p>Qatar is an important friend of the United States in the Middle East. It is also where the biggest US military base in the area is located. Since 2012, with the US's agreement, the political office of Hamas has been in Qatar.</p>
            <p>The White House said that US President Trump did not agree with Israel taking military action in a friendly country. It also said that the US had told Qatar about the attack before it happened.</p>
            <p>However, Qatar said they did not get any warning. They said they were only told after the attack had already happened.</p>

            <h1>iPhone 17 Phones Keep Same Price Even with New Taxes; Apple Will Pay Extra Costs</h1>
            <p>Apple released its new, better iPhone models today. This includes the iPhone Air, which is lighter and thinner. The prices for these phones stayed the same. This is happening even though new taxes from US President Trump are making it harder for the company to earn money.</p>
            <p>The news agency Reuters said that the iPhone Air has a strong battery and a new computer chip. It costs $999 to start. Many people who follow the stock market were waiting to see if Apple would make iPhones more expensive. They also wondered if Apple would find other ways to cover the cost of the new taxes, for example, by making phones with more storage space cost more.</p>
            <p>The iPhone Air was the most important new product shown at Apple's yearly event. Tim Cook, the boss of Apple, said, "We are making the biggest jump forward for iPhone ever."</p>
            <p>Apple says the iPhone Air is the strongest iPhone made so far. It will use a new chip called the A19 Pro. Apple says this chip uses less power and works better, which is good for the thinner battery in the iPhone Air. Other phone companies, like Samsung, already sell very thin phones.</p>
            <p>Just as many experts thought, the iPhone Air's price is between Apple's other phone models. Apple also showed updated versions of its main smartphones, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro. They also showed new wireless headphones called AirPods Pro and a new Apple Watch that can check blood pressure.</p>
            <p>The iPhone 17 standard model with 256 GB of storage costs $799. This is the same price as the old iPhone 16 model, which had only half the storage space. The iPhone 17 Pro with 256 GB of storage costs $1099. This is the same as last year's model with the same storage. However, the smaller and cheaper iPhone 16 Pro option, which cost $999, is no longer available.</p>
            <p>Apple also did not make its watches or the new AirPods Pro 3 headphones more expensive.</p>
            <p>This way of setting prices shows that Apple is ready to pay for the new taxes itself. They want to compete with other companies like Samsung, Google, and phone makers from China. Apple had thought that these taxes would cost them more than $1 billion this three-month period.</p>
            <p>Tom Mainelli, who works for a research company called IDC, said, "They are using their big size to try and keep prices the same."</p>
            <p>He said, "I think Apple, like most tech companies, knows that these taxes will affect how much money people can spend later this year, especially in the US. So they will keep prices steady. They want people to be able to buy new phones by the end of this year for the same price as last year."</p>
            <p>The iPhone Air will go against Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge phone. Experts told Reuters that this new Apple phone might be a first step for Apple to compete with Samsung's phones that fold. Samsung has already made seven versions of its folding phones.</p>
            <p>Folding phones are very important for Apple to get customers in China. People there really like folding phones, and Apple is selling fewer phones in China.</p>
            <p>Paolo Pescatore, an expert from PP Foresight, said, "This new device will make the iPhone feel fresh again after a long time... The new and much better iPhone phones look very good. This helps Apple be in a good position to meet what different groups of customers want."</p>
