            <h1>Taipei Metro Wenhu Line Problem: Trains Every 10 Minutes Between Jiantan Road and Zhongshan Junior High School</h1>
            <p>The Taipei Metro company said today that there is a problem on the Wenhu Line. A train between Dazhi Station and Taipei Zoo Station had a warning message. This is making trains run slower. So, trains between Jiantan Road Station and Zhongshan Junior High School Station are now coming every 10 minutes.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Metro company also said that trains will stop longer at stations, and people will wait longer. If you are in a hurry, you can take other transportation. Or you can change trains at other stations. If you have questions about tickets or refunds, you can ask at the information desk or check their website.</p>

            <h1>Wu Der-rong: Central and Southern Taiwan to Have Heavy Rain; Clear and Hot Weather by August 6</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu Der-rong said that starting today, the Southwest Monsoon will come to Taiwan. This means central and southern Taiwan will have many days of rain, and some rain might cause damage. He thinks that by August 6, a high-pressure system from the Pacific will get stronger. The Southwest Monsoon will move north. Then, Taiwan will have clear and very hot summer weather again.</p>
            <p>According to the weather agency's website, from yesterday until 8 AM today, Taibao City in Chiayi County had the most rain, with 477 millimeters. Houbi District in Tainan City had 433 millimeters, and Shuilin Township in Yunlin County had 409.5 millimeters.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong, who is also a professor at National Central University, wrote today in his column "Xie Tian Ji Jiao Shi" for the Meteorological Applications Promotion Foundation. He said that new computer models from Europe show that from today until August 4, the Southwest Monsoon will be near Taiwan. This will bring many days of rain to central and southern Taiwan, which is facing the wind. There will be a lot of rain that could cause problems. The air will not be stable. There will be some showers or thunderstorms. In the afternoon, the rain will spread to more areas. There is also a chance of small areas having "strong weather," like lightning, strong winds, and very heavy rain at once.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also said that the eastern part of Taiwan, which is on the sheltered side, will not be affected as much. It might have short local rain sometimes. When it's not raining, the weather will be hot and humid.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong said that the newest European model shows that on August 6, the Pacific high-pressure system will get stronger. The Southwest Monsoon will become weaker and move north. The long period of heavy rain will stop. Taiwan will go back to clear and very hot summer weather.</p>
            <p>Wu Der-rong also pointed out that the latest typhoon map from the weather agency shows "Tropical Storm Zhujiecao" is inside the monsoon area. It is moving towards Zhejiang, then it will turn north towards Jiangsu. It will not affect Taiwan. "Typhoon Krovanh" is still over the ocean south of Japan. It is moving north. It is very far from Taiwan and will not affect it either.</p>

            <h1>Markets Waiting for US Tech Company Reports; Experts Say Taiwan Stocks Might Get Stronger</h1>
            <p>US President Trump and the European Union have made an agreement about tariffs. This makes people hope that the trade break between the US and China will last longer. Most US stocks closed higher on July 28. Experts say that the main thing affecting Taiwan's stock market right now is the US tariffs. But this week, big tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Apple will release their financial reports. People hope these reports will help the Taiwan stock market grow.</p>
            <p>KGI Securities said that on July 28, Taiwan stocks started higher in the morning, reaching a new high for this period. But people were careful and waited to see what would happen. The total money traded was only NT$312.8 billion. After going up, the index went down a bit and then stayed stable. It closed with a small black candle. From a technical view, Taiwan stocks are still above their short-term average. This means the market is still going up. But because the US and Taiwan might announce new tariff rates this week, the market might trade less and stay stable before the announcement.</p>
            <p>Most US stocks closed higher on July 28. The Dow Jones Industrial Average went down a little, by 64.36 points or 0.14%, closing at 44837.56 points. The S&P 500 Index went up a little, by 1.13 points or 0.02%, closing at 6389.77 points. The Nasdaq Index went up by 70.27 points or 0.33%, closing at 21178.59 points. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 91.24 points or 1.62%, closing at 5737.1 points.</p>
            <p>Taiwan stocks went up by 48.6 points on July 28, closing at 23412.98 points. The total money traded was NT$312.841 billion. Three main types of investors bought a total of NT$13.533 billion worth of shares. Among them, dealers bought NT$5.324 billion, investment trusts bought NT$3.534 billion, and foreign and mainland Chinese investors bought NT$4.675 billion.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 stocks that foreign investors bought, Taiwan Glass was first, with 29,300 shares bought. Innolux was second, with 15,800 shares. The others were Wistron, AUO, Fubon Vietnam, E.SUN Financial, Yuanta High Dividend, CTBC Financial, Unimicron, and China Petrochemical Development.</p>
            <p>For the top 10 stocks that foreign investors sold, Taishin Synthetics had 64,000 shares sold. Taishin Financial also had 63,700 shares sold.
