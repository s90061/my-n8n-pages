**Sou Fujimoto's First Big Exhibition Shows Small Model of "Big Roof Ring"**

Japan's Mori Art Museum is holding the first big exhibition for the famous architect Sou Fujimoto. Besides models of his work and his life history, a 1/5 smaller model of the "Big Roof Ring," which is over 4 meters tall, is also on display. This means you can see a mini version even if you can't go to the Osaka Expo.

Sou Fujimoto was born in Hokkaido in 1971. He has architecture offices in Tokyo, Paris, and Shenzhen. He has designed many types of buildings, including homes, universities, shops, hotels, and big complexes. In Taiwan, he designed "Nan Cheng Long Shi" in Tainan.

He first became known in 2000 with his design for the "Aomori Museum of Art Design Competition." After that, he worked on projects like the "Musashino Art University Museum & Library" in Tokyo and the "Serpentine Gallery Pavilion" in London. He is also the design director for the 2025 World Expo in Osaka, where he designed the most important building, the "Big Roof" (Large Roof Ring).

The exhibition, called "Sou Fujimoto: Futures of the Origin of Architecture," runs from July 2 to November 9 at the Mori Art Museum. It is his first large solo exhibition and shows his main projects from the last 30 years. Fujimoto said the exhibition was inspired by the forests in his hometown of Hokkaido. He believes a "forest-like place" can accept many different things, which is why he used the word "Mori" (forest) in the exhibition's title.

**China Plans to Build More "Medical Centers" in Xinjiang, Raising Concerns About Forced Organ Harvesting**

Today, the UK's "Daily Telegraph" reported, using information from the international human rights group "End Transplant Abuse in China" (ETAC), that the Chinese government plans to build six more "medical centers" with organ transplant facilities in Xinjiang by 2030. This number is much higher than what the local population needs, which raises more worries about forced organ harvesting.

According to the report, Xinjiang currently has three similar "medical centers" that can perform organ transplants. If we count from the government's decision last December to build more of these centers, the number of organ transplant places in Xinjiang will become three times bigger in about five years. Four of the six new "medical centers" will be in Urumqi, the capital city.

In 2019, an independent group called the "Uyghur Tribunal" was held in the UK, led by British lawyer Geoffrey Nice. This group found that China has as many as 100,000 organ transplant cases each year, which is almost three times the official number.

The tribunal said there was enough proof that Chinese authorities were involved in taking organs from people in prison. Sometimes, organs were even taken while the victims were still alive. Uyghur people and Falun Gong followers are often victims of this organ harvesting.
