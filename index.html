https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4nnx6njx5lo

A new study by researchers at the University of Oxford looked at how much time teenagers spend on screens. They found that young people from richer families might spend more time on screens, but this doesn't always lead to problems like unhappiness. The study used information from about 12,000 teenagers in England. It suggests that just counting screen time isn't enough to understand its effects. What matters more is how teens use screens and their reasons for using them. Some experts say that social media can be good for young people's friendships and can help them feel less lonely. However, it's still important for parents and schools to support teens and help them use screens in a healthy way. More research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of screen use.

The way we work is changing quickly, and flexibility is now a key part of it. Many companies are realizing that giving employees more freedom, like hybrid work options (mixing office and home work), can make them happier and more productive. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also changing the workplace, taking over some simple tasks and creating new kinds of jobs. This means that workers need to keep learning new skills, especially "soft skills" like critical thinking, problem-solving, and good communication. Companies are also focusing more on employee well-being, offering support for mental and physical health. The future of work will likely involve a balance between technology, human skills, and flexible working arrangements.

More and more travelers are choosing to travel in ways that protect the environment and support local communities. This trend, called sustainable travel, is becoming very popular. Travelers are looking for eco-friendly hotels that use less water and energy. They also want to experience local culture and buy products from local businesses to help the economy of the places they visit. People are thinking more about how their trips affect the planet, for example, by choosing train travel over flights for shorter distances to reduce carbon pollution. This change shows that travelers want to make a positive impact and ensure beautiful places can be enjoyed by future generations.`;
