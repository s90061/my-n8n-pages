Taiwan's CPC Corporation is thinking about buying natural gas assets in the United States. This is to make sure Taiwan has enough gas for its economy. If they buy these assets, Taiwan will get more natural gas. It will also help Taiwan's relationship with the US government.

CPC is looking at gas fields in places like Texas and Louisiana, called Haynesville, and another area called Marcellus shale. Taiwan has been buying more and more liquefied natural gas (LNG) over the past 15 years.

CPC has already invested in US LNG factories. They also signed a deal in March to buy LNG and invest in a project in Alaska. This project will bring gas to Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea. This will help Taiwan's energy safety.

**Big Fire Near Grand Canyon Makes 500 Tourists Leave**

A fast-moving wildfire near the Grand Canyon in the US made about 500 people leave their locations. This fire, called "White Sage Fire," caused all visitors to leave the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. The North Rim is less visited than the South Rim.

Park staff safely moved about 500 visitors. The North Rim is now closed during the day until further notice. Another fire, the "Dragon Bravo Fire," also started by lightning, is also burning.

The "White Sage Fire" is outside the national park and is moving towards Jacob Lake, a small town near the North Rim. Officials say the fire has burned a lot of land and is not under control. This is because of dry weather and strong winds. The fire started on July 9 during a storm.

**History Exam for College Test Is Hard, Scores May Go Down**

The history exam for Taiwan's college entrance test was held today. The questions included topics like gender, different groups of people, and how indigenous people and Han Chinese were separated.

Some questions were very hard. Students needed to know a lot about history and understand how different events caused other things to happen. Teachers believe the average scores for this exam might be lower than last year.

The exam used different types of materials, like written texts, pictures, and charts. Teachers said the questions covered both academic topics and everyday situations. They focused on understanding historical information and different points of view.
