            <h1>Taiwanese Young Players Beat USA Team, Win Junior League World Series</h1>
            <p>The Junior League Baseball World Series is a baseball competition for young players. It started in 1981. This game is one of 11 games organized by the Little League Baseball organization. Players are between 12 and 14 years old. Every year, the event is held in Taylor, Michigan. There are 12 teams in total, divided into an American group and an international group. Taiwan won the championship in 2022 with Zhongshan Junior High School from Taichung. In 2023 and 2024, Xinming Junior High School from Taoyuan won the title twice in a row.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan office in Chicago sent out a press release this afternoon. It said that after the Taiwanese team won, President Lai Ching-te and Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim quickly sent messages to congratulate the young players. They celebrated their win and said the players brought honor to Taiwan. A representative from the Chicago office gave them the award.</p>
            <p>The office also said that the team from Zhongshan Junior High School in Taichung has played in this competition four times. Each time, they have represented Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region. They have won the championship every single time, meaning they have a perfect winning record.</p>
            <p>At the final game, almost 300 Taiwanese people living in Michigan came to support the team. They waved national flags and cheered loudly for the Taiwanese players. In the evening, the Taiwan office in Chicago also gave extra money for a celebration dinner. This was on behalf of Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, to thank the young players for their hard work.</p>
            <p>This year, on August 4th, the Detroit Tigers baseball team had their first "Taiwan Day" event. On that day, all the team members and their parents went to watch the game after their own match against Canada. They saw the best players in Major League Baseball, which is the highest level of baseball in the world.</p>

            <h1>Chen Yi-hsin, the 'Holiday Thrower,' Returns for MLB First Pitch; Catcher Praises Accurate Control</h1>
            <p>On August 10th, the San Diego Padres baseball team held a "Taiwan Culture Day" event. Chen Yi-hsin, a famous baseball player from Taiwan, threw the first pitch. He wore a "Taiwan" jersey with his well-known number 17. The catcher who caught his ball said, "His control was very good. He is the best pitcher I have ever caught for a first pitch."</p>
            <p>The San Diego Padres played against the Boston Red Sox at their home stadium today. Before the game, they had the "Taiwan Day" event. From a big stage behind the center field, Taiwanese pop songs by bands like Mayday and S.H.E played. About 1500 Taiwanese people living abroad enjoyed the event. They wore special hats for the day with the Taiwan flag on them.</p>
            <p>In one part of the stadium, the Padres' team logo, which says "SD," was changed to look like the Taiwan flag. Many Taiwanese people living abroad took pictures with it.</p>
            <p>Dai Yu-cheng, who used to be a professional baseball player and now coaches baseball in Southern California, started the Padres' "Taiwan Day." He said the main goal was to invite Taiwanese people to watch the game together. He also wanted more people to learn about Taiwan. He said, "We want everyone to know that Taiwan is a country. We are a very independent and free place."</p>
            <p>The United States has many different groups of people. These groups often use professional baseball games to share their culture and traditions, helping more people see them. Today was the Padres' first "Taiwan Day," and they invited Chen Yi-hsin, a legendary Taiwanese baseball player, to throw the first pitch.</p>
            <p>It was a Sunday when Chen Yi-hsin threw the pitch. This fit his old nickname, "The Holiday Thrower," perfectly. Before Chen Yi-hsin came out, the announcer said that he played professional baseball in both Japan and Taiwan during his career. He also had over a thousand strikeouts.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-hsin told a reporter that he is 62 years old this year. He said, "If I were still young, I would want to pitch in the biggest baseball stadium." Today, he was there to throw the first pitch. He felt relaxed and wanted to experience the excitement of American baseball.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-hsin said he had been away from baseball for a long time. He had thrown first pitches in Taiwan before. But this time, standing on the pitcher's mound in Major League Baseball made him very excited. He said, "To throw a good pitch, I trained extra hard these past few days. My whole body was sore after throwing."</p>
            <p>Everywhere Chen Yi-hsin went, if he met Taiwanese people, they eagerly asked to take photos with him. One fan brought a poster of Chen Yi-hsin from when he was a player. This fan traveled from San Francisco, which is more than an 8-hour drive, just to see Chen Yi-hsin throw the first pitch.</p>
            <p>Before Chen Yi-hsin went to the pitcher's mound to throw, he practiced with a ball girl on the outfield grass. Maria, the ball girl who always catches for first-pitch guests, told a reporter, "He was the best pitcher for a first pitch I've ever caught. You could tell he used to be a player because his control was very accurate."</p>

            <h1>US Ambassador to NATO: Zelenskyy May Attend Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>Washington, August 10th â€“ The US Ambassador to NATO, Matthew Whitaker, said today that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy might go to the summit this week. This meeting between the United States and Russia will happen in Alaska. European leaders want Ukraine to be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that CNN asked Matthew Whitaker if Zelenskyy might join the talks on August 15th with US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
            <p>He said, "Yes, I really think this is possible. Of course, we cannot make an agreement that everyone involved does not agree with. What I mean is, clearly, stopping this war is the most important thing to do right now."</p>
            <p>People were worried that if Zelenskyy was not there, the meeting might result in an agreement where Ukraine would have to give up a lot of its land. The European Union is against this idea.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy started many diplomatic efforts. In three days, he talked on the phone with 13 leaders, including those from Germany, the UK, and France, who strongly support Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Today, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he hopes and believes that Zelenskyy will be part of this summit.</p>
