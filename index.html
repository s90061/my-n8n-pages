            <h1>China Plans Europe's Biggest Embassy; UK Delays Decision Again</h1>
            <p>The British government has again delayed its decision on whether to allow China to build its largest embassy in Europe in London. This delay comes as officials are under pressure after two men, accused of spying for Beijing, were released because there was not enough evidence.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that China wants to build its new embassy near the Tower of London, on a site with a 200-year-old building. However, this plan has been stopped for the past three years due to objections from local residents, members of parliament, and Hong Kong pro-democracy activists in the UK.</p>
            <p>Some politicians from both the UK and the US are worried that the new embassy could become a place for spying. They have asked the government to stop China's plan.</p>
            <p>The UK Housing Department, in documents seen by Reuters, said that the final review, which was planned for October 21, will now be moved to December 10. This is because the Home Office and the Foreign Office have been slow in their responses.</p>
            <p>The Housing Department did not immediately answer when asked for a comment.</p>
            <p>The timing of this decision is very important for the government led by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Before this, some officials were accused of not taking China's threat to UK national security seriously enough. This led to the charges against the two British men, accused of spying for China, being dropped by prosecutors.</p>
            <p>Last month, British prosecutors suddenly dropped the charges against Christopher Cash, who was the director of the former UK Parliament think tank, the China Research Group, and academic Christopher Berry. These two were accused of spying for Beijing between 2021 and 2023. However, because the government refused to call China an enemy country, the charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence.</p>

            <h1>Kremlin: Putin and Trump Talked for 2.5 Hours, Summit Preparations to Start Immediately</h1>
            <p>The Russian Kremlin announced today that President Putin and US President Trump had a "very open and trusting" phone call that lasted two and a half hours. After this call, the Kremlin will "immediately" start preparing for a meeting between the two leaders.</p>
            <p>Yuri Ushakov, a top aide to Putin, told news agencies like AFP that "both sides have agreed that representatives of the two countries will immediately start preparing for a summit. The meeting location, for example, could be Budapest (the capital of Hungary)."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said that Trump suggested Budapest as the meeting place, and Putin "immediately" agreed.</p>
            <p>He added that the phone call was "very important" and also "extremely open and trusting." He also mentioned that Russia started the two-and-a-half-hour conversation.</p>
            <p>Putin and Trump met in Alaska, USA, on August 15, but they did not make much progress. In the last two months, efforts to reach a peace agreement for Ukraine have slowed down.</p>
            <p>Today's call between Putin and Trump happened as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was traveling to Washington D.C. He was going to talk with Trump about possible US aid, including Tomahawk long-range missiles. Later, sources told AFP that Zelenskyy had arrived in Washington.</p>
            <p>Ushakov stated, "Putin repeated that Tomahawk missiles will not change the situation on the battlefield, but they will seriously hurt relations between the two countries, not to mention the possibility of a peaceful solution (to the Russia-Ukraine war)."</p>
            <p>Andriy Sybiga, Ukraine's Foreign Minister, wrote on X (formerly Twitter): "Today's phone call between US President Trump and Putin shows that even just discussing Tomahawk missiles has forced Putin to talk with the United States again."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ushakov also said US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will talk in the coming days to prepare for the new summit between Trump and Putin. The exact date of the summit will depend on how fast these preparations go.</p>
            <p>According to the Kremlin, Trump promised to consider Putin's ideas from the call before meeting with Zelenskyy tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The Russian military launched a large air attack last night, causing power outages across Ukraine. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's Ambassador to the US, said in a statement that "Russia has once again chosen missiles instead of talking." She added that this attack directly goes against Trump's efforts for peace.</p>
            <p>She said, "These attacks show that Moscow's strategy is to scare and wear down." She believes "the only effective response is to apply pressure - through stronger sanctions, better air defense systems, and supplying long-range military power."</p>
