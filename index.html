<p>US President Donald Trump recently said that some strong actions by China are not very important. He said, "That's how the world works." This included his ideas about two Chinese people who were caught last month. They were accused of bringing dangerous germs into the US.</p>

<p>Trump told Fox News that the US also does similar things. He said, "Don't you think we do the same? We do, we do many good things... This is how the world works. The world is a bit dangerous." He was answering questions about China possibly stealing ideas, hacking US phone systems, and issues with COVID-19.</p>

<p>He also didn't seem too worried about a case where two Chinese citizens were accused of bringing a harmful fungus into the US. This fungus can hurt crops like wheat and corn. Trump said, "You don't know where that came from. I mean, did that come from that country?" Trump also said he was happy with the current trade situation with China. He said, "We are getting along well with China," and "I think it's good that we get along well with China. But they are paying a lot of money in taxes."</p>

<p><b>Trump Says Special Taxes Will Not Be Delayed After July 9</b></p>

<p>US President Donald Trump announced today that a special tax plan for most countries will not be extended. This plan, which stopped these taxes for 90 days, will end on July 9. Trump said that after this time, if countries haven't made a deal with the US, Washington will tell them that extra taxes will start.</p>

<p>Trump mentioned that letters about this will be sent "soon." He told Fox News on Sunday that the US will decide based on how each country treats the US. He said, "Some countries, we don't care, we will just make the taxes very high."</p>

<p>He explained that the letters would say: "Good news, you can sell your goods in the US, but you will pay a 25% tax, or 35% or 50% or 10%." Before, Trump had said that reaching agreements with all countries was hard. His government had aimed to make "90 trade deals in 90 days." In the interview, he said talks are still happening, but "there are 200 countries in the world, we can't talk to every one."</p>

<p><b>NBA Player Beasley Under Investigation for Gambling, New Contract Talks Stopped</b></p>

<p>ESPN reported today that Malik Beasley, a basketball player for the Detroit Pistons in the NBA, is being looked at by government lawyers. This is because of claims that he was involved in gambling on NBA games. ESPN said that these claims are about when Beasley played for the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023-24 season.</p>

<p>Beasley's lawyer, Steve Haney, told ESPN, "Being investigated does not mean he has done something wrong. In the US, Malik has the right to be thought innocent until proven guilty. Right now, he has not been accused of any crime."</p>

<p>Beasley, who is 28 years old, has played in the NBA for nine seasons. He was going to be a "free agent," meaning he could choose a new team. He was talking with the Pistons about a new contract for three years, worth $42 million. But the report says these talks have now stopped.</p>
