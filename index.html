            <h1>Premier Cho Jung-tai Reiterates Three Goals for US Tariff Talks</h1>
            <p>Premier Cho Jung-tai stated today that talks with the United States started on May 1st. Since then, there have been five in-person meetings and ten online discussions. The talks have not yet finished. He repeated three main goals: to get fairer tariff rates that are equal for both sides, to get the "most favored nation" tariff rate without extra tariffs, and to discuss fair treatment under Section 232.</p>
            <p>Today, Premier Cho Jung-tai went to the Legislative Yuan to report on a special budget plan. This plan is for making Taiwan stronger in its economy, society, and people's lives in a changing world.</p>
            <p>About the equal tariffs from the US, Premier Cho said the government will use four main rules for the talks. These are: protecting Taiwan's interests, protecting industries, protecting people's health, and making sure there is enough food. He also listed the three goals again. These are to get fairer equal tariff rates, to get the "most favored nation" rate without extra equal tariffs, and to discuss fair treatment under Section 232. This is to make sure Taiwan's important industries stay strong and competitive.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho explained that changes in US tariffs not only affect Taiwan's industries and jobs but also change how global trade works. This then affects international situations and is important for rebuilding Taiwan's trade plans. He had told the Legislative Yuan that this is one of three reconstructions that must start now and both legislative bodies should work on it together.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho said the Executive Yuan has prepared a special budget plan, as required by special rules. The plan has 550 billion New Taiwan dollars for spending. This money comes from 444.4 billion New Taiwan dollars saved from previous years and borrowing 105.6 billion New Taiwan dollars. The plan will run from March 12th this year until December 31st, 2027. The special budget includes 78 billion New Taiwan dollars for supporting industries, 15 billion New Taiwan dollars for stable jobs, 307 billion New Taiwan dollars for people's lives, and 150 billion New Taiwan dollars for making the country stronger.</p>
            <p>Premier Cho also said that because the tariff talks with the US are not finished, 20 billion New Taiwan dollars has been saved in the special budget. This money is for future results from the talks. He said this money will be used only if it is needed and useful, and he asked the Legislative Yuan for its support.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Premier Cho presented three reconstruction plans in his report to the Legislative Yuan. These were rebuilding industrial plans, rebuilding disaster areas, and rebuilding trust in society.</p>

            <h1>"Taiwanese Model" Proposed in Tariff Talks; Legislator Says Taiwan and US Can Make Money Together</h1>
            <p>Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun talked about a "Taiwanese Model" for increasing investment in the US, which is different from what Japan, South Korea, and the European Union do. Legislator Chung Chia-pin of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said today that any model can be discussed if it benefits both sides. DPP Legislator Wu Szu-yao said this is good news, and Taiwan should work with the US to make a lot of money. She hopes all political parties will support this.</p>
            <p>Taiwan and the US continue to have tariff talks. Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun, who just returned from the fifth round of in-person discussions in the US, said on October 2nd that Taiwan has suggested a "Taiwanese Model" for greater investment in the US. This model is different from those used by Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. In this model, companies make their own plans, and the government helps with money and guarantees. It uses a "G-to-G" (government-to-government) way of working together to create industry areas.</p>
            <p>Legislator Chung Chia-pin and others from the DPP held a press conference in front of the Legislative Yuan today to share their thoughts on this matter.</p>
            <p>Chung Chia-pin explained that the government had similar ideas when it promoted the New Southbound Policy. He said it could be seen as extending Taiwan's economic strength, or as working with local governments and private companies. Both are possible. He wants everyone to understand that international economic and trade cooperation always involves mutual benefits. If this principle is followed, any model can be discussed.</p>
            <p>DPP Legislator Wu Szu-yao said in an interview that this plan can help build Taiwan's semiconductor and information and communication technology (ICT) industry clusters in the US. This will lead to closer and better cooperation between Taiwan and the US. She believes Taiwan and the US should work together to make a lot of money, and this is not just giving money away.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao thinks the "Taiwanese Model" is a good idea and should be seriously and actively planned. She also believes that with the global trend of increasing investment in the US, Taiwan should create a unique position instead of resisting. This also fits President Lai Ching-te's national strategy to build a democratic semiconductor supply chain that is not tied to China.</p>
            <p>Wu Szu-yao said that if the "Taiwanese Model" can be created through government-to-government cooperation, allowing Taiwan's experience with science parks to be used in the US, it would be a good thing. She asked the public and all political parties to support it.</p>

            <h1>US-China Competition Reaches Submarine Cables; Taiwan Becomes a Focus</h1>
            <p>The United States and China are fighting to build and control the undersea cables that carry 99% of the world's internet traffic. Several events where these cables were cut near Taiwan have made this area a key point of international attention.</p>
            <p>In February of this year, a Chinese cargo ship named "Hong Tai No. 58" illegally dropped its anchor in the waters southwest of Taiwan. This broke an undersea cable, stopping internet signals from working correctly.</p>
            <p>The Chinese captain, surnamed Wang, was first sentenced to three years in prison by the Tainan District Court. Later, a higher court rejected the prosecutor's appeal, so the original sentence stayed the same. Taiwan's National Security Bureau says that in the last three years, there have been about 7 to 8 cable breaks near Taiwan each year, and most of them "are related to China." Beijing, however, says these were all accidents. No matter the reason, these events have made the already tense relationship between Taiwan and China even more difficult.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg reported that protecting these undersea cables is a very hard job. Its importance is not just in the Taiwan Strait but also grows as the competition between the US and China becomes stronger. Almost all internet traffic, including AI interactions, military plans, and financial deals worth 10 trillion US dollars every day, relies on these cables. These cables were built for working together, not for conflict.</p>
            <p>Places where cables come ashore and in shallow water are the most easily damaged. The "Hong Tai No. 58" incident showed how hard it is to enforce rules in these areas. Taiwan's Ministry of Digital Affairs told Bloomberg that "gray zone actions" (actions that are not quite war) against weak points like cables are often disguised as fishing boat accidents. This makes it difficult to collect evidence and take legal action, as it doesn't cause a war.</p>
            <p>The PEACE (Pakistan and East Africa Connecting Europe) cable, built by China's HMN Technologies, was fully working in 2024. The SEA-ME-WE-6 (Southeast Asiaâ€“Middle Eastâ€“Western Europe 6) cable, built by the US-based company SubCom, is expected to start working in early 2026.</p>
            <p>Even though both these cables go to Europe, their different paths show how internet connections match the strategic plans of the countries that support them.</p>
            <p>Almost all undersea cables in the world are made and installed by four companies: China's HMN Technologies, US-based SubCom, France's Alcatel Submarine Networks, and Japan's Nippon Electric Company.</p>
            <p>In the past, groups of telecom companies and others, including some from the US and China, mostly paid for cables. They did this to share costs and profits. But this way of working is now changing.</p>
            <p>Big American tech companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon now use over 70% of undersea cable capacity. Ten years ago, they used less than 10%.</p>
            <p>These big tech companies are now building their own networks and not using other companies to do it. For example, Meta, the company that owns Facebook, is now building "Project Waterworth," which will be the longest undersea cable in the world, stretching 50,000 kilometers.</p>
            <p>Because of the high demand for Artificial Intelligence (AI), the money spent on cable systems is expected to increase a lot. It is predicted to go from 900 million US dollars in 2023 to 15.4 billion US dollars in 2028.</p>
            <p>Cable breaks have also happened in Europe and the Red Sea. Europe has responded by spending money to create new technologies. NATO has started using AI and has sent about 50 drones under a plan called "Task Force X" to watch for threats in the Baltic Sea. They are also thinking about doing something similar in the North Sea. NATO has also invested in a company that makes robots which can go underwater and use 3D printing to fix broken cables.</p>
