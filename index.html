            <h1>Video Shows Syrian Soldiers Killing Medical Volunteer, Calls for New Investigation</h1>
            <p>A video from a security camera has been seen today. It shows Syrian government soldiers killing a medical volunteer in a hospital. After this, human rights workers in Syria are asking again for a separate investigation into the violent events that happened last month in Sweida city.</p>
            <p>News reports say that a group that watches wars mentioned fights. These fights started between Druze and Bedouin groups on July 13 in Sweida city, which is mainly Druze. As outside groups got involved, the violence quickly became worse. The events continued for a week. In the end, about 1400 people died. Many of them were Druze civilians.</p>
            <p>Syrian officials said that the government army got involved to stop the fighting. But people who saw it happen, Druze groups, and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the army worked with the Bedouin people. They also said the army treated Druze people badly, even killing some without a proper trial.</p>
            <p>Before this, many cruel videos were shared on social media. Some of these videos showed people wearing army or security force uniforms killing civilians.</p>
            <p>Today, a Syrian news website called Suwayda 24 shared a video from a security camera. It is said to be from a large hospital in Sweida city on July 16. The video shows a group of people, who seem to be staff, sitting on the floor in a hallway. Several armed people are standing in front of them. Most of these armed people are wearing army clothes. One of them is wearing a uniform from the Ministry of Interior.</p>
            <p>The report says that the armed people briefly fought with a man. Suwayda 24 said that this man was "one of the volunteers from the medical team."</p>
            <p>The armed people then shot the man. He died, and they pulled his body away. There was blood left on the floor.</p>
            <p>Syrian officials have not said anything about this yet.</p>
            <p>A 30-year-old man who appeared in the video told news reporters by phone that "this event happened on July 16." A doctor from the hospital also told news reporters, without giving their name, that the video was taken inside the hospital.</p>

            <h1>Police Find 13 Tons of Stolen Wood on Private Land, Man Arrested</h1>
            <p>The Seventh Peace Preservation Corps reported today that police found a large amount of valuable wood that belongs to the government hidden on private land in Daxi District, Taoyuan City. A man named Li was asked to come and explain. However, his story about where the wood came from was clearly not true. So, he was sent to court for possibly breaking the forestry law, stealing, and holding stolen goods.</p>
            <p>Xu Xiang-wei, who is a deputy leader of the Fifth Brigade of the Seventh Peace Preservation Corps, said that in February, they received a message. This message was from the Daxi office of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency and the Daxi Police Department in Taoyuan City. It said that a lot of wood, which might be stolen, was hidden on private land in Daxi District. A special team was immediately made to look into it.</p>
            <p>The special team first found out who owned the land. They checked records and talked to people living nearby. Also, staff from the Hsinchu office looked at the wood at the place and identified what kind it was and how big it was. Then, they checked if there were any records of this type of wood being sold in past years. They believed that the wood was most likely stolen. So, they quickly asked for a search warrant and went to find the wood.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Peace Preservation Corps asked the suspect, Mr. Li, to come and explain the situation. For the wood's origin, Mr. Li only showed papers for moving driftwood. But after looking at it with staff from the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, they found that the wood's size and weight did not fit the rules for collecting driftwood. This clearly showed that his story was not true.</p>
            <p>The Fifth Brigade stated that they seized 60 pieces of Taiwan cypress wood and 12 pieces of red cypress wood from the location. The total weight was more than 13,000 kilograms. The estimated value in the market is about 1.5 million New Taiwan Dollars. The whole case has been sent to the Taoyuan District Prosecutor's Office. The man is suspected of breaking the forestry law and laws against stealing and taking things that are not yours.</p>
            <p>The Seventh Peace Preservation Corps pointed out that after natural disasters, if driftwood flows outside of areas owned by the government, local city and county governments will announce certain areas. People living in those areas can then collect the driftwood. People who collect driftwood must follow what the announcement says. If a person does not live in the area or does not follow the rules for where and when to collect, they could still break the forestry law and other criminal laws.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Day to Debut with Nationals on August 30, Featuring Rakuten Girls and Taiwanese Culture</h1>
            <p>The Washington Nationals baseball team will have its first "Taiwan Day" event on August 30. This is the first time the Taiwan Millennium Generation Youth Foundation (MGY) has officially worked with the team for this event. It will include performances by the Rakuten Girls, who are cheerleaders from Taiwan's Rakuten Monkeys baseball team. There will also be performances by San Tai Zi (a traditional Taiwanese character) and cultural booths. The goal is to bring a lot of Taiwanese culture to Washington D.C., the capital of the United States.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Day" event is being organized by the MGY Foundation and the Nationals team. Last year, they held a smaller test event. This year, it is much bigger, and 1000 special ticket packages have been sold. The people organizing the event said today that they have added more parts about culture. They hope that by using sports events, they can share Taiwanese culture and help more people learn about Taiwan.</p>
            <p>On the day of the event, eight members of the Rakuten Girls cheerleading team, from the Rakuten Monkeys team in Taiwan's professional baseball league, will perform. Their names are Linda, Ying-le, Dai-ying, Xiao Zi, Yun-xi, Ga-lin, Ruo-tong, and Ququ. They will show five different styles of Taiwanese cheering.</p>
            <p>Tang Bo-yu, the person who started the MGY Foundation, said, "Taiwan and America both have a strong love for baseball, but the ways of cheering are very different. We hope American fans can truly feel this special atmosphere."</p>
            <p>Also, the Nationals team's special group that interacts with fans, called Nats Pack, and their famous "Racing Presidents" race will also include Taiwanese parts. For the first time, the San Tai Zi character will join the Racing Presidents. This will create a fun scene that mixes Taiwanese and American cultures.</p>
            <p>For cultural shows, before the game, there will be a San Tai Zi team, diabolo (Chinese yo-yo) performers, and a music band playing Taiwanese songs. There will also be booths with classic Taiwanese food and culture at the event. These booths will offer fun activities like writing with a brush and getting fortunes with special blocks called "Jiaobei." People who do not buy a ticket for the game can also join these activities.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Nationals' Taiwan Day was a trial event. They first planned to sell 300 tickets but ended up selling 600. Hou Li-chen, who is the main organizer of the Taiwan Day event, said, "The baseball team also said it was one of the test events that sold the best tickets ever. Because of this, they were very keen to work together again."</p>
            <p>Bai Yue-chu, the president of the North American Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, said, "There are Taiwan Day events in many places in America. We hope to work with more local Taiwanese groups in the future to make Taiwan Day an event that happens every year."</p>
            <p>MGY also shared that they are planning a "Taiwan Night" event in the NBA. They want to create regular Taiwanese events to bring the spirit of Taiwan into the main parts of American society.</p>
            <p>MGY is made up of Taiwanese people who live in Washington D.C. They work hard to share different cultures and want to build relationships with many other groups of people.</p>
