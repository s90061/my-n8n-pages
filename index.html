            <h1>US Government Might Close Again; Asian Stocks Show Mixed Results</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong, September 30 (AFP) â€“ The US government might close down again. This could stop important economic reports from coming out. Because of this, investors are being careful. But they also think the US central bank (Fed) will lower interest rates again. So, Asian stock markets showed different results today.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the Fed already lowered interest rates this month, for the first time since December last year. Recent important economic signs from the US make investors think interest rates will be lowered two more times this year.</p>
            <p>This week, several reports about the US job market will come out. These include new job openings, new hires by private companies, and how many people have non-farm jobs in September. Experts believe these reports will show that the job market is slowing down. This would allow Fed officials to relax money policies more.</p>
            <p>However, investors are worried. If the US Republican and Democratic parties cannot agree on government money by midnight today, some economic reports might be delayed.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, leaders from both parties in the US Congress met with President Donald Trump to try and solve the problem. But after the meeting, Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, told reporters that the two sides still have "big differences."</p>
            <p>Asian stock markets started higher today, continuing yesterday's gains. But some markets could not keep going up.</p>
            <p>China reported today that its manufacturing activity went down for the sixth month in a row. However, the Shanghai stock market still closed up by 0.5%. The Hong Kong stock market also finished up by 0.9%. Markets in Taipei, Singapore, and Wellington also closed higher.</p>
            <p>But the Tokyo stock market closed down by 0.3%. Markets in Sydney, Seoul, Manila, Bangkok, and Jakarta also closed lower.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei Woman Accused of Threatening Internet Friend Over Unpaid Travel Costs</h1>
            <p>New Taipei, September 30 (CNA) â€“ A woman from New Taipei City went on a trip with someone she met online. She was unhappy because the internet friend did not pay for the trip. She is accused of threatening the friend, saying things like "I'll make your life hard" and "I've already called people." She also threatened to accuse him of sexual assault if he did not pay her back. The New Taipei District Prosecutors Office recently charged her with threatening public safety.</p>
            <p>According to the court papers, a woman named Lin met a man also named Lin online. They decided to travel to Taichung together. Late at night on May 23 this year, when they returned to Ms. Lin's home in Xinzhuang District, New Taipei, Ms. Lin was upset that the man did not pay for the trip. She asked him to pay, or she would report him to the police for sexual assault. She also said, "If you try to run away, I will tell my father to deal with you right away."</p>
            <p>After this, Ms. Lin sent many LINE messages to the man. She said, "I will make your life in Taichung difficult; give me back the money I spent," and "I have already called people." The man became afraid. He reported her to the Xinzhuang police station in New Taipei City. He believed Ms. Lin was trying to get money by threatening him and would not let him leave her home. He thought she had committed crimes like threatening public safety, attempted extortion, and false imprisonment.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor's office recently charged Ms. Lin with threatening public safety. Regarding the accusation of attempted extortion, the prosecutor stated that Ms. Lin demanded money for the trip because she was unhappy that she had paid for everything. It is difficult to say that she planned to illegally take money. So, her actions did not meet the requirements for the crime of extortion.</p>
            <p>For the false imprisonment charge, Ms. Lin's ex-boyfriend said that he rented Ms. Lin's home in Xinzhuang. He said the man could come and go freely and use his phone while he was there. So, it is difficult to believe the man's story that his movements were limited.</p>
