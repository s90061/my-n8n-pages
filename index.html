            <h1>US Media: Trump Wants US Military to Get Ready to Fight Latin American Drug Groups</h1>
            <p>US media reported today that President Trump is getting ready to use military force against several drug groups in Latin America. This comes after Washington called these drug groups "terrorist organizations" earlier this year.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said that Trump has told the Pentagon to get ready to start fighting drug groups that are seen as terrorist organizations. The Wall Street Journal reported that Trump ordered the Pentagon to prepare several possible plans for action.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal also mentioned that using special forces and giving intelligence support are some of the things being discussed. Any actions would be done together with foreign partners.</p>
            <p>White House spokesperson Anna Kelly did not confirm these reports. But in a statement, she said that Trump's main goal is to protect national security. This is why he took strong steps to name several drug groups and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations.</p>
            <p>In February this year, the US named Venezuela's "Tren de Aragua," Mexico's "Sinaloa Cartel," and six other Latin American drug groups as terrorist organizations.</p>
            <p>After that, the Trump government also called Venezuela's "Cartel of the Suns" a terrorist organization. This group is said to have smuggled hundreds of tons of drugs into the US for more than 20 years.</p>
            <p>On January 20, Trump signed an order on his first day back in the White House. This order set up a way to name such groups. He said that these drug groups "threaten national security more than traditional organized crime."</p>
            <p>After media reports said the US might take military action against drug groups, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said today that "no invasion of our country will be allowed."</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum is trying her best to show Trump that she is acting against Mexican drug organizations. Trump has accused these groups of smuggling a lot of drugs, especially fentanyl, into the US.</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum stated, "We are working together and cooperating, but no invasion will be allowed. This is absolutely out of the question."</p>
            <p>Sheinbaum said at her morning press conference that she would carefully look at Trump's order. She also said she was promised that US troops would not be on Mexican land.</p>

            <h1>Germany Approves Plan to Speed Up CCS Building, Hopes to Balance Net Zero and High-Carbon Industries</h1>
            <p>Germany's government has approved a new plan. This plan will help build more infrastructure for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS quickly). Germany wants to stop adding carbon to the air by the end of 2045. At the same time, it wants to keep some industries that are hard to make carbon-free.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology takes carbon dioxide from industrial processes or removes it from the air. Then, it stores the carbon dioxide underground.</p>
            <p>Industries that are hard to make carbon-free, like those making cement and lime, and gas power plants, will be allowed to store carbon dioxide under the seabed offshore. They can also store it inland if the individual states agree.</p>
            <p>The plan approved by the German government on the 6th says that building and running carbon dioxide storage facilities and related pipelines are important for public good. It will also make the planning and approval process simpler.</p>
            <p>The previous three-party government tried to make rules for CCS technology, but they did not pass before it ended in November last year. This new plan is more ambitious than the old one.</p>
            <p>Based on the new plan, existing natural gas pipelines can be changed to carry carbon dioxide instead of natural gas. This will reduce the need to build new pipelines.</p>
            <p>Also, the government can take private land to build pipelines for carbon dioxide. They must pay for the land according to the law.</p>
            <p>Geologically, Germany can store about 1.5 billion to 8.3 billion tons of carbon under the North Sea, which they control. They can store up to about 20 million tons each year.</p>

            <h1>Putin Prefers UAE for Trump Meeting; US Media Reveals Secret US-Russia Ceasefire Talks</h1>
            <p>US media, quoting people with knowledge of the matter, said that the US and Russia are trying to reach an agreement to stop the war in Ukraine. This agreement would let Russia keep the land it took from Ukraine. Russia also said that its President Putin wants to meet with US President Trump in the United Arab Emirates.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News, quoting people who did not want to be named, reported that US and Russian officials are talking about issues like Russian-held lands. This is to prepare for a meeting between Trump and Putin, possibly next week. The US is trying hard to make Ukraine and its European allies accept this deal, but it is not sure if they will.</p>
            <p>Putin wants Ukraine to give up the whole Donbas region in eastern Ukraine to Russia. He also wants Ukraine to accept that Russia took Crimea in 2014. This means Ukrainian troops, who still control parts of Luhansk and Donetsk, would have to leave. It would be like giving up land that Russian forces have not yet taken.</p>
            <p>People with knowledge of the talks said that based on the current terms being discussed by the US and Russia, Russia would stop fighting along the current front lines in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. These sources said that the agreement is not final and could change at any time. It is not clear if Russia will leave parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that they have already taken. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is in the area controlled by Russia.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that Putin today confirmed his plan to meet with Trump. He said that the United Arab Emirates would be a good place for the meeting. Putin met with UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan in Moscow today.</p>
            <p>Earlier on the 8th, a White House official, who did not want to be named, said that Trump would only talk with Putin if Putin agreed to meet with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy. On the same day, Putin said it was not the right time to meet Zelenskyy.</p>
            <p>Later on the 8th, Trump changed his mind. He said that Putin does not need to agree to meet Zelenskyy before meeting him. He told reporters briefly in the Oval Office, "No, he doesn't have to. They (meaning the Russians) want to meet me, and I will do everything I can to stop the killing."</p>
            <p>Since Trump was elected last year, Moscow has wanted a US-Russia agreement to end the war on Russia's terms. They have purposely left Ukraine and Europe out of these talks. The Washington Post thinks that because Trump recently spoke out against Russia's bombing of Ukrainian cities and called Putin "crazy," a meeting between them now would be a big diplomatic change for Putin.</p>
            <p>After avoiding pressure for a ceasefire for months, Putin might now hope to control Trump at the summit, just like in their 2018 meeting in Helsinki. At that time, Trump agreed with Putin's denial of Russia's involvement in the 2016 US election, not with the findings of US intelligence agencies.</p>
            <p>Experts who study Russia say that Putin believes he is winning the Russia-Ukraine war. They say he believes he can reach his goals, which include making Ukraine's military weaker and stopping Kyiv from joining NATO.</p>
            <p>Tatiana Stanovaya, an analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote on social media that no matter how Putin states his terms, "it is actually the same demand: Ukraine stops fighting, the West stops sending weapons, and Kyiv accepts Russia's terms, which means effectively surrendering."</p>
            <p>Some analysts have pointed out that Trump seems determined to get a ceasefire agreement at any cost.</p>
            <p>John Foreman, a former UK military official in Moscow, said that Trump is unwisely pushing for a peace deal, trying to fix a hopeless situation. However, Putin will trick him with a "deal" that actually means Ukraine surrendering. Foreman said, "You will see things happen like this: Trump is happy with flattery, Putin makes small concessions to avoid sanctions, the war continues, and finally, Russia celebrates."</p>
