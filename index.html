**"Slacking Off" Is Not Escaping: Global Central Magazine Looks at Gen Z's Values**

Gen Z, born in the late 20th century, has been called "strawberry generation" by older groups. Now, as they enter the new working world, AI has appeared, making the future more unsure. The July cover story of "Global Central" magazine, "Lying Flat Creates New Trends," looks closely at how the "lying flat" trend among Gen Z affects work, spending habits, and social life.

Young Americans are now using "micro-retirement" to balance work and life, instead of waiting until they retire to achieve their dreams. "Micro-retirement" doesn't always mean quitting your job. Some people talk with their companies about taking unpaid leave, having flexible hours, or taking short breaks from work. Others use times between jobs for "micro-retirement." These ways don't need a lot of savings and can help people change their life pace.

In China, young people prefer to take the stairs instead of the elevator to avoid small talk. When they go home from work, they order food and relax on the sofa to feel comfortable and free. They stay up late just to have some time completely for themselves. Gen Z is also leading a global trend for plush toys. More than a quarter of plush toy buyers are young people or adults who are still young at heart. In 2023, "adult collectors" bought more plush toys than preschoolers for the first time. Gen Z has experienced social isolation from the pandemic, has large student debts, and delays finding jobs. With AI now here, the future feels even more uncertain. The cover story "Lying Flat Creates New Trends" deeply analyzes how the "lying flat" trend affects Gen Z's work, spending, and social life. It also tells about the "anti-work trend" among young people in France, how South Korea's MZ generation values mental well-being in their job search, how Japanese Gen Z dislikes after-work dinners, and India's "Timepass" against society.
