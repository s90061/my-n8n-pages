            <h1>Oscar-winning actress Diane Keaton passes away at 79</h1>
            <p>American magazine "People" reported today that actress Diane Keaton has died at the age of 79. She was famous for her roles in the classic gangster movie "The Godfather" and "Annie Hall," which won her an Oscar.</p>
            <p>Her family confirmed through a spokesperson to "People" that Diane Keaton passed away in California. More details are not yet public, and her family asks for privacy.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Diane Keaton worked with director Woody Allen many times. One of their movies was "Annie Hall" in 1977. This film won Oscars for Best Actress, Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It made Diane Keaton a top actress in Hollywood and a unique fashion icon.</p>
            <p>Diane Keaton also won a BAFTA award and a Golden Globe award. After "Annie Hall," she was nominated three more times for Best Actress at the Oscars for "Reds," "Marvin's Room," and "Something's Gotta Give."</p>
            <p>Diane Keaton was born on January 5, 1946, in Los Angeles, California. She had relationships with Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, and her "Godfather" co-star Al Pacino, but she never got married.</p>

            <h1>News of Nobel Peace Prize winner possibly leaked, association worries about spying</h1>
            <p>The Norwegian Nobel Institute told Norwegian media today that the news about the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Maria Corina Machado, might have been leaked early. They believe it was "very likely" an act of spying.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that on the betting website Polymarket, the chances for Machado to win the Peace Prize quickly went up from 3.75% to almost 73%. This happened between the evening of October 9th and early morning of October 10th. The winner was officially announced just a few hours later.</p>
            <p>However, no experts or media had said Machado was likely to win at that time.</p>
            <p>Kristian Berg Harpviken, who is the head of the Norwegian Nobel Institute and secretary of the Nobel Committee, told Norwegian TV channel TV2, "It's very likely a spying operation."</p>
            <p>But the day before, Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told the Norwegian news agency NTB that he did not think Machado's name was leaked. He said, "I don't think there has ever been a leak in the history of the Peace Prize, and I find it hard to imagine it happening."</p>
            <p>Still, Harpviken said that the institute will look into the matter carefully. They will "strengthen their security measures if needed."</p>
            <p>Harpviken explained that spying "could make people think that someone inside purposely leaked information, but this is unlikely to be true." He added, "We cannot be 100% sure yet, but it's no secret that the Nobel Institute has been a target for spies."</p>
            <p>"Clearly, this institute has always been interesting to some people who want to get information. These people could be countries or other groups. Their reasons could be political or financial."</p>
            <p>He said, "This kind of activity has been happening for decades."</p>
            <p>Harpviken did not answer questions from Agence France-Presse.</p>
            <p>Only a very small number of people know the winner chosen by the five members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee beforehand.</p>
            <p>In the past, Norwegian media sometimes announced unexpected winners early. This made people wonder if there were leaks. However, this has not happened in recent years.</p>
            <p>Machado is a leader of the opposition in Venezuela. The government stopped her from running in the 2024 election. She won this Peace Prize because the committee praised her for "tirelessly working for democratic rights in Venezuela and trying to change the country peacefully from a dictatorship to a democracy."</p>

            <h1>Biden is receiving radiation and hormone therapy to fight aggressive prostate cancer</h1>
            <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden is getting radiation treatment and hormone therapy. This is to fight prostate cancer that he was diagnosed with in May this year.</p>
            <p>Biden's spokesperson said, "President Biden is currently receiving radiation treatment and hormone therapy. This is part of his plan to treat prostate cancer."</p>
            <p>In May this year, Biden's office announced that the 82-year-old former president went to the doctor because of problems with his urinary system. Doctors found a lump in his prostate. He was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer, and the cancer cells had spread to his bones.</p>
            <p>At that time, Biden wrote on social media platform X, "Cancer affects all of us. Like many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in our broken places. Thank you for your love and support."</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society says that prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, especially older men. Studies guess that about 80% of men over 80 years old have cancer cells in their prostate.</p>
            <p>The American Cancer Society also said that if prostate cancer is found early, it can often be cured. However, it is still the second leading cause of cancer death for men.</p>
            <p>Hormone therapy is a common way to treat it. It can make tumors smaller and slow down cancer growth, but it cannot cure the cancer completely.</p>
