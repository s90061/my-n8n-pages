            <h1>Recruiters Complain Salary Adjustment Undecided, Difficult to Promote. Army: Based on Actual Current Payments</h1>
            <p>Some army recruiters wrote on social media. They said that a new rule about soldiers' pay was passed by the parliament. This rule would give volunteer soldiers an extra payment of NT$30,000. But the money for this has not been put into next year's budget yet. This makes it hard to encourage people to join the army.</p>
            <p>The army said today that all information about salaries and benefits for new recruits must be about what is actually paid or happening now.</p>
            <p>An army officer, who seemed to be a recruiter, wrote on 'Threads' social media. They said that even though the parliament passed the 'Soldier's Pay Act' in June this year to increase volunteer pay to NT$30,000, the government did not include this money in the national budget for 2027 when it was approved on August 21. This makes it difficult to recruit people and has caused questions from the public.</p>
            <p>The Army Headquarters sent out a press release in the evening. It said that all information used for recruiting about pay, benefits, and welfare should be based on what is actually given or happening. They have asked all levels to check their recruitment materials. If any materials use wrong information, they must correct them right away and explain clearly to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

            <h1>South Africa Forces Taiwan Office to Move Out of Capital; Scholars Criticize Giving Up Power to Blindly Please Beijing</h1>
            <p>South Africa has asked Taiwan's office to move out of its capital city, Pretoria. Some experts in South Africa recently wrote that South Africa is 'giving up its power.' They said South Africa is just following Beijing without thinking and is hurting its long-lasting and strong trade relationship with Taiwan. These experts think South Africa should create its own 'One China policy' based on what is best for South Africa.</p>
            <p>Since October last year, the South African government has sent two letters asking Taiwan's office to move from Pretoria. While they were talking, the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs (DIRCO) changed the name of Taiwan's office on its website to 'Taipei Liaison Office.' They put it under 'international organizations' and changed its address to Johannesburg. Then, on July 21, they officially announced in a government paper that the two offices would be renamed 'Taipei Liaison Office in Johannesburg' and 'Taipei Liaison Office in Cape Town.'</p>
            <p>Greg Mills, who used to be in charge of a South African think tank called the Brenthurst Foundation, and Ray Hartley, a writer, wrote in the South African newspaper Daily Friend on August 17. They criticized the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They said that what South Africa did was like 'giving its power and duties to Beijing.' They believe this is not good for South Africa, but only good for Beijing. They said South Africa's policy towards Taiwan has become 'diplomatic nihilism,' which means it has no real purpose or value.</p>
            <p>Mills and Hartley explained that South Africa and Taiwan trade about 2 billion US dollars every year. South Africa sells more to Taiwan than it buys. Also, there are about 450 Taiwanese businesses in South Africa that employ around 40,000 people. These businesses help the local economy a lot. Even though China is South Africa's biggest trading partner, South Africa still has some power. China needs raw materials from South Africa and also needs different markets to sell its products. If China punishes South Africa, both sides would be hurt.</p>
            <p>The two writers pointed out that Taiwan is a democratic country. It shares the same values of freedom as South Africa. On the other hand, China is ruled by one party. It treats minority groups badly, supports Russia attacking Ukraine, and is expanding its power in the South China Sea. China's values are very different from the rules of law, constitutional government, and free press that South Africa's constitution upholds. They said, 'Most Western countries see Beijing as a danger, but South Africa has become a partner in defending Russia's attacks.'</p>
            <p>They also said that if South Africa stands with China, it will face more pressure in its long-term relationships with other countries and in trade. The South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs has given its important decisions to Beijing. This means it is no longer truly showing South Africa's independence.</p>
            <p>Moreover, the two writers compared the relationship between Taiwan and the Czech Republic with the relationship between Taiwan and South Africa. They believe that 'South Africa needs its own One China policy.' The Czech Republic has a foreign policy that focuses on its own country's interests. It builds stronger trade and political ties with Taiwan based on democratic values. The Czech Republic does not give in to Beijing on issues like trade, politics, and human rights. This shows that their foreign policy is based on their values.</p>
            <p>Regarding China's unhappiness about the Czech Republic's friendship with Taiwan, the writers said that the Czech Republic has actually not lost money by working more closely with Taiwan. In fact, as European Parliament member JiÅ™Ã­ PospÃ­Å¡il said, Taiwan invests many times more money in the Czech Republic than China does. Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, has even created more than 5,000 jobs in the Czech Republic, making it the 6th largest company there. Taiwan and the Czech Republic have also recently started talking about working together on howitzers, military transport equipment, and drones. This shows that their relationship is very important strategically.</p>

            <h1>Trump to Fight Crime and Immigration, Plans to Send Thousands of National Guard to Chicago</h1>
            <p>News in the United States says that President Trump's government has been planning to send National Guard soldiers to Chicago in recent weeks. This is to help fight crime and problems with immigrants more effectively.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post newspaper reported, citing officials who did not want to be named, that the US Department of Defense is already making plans. They might send thousands of National Guard soldiers to Chicago, the third-largest city in the United States, as early as September. The Department of Defense did not want to confirm this report.</p>
            <p>This month, Donald Trump has already sent National Guard soldiers to Washington D.C., the capital. Some defense officials said that the National Guard in Washington D.C. will soon carry weapons.</p>
            <p>On August 22, Trump said he would do similar things in big cities like Chicago and New York, which are led by Democratic politicians. He told reporters at the White House, 'We will make our cities very, very safe. I think Chicago will be our next target, and then we will help New York.'</p>
            <p>Several sources, who did not want to be named, told CNN that the plan for Chicago might be like what Trump did in Los Angeles in June. That action caused some disagreement. At that time, Trump sent 4,000 California National Guard soldiers and 700 active-duty Marines, even though the California government did not agree.</p>
            <p>The plan to send National Guard to Chicago would also help the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in their bigger efforts to find and deal with immigrants who do not have legal papers.</p>
            <p>The governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, and the mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, are both Democrats. They strongly do not agree with this idea.</p>
            <p>Pritzker wrote on social media platform X, 'Trump and the 'Make America Great Again' (MAGA) Republicans try to make their party look like the party of 'law and order.' This is very far from the truth.'</p>
            <p>Johnson also said that the Chicago city government has not received any official information from Trump's government about sending soldiers. He called such actions 'not planned well, not needed, and not acceptable.'</p>
            <p>According to police numbers in Chicago, there were 573 murders in the city in 2024. This is 8% less than in 2023.</p>
