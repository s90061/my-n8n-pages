Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the art world, allowing people to create images from text prompts. However, this new technology has created a complex legal problem: who owns the copyright to AI-generated images?

Experts are unsure. Current copyright law generally protects creations made by humans. But if an AI creates an image, does the AI company own it? Does the person who typed in the prompt? Or is it in the public domain?

The lack of clear answers makes things difficult for artists and businesses. Artists worry their style might be copied by AI, while companies using AI-generated images risk legal issues. The courts will likely have to decide these questions. Until then, using AI to create art remains a risky business.

**The Rise of 'Quiet Quitting': Why Workers Are Only Doing What's Required**

A new trend called "quiet quitting" is gaining popularity, particularly among younger workers. It doesn't mean actually quitting a job, but rather doing the bare minimum required and nothing more. Workers who are "quiet quitting" are fulfilling their job descriptions but avoiding extra tasks or going above and beyond.

Several factors contribute to this trend. Burnout is a major one, with many employees feeling overworked and underappreciated. Others feel that extra effort isn't rewarded with promotions or raises, leading them to disengage. Some view it as a way to establish boundaries and protect their mental health.

While some employers may worry about productivity, others see it as a sign that they need to improve working conditions and employee engagement. It's a wake-up call for companies to create a more supportive and rewarding work environment.
