            <h1>Taiwanese Companies Go to Asia Medical Device Exhibition, Smart Healthcare Shows Supply Chain Strength</h1>
            <p>The three-day Asia Medical Device Exhibition started today in Bangkok. More than 1,000 companies from over 40 countries are showing their products. The Taiwan group has 112 companies and organizations, making it the second-largest group at the exhibition. Most Taiwanese companies are showing smart healthcare and medical equipment. They are showing how they use AI and digital changes in healthcare, which highlights Taiwan's varied medical industry.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) said that the Asia Medical Device Exhibition is one of the most important medical industry shows in Southeast Asia. It happens every year, changing between Singapore and Thailand. Last year in Singapore, it attracted visitors from 60 countries and over 10,000 buyers.</p>
            <p>This year, the exhibition is in Thailand. Taiwan has 112 companies and groups taking part, making it the second-largest country showing products. Companies like e-Da Medical, Plex Bio, and Chang Gung Medical are there. The organizers said that the exhibition space has grown by 16% this year, showing high demand for joining.</p>
            <p>TAITRA stated that the exhibition not only focuses on different kinds of medical equipment but also looks at topics like the aging population, new technology, and the medical manufacturing supply chain. It is an important event for Taiwanese companies looking to enter the markets in Thailand and Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>The Taiwanese companies at the exhibition mostly focus on smart healthcare and equipment. There are also companies that make bone products, biotechnology items, contract manufacturing, rehabilitation products, and accessories. Smart medical products include smart healthcare solutions and AI tools that help doctors find problems like osteoporosis, lung cancer, and chest issues. Equipment includes hospital beds, oxygen machines, ultrasound machines, operating tables, and surgical lights.</p>
            <p>Li Wen-cheng, director of TAITRA's Marketing Project Department, said that Taiwan cares a lot about Thailand and all of Southeast Asia. He hopes this exhibition in Thailand will help Taiwanese companies sell their products throughout Southeast Asia.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that they are focusing on Thailand first. By working with Thai companies, they hope to grow into other Southeast Asian countries. This is because "Thailand is a leader in health and medical tourism, and it also has strong goals."</p>
            <p>Wang Min-liang, CEO of Taiwan Surgical AR, a company showing its AR surgical guidance system, said, "Our smart glasses use mixed reality (MR) to let doctors clearly see where to cut and how deep. Hospitals in Thailand are already using them."</p>
            <p>He also told CNA that in the past, doctors spent a lot of time finding the right place on a patient's spine during surgery. With this system, doctors can wear smart glasses and perform surgery more accurately.</p>
            <p>Another company, Geen Smart, helps hospitals combine their digital systems. Li Ding-yuan, a senior sales manager, said, "The biggest problem hospitals have with digital integration is that data formats are not the same. So, we want to help hospitals build data records, combine hardware, AI software, and data management systems." This helps hospitals become digital and use smart healthcare.</p>
            <p>In the exhibition area, there are also many medical products made for an aging population. For example, Cai Feng Zhi Hui, which develops smart diagnostic support systems, is showing software that uses X-ray images to automatically find signs of degenerative arthritis. This software can help doctors diagnose and track chronic bone diseases in older people.</p>
            <p>Marketing manager Wu Chang-jung added that using X-ray machines with AI diagnostic software can greatly reduce the time it takes to check for osteoporosis.</p>
            <p>Also, the smart medicine cabinet created by Wise Information System was very popular with many buyers. Yu Chin-shu, the general manager, told CNA that medicine safety is an important issue for all hospitals. Their smart medicine cabinet can control how medicines are taken out. For example, medicine stock, how medicine is used, and related records can all be watched and automatically reported, making medicine use safer.</p>
            <p>He added that high-end hospitals in Thailand are possible customers. He explained, "Thailand's higher-class hospitals need to meet international standards. They cannot use traditional keys to control medicines because this does not keep records and can make using medicine dangerous."</p>

            <h1>University Student Who Uses Phone for a Long Time Has Headaches and Stiff Neck, Her Spine is Like a 60-Year-Old</h1>
            <p>A female university student used her phone for a long time and had headaches and a stiff, sore neck. An X-ray showed that the curve in her neck spine was gone, and it was straight and stiff, like a 60-year-old person's neck. A doctor at Yuanrong Hospital said this is called "phone neck" and suggested ways to reduce the harm, such as holding the phone at eye level.</p>
            <p>Ye Zong-xun, the head of the Neurology Department at Yuanrong Hospital, said in a news release today that a 20-year-old female university student recently came to see him. She said she had headaches for a long time and her neck was as stiff as a rock. A neurological check showed nothing clearly wrong, but an X-ray showed that the curve in her neck spine was gone and it was straight and stiff. It even showed some slipping, which means her neck spine was aging too fast.</p>
            <p>Ye Zong-xun explained that a healthy neck spine should have a natural C-shape curve. This curve helps spread the weight of the head and the pressure from movement, acting like a natural shock absorber. This patient used her phone for a long time, watching shows, and often lay in bed with her phone until she fell asleep. Her poor sleeping position caused her neck spine to be under too much pressure for a long time, leading to changes and aging.</p>
            <p>Ye Zong-xun said that many people do not realize how harmful looking down can be. A person's head weighs about 3 to 4 kilograms. When you tilt your head forward, the pressure on your neck spine increases a lot. If you look down 15 degrees, your neck carries about 12 kilograms. If you look down 30 degrees, it's about 18 kilograms. Looking down 60 degrees is a common way people use their phones, and at this angle, the neck carries a huge 27 kilograms, which is like having a child hanging from your neck.</p>
            <p>The doctor also said that bad posture for a long time puts constant pressure on the neck spine and the muscles around it. This affects how nerves in the neck work, causing symptoms like headaches, numb hands, and dizziness. Problems like neck spine aging or a slipped disk can also get worse quickly because of bad posture, which can press on the spinal cord or nerves.</p>
            <p>Ye Zong-xun suggested that people should keep the natural curve of their neck and do neck and shoulder stretches regularly. For example, raise your phone or computer screen to be at eye level to avoid looking down for long periods. After looking down for 30 minutes, take a 5-minute break to stand up, move your shoulders and neck, and look into the distance. Stand with your whole body against a wall, pull your chin back straight, and gently touch the back of your head to the wall for 10 seconds. Repeat this several times to make your deep neck muscles stronger.</p>

            <h1>When Disasters Can Be Predicted, Hong Zi-Xuan's "96 Minutes" Uses Hollywood Technology to Improve Filming</h1>
            <p>A good movie needs many people to work together. Besides the actors who are in front of the camera, the work of the people behind the scenes is also very important and should be recognized. The Central News Agency (CNA) has a special series called "Behind-the-Scenes Heroes," which shares the stories of these heroes every Wednesday.</p>
            <p>(CNA reporter Wang Hsin-yi in Taipei on September 10) What if disasters could be "predicted"? This means that things like a high-speed train bomb being removed, people jumping off a train, and buildings exploding in Xinyi District can all be practiced beforehand. Hong Zi-xuan, the director of "96 Minutes," brought in Hollywood's Previs system. This system solves possible filming problems before they happen, opening new ways to make movies.</p>
            <p>"96 Minutes" is a new movie by director Hong Zi-xuan, who also directed "The Scoundrels." It is the first high-speed train disaster action movie in Taiwan's film history. Hong Zi-xuan told CNA in an interview that he spent 10 years getting the script ready. This time, he used the Previs (Previsualization, which is like practicing special effects filming) and Unreal Engine systems, which are widely used in Hollywood. From the very beginning when the script was being written, action actors practiced fight scenes on the high-speed train and crowd escape scenes. This helped to solve problems before the disaster filming even started.</p>
            <p>Hong Zi-xuan shared that the film crew brought in parts from Japan to build a high-speed train car. When they used Previs to practice, they involved the action design, art, photography, and special effects teams to discuss everything. For example, for a scene in the conductor's room, they found during practice that the camera could not fit. But the space in the shot already looked too big, which would make the audience feel like it wasn't real. So, they asked the team to design walls or windows that could be taken apart. This greatly reduced the time spent trying different things on set.</p>
            <p>Actors Lin Po-hung, Tsai Fan-hsi, and Li Li-jen have intense fight scenes in the movie. However, the high-speed train aisle is already narrow, and it's even harder with many background actors and staff. Hong Zi-xuan said that Previs also helped a lot. They first designed the actions specifically for the space. The art team changed the size of the train car and made parts that could be taken apart. "Many small details needed to be handled well so the actors felt safe. Only then could they make these actions automatic, knowing what to do next. We had to reach this level before filming. Otherwise, if everyone is worried and scared, you can't film anything."</p>
            <p>"96 Minutes" uses a lot of special effects. Producer Tsou Chieh-chung admitted that filming on Xinyi District streets was real, but the exploding, burning building was actually fake. The film crew invited Wen Chao-ming, who worked on movies like "Avengers: Infinity War" and "Aquaman," to be the special effects director. This helped them mix real scenes with computer-generated ones very well.</p>
            <p>Hong Zi-xuan pointed out that special effects are not perfect just by being super realistic. "You also need to think about the visual style. It's very important how to make the special effects shots fit perfectly with the realistic shots, and even make them better!"</p>
            <p>Hong Zi-xuan gave an example: Wen Chao-ming is good at special effects shots with dynamic explosions and strong crashes, which are used a lot in the movie. "Sometimes, a little too much special effect can make it too dramatic, too much like a comic book. A little too little makes it not quite enough. This really tests the special effects director's artistic sense."</p>
            <p>Although many countries have made action movies on trains, Hong Zi-xuan believes that "96 Minutes" is Taiwan's first step. If people talk about similar types of movies in the future, this movie will let the world know that Taiwan also makes such films.</p>
