**Trump May Look into Deporting Elon Musk and His Subsidies**

US President Donald Trump said today he might think about deporting Elon Musk, a rich businessman from South Africa. Musk had said bad things about Trump's plan for government spending.

When reporters asked Trump if he would deport Musk, Trump said, "I don't know. We will look into it."

Last year, Elon Musk, who is the richest person in the world, gave a lot of money to Trump's campaign for president. When Trump became president, Musk also led a new department called the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) until the end of May.

In June, Musk and Trump had a public fight about Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

In the last few days, Musk again said that Republican politicians are not trying hard enough to make the US a leader in electric cars and clean energy. He also said that if the US Congress passes the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," he will start a new political party called the "America Party."

Trump also said today that the Department of Government Efficiency might look into how much money Musk's companies, Tesla (which makes electric cars) and SpaceX (which makes rockets), received from the US government.

Trump said, "We might have to let the Department of Government Efficiency look into Elon. Do you know what the Department of Government Efficiency is? It's a huge thing, and it might turn around and cause problems for Elon."

Trump believes Musk is criticizing the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" because it will stop giving money to electric car companies. Trump warned, "He (Musk) is losing his electric car benefits, and he is very upset about this... but he might lose much, much more. I can tell you now, Elon might lose more than just this."

Last night, Trump wrote similar things on his social media website, Truth Social. He wrote, "If Elon doesn't get government money, he might have to close his businesses and go back to his home in South Africa."

**NBA Star SGA Signs Huge Deal, Highest Salary Ever**

ESPN reported today that Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (SGA), a top player for the NBA's Thunder team, has agreed to a new contract. It's a "super max" deal for 4 years and $285 million. This makes his yearly salary the highest in the history of the NBA.

Yahoo Sports said that SGA will earn $71.25 million each year on average. This breaks the record for the highest yearly salary in the NBA.

His new contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder will begin in the 2027-28 season. It will keep him with the team until the 2030-31 season.

SGA is 26 years old and from Canada. In the 2024-25 season, he scored the most points in the league, averaging 32.7 points per game. He also averaged 51.9% shooting success, 6.4 assists, 5 rebounds, 1.7 steals, and 1 block. This is his third year in a row scoring more than 30 points per game.

In the recent 7-game NBA Finals, SGA also played very well, scoring an average of 30.3 points. He helped the Thunder win the NBA championship and was named the Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).

Because of this, he is the first player since LeBron James in the 2012-2013 season to win both the league's MVP award and the Finals MVP award in the same year.
