            <h1>Akio Toyoda: Taiwan Can Grow Racing Culture, Hydrogen Cars Are the Future</h1>
            <p>Akio Toyoda, the chairman of TOYOTA, said today that Taiwan's racing culture can grow a lot. He mentioned that racing in Taiwan and the fans have "waited a long time" for this. Speaking about the future of hydrogen-powered cars, Akio Toyoda stated that hydrogen cars represent the future and will have many uses. The TOYOTA group wants to work with its suppliers to build these future hydrogen cars.</p>
            <p>The TOYOTA GAZOO Racing Corolla Cup 2025 race continued today in Taichung, and Akio Toyoda was there again. He also spoke with reporters. When asked about Taiwan's racing culture, Akio Toyoda said that racing in Taiwan and other parts of Asia will become more popular. He saw how excited Taiwanese people were to join this event, which shows that Taiwan's racing and car fans have "waited a long time."</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda suggested that besides track races, Taiwan could try endurance races and other events in the future. They could also work with top Japanese drivers to compete on the world stage.</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda explained that car companies alone cannot create a strong racing culture by just training drivers. Everyone in society needs to work together to improve the infrastructure. Only then can the racing culture become stronger and help train more racing talents. Data from race tracks can also encourage car companies to make better new car models.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked why he has been appearing in Taiwan so often recently. Akio Toyoda said he used to be the head of Toyota Asia and visited many Asian countries, including Taiwan. He feels "a special connection" to Taiwan. He joked that he was "a bit surprised" to see so many people pay to attend and show such great interest in this event.</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda noted that as the chairman of a big international car company, some people might wonder why he opens new sales points or stores in different places. Akio Toyoda replied that besides being the chairman, he is also MORIZO, a racer who loves cars very much and has a special passion for racing. MORIZO is the name Akio Toyoda uses when he participates in racing events.</p>
            <p>Talking about the future of hydrogen fuel cell cars, Akio Toyoda said that hydrogen cars will have many uses in the future. From a racer's point of view, hydrogen cars represent what is coming next.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that building a car engine involves tens of thousands of parts, and many companies must work together. Electric cars might need one-third fewer parts, which could affect the jobs of workers in one-third of the car parts factories.</p>
            <p>Akio Toyoda said he is thinking of a way to work with companies that make parts for cars to develop hydrogen fuel cell cars together. He explained that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and small car parts companies are all very important for the car industry. He hopes to work with the supply chain to build hydrogen cars that represent the future.</p>

            <h1>Chenghuang Culture Association Raises Money for 20,000 Lunchboxes, Already Sent 7,500 to Hualien</h1>
            <p>The Matian Creek dam in Hualien County overflowed, causing great damage to Guangfu Township. The Chinese Chenghuang Culture Association collected money for 20,000 lunchboxes. They asked restaurants in Hualien City to make and send them to the disaster area. In the last three days, they have sent 7,500 lunchboxes. They will continue to provide help to the affected area as needed.</p>
            <p>According to the Hualien County Government, the disaster has caused 17 deaths, 110 injuries, and 7 people are still missing. Many areas in Guangfu Township are covered in a thick layer of black mud. Many people have volunteered as "shovel superheroes" to help clean up homes in the disaster area. Cities and counties like Keelung, New Taipei, and Yilan have also sent people and machines to help Hualien.</p>
            <p>Guo Shen-liang, the secretary-general of the Chinese Chenghuang Culture Association, said today that they learned from the Hualien Chenghuang Temple that the disaster area urgently needed lunchboxes. They immediately formed a special team. Because time was short, they first asked the Taiwan Province Chenghuang Temple, Songshan Xiahai Chenghuang Temple, Taipei City God Temple, and Keelung Huguo Chenghuang Temple to help pay. They started sending lunchboxes to the disaster area on September 26.</p>
            <p>Guo Shen-liang said that the association asked a restaurant in Hualien City to make 1,500 lunchboxes for lunch and 1,000 for dinner every day. Seven small trucks then delivered them to Guangfu Township, where a commander distributed them. The restaurant also helped by lowering the price of each lunchbox from NT$100 to NT$80, while keeping the same good ingredients.</p>
            <p>Guo Shen-liang also said that because of heavy traffic in Guangfu Township, they are talking with relevant groups about sending the lunchboxes by train to keep the food fresh. Also, because local lunchbox shops in Hualien cannot make so many lunchboxes, they are asking other lunchbox shops in Hualien to help supply them. The association has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss money for future lunchbox supplies and how to help with long-term disaster relief.</p>

            <h1>India Stampede Kills at Least 39, Police Investigate Political Party Leaders</h1>
            <p>A famous actor in India, Vijay, who is now a politician, held a political meeting in Tamil Nadu yesterday. Sadly, a crowd crush happened, killing at least 39 people. A senior Indian police officer said today that the police have started an investigation into the senior members of Vijay's political party.</p>
            <p>According to Indian media, the crowd crush in the southern state of Tamil Nadu yesterday killed at least 49 people and injured nearly 100. Among the dead were women and 9 children. Vijay was holding the event to promote his party, "Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam," for local elections next year in the state.</p>
            <p>Senior police officer V. Selvaraj told Reuters that the Tamil Nadu police have filed a case against "Anand, Kumar, and Mathiyalagan, who are senior members of the Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam." This is the first step before possibly charging them, and the investigation is still ongoing.</p>
            <p>Selvaraj said, "The Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam had asked for permission for a gathering of 10,000 people, but the actual crowd was more than twice that number."</p>
            <p>The government of Tamil Nadu has set up a committee led by a retired judge to find out why the stampede happened.</p>
            <p>Vijay is one of the most popular actors in Tamil films in the last 30 years. Since he started his political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, last year, his public events have always attracted large crowds.</p>
            <p>Vijay said that the stampede in Karur district "broke his heart" and promised to support the families of those who died.</p>
            <p>Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin also announced that the families of the victims would receive compensation of 1 million rupees (about NT$340,000).</p>
