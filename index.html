            <h1>Warsaw Security Forum Focuses on Air Defense; German Minister Says Russia is a Growing Danger to NATO</h1>
            <p>The German Minister of Defense, Mr. Pistorius, said today at the Warsaw Security Forum that Russia is becoming a bigger threat to NATO. He asked other countries to work together more on air defense. He wants to avoid falling into a trap set by Russian President Putin, who wants to cause more conflict.</p>
            <p>The Warsaw Security Forum is happening in Poland's capital from September 29th to 30th. It is one of the most important meetings about strategy in Central and Eastern Europe. This year, the forum is talking about how Europe can protect itself better and help Ukraine stay safe in the long term, as the war in Ukraine continues.</p>
            <p>Minister Pistorius said today at the meeting, "Russia is becoming more dangerous to NATO." He explained that Russian President Putin is trying to find weak points in NATO by causing military problems again and again.</p>
            <p>Because of this situation, NATO needs to show that it is united, act clearly, and work together. Mr. Pistorius promised that Germany will continue to build up its air defense and work more closely with NATO countries to deal with threats from the Kremlin.</p>
            <p>When talking about Ukraine, Mr. Pistorius promised that Germany will keep making its cooperation with Ukraine's military industry stronger. He believes this is the best way for Germany to keep Ukraine safe right now. Working together in this way will help Ukraine defend itself better and also help Ukraine join Europe's security plans faster.</p>
            <p>Before going to the Warsaw Security Forum, German Foreign Minister Mr. Wadephul said that Russia flying into NATO airspace is not by chance. He called it "a careful gray area attack" and part of "hybrid aggression." Mr. Wadephul stressed that these actions are "very dangerous and only meant to test how determined NATO is."</p>
            <p>Recently, Nordic countries like Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have reported Russian military planes flying into their airspace. This has caused a lot of worry. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy also asked European countries at the forum today to build a common air defense system to protect against Russian attacks.</p>

            <h1>Russian Drone Threat: European Expert Warns "Hybrid Warfare Aims to Confuse"</h1>
            <p>France announced today that it is sending a team to Denmark to help fight drones and keep the EU summit safe from October 1st to 2nd. Recently, there have been many suspected threats from Russia in Europe. Experts warn that people should be careful of hybrid warfare, which uses many different and unclear methods.</p>
            <p>Since September 22nd, many unknown drones have been flying over important places in Denmark and Norway, including airports and military bases. The Danish police or NATO have not said where these drones came from. However, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, "One country is a threat to European safety, and that is Russia."</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Danish Ministry of Transport announced that to keep the European Union (EU) summit safe, civil drones are not allowed to fly over the country starting today.</p>
            <p>Today, the French Ministry of Defense said it has sent a temporary joint team to Denmark. This team includes 35 members, a Fennec helicopter, and anti-drone equipment that is currently used.</p>
            <p>Many European countries often accuse Russia of using secret actions, digital attacks, or testing military defenses. They say Russia is doing "hybrid warfare" against countries that support Ukraine in fighting Russia. The goal is to cause problems or test how strong Europe and NATO are.</p>
            <p>French news channel franceinfo reported that Russia's threats to the EU and NATO are growing and changing. In recent weeks, dozens of drones have flown into Poland, Denmark, and Germany. Also, three Russian planes entered Estonia's airspace.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, earlier this month, several pig heads were found in front of some mosques in Paris. Investigators think Russia might be behind this. On September 22nd, after authorities stopped a group planning "violence after the election," Moldovan President Maia Sandu openly worried about Russia trying to influence Moldova's parliamentary election on September 28th.</p>
            <p>The report says that Europe is facing "hybrid warfare" from Russia. Ulrich Bounat, an expert from the French think tank "Euro Cr√©ative," explained that "the goal of hybrid warfare is to cause as many problems as possible for the opponent without direct military fighting."</p>
            <p>Thomas Haldenwang, a former head of German intelligence, also told Politico that Russia knows it is "weaker militarily compared to NATO." Because of this, Russia "uses all other possible ways, from influencing political discussions to cyberattacks on important infrastructure, and large-scaleÁ†¥Âùè actions."</p>
            <p>Russia has always said it has no war-related intentions, and some events cannot be directly linked to Russia. Arsalan Bilal, research head at the Peace Research Centre at the Arctic University of Norway, pointed out, "The main thing about hybrid warfare is that it is unclear."</p>
            <p>Bilal also said, "Russia's final goal is to break Europe from the inside, including the EU and NATO. Russia knows it is hard to win against Europe with a traditional war, so it tries to make Europe weaker from within."</p>
            <p>As drones enter European airspace, some people are asking for more action. For example, French President Emmanuel Macron asked NATO member countries at the United Nations General Assembly to respond more strongly when they are provoked.</p>
            <p>But the report says that European countries are not well-equipped to deal with such threats right now. A missile used to stop a drone can cost hundreds of thousands of euros.</p>
            <p>Bilal noted that when facing hybrid warfare, the military part is one thing, but it is also important to improve cooperation and work together. He said, "We must support independent media, improve media education to fight against Russian propaganda and fake news, so that everyone can tell when information is being controlled."</p>

            <h1>Moldova's Pro-Europe Ruling Party Keeps Majority in Parliament; European Leaders Congratulate Them</h1>
            <p>Today, Moldova's ruling party, which supports joining the European Union (EU), announced that it has won a small majority in the parliamentary election. This happened even though Russia was accused of trying to influence the election. The party called it a very tough fight. Leaders from several European countries congratulated them on this result.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Moldova is a country in Eastern Europe next to Ukraine. It has long been divided between supporting Europe and supporting Russia. Also, there is an area controlled by people who want to separate and support Russia.</p>
            <p>This election was seen as very important for Moldova to continue its plan to join the EU. Moldova applied to join after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.</p>
            <p>Igor Grosu, the leader of the ruling "Action and Solidarity Party" (PAS), said in a press conference, "Russia used every dirty trick to interfere in the election... This is not just a victory for our party, but a victory for the people."</p>
            <p>According to the Moldovan election committee website, over 99.96% of the votes have been counted. The PAS, led by President Maia Sandu, received 50.17% of the votes. They will now lead the parliament, which has a total of 101 seats. The "Patriotic Bloc," which supports Russia, received 24.18% of the votes.</p>
            <p>The PAS's vote share this time was slightly less than the 52.8% they received in the 2021 election.</p>
            <p>After the votes were counted yesterday, President Sandu told reporters, "The election results give a strong permission for our country to join the EU."</p>
            <p>Today, she also said that the PAS winning the parliamentary election "shows that the people of Moldova can unite when the future of their country is in danger."</p>
            <p>Andrei Curararu, an analyst at the Moldovan think tank WatchDog.md, told Agence France-Presse that the results show the PAS has indeed won a small majority in parliament. However, the problem is not over, because it will still be hard to form a government that works well.</p>
            <p>He added, "The Kremlin put a lot of money into this operation, and they won't give up easily. They might try to stop Moldova from forming a stable pro-Europe government by organizing protests or trying to buy off members of parliament from the ruling party."</p>
            <p>Antonio Costa, the President of the European Council, said that Moldova chose "a European future." Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister of Poland, praised Moldova for stopping Russia's plans. France also congratulated the people of Moldova for choosing to protect their "independence."</p>
            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also congratulated Moldova's pro-Europe ruling party today for winning the parliamentary election. He stressed that Moscow's attempts to disrupt the country's election did not work.</p>
