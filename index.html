            <h1>Man Dies by Road in Taichung, Filipino Man Held by Police</h1>
            <p>A 41-year-old man named Mr. Li was found lying injured by the road in Tanzi District, Taichung City, yesterday morning. He was taken to the hospital but died from his serious injuries. The police found a Filipino man who was living in Taiwan illegally and arrested him because they think he was involved. After questioning the Filipino man again, prosecutors asked the court tonight to keep him in jail for murder.</p>
            <p>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office said in a statement tonight that the Daya Police Department received a report on the morning of September 7th. It said that a 41-year-old man, Mr. Li, was found seriously injured by Fengxing Road in Tanzi District and later died. The police quickly asked prosecutors to form a special team to collect information and evidence.</p>
            <p>The special team looked into what Mr. Li did before he died and checked related records. On September 7th, the police found and arrested the 26-year-old Filipino man who had stayed in Taiwan longer than his visa allowed. A prosecutor and a forensic doctor examined Mr. Li's body, and an autopsy will happen soon.</p>
            <p>After questioning the Filipino man again today, prosecutors believe he is very likely guilty of murder. They also think he might try to run away or hide evidence. So, they asked the Taiwan Taichung District Court tonight to keep him in jail.</p>

            <h1>British King Will Host a Dinner for Donald Trump; Jensen Huang Will Be There</h1>
            <p>Sky News in the UK reports that King Charles III of Britain will have a special dinner next week. It will be at Windsor Castle. The dinner is for the American President, Donald Trump, who will be visiting the UK. Important American business leaders, like Jensen Huang, who is the head of Nvidia, will also be there.</p>
            <p>Sky News said that sources told them Jensen Huang, Sam Altman (who leads the AI company OpenAI), Larry Fink (who leads BlackRock Inc.), and Stephen Schwarzman (who leads Blackstone) are expected to come.</p>
            <p>The sources also said that Tim Cook, the head of Apple, was asked to come and might be at the dinner. But Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, cannot come to the UK because he is too busy.</p>
            <p>In July of this year, Buckingham Palace in the UK announced that Donald Trump would visit the UK from September 17th to 19th. This will be his second visit to the country. King Charles III and Queen Camilla will welcome Mr. and Mrs. Trump at Windsor Castle.</p>
