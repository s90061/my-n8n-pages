            <h1>Ministry of Finance Holds Lottery for Mobile Tax Filers Today, First Prize of NT$50,000 Can Be Checked on September 26th</h1>
            <p>To encourage people to file their income tax using their mobile phones, the Ministry of Finance held a public lottery today. A lawyer watched as a computer randomly picked the winners. The top prize is NT$50,000. The list of winners will be on social media and the official website on September 26th at 4 PM. Winners must claim their prizes by January 2nd next year. If a prize is not claimed or the SMS notification cannot be delivered, the winner will lose the prize.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance said that to encourage people to use mobile phones for their 2025 income tax returns, the National Taxation Bureaus in different areas worked together again. They created a national lottery called "Fun Mobile Tax Filing, Happy Prize Giving." There are 86 cash prizes and 19,500 e-voucher prizes, making a total of 19,586 prizes. The list of winners will be put on the Ministry of Finance's Facebook page and the websites of the local National Taxation Bureaus on September 26th at 4 PM. Everyone is welcome to check.</p>
            <p>The Southern Area National Taxation Bureau said that this year's tax filing lottery is the "Mobile Tax Filing Prize." Anyone who filed their 2025 income tax using a mobile phone and agreed to the option during filing can join the lottery. Each tax-filing household gets one chance to win. This time, over 2,359,000 people were eligible for the lottery. Today, 19,586 lucky winners were chosen.

            <p>The Southern Area National Taxation Bureau said there are 19,500 e-voucher prizes. An SMS message will be sent to the mobile phone number the winner used when filing their 2025 income tax. This message will come from the 111 government special short code SMS platform. After receiving the SMS, winners should follow the instructions in the message to find out how to claim their e-voucher on the Southern Area National Taxation Bureau's official website. The deadline to claim is January 2nd next year. If the prize is not claimed or the SMS notification cannot be delivered, the winner will lose the prize.</p>
            <p>The Southern Area National Taxation Bureau especially wants to remind people that the National Taxation Bureau will never call winners and ask them to use an ATM for banking operations. They will also not ask for tax payments in advance. Please be careful to avoid scams.</p>

            <h1>DPP Shows Timeline of Landslide Dam Overflow; Green Lawmakers Ask KMT and TPP to Stop Arguing</h1>
            <p>The Mata'an River landslide dam overflow caused serious damage. Today, Huang Tzu-yi, the Deputy Director of the DPP News Department, shared a timeline of the dam overflow on Facebook. He criticized the KMT and TPP for playing political games and spreading lies during the natural disaster. He asked, "Aren't you afraid of bad consequences?" DPP lawmakers Chen Pei-yu and Wang Shih-chien also asked opposition parties to stop their verbal attacks.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi said on Facebook that the Mata'an landslide dam overflow caused serious injuries and deaths downstream. The KMT lawmaker Fu Kun-chi quickly blamed the central government. This morning, TPP leader Huang Kuo-chang held a press conference and also criticized the central government for not doing enough.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi explained what the central Ministry of Agriculture did after finding the Mata'an landslide dam. From July 21st to 26th, they saw signs of its formation and did first checks. From July 26th to 31st, they started aerial surveys, made models of the dam, and did a first risk assessment. From August 7th to 12th, they talked with local groups, held expert meetings, and told people to move away as a safety measure. On August 27th, the Ministry of Agriculture started a "special team." This team clearly divided tasks into three groups (dam/engineering, evacuation) and set a schedule.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi explained that when Typhoon Koinu came, at 11 AM on September 21st, the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency told the Hualien County Government about a yellow warning for the Mata'an landslide dam. At 7 AM on September 22nd, they sent a red warning to the Hualien County Government for the Mata'an landslide dam. They also "suggested that the Hualien County Government start moving people away from the affected areas downstream." From midnight to 12:10 PM on September 23rd, they told the Hualien County Government five times about the possible time the Mata'an landslide dam might overflow. They also suggested that the Hualien County Government quickly start evacuating people and close the Mata'an River Bridge.</p>
            <p>Huang Tzu-yi stressed that at 3 PM yesterday, they told the Hualien County Government that the Mata'an landslide dam was overflowing. Since September 21st, the Ministry of Agriculture had told the Hualien County Government a total of nine times. After the disaster, the Minister of Transportation immediately drove from Taipei to Hualien. He told Taiwan Railways Administration workers to fix the tracks overnight. By 7 AM this morning, the Fulin to Rueisui section of the railway and its signals were fixed. By 8 AM this morning, the entire line was open again. The Ministry of Transportation's Highway Bureau quickly made a plan to repair the roads, hoping to open Provincial Highway 9 soon.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Chen Pei-yu was interviewed before a party meeting. She questioned why Fu Kun-chi was so quick to defend the Hualien County Mayor, Xu Zhen-wei, who is his wife.</p>
            <p>Regarding Fu Kun-chi's claim that the central government used internet armies to attack, Chen Pei-yu said that Fu Kun-chi knows best. Last night, many internet armies were spreading false information in many Hualien groups to defend the Fu family. Also, an account named KCF was spreading rumors and taking advantage of the disaster. She asked if it was not true that Xu Zhen-wei was in Korea before September 22nd and only came back after the Minister of Interior, Liu Se-fang, called her. She said it should be very clear who the internet armies are, who is spreading rumors, and who is trying to control public opinion.</p>
            <p>Chen Pei-yu said that rescue work has not stopped. She asked the KMT and TPP to stop their political arguments. The DPP is working hard on rescue efforts, and the government agencies are fully involved in rescue. However, the KMT and TPP are just arguing politically, and she finds this very sad.</p>
            <p>DPP lawmaker Wang Shih-chien was interviewed before a party meeting. He said that Fu Kun-chi and Xu Zhen-wei have a clear responsibility, but they are blaming the central government. This is not how a local leader or a member of parliament should act. He said they should admit their mistakes if they made them. Negligence is negligence, and they should not keep blaming the central government. After the disaster, they should stop arguing with words.</p>

            <h1>American Airlines Must Pay Almost NT$300 Million for Not Helping Passenger Who Had Two Strokes</h1>
            <p>(Los Angeles, September 23rd, Comprehensive Foreign Report) In 2021, a male passenger on an American Airlines international flight had two strokes. The airline crew did not follow company rules to help him, which meant he got medical help late. A court jury decided that American Airlines must pay 9.6 million US dollars (about 300 million New Taiwan dollars).</p>
            <p>The "Los Angeles Times" reported that in November 2021, Jesus Plasencia, a 67-year-old chef, and his wife were flying from Miami, Florida, USA, to Madrid, Spain. This information comes from a federal lawsuit.</p>
            <p>According to the lawsuit, when the plane was still at the gate, Mr. Plasencia had a "mini-stroke." He could not speak for a short time and could not pick up his phone. His wife told the flight attendants and the pilot. But the pilot did not listen to the wife's worries. Instead of telling medical staff and following company rules, the pilot "made jokes with Mr. Plasencia and allowed him to fly."</p>
            <p>The lawsuit says that after the plane took off, Mr. Plasencia had another stroke. When the plane arrived in Spain, Mr. Plasencia's condition was very serious, so he stayed in the hospital for more than three weeks before he could return to the US. Court documents show that he now cannot speak or write. He needs care at home all day and night and has to do a lot of physical therapy.</p>
            <p>On September 18th this month, a jury in a California federal court decided that American Airlines must pay 9.6 million US dollars. This is because their employees did not follow company rules.</p>
            <p>According to the lawsuit filed in 2023, after Mr. Plasencia had a stroke during the flight, the crew asked other passengers to watch him. But they did not tell the pilot that there was a medical emergency, so the flight did not land early.</p>
            <p>The lawsuit states that Mr. Plasencia's wife said that because American Airlines crew members did not follow the rules, Mr. Plasencia got medical help almost 8 hours late. If he had received help sooner, his condition might have been very different.</p>
            <p>American Airlines put out a statement saying, "The safety and well-being of passengers is the company's highest priority." The statement also said, "The company respects the jury's decision, but disagrees with the verdict, and is now looking at its next steps."</p>
            <p>The lawyer for Mr. Plasencia said that American Airlines did not follow the rules for strokes, which say to give medical help right away and land the plane. He said, "It's shocking how badly American Airlines reacted to this kind of medical emergency."</p>
