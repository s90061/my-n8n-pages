            <h1>Taiwan and US Work More Closely to Stop Drugs Across Borders; Sign Agreement to Share Information</h1>
            <p>To improve how they work together to stop drugs crossing borders, Taiwan's office in the US and the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) signed a new agreement in Virginia, USA. This agreement will help the Taiwan High Prosecutors Office and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) share information better, making their investigations more effective.</p>
            <p>The AIT announced in a press release this afternoon that the 4th yearly "Cross-Border Drug Enforcement Cooperation Forum" was held for the first time in the US on August 18. Before the forum, Taiwan's representative office in the US and the AIT signed this new agreement. It will make it easier for them to share information and work faster to investigate and charge groups that smuggle drugs across borders.</p>
            <p>John Scott, the head of the DEA's Asia-Pacific division, said that this forum shows Taiwan and the US are both determined to fight drug smuggling together. The DEA knows that working with other countries is very important to stop drug smuggling groups. This forum helps to make their partnership stronger, share important information, and create plans to fight the global drug trade.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan High Prosecutors Office said that this year's forum and the new agreement are a fresh start for making international law enforcement work together more closely. All these efforts have a clear goal: to stop groups that smuggle drugs across borders and to keep people safe and healthy on both sides of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
            <p>The AIT also mentioned that Taiwan's new rules to fight fake medicine production, which started on March 31, were a main topic at the forum. Now, all tablet-making machines, parts, and molds from Taiwan must have a serial number printed on them. This is the first time this kind of rule has been made in Asia, and it's a very important step to stop these machines from being used illegally.</p>
            <p>The AIT added that this forum also showed the good results of close work between the DEA's Taipei Narcotics Liaison Office and Taiwan's law enforcement groups. For example, they worked together to stop criminal groups that smuggle Ketamine and Methamphetamine from the Golden Triangle to Taiwan and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>
            <p>The AIT explained that the forum was held at the DEA headquarters. It was led by the AIT and Taiwan's representative office in the US. High-ranking law enforcement officers from the DEA, the FBI, the US Postal Inspection Service, US Customs and Border Protection, and Taiwan's law enforcement groups attended the meeting.</p>

            <h1>DPP Lawmakers Cook for Disaster Victims in Chiayi County, Bringing Warmth and Comfort</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Chiayi County. Today, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers Tsai Yi-yu, Lin Shu-fen, Wang Mei-hui, and Kuo Yu-ching, along with Wu Yin-ning, the deputy executive director of the Executive Yuan's Central Joint Services Center, held a community meal in Touzhu Village, Yizhu. They acted as chefs to show care and support through their actions.</p>
            <p>Lin Shu-fen, who started the event, told reporters that she felt very sad when she saw news reports of people in the south suffering from the typhoon and floods. She remembered how Typhoon Wayne years ago had blown off her own roof and caused problems with water and electricity. Because of this, she truly understands what the disaster victims are going through.</p>
            <p>Lin Shu-fen said that she suggested going to the village to cook for the elderly. She also brought love from the chairman and followers of Fu'an Temple in Luzhou, New Taipei. They donated NT$500,000 to both the Chiayi County and Tainan City Social Affairs Bureaus. She hopes this will comfort the local people and help them stay strong.</p>
            <p>Tsai Yi-yu said that during the typhoon, he worked hard to organize repairs. He relied a lot on help from lawmakers like Lin Shu-fen and Kuo Yu-ching for many support tasks in the Legislative Yuan. Today, seeing his kind and supportive friends come to Chiayi in person, moving from the meeting room to the kitchen, filled him with emotion and thanks.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-ching and Wang Mei-hui also said that spending time with the elderly over a meal and listening to their thoughts is the most real happiness for a public representative. This "cooking" event, full of human kindness, not only filled the stomachs of the elderly but also comforted the hearts of the people in the disaster area, bringing warm and strong support for rebuilding after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Tsai Yi-yu said that the atmosphere at the Touzhu Village community meal in Yizhu was lively. The lawmakers became chefs, chatting and laughing with the elderly while preparing ingredients.</p>

            <h1>Meta Didn't Remove Scam Ads in Time; Digital Affairs Ministry Fines Them NT$2.5 Million for the Third Time</h1>
            <p>The Digital Industry Administration (DIA) of the Ministry of Digital Affairs announced today that Meta's Facebook platform did not remove scam ads within 24 hours after being told to by the Taipei City Government. This goes against the law for preventing fraud. Because of this, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has fined Meta NT$2.5 million. This is the third time the Ministry has fined Meta.</p>
            <p>The DIA said that this case started when the Taipei City Government reported 1,763 cases related to Meta on June 18 and July 14 this year. These cases included 77 ads that were not removed within 24 hours as required by the anti-fraud law, and 1,686 cases where information about who paid for the ads was not provided. After receiving the reports, the Ministry of Digital Affairs immediately started an investigation and confirmed that all the reported scam ads had been taken down.</p>
            <p>The DIA explained that their investigation found that Meta did remove 95% of the scam ads that the Taipei City Government reported. However, because the Taipei City Government's reports this time were on paper, not digital files, Meta was slow in processing the paper reports. So, 5% of the cases were not removed within the 24-hour rule. Considering all these issues, the Ministry of Digital Affairs fined Meta NT$2.5 million according to the anti-fraud law and told Meta to fix the problem within 30 days.</p>
            <p>Regarding Meta not giving information about who paid for the ads to the Taipei City Government, the DIA stated that Meta has already given the necessary information to the National Police Agency of the Ministry of Interior. This meets the rules. In the future, the Ministry of Interior will be asked to think about creating a single contact point. This will make it easier for companies and local governments to follow the rules.</p>
            <p>The DIA stressed that the Ministry of Digital Affairs will continue to follow the law and make sure companies obey the rules. Besides asking companies to make changes by a certain date, to make the process faster, they will help local governments and the four main companies set up agreements for electronic notifications. In the future, they will use the online scam reporting system built by the Ministry of Digital Affairs to send electronic notifications. This will help remove scam ads quickly and reduce the chance of people seeing them.</p>
            <p>On May 22 this year, the Ministry of Digital Affairs decided that Meta's Facebook ads did not show enough information and did not show who paid for the ads. They fined Meta NT$1 million for the first time under the anti-fraud law, making it the first company to be fined since the law started. On June 30, the Ministry of Digital Affairs explained that their investigation found that Facebook's ad service had regular problems. This went against the anti-fraud law, and they fined Meta NT$15 million.</p>
