            <h1>South China Sea Dispute Heats Up, Southern Theater Command of PLA Criticizes Philippines for Joint Patrols with Foreign Countries</h1>
            <p>The dispute in the South China Sea has become more serious recently. Tian Junli, a spokesperson for China's Southern Theater Command, said that the command conducted regular patrols in the South China Sea from September 12th to 13th. He also said that the Philippines often invites countries outside the region to do "joint patrols," which harms peace and stability there.</p>
            <p>The Southern Theater Command announced on WeChat on September 14th that their forces patrolled the South China Sea from September 12th to 13th. They stated that the Philippines frequently invites countries from outside the area to conduct "joint patrols," spreads illegal claims in the South China Sea, and damages peace and stability in the region.</p>
            <p>Tian Junli warned the Philippines to stop causing trouble and increasing tension in the South China Sea right away. He said that getting support from outside countries will not help. The command's forces will stay ready to protect national sovereignty and the peace and stability of the South China Sea. Any attempts to cause problems will not succeed.</p>
            <p>On September 10th, China announced that it would create a national nature reserve on Scarborough Shoal (Huangyan Island) in the South China Sea. This area is disputed. China said this is important to keep the natural environment of Scarborough Shoal diverse, stable, and healthy for a long time.</p>
            <p>After this, the Philippine Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protested. They said that the Philippines has full control over Scarborough Shoal (which they call Bajo de Masinloc) and sees it as a part of their country forever. However, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Scarborough Shoal has never been part of the Philippines. China said it would not accept the Philippines' unreasonable accusations and "protest."</p>
            <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio made a statement. He said that the U.S. supports its friend the Philippines. He said the U.S. rejects China's plan to create a "national nature reserve" on Scarborough Shoal, as this plan harms stability.</p>

            <h1>1155 Base Schools Join Smart Learning, Cross-Domain Integration Helps Special Needs Students</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education is running a program called the "Cross-Domain Smart Learning Rooting Project." It uses information technology to help students learn across different subjects. So far, 1155 schools have joined. The project also helps students with special educational needs to feel motivated to learn and to feel good about what they achieve.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education announced today in a press release that it asked Kaohsiung Normal University to start the "PBL-STEM+AICT Cross-Domain Integrated Smart Learning Rooting Project" in 2019. This project teaches computational thinking through projects in elementary and middle schools across Taiwan. Now, 1155 schools are part of this project.</p>
            <p>With help from the project team, teachers put technology learning into their lessons. They combine it with practical activities. This helps students learn how to think, explore, and analyze. It also guides students to find and solve problems in their daily lives themselves.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education shared a story about a student in Miaoli County who often refused to go to school. This student used to be very quiet, did not move in class, and felt distant from learning. After teachers used teaching materials developed by the project team, the student started talking with other students and showed a desire to learn.</p>
            <p>Also, in Chiayi County, a primary school student with Tourette's syndrome often had trouble joining group activities because of uncontrolled movements. But through a project lesson that used a "cyber cafe celebration program" with lights and sounds, this student's creativity and performance were very impressive.</p>
            <p>The project team also went to Hualien County on the east coast. There, they offered public courses to help students with learning difficulties change their way of learning. One student used to get angry easily and lacked confidence in learning. At first, it was hard for this student to get used to the lessons. But after the teacher arranged for students to work together, share tasks, and perform in public, the student slowly built confidence. Not only could they finish tasks alone, but they also made a video to show their work. They changed from a student who avoided schoolwork to one who loved to learn.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that the changes in students' learning show that if we start with their interests, and combine technology and creativity in lesson design, we can help students find their hidden talents and do their best. In the future, the ministry will keep promoting new technology courses. They will encourage teachers to create lessons for different needs and teach in ways that fit each student. They will also improve support for teachers in technology, so every child can succeed.</p>
