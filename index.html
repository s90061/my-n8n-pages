Hundreds of speakers and participants from 27 countries shared best practices in civil force training at the Global Cooperation and Training Framework (GCTF) International Workshop on Strengthening Civilian Training in Taipei last week, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said yesterday.

‚ÄúAmid threats posed by natural disasters and climate change, bolstering whole-of-society resilience and emergency response capabilities has become increasingly critical,‚Äù the AIT said in a news release about the workshop held from Tuesday to Thursday last week.

Participants at the workshop shared best practices in course design and applications, alarm dissemination systems, the planning and management of disaster evacuation and shelter facilities, and cooperation mechanisms with non-government organizations, it said.

‚ÄúUltimately, the workshop improved and facilitated exchanges between civil training programs and instructors from around the world,‚Äù it added.

The event was held in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Police Agency, the Japan-Taiwan Exchange Association, the Australian Office Taipei, the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei and the Finland Trade Center in Taiwan, AIT said.

A total of 260 speakers, including 43 from 27 countries, participated in the workshop, it said.
