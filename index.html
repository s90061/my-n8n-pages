            <h1>Soldier in Taichung Charged for Being a Fraud Group Member</h1>
            <p>A 22-year-old soldier named Wu wanted to earn extra money. He had a steady job in the military with a monthly salary of NT$50,000. But he became a person who collected money for a fraud group. After being caught, he was put in jail. He was later charged with serious fraud and other crimes. Mr. Wu might even be removed from the army because of this.</p>
            <p>The Daya Police Station in Taichung shared news today. They recently handled a case of fake investment fraud. The victim tried many times to get his profits but failed. He then realized he was tricked and reported it to the police. The police said that Mr. Zhang, 40, joined an investment group on LINE called "Wealth Plan" through Facebook. A customer service agent tricked him into buying fake gold for profit, saying he would "definitely make money." Mr. Zhang saw high returns on the fake website, so he put in a total of NT$1.8 million by bank transfer or by giving cash in person. When Mr. Zhang wanted to get his NT$28.78 million profit, the fraud group asked him to pay a "10% charity donation." That's when he knew he was tricked.</p>
            <p>The police worked with Mr. Zhang and arrested Mr. Wu, the soldier who came to collect the money. After checking, they found out that Mr. Wu was a soldier currently serving in the military. He had a stable NT$50,000 monthly salary and a good future in the army. However, he wanted to earn extra money quickly. So, he looked for "unusual jobs" online. Then, he followed the fraud group's orders to sign fake agreements and collect money from different victims.</p>
            <p>On the day he was caught, the Taichung District Court decided to keep Mr. Wu in jail. The Taichung District Prosecutor's Office charged him with breaking laws about organized crime, serious fraud, and money laundering. They also asked for a harsher sentence, adding one and a half times the usual punishment, under the law to prevent fraud. The court is now reviewing his case. Mr. Wu might lose his job in the army, which means he will suffer a big loss.</p>

            <h1>Taoyuan Sends Law to Charge for Taking Down Illegal Buildings, Hopes for Fair Payment</h1>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Government has approved a new draft law called "Taoyuan City Regulations for Charging for Forced Demolition of Illegal Buildings." This draft will now be sent to the city council for them to look at. If the council says yes, the city government can charge people who built illegal buildings for the costs of taking them down. This will help create a fairer system for managing buildings.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Taoyuan City Department of Architecture Management released a statement. They said that the "Building Act" already has a rule that says, "When a building is forcefully taken down, the owner of the building must pay for the costs." The city government had actually proposed a similar draft law in 2019 about charging for forced demolition of illegal buildings. However, that draft was not approved at that time because there were still concerns about how complete it was. This new draft has been improved and made stronger. It combines real-world experience, new laws from the central government, and ideas from Taipei City and New Taipei City's rules.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang Ching-chuan, who is the head of the Department of Architecture Management, said that right now, the city government pays for taking down illegal buildings. This costs public money and does not stop people enough from building illegally. This new draft law clearly states how much to charge, how to do it, and how to protect people's rights. This will make the demolition process more official and legal. In the future, the cost will be different based on the building materials used, from NT$200 to NT$1700 per square meter. They hope this will stop people who try to break the rules.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chuang added that if this law is approved, the Taoyuan City Government will focus on taking down "large illegal buildings that are still being built" and "illegal buildings that make public places unsafe" first. This is based on Taoyuan City's policy for removing illegal buildings. They will then collect the demolition fees according to the new rules. This shows that the city government wants to make sure land is used correctly and that public safety is the most important thing.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Coach Suspended for 1 Game at U12 World Cup Because Pitcher Did Not Follow Rest Rules</h1>
            <p>In the U12 Baseball World Cup, Taiwan beat South Korea in extra innings yesterday, in the 9th inning. But the last pitcher they used, Huang Yu-chien, did not follow the rules about how many rest days a pitcher needs between games. Because of this, Taiwan's head coach, Chang Tzu-chien, was suspended for 1 game. He could not coach today's third-place game against South Korea.</p>
            <p>The U12 Baseball World Cup's Super Round last game for Taiwan was against South Korea yesterday. The two teams played a very close game until the 9th inning, which used a special rule for tied games. Taiwan scored many runs and won the game 11 to 5. Today, Taiwan played South Korea again for the third-place game.</p>
            <p>The pitcher Huang Yu-chien, who Taiwan used in the 9th inning yesterday, had pitched 53 balls on July 31st. The rules say that if a pitcher throws 46 to 60 balls, they must rest for 2 days before playing again. But Huang Yu-chien played too early yesterday, which was against the rules. So, the Taiwan team was suspended and fined. The head coach, Chang Tzu-chien, was suspended for 1 game.</p>
