News website Axios reported that the United States and Iran plan to meet next week in Oslo, Norway. They will talk about Iran's nuclear program.

An Iranian official said on Thursday that Iran is ready for talks. But, the United States must promise not to use military force against Iran. The official added that the US should make them believe they won't use force while they are talking.

The two countries have had five rounds of talks since April. The sixth meeting was stopped after Israel attacked Iran by air on June 13. The US also attacked three important Iranian nuclear places after that.

**China increases military actions near Taiwan; US says it harms peace**

China has increased its military actions near Taiwan before Taiwan's Han Kuang military exercise. The US State Department said on Thursday that China's military pressure near Taiwan is wrong. It only makes things more difficult and stops peace in the Taiwan Strait.

The US asked Beijing to stop actions that could make the area less stable. Taiwan's Han Kuang exercise will happen from July 9 to July 18. China has sent many planes near Taiwan, with 41 detected in one day.

A US State Department spokesperson said that the US cares about peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. This peace is very important for the safety and success of the world. The US will keep helping Taiwan against China's military, money, information, and political pressure.
