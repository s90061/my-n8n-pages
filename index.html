            <h1>Taiwan's Ministry of Finance Sees AI Helping Exports in Second Half, Warns of 3 Risks Including US Trade Policy</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance in Taiwan said today that countries and cloud service companies are putting a lot of money into AI technology. Also, it is now the busy time for preparing goods. These things will help Taiwan keep its exports strong. However, there are three main issues that could make it harder for exports in the second half of the year. These are: the US trade policy is very uncertain, there are risks related to global politics, and traditional industries are affected by too much production in other countries.</p>
            <p>Today, the statistics department of the Ministry of Finance released a report on Taiwan's trade in the first half of 2025. The report says that when US President Trump started his new term early this year, he quickly put in place more tariffs (taxes on imported goods). His policies also changed often, which made the market very unsure. Most international groups think that the global economy will grow more slowly this year, and world trade will also become weaker.</p>
            <p>However, the statistics department of the Ministry of Finance said that new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) are growing very fast. This has led to a continuing high demand for Taiwan's computer chips and information and communication products. It has also made related companies in Taiwan invest more. In addition, the US stopped putting high matching taxes on goods for a while. This made customers quickly order many goods. Because of this, Taiwan's total exports were 283.3 billion US dollars and imports were 227.5 billion US dollars in the first half of this year. Both of these numbers are the highest ever for this time of year, growing by 25.9% and 20.5% respectively.</p>
            <p>The statistics department of the Ministry of Finance also noted that compared to other main economies in Asia, Taiwan's exports in the first half of the year were the best. They were better than Hong Kong (January to May), which grew by 16.1%, Singapore at 9.4%, China at 5.9%, Japan at 4.8%, and South Korea, which had a small decrease of 0.03%.</p>
            <p>Looking to the future, the statistics department of the Ministry of Finance believes that the business chances for AI are very good. Governments and cloud service companies around the world are investing a lot in the necessary technology. Also, it is the busy time for international brands to prepare for new products. Taiwanese companies are also importing many electronic parts and buying a lot of semiconductor equipment. All these things will help to support Taiwan's strong exports.</p>
            <p>However, the statistics department of the Ministry of Finance said that the US foreign trade policy is still very unsure. There are also ongoing risks related to global politics. Traditional industries selling goods abroad still face problems because there is too much production in other countries. These issues might put pressure on Taiwan's exports in the second half of the year. They need to watch these developments carefully.</p>

            <h1>Typhoon Wipha Expected Tonight, Weekend Heavy Rains for Hualien and Taitung Mountains</h1>
            <p>The Weather Agency announced that future Typhoon Wipha might form tonight. They think it's unlikely a sea warning will be issued. However, the outer part of the storm will bring a lot of moisture. Starting tomorrow, there will be showers or thunderstorms in eastern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula. The mountain areas of Hualien and Taitung should prepare for very heavy rain or more this weekend.</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi, a forecaster from the Central Weather Agency, told the Central News Agency today that a tropical depression east of the Philippines could become Typhoon Wipha, the 6th typhoon this year, as early as tonight. The latest forecast this afternoon still shows it moving past the northern part of Luzon Island and into the South China Sea. It is expected to land near Guangdong (Leizhou Peninsula).</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi explained that if the current path and strength forecast are correct, the center of future Typhoon Wipha will not reach the warning area of Taiwan. This also means there is less chance of a sea typhoon warning. However, the outer part of the storm will still bring a lot of moisture, which will affect Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi said that tomorrow, because of the outer part of the storm, the wind will be from the east. There will be showers or thunderstorms in eastern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula, and some areas might have heavy rain. In the afternoon, there will be short local thunderstorms everywhere. People in the southern parts of Taiwan should be careful of local heavy rain.</p>
            <p>Also, Lin Ting-yi mentioned that it will be quite hot and humid tomorrow when it's not raining. The western parts of Taiwan will have high temperatures of about 33 to 35 degrees Celsius, and eastern parts will be 30 to 32 degrees Celsius. New Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli areas might have temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi pointed out that future Typhoon Wipha is expected to be closest to Taiwan on July 19th. The whole island will have rain on both weekend days. Eastern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula might have local heavy rain or very heavy rain. The mountain areas of Hualien and Taitung could have very heavy rain or even more. Southern Taiwan will have short rain or thunderstorms at different times, and areas from central Taiwan northwards will have afternoon thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>He also said that from July 21st to 24th, Taiwan will be affected by a large low-pressure area. The weather will be unstable, so there will likely be afternoon thunderstorms everywhere. Northern Taiwan, eastern Taiwan, and the Hengchun Peninsula might have showers or thunderstorms at different times. Although it's possible that a tropical weather system could develop within this large low-pressure area, there is no clear forecast yet. The Weather Agency will keep watching the situation.</p>
            <p>Lin Ting-yi reminded people that starting tomorrow, the coastal areas of Keelung North Coast, eastern Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), and the Hengchun Peninsula will have long waves. From July 19th to 21st, the area with long waves will get bigger to include the southern coastal areas and Penghu.</p>

            <h1>Main Suspect Chu Kai-Hsuan Sentenced to 10 Years and 2 Months in Hundred Wealth Investment Scam Over NT$10 Billion</h1>
            <p>Chu Kai-Hsuan, who was in charge of Hundred Wealth company, and his father Chu Kuo-Heng, a former national security official, were involved in selling two foreign investment funds in Taiwan without permission. They took in over NT$10 billion (about US$320 million). Today, the Taipei District Court sentenced Chu Kai-Hsuan to 10 years and 2 months in prison. His father, Chu Kuo-Heng, was sentenced to 3 years and 10 months in prison. This decision was made based on the Banking Act. They can appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors said that Chu Kuo-Heng, who used to be the head of the National Security Council's accounting office, and his son Chu Kai-Hsuan, illegally promoted two foreign financial products from Hundred Wealth Global Group to investors. This happened between 2015 and 2022, without getting permission from the Financial Supervisory Commission.</p>
            <p>The investigation by prosecutors showed that Chu Kuo-Heng and his son used their scam group's managers to hold many meetings to get more investors. They told people that they would definitely get their money back, and the investments would give very high returns of 10.2% to 12% in one to three years.</p>
            <p>Prosecutors stated that Chu Kuo-Heng and his son created a system where 6% of the investment money was used as commission. This money was for their managers to make profit, share earnings, and for daily operations. Over 8 years, they illegally took in more than NT$10 billion. The Taipei District Prosecutors Office has charged Chu Kuo-Heng, Chu Kai-Hsuan, and others with breaking the Banking Act and other laws.</p>
