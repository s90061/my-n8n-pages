Many people spend a lot of time on their phones and social media. This can sometimes cause problems like stress or difficulty sleeping. Now, some big tech companies are starting to offer new features to help users reduce their screen time. This is a change from before, when their main goal was to make people use apps more.

For example, phone makers and app companies are developing tools that help you focus. These tools might let you pause notifications for a certain time, or they might show you how much time you spend on each app. The idea is to make people more aware of their phone habits and give them more control.

Experts say this shift is important because it means tech companies are thinking about users' well-being. While it's still up to each person to manage their phone use, these new features can make it easier to take breaks and enjoy life away from screens. This move could help people find a healthier balance with technology.

**AI Will Change Many Jobs, Says New Report**

A recent report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect almost 40% of jobs around the world. The IMF is an organization that looks at the global economy. This means that AI technology will change how many people work in the coming years.

The report explains that for some jobs, AI might replace tasks that people do, making those jobs less common. But for many other jobs, AI will work alongside humans, helping them to be more productive and efficient. Countries with more advanced economies, like the US or European nations, are expected to see bigger changes because they use more AI already.

This development means that workers might need to learn new skills to work with AI. Governments and companies should think about how to train people for these changes. The goal is to make sure that the benefits of AI are shared widely and that fewer people lose their jobs because of this new technology.

**Popular Tourist Places Try to Control Visitor Numbers**

Many beautiful and famous places around the world are facing a problem called "overtourism." This happens when too many tourists visit a place at once, which can harm the environment, make life difficult for local people, and reduce the quality of the experience for visitors. To fix this, some popular destinations are now trying to limit how many people visit.

For example, cities like Venice in Italy are planning to charge a small fee for day visitors to help control crowds. Amsterdam is also working to encourage different kinds of tourism and discourage party tourism. Other places, especially natural parks or historical sites, might limit the number of daily tickets or require visitors to book far in advance.

The main reason for these rules is to protect these special places and the people who live there. By managing tourist numbers, destinations hope to keep their unique charm, protect their natural beauty, and ensure that tourism helps, rather than harms, the local community and environment for future generations.
