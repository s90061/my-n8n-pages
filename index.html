            <h1>Sanbade to Buy Asia Education for NT$30 Per Share, About 19.9% Higher Price</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's education company Sanbade and its part-owner Asia Education held a press conference today. Sanbade decided to buy shares of Asia Education for NT$30 per share. Sanbade will buy at least 1,910,174 shares and at most 14,249,968 shares. This means Sanbade will own between 5% and 37.3% of Asia Education's total shares. The total cost will be NT$427 million.</p>
            <p>Asia Education's average share price on October 14 was NT$25.02. So, Sanbade is offering about 19.9% more than that price.</p>
            <p>Ms. Huang Chia-chi, the general manager of Sanbade, said today that after this public purchase is finished, Sanbade will own all of Asia Education. After the purchase, Sanbade might even stop Asia Education from being traded on the stock market.</p>
            <p>She explained that Asia Education mainly helps students in elementary, middle, and high school. They offer both in-person and online classes and services to help students get into better schools.</p>
            <p>Sanbade is buying Asia Education to bring together educational resources. They want to make their online learning platform and in-person teaching better. In the future, they will focus on education technology and digital content. They will combine different online tools, use artificial intelligence, look at data, and use cloud services. This will help them create a complete smart learning system.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wu Ming-jin, the chairman of Asia Education, said that when they received Sanbade's offer to buy shares, they would create a special committee. This committee will check Sanbade's documents for the purchase. This is to make sure everything is fair for the shareholders.</p>
            <p>Also, Sanbade's board of directors decided to buy about 48.32% of Yiguo Culture's shares for NT$59 each. The total cost for this will be about NT$815 million. This deal involves 42 shareholders of Yiguo Culture, including 14 people who are connected to Sanbade. The total number of shares from these people is 6,011,860, costing about NT$350 million. Sanbade stated that each payment in this deal, or any payments made to the same related person within one year, is less than NT$300 million.</p>

            <h1>Pan Men-an: Pingtung "Bee Girls" Send 12,000 Packs of Honey to Guangfu</h1>
            <p>Pan Men-an, the Secretary-General of the Presidential Office, today thanked the "Shovel Superheroes" who helped in the disaster relief in Guangfu Township, Hualien. He also mentioned two young women from Manzhou, Pingtung, who make longan honey and other kinds of honey. In just a few days, they collected and made 12,000 small packs of longan honey. They sent these packs to different shelters and first aid stations in Guangfu Township.</p>
            <p>In a Facebook post this evening, Pan Men-an said that during this time, many people have been quietly working in Guangfu Township, Hualien. They don't wear capes, and no one called them to help. But they went to help with disaster relief with a simple heart. Taiwanese people call them "Shovel Superheroes."</p>
            <p>He shared that among these superheroes, there were two girls from Manzhou, Pingtung. They thought about how bees work together, share tasks, and have good teamwork to make sweet honey. So, they decided to prepare longan honey, which gives quick energy. They wanted to give this honey to the heroes working hard on the front lines, so they could "have some sweetness and keep going."</p>
            <p>Pan Men-an also said in an interview that the "Bee Girls" are two skilled divers and surfers from Manzhou, Pingtung. They usually keep bees and make longan honey, helping the local area develop. "Bee Girls" is their own brand.</p>
            <p>In just a few days, the two women gathered and made 12,000 small packs of longan honey. They sent these packs to the various shelters and aid stations in Guangfu Township. Pan Men-an stressed that this sweetness is not just the taste of honey. It also shows care for each other and love for the land.</p>
