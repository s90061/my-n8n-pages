            <h1>Schools in Hualien Guangfu disaster area reopen; Cheng Ying-yao praises amazing recovery speed</h1>
            <p>Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, visited schools in the disaster-hit Guangfu Township in Hualien again today. He said that what he saw this time was very different from before. The schools recovered quickly, and more than 90% of students were back in class. This amazing progress in recovery made him feel touched. Later, they will count the damage and try their best to help.</p>
            <p>In the morning, Cheng Ying-yao visited Guangfu Junior High School and National Guangfu Senior High School of Commerce and Industry, which were badly affected. He told reporters that when he visited the schools on September 25, there were piles of mud and sand 1.5 meters high. The school grounds were a mess. It was very hard to clean up the mud and sand in the basements. These days, the central and local governments worked together. This helped the schools get back to normal quickly so students could learn again. This quick recovery is truly amazing and touching.</p>
            <p>Cheng Ying-yao said that today he specially thanked the "Shovel Superheroes" volunteers. They came from all over Taiwan and even from other countries. This showed how strong Taiwanese society is. Guangfu Junior High School reported almost 100 million NT dollars in damages, and Guangfu Senior High School of Commerce and Industry reported about 200 million NT dollars. On October 15, they will quickly check and approve these amounts. Then, the money will be given quickly to help the schools rebuild.</p>
            <p>Also, the Taipei City Government offered to donate YouBike public bicycles for students in Guangfu Township to use for transportation. Huang Jianrong, the principal of Guangfu Junior High School, said that he does not suggest students use YouBike at the moment. This is because the roads in the town are still not very good, and large machines are still working there. They will allow students to use YouBike when daily life returns to normal.</p>
            <p>Huang Jianrong said that students who were staying in other townships are slowly coming back to school today. They have rented two cars to use as school buses. One bus follows the old school bus route, and the other follows a town route. They drive around so students can take the school bus to class anytime.</p>

            <h1>Shin Kong Life T17, T18 development period: Peng Jin-lung says no more than 5 years, not including urban review</h1>
            <p>Nvidia's plan to move into the T17 and T18 bases at the Northern Taiwan Science Park is stuck. Lawmakers are worried about how long Shin Kong Life Insurance (Shin Kong Life) has to develop the land and what the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) will do. Today, FSC Chairman Peng Jin-lung said that the disagreement between the Taipei City Government and Shin Kong Life is about their contract, so the FSC will not get involved. For insurance companies investing in land, Shin Kong Life's project is an investment in undeveloped land. Rules say it must start making money within 5 years. But this 5-year period does not include the time for urban design review and approval.</p>
            <p>Shin Kong Life got the right to use the land at the Northern Taiwan Science Park in February 2022.</p>
            <p>Nvidia's plan to move into the T17 and T18 bases at the Northern Taiwan Science Park is stuck. Taipei City Deputy Mayor Lee Sichuan said yesterday that they will send a letter to Shin Kong Life asking to "agree to end the contract together." Shin Kong Life said in a statement that they asked the Taipei City Government to start a mediation committee, as stated in the land-use contract. They want to find the best solution together to help Nvidia move into T17 and T18 at the Northern Taiwan Science Park as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>This morning, the Finance Committee of the Legislative Yuan invited Peng Jin-lung and other heads of related government departments to give a report and answer questions.</p>
            <p>Lai Shyh-bao, a Kuomintang lawmaker, asked if President Lai Ching-te had told the central government to fully help local governments solve problems. He also asked if the FSC had a role to play. In addition, the Taipei City Government said Shin Kong Life is the company that will "disappear." The original contract was for 5 years of development. He asked if the Taipei City Government could end the contract with Shin Kong Life only after the 5 years were over.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung replied that, first, according to news reports, this is a contract disagreement between the Taipei City Government and Shin Kong Life about land use rights. The FSC has never gotten involved in contract problems before. If there is a disagreement, it should be solved according to the contract.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung explained, second, the FSC mainly checks how insurance companies invest in land. According to the rules for insurance companies investing in land, this project by Shin Kong Life is an investment in undeveloped land. It is not likely to make money right away. The rules say that it must be finished within 5 years and be used to make money. But this time does not include the period for urban design review and approval (the "urban review period") before applying for a building permit.</p>
            <p>Lai Hui-yuan, a Democratic Progressive Party lawmaker, asked if Shin Kong Life "disappearing" and what happens next might affect the rights of policyholders.</p>
            <p>Peng Jin-lung pointed out that the plan for the two financial holding company subsidiaries to merge has been sent to the Insurance Bureau. They are currently adding more documents and reviewing it. Taishin Life Insurance will be the company that continues to exist, and Shin Kong Life will be the company that legally "disappears." However, after the merger, the company will be renamed Shin Kong Life. Legally, Shin Kong Life is indeed the "disappearing" company, but the real parts of the company will still exist, and the rights of insurance policyholders will not change.</p>

            <h1>Japan's biggest jazz festival starts in Yokohama, Taiwanese bands perform for the first time</h1>
            <p>Japan's biggest jazz music festival, "Yokohama JAZZ PROMENADE 2025," took place in Yokohama on October 11 and 12. The Taiwan Cultural Center in Japan worked with the Yokohama Arts Foundation to hold "Taiwan Jazz Day." They invited "YuYing Hsu Elektrikkkk 5" and "Jazz Awakening!â€”Taiwan Spirit" to perform. This showed the new and creative power of Taiwanese jazz today.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Cultural Center in Japan, under the Ministry of Culture, said that this year marks 100 years since jazz music was first played in Yokohama. So, the Taiwan Cultural Center in Japan and the Yokohama Arts Foundation worked together for the first time. They planned "Taiwan Jazz Day." They invited two Taiwanese jazz bands, "YuYing Hsu Elektrikkkk 5" and "Jazz Awakening!â€”Taiwan Spirit," to perform. These bands had also played at the National Theater and Concert Hall's Summer Jazz Festival. They played on the stage of Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse Building No. 1 Concert Hall. They showed Japanese fans the new ideas and rich culture of Taiwanese jazz music. All 300 seats were taken, and after the performance, the audience clapped loudly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Culture stated that this partnership is a big step. It is the first time Taiwanese jazz music has been asked to be part of the "Yokohama JAZZ PROMENADE" music festival. This is a very important new achievement. Since it started in 1993, the festival has aimed to "make the whole city a stage." Every year, more than 100,000 people come. It is known as a major cultural event in Yokohama in autumn. This year, Yokohama is celebrating 100 years as the "birthplace of jazz in Japan." So, they invited bands from Taiwan, Frankfurt in Germany, and other places to perform. This shows how music can connect people across borders.</p>
            <p>YuYing Hsu is a well-known pianist and composer in Taiwan's jazz world. She is praised for her excellent ability to play freely and her strong playing skills. She is active in jazz music. She has also played in concerts for many Taiwanese pop singers and written music for movies. This shows her many musical talents. This time, she led the "Elektrikkkk 5" band, which has many skilled musicians. They played in an electronic music style, making the audience feel the spirit of jazz.</p>
            <p>"Jazz Awakening!â€”Taiwan Spirit" is a six-person band led by saxophonist Su Sheng-yu. Su Sheng-yu grew up listening to Taiwanese songs. This time, he mixed classic Taiwanese songs with jazz music in an exciting and creative way. They played songs like "Man Mian Chun Feng" (A Face Full of Spring Breeze), "Shao Rou Zong" (Grilled Rice Dumplings), "Gang Du Ye Yu" (Harbor Night Rain), and "Si Mu De Ren" (The One I Miss). They gave these familiar songs a new sound. They used acoustic instruments to create a happy musical time.</p>
            <p>Last year, Minister of Culture Li Yuan met with Ono Shinji, the executive director of the Yokohama Arts Foundation. This meeting helped arrange for Taiwanese jazz bands to play at this event. Li Yuan said that jazz music means freedom, playing freely, and many different things. It shows the spirit of Taiwanese culture. Taiwanese musicians shared their music with Japanese audiences using natural rhythms and melodies. This let more people hear music from Taiwan. The Ministry of Culture will continue to work more closely with cultural groups in different parts of Japan. They want to connect feelings and make friendships through music.</p>
            <p>Li Yi-yang, Taiwan's Ambassador to Japan, said that "Yokohama JAZZ PROMENADE" is Japan's most important jazz music festival. Taiwanese bands playing there not only show their musical skill but also mark a new beginning for cultural exchange between Taiwan and Japan. He hopes that both sides can use music to build deeper connections in art and feelings.</p>
            <p>Tseng Chien-lung, the director of the Taiwan Cultural Center, said that this cooperation helps Taiwanese music enter important Japanese art platforms. He also hopes that the exchanges at the festival will lead to long-term cooperation between the jazz communities in Taiwan and Japan. In the future, they will keep focusing on different music cultures. They will also support more joint performances between Taiwan and Japan. This will let the world see Taiwan's strong cultural energy and new ideas.</p>
