            <h1>Paris Gymnastics World Cup Challenge: Tseng Wei-sheng Wins Silver in Men's Vault</h1>
            <p>Taiwanese gymnast Tseng Wei-sheng won a silver medal in the men's vault event at the Paris Gymnastics World Cup Challenge in France today. He scored an average of 13.916 points from his two vaults. This is his second silver medal in this year's challenge series.</p>
            <p>The International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) holds five World Cup Challenge events each year. Tseng Wei-sheng has now competed in four of them and has won a total of two gold and two silver medals.</p>
            <p>According to FIG rules, gymnasts must take part in all five competitions. Their three best scores are then used to decide their annual ranking. His coach, Lin Yu-hsin, is very proud and believes that Tseng Wei-sheng will surely be the overall champion of the challenge series this year.</p>
            <p>The fifth and final challenge event of the FIG series will take place in Hungary on September 26th. The overall champion will receive an award there.</p>
            <p>Tseng Wei-sheng, who is 26 years old, has become much better in international competitions since he won a silver medal in men's vault at the 2023 Chengdu Universiade. Coach Lin Yu-hsin said, "Vaulting is all about your mental strength and how steady you are. This competition was very tough, and many top athletes from different countries were competing."</p>
            <p>Today, Tseng Wei-sheng was the last of eight gymnasts to perform in the final. For his first vault, he received a difficulty score of 5.200 and an execution score of 8.733, making his total 13.933. For his second vault, he received a difficulty score of 5.200 and an execution score of 8.700, totaling 13.900. His average score from both vaults was 13.916, which earned him the silver medal.</p>
            <p>Coach Lin Yu-hsin shared that in the past, if Tseng Wei-sheng was the last person to compete, he would often make big mistakes. "But now, he is very stable," Lin said. "Even though he performed last today, he still managed to push the rankings of other gymnasts down."</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-hsin stressed that they will keep working on Tseng Wei-sheng's moves and his steadiness. His main goal is to win a medal at next year's Asian Games in Nagoya.</p>

            <h1>Paris Gymnastics World Cup Challenge: Tang Chia-hung Makes Landing Error, Wins Bronze in Horizontal Bar</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's famous gymnast Tang Chia-hung, also known as the "King of Asia," won a bronze medal in the horizontal bar final at the Paris Gymnastics World Cup Challenge in France. He tried a difficult move with a difficulty score of 6.700. However, he made a mistake during his landing, which meant his execution score was only 7.666. His final total score was 14.366 points.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung had spent three weeks training in Japan at the end of July, and he was in good condition before the competition. In the horizontal bar qualification round yesterday, Tang Chia-hung performed well. He scored 14.766 points (with a difficulty score of 6.100 and an execution score of 8.666), placing him first and allowing him to move on to the final.</p>
            <p>In today's final, Tang Chia-hung decided to increase the difficulty of his routine to 6.700 points. He did not add any new moves, but he lost his balance and touched the ground with his hand when he tried a "triple back somersault in a tucked position" for his landing. This mistake caused his execution score to be only 7.666 points.</p>
            <p>In the end, Tang Chia-hung's total score was 14.366 points. He actually had the same score as a French gymnast, who also placed second. But after comparing their execution scores, Tang Chia-hung received the bronze medal.</p>
            <p>Tang Chia-hung explained that before the competition, he had planned to try out different moves and higher difficulty levels. He said that even though he did not succeed perfectly, he learned a lot from the experience.</p>
            <p>After this competition, Tang Chia-hung will go back to Taiwan to continue training. He will prepare for the National Games in October and the World Gymnastics Championships, which will happen in Jakarta on October 19th.</p>
            <p>In another event, the men's parallel bars, Taiwan's Hung Yuan-hsi was the last to perform in the final. He scored 13.266 points (with a difficulty score of 5.700 and an execution score of 7.566). He finished in 6th place and did not win a medal.</p>

            <h1>Antetokounmpo Scores 30 Points and 17 Rebounds, Greece Beats Finland to Win Bronze in EuroBasket</h1>
            <p>Greece won a bronze medal in the EuroBasket basketball championship today. They beat Finland 92-89 in the game for third place. Giannis Antetokounmpo, also known as the "Alphabet Guy," played a great game, scoring 30 points and getting 17 rebounds. This is Greece's first medal in this competition since 2009.</p>
            <p>When the game ended, Greek fans in Riga, the capital of Latvia, cheered loudly. They were celebrating their team's first medal at the EuroBasket in 16 years. This is the sixth medal Greece has won in the history of the EuroBasket, with two gold, one silver, and three bronze medals in total.</p>
            <p>Greece was in the lead for most of the game. They quickly got ahead by more than ten points at the beginning and had a 14-point lead at halftime. They were still ahead by 11 points with only two minutes left in the game. But then Finland started to fight back and reduced Greece's lead to just three points in the final five seconds.</p>
            <p>Elias Valtonen, a small forward for Finland, had a chance to tie the game by taking three free throws. He successfully made the first two, but he missed the third one. Mikael Jantunen then got the offensive rebound and tried to score, but he also missed.</p>
            <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo, an NBA star who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, then made sure Greece won the game. He calmly scored with only four seconds left, securing the victory.</p>
            <p>Antetokounmpo played very strongly in this game. He scored 30 points, got 17 rebounds, made 6 assists, and blocked 2 shots. He also shot very well, making 9 out of 11 shots. This is the fourth time in this tournament that he has achieved at least "20 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists," which is the most times anyone has done this in the EuroBasket in the last 30 years.</p>
            <p>Greece's offense was very good. By the fourth quarter, they had scored 20 points from fast breaks, while Finland only had 3. They also shot well from long distance, making 14 out of 30 three-point shots.</p>
            <p>This bronze medal is special because it's Greece's first EuroBasket medal in 16 years. Their head coach, Vassilis Spanoulis, was a key player when Greece last won a bronze medal in Poland in 2009.</p>
            <p>For Antetokounmpo, this is his very first medal with the national team. This achievement officially makes him one of Greece's basketball heroes.</p>
            <p>Finland finished in 4th place, which is their best result ever in the competition. They have shown great improvement over the last ten years, moving from 16th place in 2015, to 11th in 2017, to 7th in 2022, and now reaching 4th place this year.</p>
            <p>Lauri Markkanen, who plays for the NBA's Utah Jazz, was Finland's top performer in this game with 19 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
