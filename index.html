            <h1>Major General Avoids Further Punishment After Being Convicted of Taking Washing Machine</h1>
            <p>A former army officer, Major General Lin Cheng-chia, was found guilty of taking a washing machine that belonged to the government. The washing machine was worth 7,990 New Taiwan Dollars. He was sentenced to 6 years and 8 months in prison for this crime. This sentence is now final.</p>
            <p>The Disciplinary Court looked at his case. They decided not to give him any more punishment. This is because he has already lost his right to work as a public servant. This means he cannot work for the government anymore. This punishment is similar to being fired, which is the strongest punishment for government workers.</p>
            <p>The criminal court document says that in December 2017, Major General Lin learned that the Kinmen Defense Command would buy washing machines for soldiers. He suggested getting one for the Deputy Chief of Staff. But the Deputy Chief of Staff did not need a new washing machine. So, Major General Lin sent that washing machine to his own home in Taiwan and kept it.</p>
            <p>Later, he found out that people knew about what he did. So, he bought another washing machine that was the same type and sent it back to the army base. He then sent the first washing machine back to Kinmen. He put it in his friend's office without his friend knowing.</p>
            <p>The court in Kinmen first sentenced him to 12 years in prison. He also lost his public service rights for 3 years. The higher court in Kinmen then changed the sentence to 6 years and 8 months in prison, and he still lost his public service rights for 3 years. Major General Lin tried to appeal again, but the highest court rejected his appeal in January this year. So, the sentence is now final.</p>
            <p>The Control Yuan, a government body, also started a case against Major General Lin and sent it to the Disciplinary Court. The Disciplinary Court recently decided not to take further action. This decision can be appealed.</p>
            <p>The Disciplinary Court believes that Major General Lin was already found guilty and has lost his public service rights. This means he cannot be hired as a government worker. If he were hired, he would have to be removed from his job. This is like the strongest punishment a government worker can get, which is being removed from their position.</p>
            <p>The court panel thought that his wrong actions greatly hurt the values of public servants. He did not show he was sorry for what he did, and his actions should be strongly criticized. However, because he is already facing a punishment that is as serious as being removed from his job, there is no real benefit in punishing him again. So, the court decided that he does not need more disciplinary action.</p>

            <h1>Police Officer Not Charged After Mother's Suicide in Fraud Case in Taipei</h1>
            <p>A mother and daughter in Neihu, Taipei, may have taken their own lives because of a fraud case. The police officer, Mr. Liu, who handled the fraud report, was punished earlier for speaking badly on the phone. The family of the mother and daughter later said that Officer Liu helped them commit suicide. But the Shilin District Prosecutor's Office decided that there was not enough proof. So, they will not charge Officer Liu.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor's report says that on December 4, 2024, Officer Liu took the mother's report. She said she lost more than 12 million New Taiwan Dollars in a fraud. The case needed more information. So, on December 6, Officer Liu called the mother three times in the morning, but she did not answer. On the fourth call, before she picked up, he said to himself, "Could she have already killed herself?" When she answered the phone, he said, "Oh, so you're still alive."</p>
            <p>Officer Liu also said other things on the phone, like, "That person came to trick you, borrowing 170 and having to pay back 250, wow," and "You burned the original paper, no way." The family believes that the mother decided to take her own life after hearing Officer Liu's words. Officer Liu called a fifth time on the afternoon of December 6, but the mother did not answer. She took her own life that evening.</p>
            <p>The family reported the case to the police and said Officer Liu helped in the suicide. Officer Liu said that when the mother gave her statement, she was sad but did not say she wanted to take her own life. He said that when he spoke before she answered the phone, he was just talking to himself. He did not mean to tell her to commit suicide.</p>
            <p>The prosecutor checked the phone calls, written records, and the mother's letter she left. They found that Officer Liu's words were not careful, but he did not mean to tell her to commit suicide. The mother's letter did say she was unhappy with Officer Liu's attitude. But the letter mostly showed that she took her own life because she lost a lot of money to fraud and was very sad. She also felt worse because Officer Liu, who was in charge of her case, had a bad attitude. The prosecutor decided there was not enough proof to charge Officer Liu with a crime.</p>
            <p>Also, the family and Officer Liu have made an agreement. The family said they accepted Officer Liu's apology and took back their complaint. So, no charges were filed today.</p>
            <p>Separately, for his job, the Taipei City Police Department said Officer Liu's words when handling the case were wrong. They gave him a big mark against him and moved him to a different job. They also sent his case to the Disciplinary Court. The Disciplinary Court first said he should not work for 6 months.</p>

            <h1>Fire at Closed Hot Spring Hotel in Miaoli, No One Hurt</h1>
            <p>A fire started early this morning at the Jinshui Hot Spring Hotel in Tai'an Township, Miaoli County. The hotel closed last July because of money problems and has not opened since. Firefighters quickly arrived and put out the fire. Luckily, no one was stuck inside or hurt. But the roof over the outdoor public hot spring pool and the small buildings next to it were completely burned.</p>
            <p>The Miaoli County Fire Department said they received a call around 5 in the morning. People saw flames near the Jinshui Hot Spring Hotel. Firefighters from Tai'an and Dahu quickly went to the place. They saw that the roof over the outdoor public pool and the open-air small buildings were on fire. The fire also reached the edge of a nearby building's roof.</p>
            <p>Firefighters used water to fight the fire. It took about 2 hours to put it out. After checking the area, they confirmed that no one was hurt or died. However, the wooden parts of the second and third floors, including the stairs to the outdoor hot spring area, the roof over the public pool, and the small buildings, were all destroyed by the fire. The reason for the fire is still being checked.</p>
            <p>People who live in the area said that Jinshui Hot Spring Hotel was the first hotel in Taiwan to receive a special sign for its hot springs. It was also a very old and famous hotel in Tai'an Township. It was popular for families and for people who wanted healthy hot springs. Last year, news came out that the hotel asked to stop business for one year because of money troubles. Now, it has also had a fire, which makes its situation even worse.</p>
