            <h1>New Session in Legislature: Government Focuses on Economy, People's Needs, Vulnerable Groups, and Young People as Top Bills</h1>
            <p>The Parliament will start its new session tomorrow. The government spokesperson, Lee Hui-chih, said today that the President, Lai Ching-te, has given instructions. The government will change its work order. It will focus on making the economy better, helping people with their daily lives, supporting people who need help, and helping young people. Nine draft laws have already been sent to the Parliament to be checked. Other important laws are still being looked at.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said today that the government has already sent some laws to the Parliament. These are laws the government thinks are very important to deal with first. They include changes to the "Law for Protecting Indigenous People's Work Rights," the "Law for Pingpu Indigenous People's Identity," the "Rules for Managing National Health Insurance Data," and the "Law for Protecting Personal Data." These changes are based on decisions from the Constitutional Court.</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih said that President Lai Ching-te had given instructions earlier. The government will change how it works in the future. It will focus on the economy first, people's lives first, vulnerable groups first, and young people first. The government has sent these proposed laws to the Parliament: "Basic Law for Youth," "Law for Child Care Services," "Basic Law for Artificial Intelligence," "Changes to some articles in the Company Mergers and Acquisitions Law," and "Changes to some articles in the Law for Protecting the Rights of People with Disabilities."</p>
            <p>Lee Hui-chih also said that other important laws are still being checked and organized by the new Deputy Secretary-General of the government, Ruan Zhao-xiong. He will also talk with the political parties in the Parliament about these laws.</p>

            <h1>Indonesia: Protests Start Because of High Pay for Parliament Members; Finance Minister's Home Robbed</h1>
            <p>Recently, people in Indonesia have been unhappy about the economy and the high salaries of parliament members. This has caused protests against the government. People's anger grew, and last night, the home of Indonesia's Finance Minister was robbed. Today, Indonesia's Defense Minister said that strong actions will be taken against those who caused trouble and stole things.</p>
            <p>On August 25, protests began in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. People protesting said that parliament members got too much money for their pay and housing. On August 28, the protests became violent after a police vehicle hit and killed a person who rode a motorcycle taxi. Some homes of politicians and government buildings were robbed or burned.</p>
            <p>A news agency reported that a neighbor said the house of the Indonesian Finance Minister, Sri Mulyani Indrawati, was robbed early this morning. Her house is in South Tangerang, a city close to Jakarta. Two groups of people robbed it.</p>
            <p>The neighbor said: "The first group of robbers came on many motorcycles, with two or three people on each. The second group had about 150 people. They stole TVs, music players, things from the living room, clothes, and dishes."</p>
            <p>Today, Indonesia's Defense Minister, Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin, gave a warning at a press conference. He said: "Police will act strongly and without doubt against troublemakers and robbers who go into private homes or government places."</p>
            <p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto held a press conference today. Leaders from different political parties stood with him. He said he told the army and police to act firmly against troublemakers and robbers. He also warned that some actions during the recent protests across the country were like "betrayal" and "terrorism."</p>
            <p>The leaders of the Parliament have promised to remove some rules within the Parliament. These changes include adjusting how much money members get and stopping their trips overseas.</p>
            <p>The protests in Indonesia have been happening for several days. They have now spread to areas outside Jakarta. Some local parliament buildings were even set on fire. Because of these events, President Prabowo canceled his planned trip to visit China.</p>
            <p>President Prabowo became leader last October. For almost a year, his government did not have many political problems. These protests are the biggest challenge he has faced so far.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Women's Volleyball Team Gets Second Place in East Asian Cup; Coach Happy with Players' Improvement</h1>
            <p>The East Asian Women's Volleyball Championship was held in Hong Kong. Today, the team from Taiwan played in the final match. They lost to the team from China with scores of 26-24, 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. So, Taiwan got the silver medal (second place). The main coach, Deng Yan-min, said she was very happy to see how much the players have improved.</p>
            <p>In the past, the Taiwan women's volleyball team had won the East Asian Volleyball Championship three times. But for nine years, they could not get into the top four teams. This time, the team was led by the setter, Liao Yi-jen, also known as "Volleyball Sweetheart." Other players included Hung Chia-yao, Hsu Heng-yun, Weng Tzu-yun, Chien Yi-wen, and Chiu Shih-ching. The main coach, Deng Yan-min, whose nickname is "Xiaoniu," said their goal was to reach the final game. They wanted to end their last international competition of the year in a good way.</p>
            <p>In the first part of the competition, the Taiwan women's volleyball team beat Mongolia and Hong Kong (the host team). This meant they were first in their group and went to the top four again. Yesterday, they also won against South Korea with a score of 3-0. So, they reached their goal of getting into the final. But today, they played against the strong team from China. Taiwan won the first set. However, they then lost the next three sets with scores of 24-26, 22-25, and 19-25. So, they did not win the championship trophy.</p>
            <p>After the game, Coach Deng Yan-min spoke to reporters. She said she used to play for the national team herself. She knows that players feel pressure and want to do well for Taiwan. So, she told all the players to focus only on the game and not to think about anything else. She wanted to make a "happy volleyball" feeling. This way, players would naturally train hard and play with a strong focus.</p>
            <p>Coach Deng Yan-min believes that after playing in the Asian Cup, the Rhine-Ruhr Universiade, and now this East Asian Volleyball Championship, these players are not as afraid of tall opponents anymore. Also, their moves for blocking, defending, and attacking have become much smoother. This made her feel very touched. She also thanked the players because they quickly trusted the team and worked together to get good results.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan women's volleyball team will start the next part of their training for the 2026 Nagoya Asian Games on September 8. Coach Deng Yan-min said that more experienced older players will join the team then, along with new players who have a lot of potential. Next year will have many important games, like the Asian Cup, East Asian Volleyball Championship, Asian Championship, and Asian Games. She said, "Next year will be a very exciting year. We hope to use this time to get stronger."</p>
