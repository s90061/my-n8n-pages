Hsinchu County Councilor Wu Hsu-chih announced today that several schools in Hsinchu County have received AI smart display boxes. This initiative, in cooperation with Hongju Technology, aims to promote technology education and environmental sustainability. The boxes include sensors and smart light bulbs to help students learn about AI applications and energy saving. This will help students develop their tech skills.

Hongju Technology got a grant from Hsinchu County for their "AIoT Smart Education Angel Service and Expansion Project." They are setting up many smart education centers in the county. With help from Councilor Wu Hsu-chih, they gave AI smart display boxes to several schools in Hsinchu County. They also created special smart technology lessons for these schools.

Hongju Technology gave four sets of AIoT Environmental Sustainability Smart Education Systems (AI Smart Display Boxes). The launch event today showed how the system works. It uses sensors, air quality monitors, smart light bulbs, smart plugs, and infrared devices. In the future, it will be used for lessons on smart applications, saving energy, and safety.

Councilor Wu Hsu-chih told CNA that the smart display boxes can control air conditioners in school classrooms. They also use AI to make smart decisions, allowing technology to really help manage the environment.

He explained that students can learn about AI and the Internet of Things early. They can also see how technology connects to daily life, society, and the environment. He added that they will continue to build more smart campuses and work with industries. This will use company knowledge and local resources to close the digital gap between cities and rural areas.

**Flying Tiger F-5E/F: A Fighter Pilot Calls it "Not the Main Fighter, but the Main Fighter"**

Every fighter jet has its own character. The F-5E/F, also known as the Tiger II, is "simple to use, easy to learn." It uses traditional hydraulic controls, so pilots need good hand-eye coordination to feel "at one with the machine." When newer jets were being prepared, during the 1995 missile crisis, the F-5E/F was like a flying guardian, quietly doing its job to protect Taiwan's skies.

The "Peace Tiger" project started in 1973. It was divided into 7 stages to match Taiwan's manufacturing ability. The last plane was made at the end of 1986. In total, 242 single-seat F-5E planes and 66 two-seat F-5F planes were produced, making 308 fighter jets.

When asked about the F-5E/F's features, retired Colonel Song Wen-hsi quickly said it's "a very easy plane to learn." Taiwan's three main fighter jets now â€“ the F-16, IDF Ching-kuo, and Mirage 2000 â€“ use a fly-by-wire system. This system needs pilots to know the flight procedures and plane systems well.

Song Wen-hsi used the F-16 as an example. Because the F-16 is designed to be aerodynamically unstable, the plane's computer automatically calculates the angles needed for flight and adjusts parts like ailerons and flaps. The pilot just tells the computer what they want to do, and the F-16 helps with the calculations and flying.

Unlike the IDF Ching-kuo and other newer jets, Song Wen-hsi said the F-5E/F uses old-fashioned hydraulic controls, like driving an old car. Pilots need to use their hands and feet to control the stick and rudder based on what they see, so the F-5E/F can fly as they want.

Without a computer to help, Song Wen-hsi said controlling the F-5E/F is "very personal." The pilot needs to feel how much to pull up or turn the plane. Besides hand-eye coordination, using the feet to control the rudder is also very important. So, you need both hand-eye and hand-foot coordination to become "one with the machine."

Also, Song Wen-hsi said the F-5E/F is an old-style mechanical plane. It works well, is safe, and easy to control. "If the engine sounds strange, you can tell just by listening," he said.

The F-5E/F has a high operational readiness rate for a reason. Former AIDC Vice President Ho Pao-hua pointed out that all 308 F-5E/F fighters used by the air force were made by the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC). They knew everything about each plane's history and had full control over the F-5E/F's manufacturing plans and production methods. This greatly helped keep the F-5E/F in good condition during its time in service with the air force.

After the U.S. ended ties with the Republic of China in 1979, Taiwan's air force could not get new fighter jets. Because AIDC had the plans, the F-5E/F later took on many different tasks.

Retired Colonel Huang Yang-te said that back then, the air force found ways to give the F-5E/F many abilities for combat. For example, some single-seat F-5Es could fire Maverick missiles. Some two-seat F-5Fs were given Laser Target Designators (LTDS) to guide laser bombs. They even changed some F-5E jets into RF-5E reconnaissance planes.

However, the F-104 jet was more famous back then, and the F-5E/F was less known. Song Wen-hsi thinks that at the same time, the F-104 could only intercept at high altitudes. All other combat tasks had to be done by the F-5E/F. Before the F-16, IDF, and Mirage 2000 joined the air force, the F-5E/F carried the heavy responsibility of protecting Taiwan's air.

For example, during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis, Song Wen-hsi remembered that the Air Force's 455th Wing sent 20 pilots, including him, to Penghu base for the "Sky Hawk Mission." At that time, the air force told pilots not to start any fights in the air. By not fighting back if attacked, they hoped to get help from other countries. The F-5E/F jets were still good enough to face the Chinese J-7 and J-8 jets back then. He said that when he was flying, he only thought about keeping Chinese jets out of Taiwan's airspace.

The F-5E/F has protected Taiwan's sky for over 50 years. How should we remember the F-5E/F, which is now retiring? Huang Yang-te pointed out that when the F-5E/F was most active in Taiwan, five air force units used it. If you don't count the 737th Wing (now the 7th Wing), which trained pilots, four combat units used the F-5E/F. He called the F-5E/F "a main fighter jet that isn't a main fighter jet."

**F-5E/F Assembly in Taiwan Laid Foundation for Aerospace Industry**

The Air Force held a ceremony today at Hualien Air Base to retire the RF-5E reconnaissance aircraft, marking the end of the F-5E/F fighter jet's service in Taiwan's skies. Ho Pao-hua, former Vice President of AIDC (Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation), said that assembling the F-5E/F in Taiwan helped Taiwan's aircraft manufacturing "jump from propeller planes to supersonic jets." It moved from old workshops to modern engineering and scientific management, especially benefiting AIDC with American quality control systems.

Ho Pao-hua was interviewed in Taichung City's Shuinan area. According to history, about 60 years ago, this was where the "Aeronautical Industrial Development Center" (AIDC), the predecessor of AIDC, was located. Compared to today's tall, modern aircraft factories, the AIDC park still has many old, historical buildings. Time seems to stand still in the last century, showing where Taiwan's aerospace industry began.

The project to assemble F-5E/F fighter jets in Taiwan was called "Peace Tiger," because the F-5 was nicknamed "Tiger." According to AIDC information, the international situation was unclear back then, especially after the Republic of China left the United Nations in 1971. Taiwan faced the threat of military attack from China, and the air force mostly relied on foreign countries (the U.S.) for fighter jets. It was also getting harder to buy high-performance aircraft. To keep the Fuxing base safe, they decided to both "develop their own" and "cooperate in production."

Ho Pao-hua was born in Taiwan in 1956. He comes from a family of aircraft makers; his grandfather and father worked in aircraft factories in mainland China. After the government moved to Taiwan, his family flew to Taichung Shuinan Airport and settled there. After his military service, his first and only job, which he loved until he retired, was at the AIDC aircraft manufacturing plant.

The "Peace Tiger" project began in 1973. It was divided into 6 main parts, but the actual production was done in 7 steps (Phases) to match Taiwan's manufacturing abilities. The last plane was made at the end of 1986. In total, 242 single-seat F-5E planes and 66 two-seat F-5F planes were produced, making 308 fighter jets.

Looking back at this production plan that lasted over 10 years, Ho Pao-hua believes that working with American companies to produce F-5E/F fighter jets was like "jumping from propeller planes to supersonic jets." It truly helped train aerospace talent in Taiwan and improved AIDC's tools and equipment.

When Ho Pao-hua started working at AIDC in late 1979, the "Peace Tiger" project was already in "Peace Tiger Phase Three." They were making honeycomb parts for the fifth stage (Phase-V), such as the fighter jet's spine cover, aileron trailing edge flaps, and rudder parts. The reason for having 7 phases was that the U.S. needed to gradually increase Taiwan's ability to make planes, based on the manufacturing capacity at that time.

He remembered that most of the leaders at AIDC back then were military personnel, and they had not done much international cooperation. Before this, they had only made slow propeller planes like the PL-1 Chieh Shou primary trainer, the T-CH-1 Chung Hsing trainer, and had worked with Bell Helicopter from the U.S. to make UH-1H helicopters.

He smiled as he remembered that now everyone knows about CNC computer-controlled milling machines. But back then, many of the tools in the factory were brought from mainland China by plane. They came from many different countries, and you could even see Soviet-made tools being used in the factory. Simply put, it was "handmade metal parts, crafted by skilled workers!"

The first phase of the Peace Tiger project was learning how to assemble. Ho Pao-hua added that because they started from scratch, all fighter jet parts came from the U.S. AIDC just "assembled" them following drawings and technical guidance, with only 9% of parts made locally. Then, it took nearly 10 years to gradually move to the seventh phase (Phase-VII), which included making wing parts, increasing the local production rate to 47%.

He further explained that a propeller plane's skin is a thin metal sheet (aluminum). But an F-5 is a supersonic plane, so its metal skin must be thicker. This skin connects to the plane's structure and needs to handle strong forces and pressure during high-speed flight. Also, the wingtips might vibrate slightly up and down during flight. So, when they make the skin, they must first reduce its stress, otherwise, it will break from the stress points after flying for a long time.

For AIDC, which was still like a workshop at the time, these were all new production challenges. He revealed that AIDC bought a 50-meter-long milling machine from an American company just to mill the F-5E/F fighter jet's wing skin and main beams. From Peace Tiger Phase Three onwards, the U.S. agreed to buy back 66 F-5E front fuselages made by AIDC for other F-5E countries, which showed that Taiwan's manufacturing quality was recognized by the U.S.

For Ho Pao-hua, who spent almost his entire career in aircraft production, the Peace Tiger project not only laid the foundation for fighter jet production in Taiwan but, more importantly, it taught Taiwan about quality management systems and "international thinking."

He used the F-5 fighter jet wing as an example. He said that the first wing, the second, and the third should ideally be exactly the same for them to be interchangeable. But back then, there would be small differences (tolerances) in what they produced. This meant that wings from different fighter jets could not be swapped. The solution they found was that the U.S. would first make a master tool when producing. Then, they would use this master tool to create assembly jigs, and these jigs would then be used to assemble the wings. This way, they could achieve interchangeable parts.

Because they learned this idea of using master tools, Ho Pao-hua, who helped produce the AT-3 wing, said that the AT-3 first had master tools. So, its wings, landing gear doors, and even the pylons for weapons could be swapped. Of course, a few parts couldn't be swapped due to the technology limits at the time. But it was different for the IDF Ching-kuo fighter jet; most of its parts could be swapped.

Besides the idea of using master tools for quality control, he compared it to how computer technology keeps getting better. The technology from 40 years ago is old now. But assembling F-5 fighter jets helped create the idea of manufacturing feasibility assessment. This means that the spirit of improving quality and lowering costs became a deep part of AIDC's culture and later, the restructured AIDC company.

For him personally, it helped him develop an international outlook. Ho Pao-hua explained that when making the IDF Ching-kuo fighter jet, they worked with General Dynamics from the U.S. Because they had worked with Northrop Grumman from the U.S. to produce F-5E/F fighter jets before, they felt "less nervous" when working with General Dynamics. This led to the successful mass production of the IDF Ching-kuo fighter jet. It was these experiences that later allowed AIDC to successfully develop the Brave Eagle advanced jet trainer in just three and a half years.

Looking back at the process of assembling the F-5 fighter jets, Ho Pao-hua believes that because AIDC built an advanced quality management system, the reorganized AIDC company was able to get orders for ODM (original design manufacturer) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) contracts from international companies like Boeing and Airbus after the mass production of the IDF Ching-kuo fighter jet ended. Also, when they were mass-producing F-5E/F fighter jets, to make more planes, they started working with local and foreign subcontractors. This helped local companies enter the aerospace industry and built Taiwan's aerospace supply chain, benefiting those companies and making Taiwan an important part of the global aerospace industry.
