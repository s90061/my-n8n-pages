            <h1>After Hyundai Raid, "Border Czar" Says More Companies Will Face US Immigration Enforcement</h1>
            <p>After the U.S. government raided a Hyundai facility in Georgia and arrested hundreds of people recently, a high-ranking official in the White House said today that the government will increase immigration enforcement actions against more companies in the future.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Tom Homan, the White House "border czar," said on CNN's "State of the Union" program that the government will focus on checking workplaces for illegal immigrants.</p>
            <p>Homan said, "We will do more enforcement actions in workplaces. Nobody hires illegal foreign workers because they are kind. They hire them because these workers can do harder jobs, get paid less, and this makes it harder for companies that hire American citizens to compete."</p>
            <p>People who do not agree with Trump's strict immigration policies and some business groups say that important American industries, like farming, hospitality, and meat processing, rely on migrant workers who do not have legal status in the U.S.</p>
            <p>On September 4, U.S. immigration officers raided a Hyundai facility and arrested 475 people for breaking immigration laws. Most of these people were from South Korea. The South Korean government said today that these workers will go back to their country after their paperwork is finished.</p>

            <h1>Trump Gives Hamas "Final Warning" to Accept Conditions for Releasing Hostages</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump today gave what he called a "final warning" to Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic group. He urged the armed group to agree to a deal to release hostages from Gaza.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social: "Israel has agreed to my terms, and now it is time for Hamas to agree too. I have warned Hamas about what will happen if they do not agree. This is my last warning, there will not be another one!"</p>
            <p>N12 News in Israel reported yesterday that Trump had offered Hamas a new ceasefire plan.</p>
            <p>According to N12, this deal includes Hamas releasing all 48 hostages still held on the first day of the ceasefire. In return, Israel would release thousands of Palestinian prisoners. Both sides would also talk about ending the war during the ceasefire.</p>
            <p>An Israeli official said that Israel is "seriously thinking about" Trump's plan, but did not give more details.</p>

            <h1>Trump Attends U.S. Open at Rolex's Invitation, Not Affected by 39% Tariff on Switzerland</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Trump went to the men's singles final of the U.S. Open tennis tournament today, invited by the Swiss luxury watch brand Rolex. This happened even though he raised tariffs on Switzerland greatly in early August.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that since Trump returned to the White House, his schedule within the country has mostly involved going to big sports events. He has not traveled around to announce policies or give speeches at large gatherings, which he liked to do during his campaign.</p>
            <p>Today, Trump will watch the match from Rolex's special box. The defending champion, 24-year-old Italian star Jannik Sinner, will play against the second-seeded player, 22-year-old Spanish talent Carlos Alcaraz.</p>
            <p>Just a few weeks ago, Trump's government put a high tariff of 39% on Swiss goods. This rate is more than two and a half times what the U.S. agreed to with the European Union (EU), and almost four times the rate for the UK. This made people wonder if Switzerland could still compete with the nearby 27-country EU.</p>
            <p>The White House did not want to comment on Trump accepting an invitation from a company client to attend the U.S. Open. However, Trump has often not cared about making the line blurry between decisions for politics or foreign policy and decisions to make his family's businesses more money.</p>
