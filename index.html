Oil prices went down for the second day in a row. This happened because people expect OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies) to agree to produce more oil soon.

Also, new taxes threatened by US President Trump made people less likely to buy risky things, which also caused oil prices to fall.

In New York, the price of West Texas oil for August was US$66.50 per barrel, down 0.7%. In London, the price of Brent oil for September was US$68.30 per barrel, also down 0.7%.

**Ukraine Shoots Down Russian Drones; Zelenskyy Calls for More Production**

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that special drones successfully shot down many Russian drones during an attack on Kyiv last night. He called for these interceptor drones to be made and developed more quickly.

Zelenskyy said this long attack was one of the biggest in the 40-month war, with over 500 drones and missiles. He noted that "a large part" of them were shot down.

He also stated, "Our interceptor drones brought important results today. They shot down tens of 'Shahed' drones." Zelenskyy emphasized that they are working to produce more of these drones and train more drone operators. He has been focused on drone production since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Recently, he has highlighted the need for interceptor drones to defend against Russia's growing number of drone and missile attacks.

**US Plans to Control AI Chip Sales to Malaysia and Thailand to Stop Them Reaching China**

The US government, led by President Trump, is planning to limit how companies like Nvidia sell AI chips to Malaysia and Thailand. This is to prevent these chips from being sent to China indirectly.

Bloomberg reported that the US Commerce Department is working on a rule to stop China from getting these important AI parts through countries in Southeast Asia. The US has already stopped selling advanced AI chips directly to China.

People familiar with the plan said the rule is not yet final and could change. Officials want to add these new rules for Malaysia and Thailand to existing global rules about AI technology. These older rules were suggested by the previous US President Biden's team and were not popular with other countries and tech companies like Nvidia.

The US will keep its current limits on chip sales to China from 2022 and another rule from 2023 that affects over 40 other countries. These rules were made to stop chips from being sold illegally.

This new rule would be the first step for Trump's government to change the previous AI plans. However, sources said this new rule is not a complete solution. It doesn't answer questions about using US chips in data centers in other countries, which is important for the Middle East. It is also not clear if more countries will be included in these restrictions.

The US Commerce Department, along with the governments of Thailand and Malaysia, did not comment on this news. Nvidia also chose not to comment. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, has previously stated that there is "no evidence" of AI chips being moved illegally.
