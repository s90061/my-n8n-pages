  <h2 style="color: #333;">China May Invite Trump to Beijing Parade on September 3</h2>

  <p>China is planning to invite former US President Donald Trump to a big event in Beijing on September 3. This event will celebrate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, with a special parade in Tiananmen Square.</p>

  <p>Sources say that the US has suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping visit the US in September, which is when the United Nations General Assembly will be held in New York. If either of these visits happens, it would be the first time the leaders of the world's two biggest economies meet face-to-face since Trump started his second term.</p>

  <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is also expected to be at the parade in Beijing. China's Foreign Ministry said that Xi invited Trump to China on June 5, and Trump thanked him and invited Xi to visit the US in return. However, some US officials, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, might not want Trump to go to the parade. China is also careful about Xi visiting the US, as they don't want a difficult meeting like the one between Ukraine's President Zelenskyy and Trump in February. Because of this, China is thinking about sending Premier Li Qiang to the UN meeting instead of Xi.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #333;">NBA: LeBron James to Stay with Lakers for Record 23rd Season</h2>

  <p>LeBron James, a famous basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers, will continue to play for the team. His agent, Rich Paul, told ESPN that James has decided to use his player option for the 2025-26 season. This means he will play and earn $52.6 million.</p>

  <p>The next season will be James's 23rd in the NBA, which is a new record for the league. Paul said that James wants to win more championships in the coming years. He will be watching closely to see if the Lakers build a team that can win a championship.</p>

  <p>James is 40 years old and has scored more points than anyone else in NBA history. He had said before that he wasn't sure if the current season would be his last or if he would play for many more years.</p>

  <h2 style="color: #333;">TikTok in US: Trump Says He Has Found Rich Buyers</h2>

  <p>TikTok, a popular video app owned by China's ByteDance, might be banned in the United States if it is not sold. The time limit for this sale has been made longer three times already. Former U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview today that he has found people to buy TikTok.</p>

  <p>Trump told Fox News Channel that he found a group of "very rich people" who want to buy the app. He also said he might need permission from Chinese President Xi Jinping for the sale to happen, and he believes President Xi might agree to it.</p>

  <p>Trump did not give many details about the buyers, but he said he would announce them in about two weeks. A U.S. law says TikTok must be sold because of worries about national security, or it will be banned in the country. This law was supposed to start the day before Trump became president in January, but the deadline has been moved several times.</p>
