            <h1>Hezbollah to Ignore Lebanese Government's Order to Disarm by Year-End</h1>
            <p>(Beirut, August 6, Central News Agency) The government of Lebanon decided yesterday to ask its army to make a plan. This plan is to disarm Hezbollah, a strong group supported by Iran, by the end of this year. Today, Hezbollah said they will not follow this decision. They also said that the government's decision makes Lebanon weaker.</p>
            <p>Reporters from AFP said that the Lebanese government made this difficult decision yesterday. It came after almost six hours of talks. The talks were led by President Joseph Aoun and happened because of strong pressure from the United States.</p>
            <p>This decision also means that a ceasefire agreement between Lebanon and Israel from November last year will be put into action. That agreement was made to stop more than a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel. This fighting included two months of full war. After the war, Hezbollah became much weaker. Their weapons were badly damaged, and many of their top leaders were killed.</p>
            <p>Lebanon's Prime Minister, Nawaf Salam, said at a press conference yesterday after the meeting that the government has asked the army to present a plan by the end of this month. This plan will be discussed and approved by the government. The main goal is for only the national army and other state forces to have weapons by the end of the year.</p>
            <p>However, Lebanon's Information Minister, Paul Morcos, said that two ministers left the meeting because they did not agree with the government's decision. These were Health Minister Rakan Nassereldine, who is connected to Hezbollah, and Environment Minister Tamara Elzein, who is connected to Amal Movement, a group that supports Hezbollah.</p>
            <p>Hezbollah is the only group in Lebanon that still has weapons after the civil war from 1975 to 1990. They say they keep weapons to fight Israel, which occupied southern Lebanon until 2000.</p>
            <p>During the government meeting yesterday, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem spoke on TV. He said that they would not give up their weapons as long as Israel's attacks continue.</p>
            <p>Today, Hezbollah released another statement. They said they would "not care about" the government's decision. They also said, "The Salam government's decision to make Lebanon give up its weapons to fight enemies like Israel is a big mistake. This hurts Lebanon's power and lets Israel do whatever it wants with our safety, land, politics, and future."</p>
            <p>Hezbollah has been the most powerful political group in Lebanon for a long time. People who are against them say they use their weapons to force their ideas in the country's government. But after the recent fighting with Israel, Hezbollah's power has become less.</p>

            <h1>Philippine President Marcos: Philippines Cannot Stay Out If Conflict Happens in Taiwan Strait</h1>
            <p>(New Delhi, August 6, Central News Agency) The situation in the Taiwan Strait is becoming more tense. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. spoke in an interview with Indian media. He said that if a fight breaks out between China and Taiwan, the Philippines "cannot stay out." He also said that countries need to form groups to deal with dangers in the Indo-Pacific area.</p>
            <p>Marcos arrived in India on August 4 for a five-day visit. In an interview with India's "Firstpost," he said it is very important to form strong partnerships with countries like India that share similar ideas. This is to keep the area safe.</p>
            <p>Marcos said, "If a full war starts, we will definitely be pulled into it. We will have to go into Taiwan to bring our people home." He also said that many Filipinos live in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>When asked if the Philippines would let the United States use its military bases if something happens in Taiwan, Marcos replied, "Why would we say no to a friend who is facing threats from China? We are not a puppet country. It is our job to protect our country."</p>
            <p>Without directly naming China, Marcos also said that it is important to create a group of countries around the world that respect international law and are against changing borders without agreement. He said, "No country can protect these ideas alone. We need to work together."</p>
            <p>About the idea of an "Asian NATO," Marcos said that ASEAN, the group of Southeast Asian nations that exists now, might not be enough to deal with all the challenges in the region.</p>
            <p>He said, "One country cannot solve global problems alone." The Philippines is happy that India is becoming more important in the Indo-Pacific area.</p>

            <h1>White House Says Apple Will Promise $100 Billion for US Manufacturing</h1>
            <p>(Washington, August 6, Central News Agency) Officials from the White House said that Apple Inc. will announce today a promise to spend $100 billion on making things in the United States. This is meant to bring more manufacturing jobs back to America.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, the official, who did not want to be named, said that this new promise from Apple is more money than they had already promised before.</p>
            <p>In February, Apple said it would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years. This includes building a very large factory for making Artificial Intelligence (AI) servers in Texas. They also plan to create 20,000 new research and development jobs across the country.</p>
            <p>Apple did not answer requests for comments right away.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Kevin Hassett, a White House economic advisor, also said that Apple would likely announce an investment today.</p>
            <p>Hassett said in an interview with Fox Business Network, "They are coming here in big numbers. There are promises of trillions of dollars to build factories here. In fact, you might see Apple announce something today."</p>
