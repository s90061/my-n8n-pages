            <h1>Many Countries, Including Brazil, Walk Out During Israeli Prime Minister's UN Speech</h1>
            <p>Today, at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, the Brazilian group, along with other countries, left the room before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu started speaking. They did this to show they were unhappy with Israel's military actions in Gaza.</p>
            <p>News from CNN Brazil and other sources said that people close to the Brazilian government called this walkout a "planned political statement." It was meant to show disagreement with Israel's actions in the Middle East conflict. Besides Brazil, groups from Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Venezuela also left their seats, leaving many empty.</p>
            <p>The Iranian group even put pictures of child victims on their seats to protest Israel's military actions in Gaza. During the speech, some people clapped while others booed. This showed that countries have different ideas about Israel's policies.</p>
            <p>Brazil has usually stayed neutral on issues in the Middle East. But in recent years, as world events and politics in Brazil changed, Brazil has started to show stronger views in places like the United Nations. This walkout is a clear message from Brazil's foreign affairs department about Israel's policies.</p>
            <p>Brazil's President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, has openly criticized Israel's actions in Gaza. He also supports the United Nations recognizing Palestine as a country. During the UN General Assembly, the Brazilian group's walkout was not just a protest against Netanyahu's personal views, but also a rejection of Israel's overall policies.</p>
            <p>Brazilian news said that this protest might make Israel more isolated from other countries. The International Criminal Court has already issued a warrant to arrest Netanyahu, saying he committed crimes against humanity in Gaza. The United Nations also passed a resolution, which is not legally binding, asking Israel to recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>For Brazil, this action might make it a stronger moral leader among countries in the Global South. However, it might also cause arguments with Israel and countries that support Israel.</p>
            <p>Reports say that this protest at the UN General Assembly is more than just a diplomatic action. It shows how the world's opinions on the Middle East conflict are changing. Brazil's choice might show how a new big country tries to balance what is right with what is real in its foreign policy.</p>

            <h1>Foreign Media: ByteDance Keeps Big Control and Shares Profits in TikTok's US Business</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 26 â€“ People who know about the deal say that ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, will still own some parts of TikTok's business in the US. But a new joint team will control TikTok's data, content, and the computer programs (algorithms) that decide what users see. ByteDance will still get at least half of the profits from the US business.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that ByteDance will have a bigger role than expected in how TikTok runs in the US. This shows that the big Chinese technology company will still be very involved in TikTok's US operations and will earn a lot of money from it.</p>
            <p>One US financial news group said that the new joint team will rent a copy of the algorithms from ByteDance. Then, Oracle, a US company, will "start from scratch" to train these algorithms again. The information of US users will be kept safe in a special cloud system managed by Oracle. ByteDance will not be able to get information about TikTok's US users or control the algorithms in the US.</p>
            <p>Sources said that ByteDance can get money from licensing fees for providing copies of the algorithms to the US team. They will also get profits based on how much of the company they own. Overall, after the new owners take over TikTok in the US, ByteDance will still receive 50% or more of the total profits from the US business.</p>
            <p>On September 25, US President Trump signed an order. It said that TikTok's US business must be sold to a group including Oracle, Silver Lake, and other investors. This was to meet rules about national security.</p>
            <p>However, the ownership details that are now coming out might make people in the US Congress and critics question if Trump's deal follows the "sell or ban" law passed in 2024.</p>
            <p>Last April, the US Congress strongly passed a law called the "Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act" (also known as "sell or ban"). President Biden signed it that same month. This law required ByteDance to sell its US business, or TikTok would be banned.</p>
            <p>People familiar with the situation said that the US version of TikTok will be separated into two companies. The joint team announced by Trump will be in charge of US user data and algorithms. Another company, fully owned by ByteDance, will manage income-generating parts like advertising and e-commerce.</p>
            <p>Chinese news also reported this two-part structure on September 26. They said ByteDance would keep control of TikTok's brand, e-commerce, and international connections in the US. The new joint team would handle user data and algorithms. However, reports from "LatePost" and "Caixin" about this were later removed.</p>
            <p>For Trump, it was very important for TikTok to continue working in the US. He often said that the platform helped him reach young voters and partly credited TikTok's 170 million US users for his win last year. His own TikTok account has 15 million followers, and the White House also opened an official TikTok account last month.</p>
            <p>After Reuters shared this news, John Moolenaar, a Republican member of the House of Representatives and chairman of the "House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party," said he would carefully watch this deal. He stressed that the deal should "remove any working links between the new company and ByteDance."</p>
            <p>Moolenaar said, "The law clearly stops ByteDance from working with any team that takes over TikTok on the very important algorithms."</p>
