            <h1>New Taipei Tracking Platform Manages Flow of Incineration Recycled Materials</h1>
            <p>The New Taipei City Environmental Protection Department announced today that it has created an "Incineration Recycled Materials Tracking and Management Platform." This platform uses digital methods and geographical information to fully track where recycled materials from its three incinerators go. It also encourages the use of recycled materials instead of sand and gravel in public building projects.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department told a reporter today that as places for burying trash are getting full, finding ways to turn ash from incinerators into useful resources is a common challenge for all cities and counties. New Taipei has three incinerators in Xindian, Shulin, and Bali. The ash from these incinerators must go through steps like crushing, sorting, and using magnets to remove unwanted parts. The material that is left is called "incineration recycled material."</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department stated that the "Incineration Recycled Materials Tracking and Management Platform" controls the ash and recycled materials from the three incinerators using digital tools. It records and tracks each group from when it is made, transported, processed, reused, to its final treatment, all in real time. This lowers office work and staffing costs. It also creates a good system for warnings and planning, giving full control over where the incineration recycled materials are used.</p>
            <p>Because building companies, inspection teams, and main departments can quickly get the newest information, each group of recycled materials has an "identity card." This makes sure they are used correctly in public projects and stops them from going into sensitive areas where they could cause pollution.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Department said that in the last two years, New Taipei City has made about 110,000 metric tons of incineration recycled materials each year on average. The average amount used each year is about 148,000 metric tons. This means more is used than made. All of it is used in public projects, mostly for filling in pipe trenches with low-strength material. A small part is used for road base layers and strong concrete bricks. If there are any extra incineration recycled materials in the future, they will ask to use them for making new land at Taipei Port.</p>
            <p>Before using incineration recycled materials, it is important to check if the way they are used and their location follow the rules from the Ministry of Environment. The Environmental Protection Department said that New Taipei's recycled materials have not gone into sensitive natural areas. This not only makes the circular economy work better but also helps the city move towards "2050 net-zero carbon emissions."</p>

            <h1>iTunes Out of Control in the Brain: A Musical Explores Modern People's Difficulties</h1>
            <p>The National Theater Group is putting on a musical called "iTunes Out of Control in the Brain." It will begin during the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday. The talented musician Lin Yi-hsin and Lin Chun-yi, known as the "King of Impersonations," are working together again. They will show the problems that people today face.</p>
            <p>At the practice press conference, Lin Chun-yi showed his skills as the "King of Impersonations." In just three minutes, he quickly changed into four well-known characters, also changing his clothes fast. Everyone there was very surprised.</p>
            <p>According to the National Theater Group's press release, "iTunes Out of Control in the Brain" has been very popular since it first showed. This time, the rerun will have the same main actors. It will also include the talented actress Hsiao Hsun (Huang Ching-yi) and the lovely singer Angie An Ji. They will bring new energy to the stage.</p>
            <p>The director, Hsieh Nien-tzu, said: "Hsiao Hsun shows a woman's feelings of love and wanting to be with someone. This makes people feel sad for her. Angie An Ji's fun and unique character is very appealing. These new people joining the show make it deeper and more interesting."</p>
            <p>When talking about their first time in the show, Hsiao Hsun laughed. She said that before the first show in Hsinchu, even after a lot of practice, she was very nervous. She kept repeating her lines, dance steps, and songs. Angie An Ji shared: "My lips were shaking before I went on stage. But luckily, my teammates were very strong, which made me feel much calmer." They both hope to feel less nervous this time in Taipei and truly enjoy their time on stage.</p>
            <p>"iTunes Out of Control in the Brain" tells the story of an unlucky girl who is hit by lightning. After this, she cannot stop hearing music in her brain. She meets a famous singer who has lost his ability to make music. With the help of a psychiatrist, they both find their way back to music and a clear direction in life from their confused thoughts. Hsieh Nien-tzu said that this show seems light and funny. But it actually has deep ideas about mental health and the stress that modern people feel.</p>
            <p>"iTunes Out of Control in the Brain" will be performed from the 3rd to the 5th at the Taipei City Stage.</p>

            <h1>World's Richest Man Elon Musk's Net Worth Breaks US$500 Billion, First Person in History</h1>
            <p>New York, October 1 (Central News Agency) - Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, saw his personal wealth go over US$500 billion today. He is the first rich person to reach this amount. Musk's money grew mostly because Tesla's stock price went up again. Also, his other new companies were valued much higher this year.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that, according to the Forbes list of billionaires, at 4:15 PM Eastern Time, Elon Musk's wealth reached US$501 billion (about NT$15,211 billion). This made him the first billionaire to pass the US$500 billion mark.</p>
            <p>Musk's wealth is very much connected to Tesla. As of September 15, Musk owned more than 12.4% of Tesla's shares. Tesla's stock price has gone up by more than 14% since the start of the year. Today, it went up by 3.3% when the market closed. This added over US$6 billion to Musk's wealth in just one day.</p>
            <p>Tesla's stock price moved a lot at the beginning of this year. But as Musk started to focus on his business again, investors felt more sure, and the stock price began to rise. Robyn Denholm, Tesla's chairperson, said last month that Musk had returned to the company's main work after working for the White House for several months.</p>
            <p>A few days later, Musk also announced that he bought about US$1 billion worth of Tesla stock. This showed that he believed in the company's future. Tesla is now working hard to change from a car company to a leader in artificial intelligence (AI) and robots.</p>
            <p>This year, Tesla did not perform as well as the "Magnificent Seven" technology companies in the US stock market. Last month, the board of directors suggested a very large pay plan of US$1 trillion. This plan set very high goals for money and operations. It also answered Musk's request to own more of the company.</p>
            <p>In addition, the value of Musk's AI startup company, xAI, and his space travel company, SpaceX, also increased this year.</p>
            <p>According to Pitchbook, a company that studies financial data, xAI was valued at US$75 billion in its newest valuation in July this year. CNBC, a financial news channel, reported last month that xAI's value could go up to US$200 billion after it gets more money. But Musk said that the company is not getting more money right now.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported in July that SpaceX was talking about getting more money and plans for people inside the company to sell their shares. The total value of the company was thought to be about US$400 billion.</p>
            <p>Larry Ellison, who started Oracle, had a personal wealth of US$350.7 billion today. He is second only to Musk on the Forbes list of billionaires.</p>
