            <h1>Thai Woman Tried to Smuggle 15 kg of Marijuana into Taiwan, Now Charged</h1>
            <p>Customs officials and airport police recently checked a passenger's luggage at Taoyuan Airport. They used an X-ray machine. They saw something strange in a bag sent from Thailand. When the passenger came to pick up her bag, they stopped her. They found 15.039 kilograms of marijuana inside. The woman was charged with breaking drug laws.</p>
            <p>Captain Chang Tsung-lung from the Aviation Police Bureau spoke to the media today. He said that on June 3rd, airport police and Taipei Customs checked luggage at Taoyuan International Airport. They saw a strange image from a Thai tourist's (named P, changed for privacy) suitcase on the X-ray. When they opened it, they found 26 packs of marijuana, which is a Class 2 drug. It weighed 15.039 kilograms. They quickly reported it to the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office to start an investigation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chang said that the investigation team found that the 27-year-old Ms. P flew from Bangkok, Thailand, to Taiwan. Her family had money problems. Police believe a drug group used her to bring drugs to Taiwan, pretending she was a tourist. She tried to hide the drugs by acting like a normal visitor. But Ms. P said she was just helping a friend bring the bag to Taiwan and did not get paid. She tried to avoid punishment this way.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chang added that the investigation team caught the drugs in time. They stopped the drugs from going into the market. The case was sent to the Taoyuan District Prosecutors Office because she broke drug laws. She was charged in mid-August. The airport police will continue to work hard to stop drugs at the border. They want to remind everyone that carrying Class 2 drugs can lead to a life sentence in prison or at least 10 years in jail. Also, there can be a fine of up to NT$15 million. They ask people not to break the law.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Health Continues Doctor Training Plan; Medical Groups Say Policy Changes Too Often</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare has decided to continue a plan for government-funded doctors in important medical fields. Doctors' groups are very unhappy. They say the government changes its mind too often and cannot be trusted. They believe that training more government-funded doctors will not solve the problem of not having enough doctors in special fields. They think this will create big problems for healthcare in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Health and Welfare started the "Plan for Training Government-Funded Doctors in Important Medical Fields" in 2016. This was to help rural areas and special medical fields that do not have enough doctors. The second part of this plan will finish in the 2025-2026 school year.</p>
            <p>Now, the government has decided to continue the plan. The Minister of Health and Welfare, Shih Chung-liang, told the media yesterday why. He said it is because rural areas still need doctors. Also, there is a new need for doctors in many different areas of medicine.</p>
            <p>After this news came out, many doctors' groups strongly disagreed. The National Federation of Physicians' Associations immediately shared three main worries about continuing the plan. First, they said the policy changes too much, which makes people lose trust. Two months ago, the government said it would stop the plan and not continue it. Now, they are doing the opposite, which makes the government less believable. It also makes doctors and the public confused.</p>
            <p>Second, they said the current system for judging doctors is not used, which means places for students are frozen. Third, government-funded doctor spots are planned for certain periods, and extending them is not the right way to fix things. The Federation of Physicians' Associations strongly asked that the number of medical students should be decided based on Taiwan's long-term needs for doctors and expert opinions. They said it should not change often because of short-term government plans.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Primary Care Association also spoke out today. They questioned if the government is trying to solve the problem of not having enough doctors in difficult and rare medical fields by training more government-funded doctors. They called this "looking for fish in a tree," meaning it won't work. To truly solve the shortage of doctors in difficult medical fields, the government should increase their salaries. They should not force more government-funded students to enter these fields with low-pay contracts.</p>
            <p>The Primary Care Association thinks that doctors in difficult and rare medical fields are in short supply because they work many shifts, face high risks, get paid less, and have a poor quality of life. Their income is not fair compared to doctors in less risky fields. Adding more government-funded students to these difficult fields will only make doctors' rights ignored, causing them to leave and change jobs.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Medical Association also shared many worries. They said that the system for government-funded medical students has been criticized for many years. This includes very long contract periods (10 years), strict punishments for breaking contracts, and doctors being unhappy with medical conditions in rural areas. This means that after their contract ends, few doctors stay. So, the plan does not have the good effect it claims to have.</p>
            <p>The Taipei Medical Association stated that the government's recent announcement shows they have not thought enough about the future need for medical staff in rural areas. They made this important long-term plan for training people based only on a quick feeling about the current shortage, without asking medical groups and experts enough. Because Taiwanese people really want to become doctors, the government will probably still attract young students. But this will definitely create problems for Taiwan's healthcare system in the future.</p>
