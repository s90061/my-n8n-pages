            <p>Jerusalem/Cairo, July 24 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, Israel and the United States called back their teams that were talking about a ceasefire in Gaza. They did this to get advice. The US special envoy, Steve Witkoff, also said that the Palestinian group Hamas was not serious during the talks.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Witkoff put a statement on social media platform X. He said, "Even though the people helping with the talks worked very hard, Hamas seems to lack teamwork and is not being serious. Now, we will look at other ways to bring the hostages home and try to make things more stable for the people in Gaza."</p>
            <p>After nearly two years of fighting between Israel and Hamas, the situation for people in Gaza has become much worse. Israelis are also worried about the hostages still held there. Both sides are under pressure from inside and outside to reach an agreement.</p>
            <p>People who are helping with the talks continue to try to get an agreement for a ceasefire. They also want to free the hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.</p>
            <p>According to health officials in Gaza, many tens of people have died from hunger there in the past few weeks.</p>

            <h1>Trump Says He Does Not Want to Destroy Elon Musk's Companies, Hopes All US Businesses Do Well</h1>
            <p>Washington, July 24 (Central News Agency) â€“ US President Donald Trump today said he does not want to destroy the companies of tech billionaire Elon Musk. This comes as people are wondering if Trump supports US government groups working with companies owned by Musk, who is also the head of the electric car company Tesla.</p>
            <p>The Hill newspaper reported that Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social: "Everyone says that I will destroy his companies by stopping some or all of the large financial help the US government gives to Elon Musk. This is not true!"</p>
            <p>He continued to write: "I want Elon and all companies in our country to do very well, even better than before! The better they do, the better America does, and that is good for all of us. We are setting new records every day, and I want that to continue!"</p>
            <p>Trump said these things one day after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said she did not think Trump supported the US government signing a contract with Musk's Artificial Intelligence (AI) company, xAI.</p>
            <p>When asked if Trump wanted the government to cancel the recent contract with xAI, Leavitt said she would talk to the President about it.</p>

            <h1>Wrestling Legend Hulk Hogan Dies at 71</h1>
            <p>New York, July 24 (Central News Agency) â€“ World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) announced today that Hulk Hogan, a big star in American sports and entertainment, has died at 71 years old. During his life, he made professional wrestling famous around the world and openly supported Donald Trump when he ran for US President. Trump later wrote a message to show his sadness.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that WWE wrote on social media platform X: "WWE is sad to announce that Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan has passed away. Hogan was one of the most famous faces in popular culture and helped WWE become known around the world in the 1980s." The post did not say why he died.</p>
            <p>This strong man with light blonde hair and a tan body became the main face of professional wrestling in the 1980s. He helped wrestling change from a low-class show into a multi-billion dollar entertainment that families could enjoy.</p>
            <p>The 1987 "WrestleMania III" event was a very important moment in this change. That year, Hulk Hogan used a powerful body slam on the French wrestler AndrÃ© the Giant in the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan, which was full of people.</p>
            <p>Hulk Hogan also used his fame from wrestling to go into Hollywood, but he was not very successful. He was in movies like "Rocky III," but he kept returning to the wrestling ring when his body allowed it.</p>
            <p>He was added to the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005.</p>
            <p>Last year, Hulk Hogan went to the Republican National Convention (RNC) to support Donald Trump running for president again. At that time, Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt to show a Trump vest underneath. He then yelled to the cheering crowd: "Let Trumpamania rule again!"</p>
            <p>After news of Hulk Hogan's death, Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social, "Today, we lost a good friend." He also said that "Hulk Hogan always supported MAGA (Make America Great Again) â€“ strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart."</p>
            <p>US Vice President JD Vance also wrote on X: "Hulk Hogan was a great American hero. He was one of the first people I truly looked up to when I was a child. The last time we met, we planned to have a beer next time. We will have to meet on the other side, my friend! Rest in peace."</p>
