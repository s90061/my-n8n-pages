            <h1>Putin Says US Uses Ukraine War to Pressure Brazil, But Real Goal is to Meddle in Its Politics</h1>
            <p>Today, Russian President Vladimir Putin openly criticized the American government. He said that the US is using the war in Ukraine to put unfair trade taxes on Brazil. He believes the real reason for these actions is not about global politics, but about political problems inside Brazil.</p>
            <p>CNN Brazil reported that Putin attended an event in China to remember 80 years since the end of World War II. At a press conference, he stated that trade between Brazil and the US is balanced. He disagreed with the US saying that high taxes are fair because of unequal trade.</p>
            <p>Even though the law signed by US President Donald Trump to put a 50% tax on Brazil did not directly mention the Ukraine war, Brazil has recently bought much more oil and fertilizer from Russia. It has become one of the main buyers of Russian oil. According to Brazil's Ministry of Industry, Trade, and Services, Brazil's imports of diesel from Russia increased a lot. It went from 16.9 million US dollars in 2021 to 5.3 billion US dollars in 2024. This is more than 300 times higher.</p>
            <p>Lourival Sant'Anna, a CNN international analyst, said that the US might put trade restrictions on Brazil's Russian oil imports as early as next week. Something similar happened to India. The US raised taxes from 25% to 50% because of India's cooperation with Moscow.</p>
            <p>Putin said that the US's actions are not truly about the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Instead, he believes the US is using the war as an excuse to get involved in Brazil's internal affairs. He pointed out that Brazil is currently facing political problems, especially between the current government and former President Jair Bolsonaro. He said these problems have nothing to do with Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, Trump sent a letter to Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. In the letter, Trump called Bolsonaro's trial a "witch hunt." He also accused Brazil of stopping American citizens from having free speech and fair elections. The US government also used the "Magnitsky Act" to punish Brazil's Supreme Court Justice Alexandre Moraes. They said he used harsh checks, held people without reason, and made political judgments.</p>
            <p>Because the US is putting high taxes on Brazil, saying it is because of the war, the Brazilian government has officially started steps to respond. It also wants to work with BRICS countries to change the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. This is to protect its own power and fair international trade. Even though businesses worry that these actions might make trade problems worse, the Brazilian government still believes in talking and following the law.</p>

            <h1>Former AIT Military Officer Talks About Taiwan's Defense Strategy: Local Units Should Make More Own Decisions</h1>
            <p>Modern wars are very fast. If you wait, you might not survive. Marvin Park, a former military officer at AIT, said that Taiwan's military is too controlled from the top. Soldiers on the front line have to wait for orders from senior leaders, and this makes them too slow to react. He suggests Taiwan should learn from the US military's "shoot and scoot" idea. This means that local units should be able to make their own decisions and act. He said that only by constantly shooting and moving can soldiers stay safe.</p>
            <p>Marvin Park was the Director for Taiwan Affairs at the White House National Security Council from 2023 to 2024. Before that, he was a naval officer at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) from 2016 to 2019. Yesterday, he spoke with CNA about military cooperation between the US and Taiwan and about Taiwan's defense plans.</p>
            <p>Park said, "If you stay in the same spot, you won't survive. China has satellites, planes, and drones. They will find you and attack you." He also advised the Taiwan military to change its culture and training. He believes they should trust front-line and local soldiers to make the right choices.</p>
            <p>He specifically talked about the US military's idea of "shoot and scoot" for their lowest-ranking soldiers. He stressed that "decentralized command and control" (meaning decisions are made at lower levels) and understanding the mission details first are very important.</p>
            <p>He said, "Soldiers must shoot, then move. Then they should check again, shoot again, move again, and hide to survive. They should not wait for a general or commander to approve their actions."</p>
            <p>Regarding mission details, Park explained that Taiwan has bought large weapons like anti-ship cruise missiles in recent years. These weapons work with mobile missile launchers and radar units. However, the youngest officers on the battlefield must be able to make decisions on their own after they get the mission details.</p>
            <p>An example of mission details might be: After an attack, if a Chinese warship is seen on the computer, soldiers should fire immediately. Then they should quickly take down their equipment and move to a new place. This helps their weapons work best and stops the enemy from targeting them. It also helps them survive.</p>
            <p>However, he pointed out, "But your military is not trained like that."</p>
            <p>Besides quick reactions, Park also reminded Taiwan that it must be able to fight for a long time. He said Taiwan is different from Ukraine. Ukraine can get supplies from its neighbor Poland, but Taiwan is surrounded by the sea.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Strait could be full of sea mines, submarines, and blockades. So, Taiwan must be able to supply itself on the island to keep fighting. He said that making advanced missiles takes too long and is too hard. Taiwan should instead make many drones, bullets, and artillery. It should also build a full supply chain to continue fighting and gain time.</p>
            <p>"But if you just wait, hope, and pray for the American navy or air force to send supplies, that is putting the win or loss to political luck. Maybe it will happen, maybe not. We cannot put our hope there."</p>
            <p>Park served in the military for over 25 years. After returning from Taiwan in 2019, he worked as the China, Taiwan, and North Korea Desk Officer at the US Chief of Naval Operations Office (OPNAV). He was also a Senior Military Advisor for the Taiwan Team at the Office of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
            <p>He is now a Senior Vice President at American Global Strategies, a company that advises on world politics. He is also a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council. Robert O'Brien, who was the White House National Security Advisor during Trump's first term, helped start American Global Strategies.</p>

            <h1>US Scholars Say China's Military Parade Aims to Create New Global Order and Strengthen Claims on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>China held a large military parade. Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared with the leaders of Russia and North Korea. Xi Jinping also gave a speech about the war. Today, American scholars said that Beijing wants to make its claims over Taiwan stronger, show its military power, and say that China is a strong part of a new global system, replacing the United States.</p>
            <p>On September 3rd, Taipei time, China held a military parade in Beijing to celebrate the "80th Anniversary of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." They showed many new weapons. Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un were all there together.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping also gave a speech. He said that under the Chinese Communist Party's guidance, the Chinese people won their first complete victory against foreign invaders in modern times. He also said that China will quickly build a world-class army to strongly protect the country's power, unity, and land. This will support the great return of the Chinese people.</p>
            <p>US President Donald Trump said that the leaders of China, Russia, and North Korea together "were secretly planning against the United States." He thinks that the US helped China become free in the past, so Xi Jinping's speech about the war should have mentioned the US.</p>
            <p>Richard Bush, a former chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution in Washington, told CNA that Xi Jinping wants to send messages like: "China is strong and getting stronger." He also wants to say that China is a firm support in a new global system, and it "is replacing the United States."</p>
            <p>Bonnie Glaser, who leads the Indo-Pacific program at The German Marshall Fund, a think tank in Washington, also said that Xi Jinping wants to do several things. These include sharing China's story of World War II, showing the important roles of China and the Soviet Union in defeating fascism, and making the Allies' roles seem less important.</p>
            <p>Glaser added that China also wants to achieve other goals. These include pushing for a different world order with an important plan called the "Global Governance Initiative." They also want to make the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" seem more valid to strengthen China's claims over Taiwan. Lastly, they want to show China's growing military strength.</p>
            <p>Xi Jinping recently talked about his "Global Governance Initiative" for the first time at the SCO Summit. He said that countries should "follow international law" and work together to build a fairer global system of governance.</p>
            <p>Also, this year is 80 years since the end of World War II. In May, Xi Jinping wrote an article saying that "Taiwan returning to China" was a result of World War II. He used the "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" to support this.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly criticized this, calling it a false idea that goes against facts. They repeated that documents like the 1943 "Cairo Declaration" and "Potsdam Proclamation" have international legal power and confirm that the Republic of China (Taiwan) has power over Taiwan. At that time, the People's Republic of China did not exist. It did not fight in World War II against Japan, and it has no right to say it is "part of the post-war order."</p>
