            <h1>Wei Zhejia Hosts Dinner, Jensen Huang Praises TSMC Team as "Best in the World"</h1>
            <p>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang came to Taiwan for a quick visit today. In the evening, he had dinner with TSMC Chairman C.C. Wei and his team at a private restaurant in Taipei. Mr. Wei hosted the dinner. Jensen Huang said that TSMC is making new computer chips for NVIDIA. He added that the next few months will be very busy. He greatly praised the TSMC team, calling them "the best in the world." He also said he had a wonderful day.</p>
            <p>After the dinner, Jensen Huang flew out of Songshan Airport at 10:06 PM on his private plane. This ended his short visit of about 13 hours.</p>
            <p>During a break from dinner, Mr. Huang and Mr. Wei spoke to reporters. Their good friendship was clear. Mr. Wei said he was happy to invite Jensen Huang, whose wealth is about 4 trillion New Taiwan Dollars, to speak at TSMC. Jensen Huang joked, "Even so, you're still paying for dinner."</p>
            <p>Mr. Wei laughed and said, "No problem, as long as you accept my wafer prices." Jensen Huang agreed, and then both men laughed happily.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wei pointed out that Jensen Huang is a good friend of TSMC. He is a customer, but a very good one. Mr. Wei was happy to invite Jensen Huang to Taiwan to speak to TSMC employees. It was a very good speech that "told us how to make your company successful."</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang said that when TSMC and he first started working together, a new generation of chips was just one chip. Now, what TSMC and he are making together is no longer just a new chip. It is a new factory for Artificial Intelligence (AI). This AI factory and the new generation of chips are called Rubin.</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang stated that NVIDIA and TSMC have just finished designing six new chips. These include a new central processing unit (CPU), a graphics processing unit (GPU), network chips, NVLink switches, Spectrum Ethernet switches, and silicon photonics processors. Both companies completed the design of these chips at the same time.</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang said, "So, I came here to thank the TSMC leaders. They will be very, very busy in the next few months." He added that the production of Blackwell chips has been very successful, and TSMC has done an excellent job. Now, they have a new generation of products called Rubin, which uses the most advanced technology in every part.</p>
            <p>Regarding OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's recent comments about the AI market being too active and possibly having a "bubble" (a market that might crash), Jensen Huang said that Altman meant many AI investors might lose money. "That is certainly true," he said. This is because there are many companies in the market, and many of them will not succeed. This is how venture capital works. "But it is clear that AI is making a lot of money."</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang also said that in the AI industry, the fastest-growing software companies in history are appearing right now, like OpenAI and Anthropic. He added that even though it might not seem obvious inside Google, the AI model Gemini is a very fast-growing business. These lists of quickly growing AI companies are everywhere.</p>

            <h1>US Puts 15% Tariffs on EU, Italy Still Wants Wine Exemption</h1>
            <p>The United States announced yesterday that it will put a 15% tax on goods from the European Union. Wine was not removed from this tax list. Italy's Foreign Minister, Antonio Tajani, said that Italy will continue to talk with the US. They want to ask for wine and spirits to be free from this tax. He also hopes that the European Central Bank (ECB) will lower interest rates and do other things to help businesses in EU countries deal with these problems.</p>
            <p>Details about the US and EU tariffs were made public on August 21st. Italy had hoped that wine would not be taxed, but this did not happen. Today, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani spoke to the financial newspaper "Il Sole 24 Ore." He said they will keep talking to get better conditions and help Italian companies that are worried.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tajani said it is good that the US set a 15% tariff for all EU goods. At least this stops a trade war between them. Compared to earlier talks, the 15% tax on medicines and cars is also a good thing. He said, "I want to say that things could have been worse. For now, we have done our best."</p>
            <p>Mr. Tajani mentioned that Italy's goal in the talks is to get wine and spirits to be free from tariffs. For steel and aluminum, the tax is still 50% for now. However, the US and EU have agreed to work together against too much production from China. So, they might use a "tariff quota" system for these products. A tariff quota means that a certain amount of imported goods will have a lower tax rate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tajani believes that the EU getting a 15% tariff from the US is better than what many other countries have. He said, "This means Italian products have a chance to take over some product areas in the US market that are now mostly controlled by countries outside the EU."</p>
            <p>Mr. Tajani said that Italy's Foreign Ministry quickly held meetings with different industries. They explained how the US tariffs would affect them. The ministry will also keep working on a "plan to sell products to more countries." They will look for new markets outside the US. After careful review, they might also offer help to certain industries that are affected.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tajani thinks the European Central Bank should lower interest rates and do other things to help businesses. He said that the US dollar being weaker than the euro is a big problem for businesses. He also said that because inflation is around 2%, it is time to lower interest rates more, from 2% to 1.5% or 1%, or even to zero.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tajani suggested that the European Central Bank could also buy government bonds, like it did during the Covid-19 pandemic. This would be a new "quantitative easing" (QE) policy. Another idea is to increase the limit for the "SME supporting factor" tool from 2.5 million euros to 5 million euros. This would make it easier for small and medium-sized businesses to get loans.</p>

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by over 700 points.</p>
            <p>CNBC, a US business news channel, reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 732 points, or 1.6%. It reached 45512.25 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index increased by 1.2%.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index went up by almost 1.3%.</p>
