            <h1>Ma Ying-jeou and Annette Lu's Teacher, Jerome Cohen, Passes Away at 95</h1>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that Jerome Cohen, an important American legal scholar, passed away yesterday. He was 95 years old. Mr. Cohen was a respected teacher to former President Ma Ying-jeou and former Vice President Annette Lu. He had a deep and important effect on Taiwan becoming a democracy and on the development of legal systems in China.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Jerome Cohen's son, Ethan Cohen, said his father passed away on September 22. He was 95 years old.</p>
            <p>Jerome Cohen spent many years studying China's legal system. He greatly influenced Taiwan's move towards democracy after a long period of martial law. He was a beloved teacher to both former President Ma Ying-jeou and former Vice President Annette Lu when they studied at Harvard Law School. In 1985, after the Henry Liu murder case, he helped Liu's widow, Cui Rong-chih, in Taiwan without charge. During that time, he visited Annette Lu in the hospital. She was in prison because of the Kaohsiung Incident, which made her a prisoner of conscience.</p>
            <p>In May 2012, when Chinese human rights lawyer Chen Guangcheng left the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to go to America, Jerome Cohen helped him. Cohen contacted New York University, where he was teaching, to offer Chen Guangcheng a visiting scholar position and a scholarship to help him move to the U.S. Later that year, Cohen visited Taiwan. He met with former President Chen Shui-bian, who was in prison for corruption, at Taipei Veterans General Hospital and shared his legal opinions on the case.</p>
            <p>Jerome Cohen finished law school at Yale University in 1960. He worked for two U.S. Supreme Court Justices. When he was 30, before the U.S. and China had official diplomatic relations, he decided to study Chinese law under the Communist system and learn Chinese. After the U.S. and China established diplomatic ties, Cohen, who spoke fluent Chinese, was the first American lawyer to work in Beijing for several American universities and law firms.</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that in the 1960s, during the Cold War, Jerome Cohen traveled to Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, but he could not enter China. In Hong Kong, he once said he would pay $20,000 to buy a panda. He also wrote letters to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, but he was not able to meet them. In 1972, when relations between the U.S. and China started to improve, Jerome Cohen met Zhou Enlai, who was the second most powerful person in China at the time, in Beijing.</p>
            <p>In 1979, the U.S. and China started official relations, and China began to open up. Jerome Cohen and his wife were invited to Beijing to teach Chinese officials.</p>
            <p>Jerome Cohen always cared about China's legal system, human rights, and the growth of democracy and law in the region. He skillfully played a trusted role between the U.S. and China. He was trusted by high-level officials in Taiwan, the U.S., and China. He also gave legal comments on the changes happening in China and Hong Kong under President Xi Jinping's leadership.</p>

            <h1>U.S. Secret Service Finds 100,000 SIM Cards During UN General Assembly, Prevents Communication Crisis in New York</h1>
            <p>Hours before U.S. President Trump was going to speak to world leaders at the UN General Assembly, the U.S. Secret Service announced that they had stopped a complex network of electronic devices in New York. These devices were planned to threaten U.S. government officials.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Secret Service said in a statement that these devices were found about 56 kilometers away from where the 193-member global meeting was held.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "Early checks show that there were mobile phone calls between people known to federal law enforcement and those linked to threats from national governments."</p>
            <p>Officials found more than 300 SIM card servers and 100,000 SIM cards in several places. The Secret Service said this action removed an immediate threat to their protection efforts.</p>
            <p>The Secret Service stated that these devices were used to "make several threats related to phone calls against high-level U.S. government officials."</p>
            <p>Secret Service agent Matt McCool said in a video statement, "This network could have stopped cell phone towers from working and basically cut off New York City's mobile communication network."</p>
            <p>He added that these devices no longer pose a threat to the area.</p>
            <p>The White House did not immediately answer questions about the situation.</p>
            <p>These devices could have been used for many types of phone attacks. This includes stopping cell phone towers, starting cyberattacks, and allowing criminals and people who pose a threat to talk to each other secretly.</p>
