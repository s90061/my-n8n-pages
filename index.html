            <p>In the bottom of the 6th inning, Enrique HernÃ¡ndez got a hit first. Shohei Ohtani then got a hit that brought in a run for the Dodgers. After this, the whole Dodgers team hit the ball strongly against the Reds' relief pitchers. Mookie Betts and Teoscar Hernandez both hit doubles. The Dodgers scored 4 runs in this inning, making the score 7-2.</p>
            <p>At the end of the game, the Dodgers' relief pitchers gave up runs in the 8th inning, and the bases were loaded. Luckily, Alex Vesia got the last out. In the 9th inning, the Dodgers sent out Roki Sasaki to finish the game. With the fans cheering, he got three outs quickly, including two strikeouts.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City: More Drivers Not Stopping for Pedestrians; Drivers Need to Follow Rules Better</h1>
            <p>The Taipei City Motor Vehicle Arbitration Office said today that there are more cases of drivers in Taipei not stopping for people walking. This happened in the first six months of this year compared to the same time last year. This means that some drivers need to be better at following the rules. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications has made the fines higher for not stopping for people walking. They ask drivers to be careful.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Department of Transportation held a press conference this morning called "High Cost for Not Stopping for Pedestrians." Data from the Taipei City Motor Vehicle Arbitration Office shows that the Ministry of Transportation and Communications increased fines starting from June 30. This is to warn drivers to stop for people walking. If a driver does not stop and causes a small injury, the fine is now 18,000 New Taiwan Dollars. If it causes a serious injury or death, the highest fine can be 36,000 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The Taipei City Motor Vehicle Arbitration Office said that in the first six months of this year, there were 11,818 cases where drivers did not stop for people walking. This is 1,969 more cases than last year, an increase of almost 20%. This shows that some drivers still need to get better at following the rules about stopping for pedestrians.</p>
            <p>The Arbitration Office said that if a car hits a person because the driver did not stop, causing injury or death, there will be a large fine. Also, the driver might face legal action in civil and criminal courts. Drivers should follow traffic safety rules. They should also be careful and always look around to see what is happening. This way, they can stop accidents from happening.</p>
            <p>Li Tian-xing, the head of the Arbitration Office's penalty section, spoke to reporters. He said that people driving should be very careful when they go through intersections without traffic lights or crosswalks. If not, accidents with injuries might happen. Also, because people walking are weaker, cars should always let them cross, no matter what the traffic lights show.</p>
            <p>He pointed out that drivers should be very careful when going through a crosswalk. If a person walks across when the light is not for them, the driver might have less blame. But if an accident happens, there will be a fine and legal problems, including long court cases and large payments. He asks everyone to be careful on the road.</p>
            <p>The Arbitration Office said that drivers often think they are not at fault if their car's pillar blocked their view. But this is wrong. If a person walks on a crosswalk with the right light, they are not to blame for an accident. Drivers should be aware of blind spots from the car's pillar and turn their head to check. Cars should stop for people walking when near a crosswalk, with or without traffic lights.</p>
