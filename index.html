            <h1>US Government Shutdown, Stock Market Still Rises, Dow and S&P Reach New Highs</h1>
            <p>The US government has closed down some of its services, but the stock market still went up today. The Dow and S&P 500 stock indexes reached their highest points ever. This happened because people in the market think the central bank (the Federal Reserve) will lower interest rates more.</p>
            <p>The Dow Industrial Average went up by 43.21 points, which is 0.09%, and closed at 46441.10 points.</p>
            <p>The S&P 500 index went up by 22.74 points, which is 0.34%, and closed at 6711.20 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq index went up by 95.15 points, which is 0.42%, and closed at 22755.16 points.</p>
            <p>The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index went up by 130.46 points, which is 2.05%, and closed at 6500.28 points.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine: Russian Attacks Cause Power Outage at Chernobyl Nuclear Plant, Threatening Global Safety</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's energy department said today that Russian military attacks caused some parts of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant to lose electricity. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia is putting the safety of the whole world at risk.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news agency, Ukraine's energy department announced on the Telegram app that there was an emergency at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. This was due to Russian attacks on energy buildings in the Kyiv area.</p>
            <p>The energy department also said that changes in electricity caused the New Safe Confinement to lose power. This is an important building that stops radioactive material from the damaged Chernobyl Unit 4 reactor from spreading into the environment.</p>
            <p>The Chernobyl Unit 4 reactor exploded on April 26, 1986. This nuclear accident killed many people and caused radiation to spread. The area around it became one of the least populated places on Earth.</p>
            <p>President Zelensky wrote on Facebook today that Russia is making the war last longer every day. It refuses to agree to a full and real ceasefire. Russia continues to attack Ukraine's energy buildings, including important places for the safety of nuclear power plants and other nuclear sites. This puts the whole world in danger.</p>

            <h1>Jane Goodall Dies at 91; She Visited Taiwan in June and Encouraged Hope</h1>
            <p>The Jane Goodall Institute announced today that Jane Goodall, a very well-known expert in protecting nature, passed away peacefully in her sleep. She was 91 years old. Jane Goodall visited Taiwan in June this year. She said she did not have much time left. She wanted to use her last energy to help people understand that there is still hope for a better future, even in a difficult world.</p>
            <p>The Jane Goodall Institute in Washington shared this news on Instagram. They also said that Jane Goodall was on a speaking tour in California, USA, at the time. Her schedule showed she was planning to speak in Los Angeles on October 3.</p>
            <p>The institute stated that Dr. Goodall was an animal behavior scientist. Her discoveries changed science completely. She also worked very hard to protect and bring back the natural world.</p>
            <p>Jane Goodall was born in London in 1934. When she was a child, she dreamed of living with wild animals. She said her love for animals began when her father gave her a toy chimpanzee. As she read books like Tarzan and Doctor Dolittle, her love for animals grew even more.</p>
            <p>In 1960, when she was 26, Jane Goodall went to Tanzania for the first time. She started to study chimpanzees deeply. At that time, this way of studying animals in their natural homes was not a common scientific method.</p>
            <p>While living with chimpanzees, Jane Goodall saw them using tools and doing other things that people used to think only humans did. She also noticed that each chimpanzee had its own special personality. Her observations, and the articles and films about her work in the 1960s, changed how people saw chimpanzees. They also changed how people understood the feelings and complex social lives of all animals. This made her famous.</p>
            <p>In 1997, she said, "Over the years, chimpanzees have taught me this â€“ they are really so much like us. They make the difference between humans and animals unclear."</p>
            <p>Besides her research on primates and her other work, she also worked hard to protect the environment and was against cutting down forests. In 2024, she spoke at the Global Citizen Festival. She said, "Because we are part of nature. Also, our food, water, clothes â€“ everything depends on healthy natural systems and the complicated network of plants and animals that are connected."</p>
            <p>She also asked, "If nature keeps getting worse, what will happen to the future of our children and grandchildren?"</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Jane Goodall traveled for about 300 days each year. She met with government officials in different countries and talked with groups from communities and schools. For many years, she kept giving talks until the end of her life. Just last week, she spoke during New York Climate Week.</p>
            <p>In January this year, then-US President Biden gave Jane Goodall the "Presidential Medal of Freedom." This is the highest award a person who is not in the military can get in the US. She received it for her scientific work and her efforts to help society.</p>
            <p>About five months later, Goodall visited Taiwan for the first time in seven years. During her visit, she was not well but still gave interviews to news reporters. She talked about topics like artificial intelligence (AI), oceans, and protecting nature. The 91-year-old also said that she did not have much time left. She hoped to use her last strength to help young people understand that there is still a way to move forward in this difficult world.</p>
            <p>When she talked about life and death, Jane Goodall said she had spent her life observing the world. This included watching chimpanzees in Africa and starting the "Roots & Shoots" program. She believed that when the body dies, something else continues. She said, "I cannot think of a greater adventure than finding out what that is." For her, this idea was okay.</p>
            <p>The "Roots & Shoots program" started in the 1990s. Now it works in 75 countries and has helped many young people take action to protect the Earth. People will always remember her image: holding notes, kneeling in bushes, and watching primates through binoculars.</p>
