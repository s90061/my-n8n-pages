            <h1>Ministry of Education Announces New Mental Health Leave for Teachers: 3 Days Per School Year</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Education recently announced changes to the "Teacher Leave Rules." They plan to add a new type of leave called "mental and physical adjustment leave" for teachers. Teachers can take 3 days of this leave each school year. These days will be counted as part of their personal leave.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education wants to create a better work environment in schools. So, they plan to change some rules in the "Teacher Leave Rules." A main part of this change is the new mental health leave. Teachers can take 3 days per school year, and they can even take it by the hour. The rules clearly state that schools "cannot refuse this leave and cannot treat teachers badly for taking it."</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Education said that this mental health leave is to help teachers care for their mental well-being. If teachers feel mentally unwell, they can take this leave to reduce stress. This will help them work better later.</p>
            <p>According to the new rules, the days taken for mental health leave will be added to personal leave. If the total number of days for personal leave, family care leave, and mental health leave is more than 7 days, then the teacher's salary will be reduced for the extra days. If a substitute teacher is needed because of this leave, the school will pay for it.</p>
            <p>In recent years, schools have been paying more attention to the mental health of both teachers and students. Students have also been given mental health leave. For example, high school students have been able to take up to 3 days per semester since August 2024.</p>

            <h1>Encouraging Social Gatherings Criticized, Minister Chiu Tai-yuan Says Focus on Overall Solutions for Low Birth Rate</h1>
            <p>Minister of Health and Welfare, Chiu Tai-yuan, was criticized for saying "encourage social gatherings" when talking about the low birth rate. People said he missed the main point. Today, he explained that solving the low birth rate is a very important national problem. He said they are working on four main plans, including making it easier to raise children. He added that they will accept any good ideas.</p>
            <p>To deal with the low birth rate, Chiu Tai-yuan recently suggested four main plans. These plans aim to reduce the costs of raising children, improve the health of mothers and babies, and encourage people to get married and have children. This includes coordinating with other government departments to offer public housing for parents and promoting social events. However, many people criticized the idea of social events, saying it was not the right focus.</p>
            <p>Chiu Tai-yuan attended a press conference today. Before the conference, he spoke to reporters. He explained that he brought up encouraging social gatherings after talking about the four main plans. He said that developed countries often need more chances for people to meet and interact.</p>
            <p>Chiu Tai-yuan said that the Taiwan Medical Association and other professional groups like accountants, dentists, Chinese medicine doctors, lawyers, and architects often meet. They discuss national policies and also do many public service activities like blood drives. That is why he said social activities could also be considered.</p>
            <p>He stressed that social gatherings are "just one activity." He said that to solve the low birth rate, we need to look at the whole picture. This includes men being more involved in childcare and changes in family values. He said that any good ideas will be accepted and put into practice. He believes that everyone needs to work together to solve the low birth rate problem.</p>
            <p>Also, there are rumors that the cabinet will change, and some say Chiu Tai-yuan might leave his position. He said that for the country's development, the team cares most about doing their jobs well. Other things are not important. He said it's most important to do what needs to be done every day. For the Ministry of Health and Welfare, this means making healthcare better, and doing well with disease prevention and social welfare. The main goal is to achieve President Lai Ching-te's vision of a healthy Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>Cheng Li-chun Explains Tariff Negotiation Progress, Eric Chu Says It's Like Saying Nothing</h1>
            <p>Vice Premier Cheng Li-chun recently held a press conference to talk about the progress of tariff negotiations between Taiwan and the United States. Today, Kuomintang Chairman Eric Chu said that her explanation was unclear, like "saying nothing." He said she did not tell people important things they care about, such as Taiwan's specific tariff rates, if new tariffs will be added, or how much Taiwan will have to pay. He said this is truly a "black box" situation, meaning it's not clear or transparent.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's temporary tariff rate of 20% is now in effect. On August 11, Cheng Li-chun, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Kung Ming-hsin, and Negotiator-General Yang Jen-ni attended an Executive Yuan press conference. They explained issues related to US tariffs and plans to help industries.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Eric Chu spoke at the KMT Central Standing Committee meeting. He said that people hope the government will work hard to get a good result from the talks. But after watching Cheng Li-chun's press conference, he said people are still confused. She only said that the 20% tariff needs more discussion and that Taiwan hopes to lower it, similar to Japan, without adding more. Chu said this was "like saying nothing." He compared it to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who gave a complete report to the Japanese people.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu believes there are several key points in the Taiwan-US tariff negotiations. These include what Taiwan's tariff rates will be, if they will be added to current tariffs, and what will happen with Section 232. Also, how much will Taiwan have to pay? For example, Japan must invest 550 billion US dollars in the US, and South Korea must invest 350 billion US dollars. How much will Taiwan need to invest?</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said that so far, the government has not been able to tell the public these things. He believes this is truly a "black box." He stated that the most serious challenge Taiwan faces is how much more it will have to pay and how many industries will be negatively affected.</p>
            <p>In addition, Eric Chu mentioned that Minister of Economic Affairs Kuo Chih-hui not only cannot protect Taiwan's energy but also said that people in Pingtung support nuclear power only to get subsidies from Taipower and money for local community relations. Chu said this is not true at all, and most people certainly support extending the life of nuclear power plants.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said that if the subsidies for green energy wholesale were cut, Taipower Company would not lose money, and electricity prices for everyone could even go down. He said that today, because the Democratic Progressive Party is against nuclear power, they keep giving money to "green friends," which is a serious problem. He said the Kuomintang stands with the people, for national security and stable industries. He also hopes to stop Taipower's huge losses, and that everyone should support extending the life of nuclear power plants.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu emphasized that a referendum on extending the life of Nuclear Power Plant No. 3 will be held on August 23. He believes if people are asked if they support extending nuclear power, most will say yes. But many people don't know about the referendum. So, the KMT will increase publicity and hold events to encourage people to support extending the life of Nuclear Power Plant No. 3. He hopes everyone will work together to keep Taiwan's economy strong.</p>
