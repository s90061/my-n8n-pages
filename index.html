**Taipei Cancels Restricted Access to Floodgates Based on New Water Levels**

The Taipei City Water Resources Department announced today that on July 7th, offices and schools in Taipei, Keelung, New Taipei, and Taoyuan will be open as usual. After looking at information about Typhoon Danas and water levels, they decided to change the rules. From 11 PM on July 6th, people can go in and out of Taipei's floodgates and riverside paths freely. Cars will not be towed, and traffic will be normal.

The Water Resources Department explained that the floodgates and riverside paths were originally planned to only allow cars to exit starting at 8 PM on July 6th. However, new forecasts from the Central Weather Bureau and the Water Resources Agency show less rain is expected. Also, Shimen Reservoir will release less water. This means the risk of river levels rising and affecting riverside areas is much lower. Because it is now safe, the previous restrictions are canceled.

The department also said that there might still be some rain in local areas on July 7th due to the typhoon and its outer bands. People should still be careful when they go into riverside areas.

**Man Dies in Car Crash During Typhoon Danas in Taiwan**

While Typhoon Danas was affecting Taiwan, a man named Li died in a car accident tonight. He was driving on National Freeway 3 near the Zhongliao Tunnel exit. For reasons unknown, his car hit a guardrail, and he was thrown out of the car onto the side of the road. He died at the scene. Police are still investigating the cause of the accident.

Officers from the Fifth Highway Police Team said that Mr. Li, who was about 35 years old, was driving around 9:04 PM. His car hit the inner guardrail and then the outer guardrail at the 378.7-kilometer mark on National Freeway 3 North, near the Zhongliao Tunnel exit. He was thrown onto the shoulder of the road and died instantly. The accident site was cleared around 11:02 PM, and all lanes were open again.

The police advise drivers to slow down in the rain and keep a longer distance from other cars. If a car feels like it's sliding on water, drivers should hold the steering wheel tightly and ease off the gas pedal to avoid losing control.
