            <p>Klingbeil added, "We are watching the situation closely. We are trying our best to stop more problems between the US and China from happening." He also said, "I now have some hope that President Trump and President Xi Jinping can make many things clear when they meet."</p>

            <p>Taipei, October 17th (CNA) â€“ The 60th Golden Bell Awards for TV shows ended tonight. Dee Hsu and Kevin Tsai worked together again to bring back "Kangxi Coming."

            <p>The famous singer Lo Shi-Fong sang a mix of songs and made the event very lively. He sang songs like Jay Chou's "Nunchucks," S.H.E's "Super Star," and Wei Li-An's "If I Could." He also sang "French Kiss" with Aisa, forming a special group. Then he showed off his dancing skills, singing "Hoo Hoo" with the new girl group GENBLUE Fantasium, originally sung by Amber An. Finally, he sang and danced with GENBLUE Fantasium, Aisa, and Wayne Huang to Jolin Tsai's "The Great Artist." Everyone at the awards was surprised by his amazing performance.</p>
            <p>Lin Chih-Sheng, a baseball star who recently retired, was invited to give the "Most Popular Variety Show Award." He said he was happy to be on the Golden Bell stage after being on the baseball field. He also joked that he hopes to be on the Golden Bell stage for a sports show in the future. He said that variety show hosts and baseball players are similar because they both work hard to make people feel something. This award is for the whole team of the show and deserves applause from the audience.</p>
            <p>The actress Barbie Hsu (Big S) passed away suddenly earlier this year. During the ceremony today, a video showed her lively moments from her past TV shows. The event also remembered other people who passed away, like writer Wang Hao-Yi, cartoonist Yu Fu, and fortune teller Bu Yang. The speaker, Liu Ke-Xiang, said emotionally that every star has a special light that connects people. Tonight, we looked at the bright light of these stars again.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu and Kevin Tsai hosted "Kangxi Coming" again at the 60th Golden Bell Awards. They also gave out an award. Kevin Tsai asked everyone to cheer for Dee Hsu and give her strength.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu said that she came to the event today because her sister Big S would have wanted her to be there. She still feels very sad and wants to call Big S. "Thank you to my family and friends for giving me a lot of strength, so I am standing here," she said.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu also sang a song that Big S wrote. She told Big S in a sad way, "Life without you will be very hard, but I will keep moving forward." Her strong love for her sister made many people in the audience cry.</p>
            <p>Dee Hsu and Patrick received the "Variety Show Host Award" for their show "Miss Buxidi." Dee Hsu cried as she took the award from Kevin Tsai. She said, "I want to give this award to my mother. My mother said she has a big hole in her heart. If I win this award today, maybe the hole will be filled a little. Mom, please put this award with Big S's picture, and your hole might be filled."</p>
            <p>Patrick said that he dreamed of being a host more than 10 years ago. He never thought he would win an award with the person who first asked him about his dream, which was Dee Hsu.</p>
            <p>Lulu, Ken Lin, and Jacky Wu were nominated for the "Variety Show Host Award" for "Hot Door Night" at the 60th Golden Bell Awards. Lulu was also nominated with her ex-boyfriend Ada and Beautiful Person for "Night Market King." Even though they did not win, Lulu was sitting between Ada and Ken Lin when the winner was announced. This made Lulu laugh and say, "Meeting again means we are meant to be." She joked about her past and current colleagues in a funny way.</p>

            <h1>Vice President Hopes Taiwan and Canada Can Create Stronger Laws to Build Trade Partnership</h1>
            <p>Taipei, October 17th (CNA) â€“ Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim recently spoke with a foreign news agency. She said that she hopes Taiwan and Canada will continue to have a strong and steady trade relationship. She also said it would be very helpful if they could make better laws to support their trade partnership. She hopes Canada will support Taiwan in joining the CPTPP.</p>
            <p>The Presidential Office released a statement tonight. It said that Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim was recently interviewed by Chris Brown, a reporter from the "Canadian Broadcasting Company" (CBC) in London.</p>
            <p>Some news in Taiwan said that trade talks between Taiwan and Canada's former Prime Minister Trudeau's government were delayed by Canada. The Vice President said that Canada is a very important trade partner for Taiwan. The economies of both countries help each other in many ways. Of course, she hopes they can keep talking about trade. These talks have been very good over the years, and she wants them to continue.</p>
            <p>When asked if there were delays, she said that trade talks are always very complex. She hopes and expects that these discussions will continue.</p>
            <p>The Vice President said that Canada has always been an important supplier of farm products to Taiwan. Taiwan, in return, makes important parts for technology that help Canadian factories. She hopes they can keep their strong and steady trade relationship. She thinks it would be very helpful if they could make better laws to support their trade partnership.</p>
            <p>The Vice President also hopes Canada will support Taiwan in joining the "Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership" (CPTPP). Taiwan continues to ask for fair treatment in international groups and organizations. It is very important for Taiwan to be a part of the international trade system that follows rules. She truly hopes Canada will give its support.</p>
            <p>Regarding safety, she thanked Canada very much. Canada has often sailed ships near the Taiwan Strait to show freedom of navigation, following its Indo-Pacific strategy. Canada has also been a leader in the Group of Seven (G7) countries. With other G7 members, it has often said that peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are very important for global wealth. Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are a necessary part of global wealth. This is very important for Taiwan, whether it's about leading in diplomacy or as a country in the Pacific that cares deeply about peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The Vice President especially thanked Canada and Taiwan for recently signing a special agreement called the "Memorandum of Understanding on Dark Vessel Detection System." This helps Taiwan know more about what is happening in its seas. Canada's technology not only helps with rules for fishing around the world but also helps with other issues related to understanding the sea. The cooperation between the two countries will make sure that everyone involved in the area respects the rules and standards that keep the world stable. This is very meaningful.</p>
            <p>The Presidential Office said that CBC has been around for almost 90 years. It is a main media company in Canada that has a big influence on public opinion. Its 24-hour TV news programs can be watched all over Canada. Its different channels include radio, TV, and online media. It has a big effect on politics, business, and education in Canada.</p>
