            <h1>Ministry of Transportation Connects Companies to Help People Repair Their Homes</h1>
            <p>Typhoon Danas and strong winds from the southwest have caused a lot of damage to homes in southern Taiwan. Today, the Ministry of Transportation said that it is hard to find workers and materials right now. So, the ministry has asked all its departments to help connect companies with people. They want to help people find workers to repair their homes.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation wrote on Facebook today that Vice Minister Chen Yen-po held a meeting yesterday. He brought together different departments to check on the repair work in the damaged areas of Tainan. They also talked about how to continue helping. So far, they have visited more than 100 damaged homes. They are also looking for more workers and resources to help people rebuild their homes quickly.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation explained that it is difficult to find workers and materials. People cannot easily get repair teams, and there are not enough workers or tools. The government has asked all its ministries to help. Each ministry is responsible for a different area. The Ministry of Transportation is in charge of helping the areas of Sinying District, Yanshui District, Baihe District, and Houbi District in Tainan City.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Transportation said that people who want to repair their homes should first register with their district chief. Then, the Ministry of Transportation will help connect different companies with these people. After that, the people and the companies will talk and sign a simple agreement. The Ministry of Transportationâ€™s main job is to connect people with companies; it does not pay for the repairs.</p>
            <p>To make the repair work faster, the Ministry of Transportation also set some rules. Besides connecting companies, they will first help repair old one-story houses and homes where the roofs have been torn off, making them unsafe to live in. This is for immediate help. Also, old materials like asbestos tiles that are removed will be collected in one place. The district office will then help to remove them.</p>
