Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly changing the way we work. Experts say that while AI will create many new jobs, it will also cause some existing jobs to disappear. This is a big change for the world of work.

Some new jobs created by AI include "AI trainers," who teach AI systems, and "prompt engineers," who write special instructions for AI. These roles need people who understand how AI works and can communicate clearly.

However, jobs that involve repetitive tasks or data entry might be done by AI in the future. This means some workers will need to learn new skills to stay employed. Companies and governments are thinking about how to help people adapt. The goal is to prepare the workforce for these new challenges and opportunities that AI brings.

**Making Cities More Natural to Fight Climate Change**

As our planet warms, cities are looking for new ways to deal with climate change. One interesting idea is "rewilding." This means making urban areas more natural by bringing back plants, trees, and even small animals. It's about letting nature play a bigger role in city life.

Rewilding can help in several ways. For example, more green spaces can make cities cooler during hot weather. Trees and plants also help clean the air and absorb rainwater, which can prevent flooding. These natural areas can also make city dwellers feel happier and healthier.

Many cities worldwide are starting to try rewilding projects. They are planting more trees along streets, creating natural parks, and even turning rooftops into gardens. This approach helps cities become more sustainable and pleasant places to live as the climate changes.

**Companies Try New Ideas for Better Work-Life Balance**

Many people today feel that their work-life balance is not good. They often work too much and don't have enough time for their personal lives, family, or hobbies. This can lead to stress and unhappiness. Companies are now looking for new ways to help their employees.

Some companies are trying shorter workweeks, like four days instead of five, with the same pay. Other companies are offering more flexible hours, allowing employees to choose when they start and finish work. Some even offer "recharge days," which are extra days off specifically for rest and personal time.

The goal of these changes is to reduce stress and improve mental well-being for workers. Companies hope that happier employees will be more productive and loyal. These new approaches show a growing understanding that employees need time outside of work to live full and healthy lives.`;
