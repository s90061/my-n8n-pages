The United States is considering ending exceptions that currently allow foreign chipmakers like Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC to use American technology in their manufacturing operations in China. These exceptions were first granted after the U.S. put broad export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022. China is the world's largest market for semiconductors, and for South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies, having production in China is crucial for their business. This potential decision to remove these exceptions for allies' operations in China marks an important moment in U.S. technology policy.

**Air Travel Rebound and Strategic Acquisition Propel SATS in Fortune Southeast Asia 500**

Singapore-based SATS, a company offering a variety of aviation services, has significantly increased its revenue, tripling it after acquiring Worldwide Flight Services in early 2023. This impressive growth has allowed SATS to climb 134 spots to No. 93 on this year's Southeast Asia 500 list, with its 2024 revenue reaching $3.8 billion. The acquisition of Worldwide Flight Services, a major global air cargo logistics provider, is identified as the primary reason for this revenue surge.

**Oil Tankers Near Iran Seem to Be in Rural Russia Due to Signal Jamming**

On Sunday, an oil tanker called the Front Tyne was traveling through the Gulf between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. However, around 9:40 a.m., ship-tracking data strangely showed the large vessel located in Russia, specifically in agricultural areas known for growing barley and sugar beets. Later that day, by 4:15 p.m., the ship's inconsistent signals indicated it was near Bidkhun in southern Iran, before continuing to show it moving back and forth across the Gulf.
