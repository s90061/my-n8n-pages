            <h1>Asia Optical: Sales Expected to Grow in Second Half of Year; Philippines Expansion Due to Tariffs</h1>
            <p>Asia Optical, a company that makes optical parts, held a meeting today. The chairman, Lai Yi-jen, said that sales might keep growing in the second half of the year. To deal with tariffs, Asia Optical has started making more products in the Philippines. Some products might be moved to be made there. Also, the company has rented a new factory in Thailand.</p>
            <p>Lai Yi-jen explained that car cameras are not sent directly to the United States, so tariffs do not affect them. Half of the finished digital cameras made in Myanmar are sold to the United States. The current tariff for Myanmar is 40%. The Myanmar government is talking with the U.S. to possibly lower this tariff.</p>
            <p>In the first half of this year, the New Taiwan Dollar became about 11% stronger against the US dollar. However, Asia Optical made money from currency exchange. Lai Yi-jen said that Asia Optical uses different currencies like Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, and US dollars. When the New Taiwan Dollar got stronger, it made money from US dollar debts and also extra money from Japanese Yen debts.</p>
            <p>In the second quarter of this year, Asia Optical's sales were about 6.908 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This was 28% more than the previous quarter and 23% more than last year. The profit from operations was about 675 million New Taiwan Dollars, which was 1.21 times more than the previous quarter and 79% more than last year. The company also benefited from about 89 million New Taiwan Dollars in interest income and about 324 million New Taiwan Dollars from currency exchange. After tax, the profit was 799 million New Taiwan Dollars, which was 2.62 times more than the previous quarter and 79% more than last year. The earnings per share were 2.86 New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>Looking at Asia Optical's products, optical parts like drone parts, lenses, and prisms make up 41% of sales. Digital cameras are 19%, image sensors (CIS) are 17%, car cameras are 9.1%, and rifle scopes are 6%.</p>
            <p>Lai Yi-jen said that the profit in the second quarter this year was the highest in recent years for a single quarter. Digital cameras and action cameras showed the most growth. By July this year, 1.6 million digital cameras were shipped, which is more than the 1.36 million shipped in all of last year. Based on what customers need now, digital camera shipments will keep growing in the second half of the year. Action camera sales are expected to double this year.</p>
            <p>He also said that sales of car cameras are expected to be similar in the second half of the year as in the first half because the car market changes a lot. Sales from drones are about 3% of total sales, which is still low, but they are expected to grow this year and next year. Asia Optical is also working with several companies that make humanoid robots and is currently testing a small number of products.</p>

            <h1>Japanese Artist Takahito Kimura's Huge Blue-Print Kite Flies in Dongjyu Sky</h1>
            <p>Japanese artist Takahito Kimura's artwork, "The Day We Turn into Clouds Together with Two Islands," was created with people from Dongjyu and Ogijima, a small island in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. His huge kite, made using a blue-printing method, flew successfully in the sky over Dongjyu Island today.</p>
            <p>The 3rd Matsu Biennial Art Festival will start in September. News information says that Japanese artist Takahito Kimura's artwork, "The Day We Turn into Clouds Together with Two Islands," held workshops in June in Dongjyu, Juguang Township, and in July on Ogijima Island in Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. Local people were invited to collect everyday items and write down wishes and blessings. Then, they used a blue-printing method to make a giant fabric kite.</p>
            <p>Takahito Kimura told a news reporter today that with the help of the people of Dongjyu Island, the giant kite, 8 meters wide and 20 meters long, took off smoothly and flew in the sky over Dongjyu Island. The actual kite will be shown in the waiting room at Dongjyu's Meng'ao Port. Videos and photos of the kite flying will also be shown on Ogijima Island during the "Setouchi Triennale 2025" in Japan.</p>
            <p>Dongjyu Elementary School, which helped Takahito Kimura fly the kite, told the news reporter that to make the kite fly well, staff members went with Kimura to a temple yesterday to pray for good weather. The Juguang Township Office and Mayor Chen Le-li also helped clean the beach yesterday.</p>
            <p>Dongjyu Elementary School said that this morning, with the help of teachers, students, and island residents, the kite was supposed to be flown at Fuzheng Beach. But the wind was too weak, so the kite could not fly well. Everyone did not give up. In the afternoon, they moved to Meng'ao Port to try again. Finally, in the evening, the kite successfully flew in the sky over Dongjyu.</p>
            <p>Speaking about how the artwork started, Takahito Kimura said that Dongjyu and Ogijima are two small islands. Although their countries, languages, and cultures are different, the thoughts of the islanders, especially what adults hope for their children and how they think about the future, are surprisingly similar. He hopes his artwork helps people see the similarities between the two islands and think about what human life is and what kind of environment we should leave for the next generation.</p>

            <h1>Ministry of Economic Affairs: Graphics Cards and Servers Are Over 70% of Exports to US, Under Section 232 Rules</h1>
            <p>The temporary 20% tariff from the United States on Taiwan is expected to start on August 7th. However, the US Section 232 investigation is not finished yet. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Taiwan's main exports to the US are information and communication technology (ICT) products, graphics cards, and servers. These make up more than 70% of exports to the US and are part of the Section 232 investigation. The Cabinet has already said that Taiwan's matching tariffs and the Section 232 rules will be discussed together. If Taiwan can get a lower tariff rate, it will be better for Taiwan's businesses.</p>
            <p>Today, Ho Chin-tsang, the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, said that once the matching tariff rate is decided, the government will quickly release a report on how it will affect industries. They have already looked at different tariff rates and are studying how the 20% tariff might affect businesses. But the Section 232 rules are not out yet, so the Cabinet will announce the full report on industry effects.</p>
            <p>Ho Chin-tsang stated that Taiwan's main exports to the US are ICT products, graphics cards, and servers, which make up over 70% of exports to the US and are covered by the Section 232 investigation. Other exports are from traditional industries, such as machinery, cars, and hand tools. The Cabinet has already stated that Taiwan's matching tariffs and the Section 232 rules will be discussed together.</p>
            <p>Ho Chin-tsang pointed out that businesses are more worried about currency exchange rates. However, the New Taiwan Dollar's exchange rate has been stable recently. If Taiwan can get a lower tariff rate, it will be better for Taiwan's industries.</p>
            <p>The media asked if the Section 232 tariff rate would be the same for all countries. Ho Chin-tsang explained that he does not know if the US will set different rates for different countries. He also does not know the results of the Section 232 investigation yet. Different tariffs might apply to older and newer types of semiconductor production. But if tariffs increase, it will definitely make costs higher for companies.</p>
            <p>About looking at how tariffs affect industries, Ho Chin-tsang said they are paying attention to traditional industries that export a lot to the US. They want to understand how their products are different from those of competing countries. Future plans to support industries will help companies become stronger. They will also help companies find new markets, like in Southeast Asia or Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p>During the US Section 232 investigation, 20 ICT products, including semiconductors, graphics cards, and servers, did not have tariffs. However, products like PCBs and network parts had a 10% tariff. Based on Taiwan's trade numbers for exports to the US, in 2024, Taiwan exported 111.4 billion US dollars to the US. This was 23% of Taiwan's total exports. Electronic information industries made up 71% of these exports, and other traditional industries made up about 29%. For products under matching tariffs, their share of exports to the US was 20%, while products under Section 232 rules made up 78%.</p>
