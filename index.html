**Sustainable Tourism: Overtourism Solutions in Venice**

Venice, struggling with overtourism, is implementing new strategies to manage visitor flow and promote sustainable tourism practices. The city is testing a reservation system and entry fee for day-trippers.

The new system requires visitors to book their entry in advance and pay a fee, particularly during peak season. The aim is to reduce congestion in popular areas and encourage more responsible tourism. The city is also promoting alternative routes and less-visited attractions. Authorities are working with local businesses to offer sustainable tours and experiences. They also educate tourists about respecting the environment and local culture. Venice hopes these measures will balance tourism with the needs of its residents.
