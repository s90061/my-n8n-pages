Retailers are facing a growing problem: more and more people are stealing from stores. This is happening as the cost of living is going up, making things tough for many families. Shops are reporting that everything from food and clothes to electronics is being taken more often. Some blame the rising prices, suggesting that desperate people are resorting to theft to get by. Others point to a decline in respect for rules and a feeling of lawlessness after the pandemic.

Stores are trying different strategies to combat the shoplifting wave. They are putting more security guards on the floor, installing more cameras, and even locking up certain items behind glass. Some retailers are considering reducing their opening hours or even closing stores in areas particularly affected by theft. The problem is complex and requires a combination of strategies, as well as cooperation between retailers, law enforcement, and communities.

**Article 2: Innovative company pioneers sustainable packaging made from seaweed**

A startup company is making waves in the packaging industry with its environmentally friendly alternatives to plastic. They have developed a process to create packaging from seaweed, a readily available and renewable resource. This material is biodegradable, meaning it breaks down naturally in the environment, unlike traditional plastics which can take hundreds of years to decompose.

The seaweed packaging is already being used by some food and beverage companies for things like takeaway containers and drinks pouches. The company claims that their product is not only better for the environment but also competitive in price with traditional plastic options. They are currently working on expanding their production capacity to meet the increasing demand for sustainable packaging solutions from businesses looking to reduce their environmental impact.

**Article 3: Italy launches digital nomad visa to attract remote workers**

Italy is hoping to attract talented individuals from around the world with a new "digital nomad" visa. This visa allows non-EU citizens to live and work in Italy for up to a year, provided they are employed by a company outside of Italy or are self-employed and earn a minimum income. The aim is to boost the Italian economy by attracting skilled professionals who will spend money in local businesses and contribute to the country's cultural landscape.

The digital nomad visa is designed for people who work remotely using technology, such as software developers, writers, designers, and consultants. Applicants need to prove they have sufficient financial resources, health insurance, and accommodation. The Italian government hopes this initiative will revitalize smaller towns and villages, as well as attract investment in the country's technology sector.
