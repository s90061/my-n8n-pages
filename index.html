            <h1>Guitar Teacher Huang Chung-Yue Becomes Music Director, Making Accusefive Feel Calm</h1>
            <p>The music band Accusefive started their tour in their hometown Yilan. On August 16th and 17th, they played concerts in Taipei. 4000 fans came to watch the two concerts. Accusefive shared that they asked Huang Chung-Yue, who is known as the "Guitar Godfather," to be their music director. His intense training helped Accusefive feel very confident and relaxed.</p>
            <p>Accusefive played two concerts at Legacy TERA in Taipei on August 16th and 17th. According to the news, during the first talking part, Yun An was a little out of breath. Quan Qing joked, "Are you out of breath after only 3 songs?" Yun An quickly said he has good stamina. Zhe Qian added, "He can keep going for 3 hours!" Accusefive loves their fans, so they let fans ask for songs. Fans used different ways to get Accusefive to choose their song.</p>
            <p>For this Live House world tour, Accusefive specially invited Huang Chung-Yue to be their music director. The band members said that the intense practice before the tour was like "special summer training." Zhe Qian said, "This was the most difficult practice I have ever had!"</p>
            <p>Accusefive said, "The main point of this practice was not to think about how great we could be. Instead, it was to think about how to play and show the band's songs. Teacher Huang Chung-Yue is like a 'calming pill.' When he is here, we are more careful to change our daily routines and attitudes. We also work harder to get even better."</p>
            <p>Accusefive will play in Taichung at Legacy Taichung on August 30th and 31st. On September 6th and 7th, they will go to Kaohsiung LIVE WAREHOUSE. They will also continue to spread their rock music in cities like Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Xi'an, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Wuhan.</p>

            <h1>Ukraine and Russia Attack Each Other with Drones Before Zelenskyy Meets Trump in the US</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Zelenskyy will visit the United States tomorrow. He will meet with President Trump to talk about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has lasted more than three years. Before this meeting, Russia and Ukraine used drones to attack each other today.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that President Zelenskyy will visit Washington tomorrow to meet President Trump. This meeting will happen after President Trump met Russian President Putin in Alaska on August 15th.</p>
            <p>The Ukrainian Air Force said that Russia sent 60 drones made in Iran, other types of drones, and one missile called Iskander to attack Ukraine today.</p>
            <p>Vadym Filashkin, the governor of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine, said that Russian attacks in his area yesterday killed 5 people.</p>
            <p>Russia's Ministry of Defense said that Ukraine sent 46 drones to Russia. Most of these drones went to areas near the border, but some also reached Nizhny Novgorod, which is east of Moscow.</p>
            <p>Alexander Khinshtein, the temporary governor of Russia's Kursk region near the border, said that a Ukrainian drone attacked a man in his car, and he died.</p>

            <h1>China Focuses on Its Story of War Against Japan; Scholars Say It Wants to End the Republic of China Using Laws</h1>
            <p>China will have a military parade on September 3rd. This is to make their story about the war against Japan stronger. Experts say that China is trying to use legal and public opinion battles. They want to spread their idea that they are the true rulers. They also want to completely remove the international identity of the Republic of China. The war against Japan is a real historical event. To fight back, we need to show the truth: which battles the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) actually won during that war. If Beijing tries to create false information, it will be seen as a joke around the world.</p>
            <p>This year is 80 years since World War II ended. On September 3rd, the People's Republic of China will hold a military parade in Beijing. They call it "The 80th Anniversary of the Victory of the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War." This is the first parade in ten years. They want to make the CCP's story about the war against Japan and World War II more powerful.</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-min, a professor at National Taiwan University, said in an interview that China wants to have a stronger voice. They want to tell the world that their government is the rightful one. For the CCP, even though President Chiang Kai-shek led the fight and beat Japan, the CCP believes it has "ended" the Republic of China. They think they have taken over the legal position of "China."</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-jen, who leads a research center at National Sun Yat-sen University, said this is a very important part of China's legal and public opinion fight against Taiwan. They want to completely remove the Republic of China's place in the world. Last year, China's office for Taiwan decided to get more control over how history is told around the world, especially about the "Cairo Declaration," which is about Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-jen explained that the People's Republic of China cannot legally take all the rights and positions of the Republic of China in international law. This is because the Republic of China still exists. Also, the People's Republic of China cannot go back in time and change history. So, they can only try to change public opinion now. This also includes China giving a wrong explanation of UN Resolution 2758.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-jen said in simple words that the People's Republic of China is acting as if to say, "Even if you are not dead yet, we want everyone to say that you are dead."</p>
            <p>Chen Shih-min pointed out that the "Cairo Declaration" was a news announcement. News reports from the government in Chongqing at that time clearly stated that after Japan lost the war, the land it took from China should be given back to the "Republic of China," not just "China." For Taiwan, the Republic of China has not disappeared. Twelve friendly countries still recognize the Republic of China as a country. Also, more than one hundred countries accept passports from the Republic of China, Taiwan.</p>
            <p>As for how Taiwan can respond, Chen Shih-min said directly that the war against Japan is a historical fact. We should show everyone the facts: which battles the Chinese Communist Party won between 1937 and 1945, and which battles the Republic of China won. Also, the United States played a very important part back then, and many countries have records of this. If Beijing tries to make up stories, it will be a joke to the world.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-jen said, "We cannot do nothing just because the Chinese Communist Party is making up stories." The Chinese Communist Party keeps releasing official statements. They do this to create proof for international law. Taiwan has few countries that recognize it. So, Taiwan must continue to work with friendly countries to pass laws in their parliaments and make statements in international talks. "If we don't speak, it's like we agree," he said.</p>
            <p>Kuo Yu-jen stressed that it is very difficult for China to use legal and public opinion fights to make the Republic of China lose its international identity. The People's Republic of China was formed in October 1949. It did not take part in the "Cairo Declaration" in 1943. It also did not sign the "San Francisco Peace Treaty" in 1951. Historical facts cannot be erased.</p>
            <p>About the People's Republic of China's military parade on September 3rd, Kuo Yu-jen believes China is carefully trying to show that it is a power that keeps the world stable. They want to make it look like the United States is the one changing the world order. So, China is inviting many countries to the parade. Chen Shih-min said the parade also shows that Chinese President Xi Jinping's government is strong.</p>
