            <h1>Kaohsiung's Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market Upgrades, New Entrance Landmark to Be Unveiled</h1>
            <p>Kaohsiung City's "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market" has been open for 10 years. To celebrate its 10th birthday, there will be a thank-you party on the 30th. They will also show a new entrance design. On that day, if you spend over 100 NT dollars, you can join a lottery. You might win prizes like a Gogoro scooter and other good gifts.</p>
            <p>The "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market" is famous for selling all kinds of seafood and local snacks. It is a popular place to visit in northern Kaohsiung. To make the area better, the city government got 13 million NT dollars from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They used this money to build a new and modern entrance for the market. They also planned more comfortable areas for shopping, eating, and resting. This work was finished this year.</p>
            <p>Mr. Liao Tai-Hsiang, who is in charge of Kaohsiung's Economic Development Bureau, said that the new entrance has blue steel frames. These frames look like the "home for fishermen." Inside the market, there are blue and white roofs that cross over each other. This creates a bright "seafood hallway." Near the port, they added a "port shared eating and resting area." This gives people a nice place to meet.</p>
            <p>Mr. Liao also said that with professional design, the fish market is now better for shopping and relaxing. It also attracts more visitors. The market is becoming a place that combines culture, tourism, and community life.</p>
            <p>The Economic Development Bureau announced today that to celebrate the 10th anniversary and the new look, the management committee will hold the "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market 10th Anniversary Thanksgiving Celebration" on the 30th, from 10 AM to 5 PM. They will also officially show the new entrance design.</p>
            <p>Mr. Zheng Rui-Yi, the general secretary of the Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market, said that if you spend over 100 NT dollars on that day, you will get one lottery ticket. Each person can get only one ticket from each stall. The lottery prizes include a Gogoro, an iPhone 16E phone, home appliances, and cash envelopes. There are over 50 big prizes in total, and their value is more than 500,000 NT dollars.</p>
            <p>Also, the event will have performances by Taiwanese singers like Qi Lang and Hsieh Chin-Ching. There will also be shows by local groups. They will also have a free haircut event for charity and a receipt donation activity. This makes the celebration both lively and a way to show love.</p>
            <p>The Economic Development Bureau said that on the day of the event, there will be the usual traffic rules for holidays. They will also close off more roads around Dafu Road. They remind people to follow the traffic officers and to use public transportation to get there. For more information, people can check the official Facebook page of "Xingda Port Tourist Fish Market."</p>

            <h1>East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration to Hold Eurasia-Philippine Plate Music Concert, Percussion Music to Interpret Earth's Heartbeat</h1>
            <p>There will be a music concert called the 'Eurasia-Philippine Plate Music Concert.' It will combine the land, music rhythm, and memories of the area. This concert will happen on October 11th at Yuli Township Square in Hualien. The Ju Percussion Group will play music that sounds like the Earth's heartbeat. People are invited to experience this "geological music" at the place where the Eurasian and Philippine Sea plates meet.</p>
            <p>The East Rift Valley National Scenic Area Administration, part of the Tourism Administration, announced today that the concert's theme is "Whispers at the Edge of the Plates." The idea for the concert comes from Yuli's special geology and location. They will use the natural scenery as a stage. The Earth's movements will become music rhythms. Through the strong power of percussion music, the audience will feel that every drum beat is like the Earth's deep heartbeat.</p>
            <p>Mr. Hsu Tsung-Min, the head of the administration, said that they want more students from colleges and younger schools to experience the powerful feeling of percussion instruments. So, they asked the music group to offer a free 30-minute percussion experience before the main show. Musicians will teach about the parts of the instruments, rhythms, basic playing, and how to play together. This will let interested children feel the magic of percussion music up close.</p>
            <p>The administration also said that besides the "Eurasia-Philippine Plate Music Concert," there will also be a special market. Businesses from the tourist area will set up stalls. They will sell local farm products and handmade crafts from Hualien and Taitung.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is a "Slow Ride Through the Rift Valley Plate Cycling" event that mixes exercise and learning about geography. On the second day (October 12th) morning, people will gather and start riding their bikes. There are two groups based on how difficult the ride is: the Batongguan Ancient Trail Cycling Challenge Group (34 km) and the Eurasia-Philippine Plate Leisure Cycling Group (20 km). Riders can explore where the Eurasian and Philippine plates meet, the Batongguan Ancient Trail, and the small town of Yuli. You can find information about the event and how to sign up on the administration's official website and Facebook page.</p>

            <h1>Fraud Group Uses High-Speed Rail Refund System to Launder Money, Yunlin Prosecutors Indict Malaysian Courier</h1>
            <p>A group of scammers used the High-Speed Rail (HSR) refund system to illegally clean money. A Malaysian man named Chen was working for them. He was refunding many tickets at the HSR Yunlin Station to get cash. This was unusual. The police were told about it and arrested him there. The Yunlin District Prosecutors' Office has finished its investigation and will now take him to court for crimes like fraud.</p>
            <p>The Yunlin District Prosecutors' Office said in a press release today that the Huwei Police Precinct received a report on June 26th this year. They found a 42-year-old Malaysian man named Chen who was refunding a lot of tickets for cash at the HSR Yunlin Station. They thought he might be involved in money laundering.</p>
            <p>The prosecutors said that when the police arrived and questioned him, they believed Mr. Chen was a money laundering courier. They arrested him immediately and took 114,000 NT dollars from him. After investigating, they found that Mr. Chen came to Taiwan with a tourist visa on June 24th. On his third day, he started using the refund machines at HSR stations.</p>
            <p>Using HSR refunds for money laundering is very rare. So, the police asked the Yunlin District Prosecutors' Office to lead the investigation. Prosecutor Yeh Chiao-Chun was in charge.</p>
            <p>After questioning, the prosecutors believed Mr. Chen was involved in organized crime, fraud, and money laundering. These were serious crimes. Also, they thought he might try to talk to other people involved in the crime. So, they asked the Yunlin District Court to keep him in jail, and the court agreed. The investigation is now finished, and they will take him to court as the law says.</p>
            <p>The police and prosecutors found out that the scam group first used the personal information of a man named Lin, who knew nothing about it. They tricked victims by telling them they had "won a prize and needed to pay a handling fee." After the victims made a mistake, members of the group pretended to be Mr. Lin. They used the internet many times to buy 10 business class tickets from Nangang to Zuoying on Taiwan High-Speed Rail. The total cost was 25,000 NT dollars. Then, the group used "Taiwan Pay" to create a QR Code for payment. They sent this to the victims so they could scan it and pay the prize handling fee. After that, they told Mr. Chen to go to Tainan and Yunlin HSR stations. He used the fake identity information to get cash refunds for the tickets. This helped them achieve their goals of fraud and money laundering.</p>
            <p>After this happened, the High-Speed Rail company immediately put an announcement on its official website. Starting now, they have stopped the QR Code payment function for online ticket booking. While they improve the system, people cannot use "Taiwan Pay" to pay. Passengers are asked to use credit cards for online payments instead.</p>
