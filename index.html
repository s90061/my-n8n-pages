Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved universities and higher education institutions in mainland China. The list now has 154 universities and 191 colleges. Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. This is the first change to the list in almost ten years.
In a meeting with university presidents earlier this year, Education Minister Cheng Eng-yao said that universities linked to China's United Front Work Department have special purposes and are not purely academic. He stated that it is necessary to stop cooperating with them, and the Ministry of Education will no longer recognize their degrees in the future.
The Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved Chinese universities and officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University. The Ministry explained that since 2019, Jinan University in mainland China has been under the control of the United Front Work Department. To ensure that Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment, and because learning places should not have specific political goals, Guangzhou Jinan University was taken off the approved list.
The Ministry of Education also repeated that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be healthy, orderly, respectful, and mutually beneficial. Schools arranging student exchange trips to China must follow cross-strait policies and laws. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of activities, organizers, travel plans, and promotional materials. These activities should not have political goals or content. Schools should also avoid accepting one-sided invitations or helping with China's policies and political messages.
The Ministry of Education also stated that if schools are unsure about the organizers or plans for an activity, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. Taiwan still hopes to encourage young students from both sides to learn and understand each other. However, during exchanges, students should be aware of risks and pay attention to the background of the organizers and if there are any political aims.
