Taiwan's Ministry of Education recently updated its list of approved universities and colleges in mainland China. Guangzhou Jinan University has been officially removed from this list. This is the first change to the list in nearly ten years. After this change, there are still 154 universities and 191 vocational colleges on the list.

Minister of Education, Cheng Ying-yao, said earlier this year that schools controlled by China's United Front Work Department have special goals and are not purely academic. He stated that stopping cooperation with such schools is necessary and that Taiwan will no longer accept their degrees.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University because since 2019, it has been managed by China's United Front Work Department. The Ministry wants to make sure Taiwanese students study in a normal academic environment, free from political influence.

The Ministry also reminded that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools organizing trips to China should follow Taiwan's rules. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose of events, the organizers, and the content to avoid political messages or one-sided offers.

The Ministry also advised schools to ask for help from the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education if they are unsure about any event organizers or plans. They want to encourage young people from both sides to learn together but also to be aware of possible risks and political intentions of event organizers.
