            <h1>President Lai visits Yizhu to comfort repair workers as power in Chiayi area is 99.9% restored</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 18th (CNA) â€“ Typhoon Danas hit the coastal areas of Chiayi County hard on July 7th. It caused power outages for over 250,000 homes. Taipower has been working day and night to fix the power, and 99.9% of the homes now have electricity again. President Lai Ching-te visited Yizhu at noon today to thank and comfort the repair workers.</p>
            <p>Taipower's Chiayi branch released a statement saying that President Lai went to Taipower's Songmei repair office in Yizhu Township today. He met with Taipower staff to show his care. He listened to a report about how the area is recovering from the disaster and how the power repairs are going. He also offered comfort and encouragement to the repair workers. He thanked the Taipower staff on the front lines for starting work immediately after the disaster and continuing to work hard. This helped electricity come back little by little after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that President Lai's visit and concern were real support and encouragement for the staff who stayed on site. President Lai even signed the workers' "Whampoa backpacks" (work backpacks) and work clothes.</p>
            <p>Taipower stated that by 5 PM today, 99.9% of the power in the Chiayi area had been restored. About 212 homes still need power fixed. These are mostly in remote parts of Yizhu Township and Budai Township. Most of the homes without power are at the end of power lines. For these, workers need to put up poles and wires pole by pole, and section by section. This makes the work much harder and takes more time.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that during this long and difficult repair job, staff from all over Taiwan came to help without complaining. Also, many people in the community showed great support. On sunny days, they brought cold water, and at meal times, they brought food.</p>
            <p>Taipower reminded people that if they are in an area where power has been announced as restored but their home still has no electricity, they can report it through the "Taiwan Power APP" or by calling the 1911 customer service hotline. Taipower will immediately send staff to check and fix it. (Edited by Lin Shu-hui) 1140718</p>

            <h1>New Book About "Pingtung Land Crabs" Released: 20 Years of Conservation Work Put into One Book</h1>
            <p>Pingtung, July 18th (CNA) â€“ The Houwan area in Pingtung has a lot of land crabs. With support from the Pingtung County Government, the Taiwan Animal Protection Administrative Supervision Alliance has published a new book called "Pingtung Land Crabs, Thank You!" This book collects nearly 20 years of environmental protection efforts. Today, a book launch event was held to share it with the public.</p>
            <p>The book launch for "Pingtung Land Crabs, Thank You!! The Real Story of Land Exchange Conservation in Houwan" was held today at the Pingtung Tobacco Factory 1936 Cultural Park. Pingtung County Magistrate Chou Chun-mi and environmental activists attended the event.</p>
            <p>The book tells the story of how, starting in 2006, the Houwan area in Checheng Township, Pingtung, faced the building of a fancy hotel. Local groups and the community together suggested a new idea: exchanging land for conservation. At that time, County Magistrate Pan Meng-an strongly supported this idea. In the end, the company building the hotel agreed to work together. This successfully protected the most important land crab home in Taiwan. It was the first time in Taiwan that regular people started an environmental idea, and the government and private companies worked together to change land use for nature.</p>
            <p>During the event, Chou Chun-mi said that conservation work is like a relay race, where one person passes the baton to the next. After she took office, the county government team, along with the Directorate General of Highways and the Kenting National Park Headquarters, worked to create Taiwan's first continuous land crab ecological corridor. This path of conservation has been difficult, but it shows everyone that protecting nature and developing the area can go together. This makes Pingtung people proud, and it is a great example of sustainable development in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chou Chun-mi said that Houwan has always been home to land crabs. She believes it is their job to protect this area and pass it on. Because many people worked to protect the land crabs, this important land crab home could be saved. She invited people to visit Houwan in person to see the results of the conservation work and enjoy the beauty of local life.</p>
            <p>The Pingtung County Government also mentioned that the new book includes pictures and information on 29 types of land crabs, along with stories and teaching plans. It is good for families with children and for school students to learn about land crab nature. It is an important book that combines learning about the environment with travel.
