**AI Technology Improves Medical Diagnosis Accuracy**

A new study shows that artificial intelligence (AI) is making medical diagnoses more accurate. Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital used AI to analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs. They found that the AI system was able to identify diseases with greater precision than human doctors in some cases.

The AI system was especially good at spotting subtle signs of cancer in early stages. This could lead to earlier treatment and better outcomes for patients. However, experts emphasize that AI should not replace doctors. Instead, it should be used as a tool to help them make better decisions.

AI can process large amounts of data quickly and identify patterns that humans might miss. This technology has the potential to transform healthcare and improve patient care significantly. More research is needed to fully understand the capabilities and limitations of AI in medicine.

**Electric Vehicle Sales Surge Worldwide Amid Climate Concerns**

Sales of electric vehicles (EVs) are increasing rapidly across the globe. Growing concerns about climate change and rising fuel prices are encouraging more people to switch to EVs. Governments are also supporting this trend by offering subsidies and tax incentives for EV purchases.

Major automakers are investing heavily in electric vehicle technology. They plan to launch dozens of new EV models in the coming years. This increased competition is driving down prices and making EVs more affordable for consumers.

However, challenges remain. These include the limited availability of charging infrastructure and the high cost of batteries. Overcoming these challenges is essential to accelerate the transition to electric mobility. The future of transportation is likely to be electric, as the world seeks to reduce carbon emissions.

**Interest Rate Hike Announced by Central Bank to Curb Inflation**

The central bank has announced an increase in interest rates in an effort to control inflation. Inflation has been rising steadily in recent months, driven by strong consumer demand and supply chain bottlenecks. The central bank hopes that higher interest rates will cool down the economy and bring inflation back to its target level.

The decision to raise interest rates is likely to affect consumers and businesses alike. Borrowing costs will increase, making it more expensive to take out loans for homes, cars, and other purchases. Businesses may also delay investments due to higher borrowing costs.

Some economists fear that raising interest rates too quickly could trigger a recession. The central bank has stated that it will carefully monitor the economy and adjust its policies as needed. The goal is to achieve price stability without harming economic growth.
