            <h1>The Washington Post: Trump's Actions Against Brazil Did Not Work</h1>
            <p>Today, The Washington Post, an American newspaper, wrote an article. It said that Donald Trump's actions against Brazil did not work. He announced a 50% tax on goods from Brazil. He did this to protest how Brazil's highest court was handling the case of former President Bolsonaro. But it had the opposite effect.</p>
            <p>Ishaan Tharoor, a writer for The Washington Post, believes Trump's 50% tax on Brazilian goods "backfired." This action did not make Brazil weaker. Instead, it made the current President Lula's government look stronger. It also gained support from people in Brazil.</p>
            <p>The article points out that the Brazilian President's strong reaction to the new tax made more people support him. It even got support from some business leaders who usually speak against the Brazilian government.</p>
            <p>People from Brazil and the US who work in diplomacy have openly said they don't agree with Trump's position. They said it hurts the image of the US as a country that supports democracy.</p>
            <p>According to BBC Brazil News, the relationship between Brazil and the United States is getting worse. Brazil's highest court is looking into former President Jair Bolsonaro for possibly trying to start a coup. At the same time, the US took away the visa of Brazilian Judge Alexandre de Moraes as a way to get back at Brazil. A few days before, Judge Moraes had ordered Bolsonaro to stay in certain areas and wear an electronic tag. This was also called a "political witch hunt" against Brazilian courts.</p>
            <p>The United States buys the third-most goods from Brazil, after China and the European Union. The new tax is planned to start on August 1st. Officials and experts in Brazil think that the US government will probably not change its mind about the tax. This is because the political problems between the two countries are getting worse.</p>

            <h1>US House Passes Taiwan Bill to Show Chinese Officials' Money and Stop Attacks on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>Today, the US House of Representatives agreed to pass the "Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act." Both political parties supported this bill. It asks the government to show how much money high-ranking Chinese Communist Party officials have in the US if China takes military action against Taiwan. The lawmakers who suggested the bill said that dishonest deals and bank accounts of rich Chinese officials will be shown to the public so that the people of China will know.</p>
            <p>The "Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act" was put forward in February this year. Lisa McClain, who leads the Republican group in the House, and Brad Sherman, an important Democratic lawmaker who has always supported Taiwan, both suggested it. The bill targets members of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee and members of the Central Committee who are involved with Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The bill asks the Treasury Department to tell Congress about the money these officials have. This includes the total amount of money, what kind of money it is, and the names of the banks or financial groups involved. It also asks for a report to Congress on how this money was obtained and if any illegal or dishonest methods were used to get or use it.</p>
            <p>The bill also gives the Treasury Secretary the power to stop Chinese officials from using their money in US banks. It also says that a summary or part of the report, which is not secret, must be made public. This will be done on the Treasury Department's website and social media. It can be in Chinese, English, or any other language the Secretary thinks is right.</p>
            <p>The bill also tells the Treasury Secretary to stop banks from doing important business with the close family members of these officials.</p>
            <p>In March this year, the US national intelligence department released a report. It was called "Wealth and Corrupt Activities of the Chinese Communist Party Leadership." The report said that even though Xi Jinping became the head of the Chinese Communist Party in 2012, his family members may have sold some of their property. But his family still has business interests and money in banks worth millions of US dollars.</p>
            <p>"The US cannot be careless about China's growing aggressive actions." This afternoon, before the vote, the bill's supporter, Lisa McClain, said this. She is a representative from Michigan, a state that knows how important manufacturing, trade, and global peace are. She said, "I deeply understand how important peace in the Indo-Pacific area is for American jobs and our economy."</p>
            <p>She pointed out that Taiwan is not only a democratic friend of the US. It is also very important in the world's supply chain. This is especially true for semiconductors, which are parts that power many things, from cars to defense systems.</p>
            <p>McClain said this bill sends a clear message from both political parties: if Beijing starts a war against Taiwan, there will be consequences.</p>
            <p>"We are talking about real and specific consequences. The money deals and bank accounts of corrupt Chinese officials in other countries will be shown to everyone. This will let the people of China know."</p>
            <p>McClain stressed that the US is not trying to start a fight. Instead, it is working to stop a fight from happening. To be strong, warnings must be believable. Right now, being believable means passing this bill.</p>
            <p>For a US bill to become a law, both the Senate and the House of Representatives must agree on the exact same words. Then, it goes to the White House for the President to sign it. The "Taiwan Conflict Deterrence Act" was also approved by the House without any votes against it in the last session. However, it did not get scheduled for a vote in the Senate after that.</p>

            <h1>If There is Conflict Near Taiwan, China Might Stop Ships From Fixing Damaged Underwater Cables</h1>
            <p>More than 90% of Taiwan's internet connection depends on underwater cables. These cables are like a "digital lifeline" for Taiwan. An American cybersecurity company recently warned that if there is a conflict around Taiwan, China might stop repair ships from fixing damaged underwater cables. This warning comes after the Chinese coast guard stopped the Philippines from supplying its own ships. The company suggests doing a full test of the system to see how strong it is.</p>
            <p>On July 17, "Insikt Group," the research part of the American cybersecurity company "Recorded Future," released a report. The report was nearly 30 pages long. It talked about "Growing Threats to Submarine Cables Amidst Geopolitical Tensions and Limited Repair Capabilities."</p>
            <p>The report said that China and the Philippines are still arguing over land in the South China Sea. The Chinese coast guard has tried to stop Philippine ships from getting supplies at Second Thomas Shoal, Scarborough Shoal (which Taiwan calls Democracy Reef and China calls Huangyan Island), and Sabina Shoal.</p>
            <p>These are sensitive sea areas. The Philippines controls or claims them, but China also says they belong to China.</p>
            <p>For many years, the Chinese coast guard and other Chinese forces have not only bothered Philippine ships. They have also bothered ships from other countries that claim parts of the South China Sea, and ships operated by outside powers like the United States.</p>
            <p>Insikt Group said these events show that if the situation around Taiwan becomes more tense or if fighting starts, Beijing might act the same way it does in the South China Sea. This means it might stop repair ships from going to fix damaged underwater systems.</p>
            <p>The report says that from 2024 until now, there have been 4 events in the Baltic Sea area. In these events, 8 different underwater cables were damaged. Around Taiwan, there have been 5 similar events. In 4 of these, ships linked to China or Russia were involved.</p>
            <p>These ships were operating in a way that raised questions, or their ownership was not clear. Because of this, later investigations showed that it is hard to say if these cable breaks were caused by attacks from a country.</p>
            <p>The report believes that even though cable breaks can still happen mostly by accident, recent events in the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan show that underwater cable systems are still at risk from things like dragged anchors. Countries can use this simple method to target important systems of their opponents. They can also deny that they did it on purpose.</p>
            <p>Insikt Group thinks that as political tensions grow, similar actions by Russia in the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea, and by China in the West Pacific, might happen more often. Both countries use these actions to put political pressure on others. They can also deny doing it, so the situation does not get much worse.</p>
            <p>China is also getting better at working in deep seas. This might make them better at targeting underwater systems. In January this year, Insikt Group said that a Chinese university, a company, and several people asked for patents for tools that cut underwater cables in 2020, 2013, and 2009.</p>
            <p>Also, Chinese companies are becoming more involved in putting in, owning, and operating underwater cables. This raises the risk of spying for countries and businesses that use these cables.</p>
            <p>The report says that China is getting ready for a possible military attack on Taiwan in the future. Also, the relationship between the US and China is getting worse. Because of this, Beijing might attack underwater cable systems and gather information about them. This would harm the economic, diplomatic, and security goals of the United States and its friends.</p>
            <p>Insikt Group advises that public and private groups work together. They should improve how they watch and protect underwater cable systems in real-time. They should also do full "stress tests." This is very important to make the systems stronger and to prevent events that are not likely to happen but would cause big problems.</p>
