            <h1>Philippine Officials Say South China Sea Stance is Unchanged, Despite President Marcos' Speech</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. gave his speech about the state of the nation. Some people thought he seemed softer towards China. But today, the Philippine President's office and the military said that the Philippines' position on the South China Sea has not changed. They will continue to protect the country's power and rights.</p>
            <p>President Marcos Jr. gave his fourth state of the nation speech in the House of Representatives yesterday. He did not talk about the South China Sea dispute. He repeated that the Philippines wants to be "friends with everyone and enemies with no one." He also said that the country will "be careful and patient" when protecting its land and interests.</p>
            <p>In his speech, which was about 1 hour and 10 minutes long, President Marcos did not clearly mention the disagreement between the Philippines and China in the South China Sea. Some people thought this meant he was becoming softer towards China. They were worried he might give in on the South China Sea issue.</p>
            <p>Today, Lucas Bersamin, the Head of the President's Office, was asked by Philippine media about this. He said that the Philippine government's position on the "West Philippine Sea" has not changed and they are not hesitant.</p>
            <p>Bersamin said that the Philippines is still friendly with China, but China must be friendly back. He added that if China keeps violating the Philippines' power, President Marcos will "certainly not welcome it."</p>
            <p>President Marcos first talked about being friendly and not making enemies in his state of the nation speech in July 2022. But he has also often said in public speeches that the country will not give up "even an inch" of its land.</p>
            <p>Also, military spokesperson Francel Margareth Padilla said today in a press conference that the military will "as always" protect the country's power. She also said that President Marcos's instructions on this are very clear.</p>
            <p>One week before his state of the nation speech, President Marcos visited the United States. At a press conference there, Trump said that the U.S. does not care if the Philippines is friends with China. He said that the Philippines has its own foreign policy and can do anything to make itself great again.</p>
            <p>The Philippines uses the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) to say that it has the right to use the resources in a special economic zone that extends 200 nautical miles into the South China Sea. They call this area the "West Philippine Sea."</p>
            <p>China, however, claims most of the South China Sea using a "ten-dash line" and historical reasons. This area overlaps with the area the Philippines claims. For many years, the two countries have had conflicts in this disputed sea. The Philippine Navy, Coast Guard, and Bureau of Fisheries have often said that Chinese ships have hit their boats and used strong water cannons to stop Philippine fishing and scientific work.</p>
