            <h1>Bangladesh Air Force Chinese-made Trainer Jet Crashes into Capital School Campus; 19 Dead, Over 100 Injured</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Dhaka, July 21st, 2025) Today, a Chinese trainer plane from the Bangladesh Air Force crashed into a school in Dhaka, the capital city. Firefighters reported that at least 19 people died. The government of Bangladesh also said that more than 100 people were hurt in this accident.</p>
            <p>Reuters said that officials reported the accident happened at Milestone School and College. This school is in Uttara district, in the northern part of Dhaka.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse said that the Chinese F-7 BGI trainer plane crashed soon after it took off. This happened at 1:06 PM local time, which was 3:06 PM in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Videos from where the crash happened showed a big fire near some grass. A lot of smoke went up into the sky. Many people watched from far away.</p>
            <p>Pictures from Reuters TV showed that the plane crashed into the side of a building. It made a big hole and broke the metal window bars. Firefighters were spraying water on the broken parts of the plane.</p>
            <p>Bidhan Sarker works at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. He is the head of the burn unit, and some people hurt in the crash were brought there. He said, "A 3rd-grade student was already dead when they arrived. Also, three other injured people, who were 12, 14, and 40 years old, came to our hospital."</p>
            <p>TV pictures also showed people at the crash site screaming and crying. Other people nearby tried to calm them down.</p>
            <p>Masud Tarik is a teacher at the school where the crash happened. He said, "I was taking my children to the school gate when I saw something coming from behind me. Then I heard a big noise, like an explosion. I looked back and only saw fire and smoke."</p>
            <p>Muhammad Yunus, who leads the temporary government in Bangladesh, said they will do what is needed to find out why the accident happened. He also said they will "make sure all help is given."</p>

            <h1>Jeju Air Crash Investigation Points to Pilot Shutting Down Wrong Engine; Families and Pilots Unhappy</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency Seoul, July 21st, 2025) Last December, a Jeju Air plane crashed and 179 people died. Today, someone who knows about the plane crash investigation said that Korean investigators found "clear proof." This proof shows that the pilot turned off the engine that was less broken after birds hit the plane.</p>
            <p>Reuters said that sources shared information. They said that things like the voice recordings from the plane's cockpit, computer information, and the actual switches found in the wreckage, all showed something. They showed that the pilot turned off the left engine, not the right one. This happened just before the plane was supposed to land, after birds hit it.</p>
            <p>The person told Reuters, "The team investigating the crash has clear proof and extra information. So, what they found out will not change." The person did not want their name to be used because the investigators have not yet given a public report about this proof.</p>
            <p>A government worker said that they checked the plane's engines that were found. They found no problems with the engines before the birds hit the plane and before it crashed.</p>
            <p>On December 29th last year, a Jeju Air plane (a Boeing 737-800) crashed at Muan International Airport. There were 181 people on the plane, including passengers and workers. Only 2 people lived. This was the worst plane crash in South Korea.</p>
            <p>A third person who was told about the investigation said that on the 19th, the investigators told the families of the people who died that the right engine was more damaged by the birds. Also, there was indirect proof that the pilot turned off the left engine, which was less damaged.</p>
            <p>Korean news channels like MBN TV and Yonhap News shared this information on the 19th and 20th of the month.</p>
            <p>The Korean investigators stopped a press meeting that was planned for the 19th. This meeting was about the newest information on the engine investigation.</p>
            <p>The lawyers for the families of the people who died said that the families were told about the report before the news meeting. But the families did not want the report to be made public. They felt it blamed the pilot and did not look at other reasons for the crash.</p>
            <p>The Jeju Air plane that crashed went off the runway at Muan International Airport when it tried to land in an emergency. It hit a concrete wall that had navigation tools. This caused the plane's body to catch fire and partly explode.</p>
            <p>On the weekend, people representing the families of those who died, and the union for Jeju Air pilots, said the investigation should look at the concrete wall. Experts in flying planes think that this wall might have caused many people to die.</p>
            <p>The Jeju Air pilots' union said that the Korea Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board (ARAIB) is "tricking people." They said ARAIB says the left engine was fine, even though pieces of birds were found in both engines.</p>
            <p>The pilots' union said that ARAIB did not show any scientific or technical proof that the plane could land safely with only the left engine working. They think ARAIB is trying to blame the pilot for everything.</p>
