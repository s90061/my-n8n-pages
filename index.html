            <h1>Trump: Maybe Air Support for Ukraine, No Soldiers on the Ground</h1>
            <p>The US President, Donald Trump, said today that the US will not send soldiers to help Ukraine in any peace deal. However, he suggested that the US could give support from the air. At the same time, countries in Europe have started talking about safety promises before a possible meeting between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The French news agency (AFP) said that Trump has been working hard on diplomacy to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. He met with Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and many European leaders at the White House yesterday. This meeting happened only three days after Trump had an important talk with Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska.</p>
            <p>Trump said that Putin agreed to meet Zelenskyy and accepted some safety promises for Ukraine from Western countries. But people in Ukraine and Western countries are being very careful about these promises, and many details are still not clear.</p>
            <p>Three people who know about the talks told AFP that when Putin talked to Trump, he suggested that he and Zelenskyy meet in Moscow. One of these people said that Zelenskyy immediately said no to meeting in the capital city of the country that attacked them.</p>
            <p>Since Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022, the US has given billions of dollars to Kyiv. Trump has strongly criticized this. He said that European countries "are willing to send soldiers" to make sure any peace agreement works.</p>
            <p>Trump told Fox News that "France, Germany, and a few other countries like the UK want to send soldiers. We are willing to help, especially with support from the air."</p>

            <h1>US Secretary Says They Are Talking to Intel About Buying Shares, Chip Production Must Not Rely on Taiwan</h1>
            <p>After Nvidia and AMD agreed to give 15% of the money they get from selling chips to China back to the government, the US Secretary of Commerce, Howard Lutnick, confirmed today that the US is talking with Intel about buying 10% of its shares. He also said again what he often said before he became a Secretary: "We cannot depend on Taiwan" for making computer chips.</p>
            <p>Lutnick told CNBC, a business news channel, that the US government might become Intel's biggest shareholder. But this would not mean the government would control how Intel is run. He said, "This is not about control. We are just changing the money given by President Biden's government into shares. And the US government will not have the right to vote."</p>
            <p>Lutnick again spoke against the CHIPS Act, which President Biden signed. He said this law gives money to companies that make semiconductors, but US taxpayers do not get anything in return.</p>
            <p>He asked, "Why should we give so much money to a company worth 100 billion US dollars? How does this help American taxpayers? Trump's answer is that we should get shares with this money."</p>
            <p>Intel did get the most help from the "CHIPS Act." It received 7.9 billion US dollars to make commercial semiconductors. It also got 3 billion US dollars for a special project from the Pentagon called "Secure Enclave." On top of that, Intel can ask for 11 billion US dollars in loans.</p>
            <p>Lutnick said, imagine this: "Biden's government actually gave money to Intel for free, and also to TSMC for free. All these companies are just getting money for nothing."</p>
            <p>Bloomberg news agency had reported earlier, quoting officials from the White House, that Trump's government was talking about buying about 10% of Intel's shares. At the same time, SoftBank Group Corp. from Japan also said it would invest 2 billion US dollars in Intel, becoming one of Intel's ten biggest shareholders.</p>
            <p>If the White House decides to buy shares, it would give a strong boost to Intel's money situation. Because Intel has been letting go of workers and spending less money recently, people in the market are paying close attention to these talks.</p>
            <p>Intel's share price went up by 11% today during trading in New York. SoftBank's shares, traded in Tokyo, fell by 4% today.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg said that the US government talking about buying shares in Intel shows a big change in how the US handles its semiconductor policy. If this deal is completed, it could set an example for similar agreements between the US government and other companies that make chips.</p>
            <p>Lutnick also said today that for national safety reasons, the US wants to bring some chip manufacturing back to the US. He stated, "We need to make our own chips. We cannot depend on Taiwan."</p>
            <p>At the same time, Lutnick did not say no to the idea of Nvidia selling its new AI chips to China. These new AI chips would use the latest Blackwell technology and would be more powerful than the H20 chips that are currently allowed to be sent to China.</p>
            <p>Lutnick talked about Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia. He said, "Of course, he wants to sell a new chip to China. I heard him talk to the President about it, and the President will listen to what these good technology companies say. In the end, he will decide what to do."</p>
