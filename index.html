            <h1>Trump's New Tariffs Are Coming; Experts Think Taiwan Will Agree with the US by August 7</h1>
            <p>On July 31, US President Donald Trump announced new tariffs that will start on August 7. These tariffs include a 20% tax on goods from Taiwan. But talks between Taiwan and the US are still happening. Some international experts believe that Taiwan, India, and other economies might reach an agreement within the 7-day grace period.</p>
            <p>News reports say that Trump often sets trade deadlines and then cancels or extends them. This has led to people saying, "Trump always chickens out." However, experts think he will not change his mind this time.</p>
            <p>Matthew Aks, a public policy expert at Evercore ISI, said he does not expect big changes to the new order. But he thinks some economies, like Taiwan or India, might finalize agreements within the 7-day period.</p>
            <p>Josh Lipsky, an international economics expert at the Atlantic Council in Washington, also believes Trump is "not chickening out." He says Trump is "doing what he promised, or even more," about tariffs during his election campaign.</p>
            <p>Before announcing the latest tariffs, Trump had difficult talks and made several agreements. The most important ones were with the European Union (EU), Japan, and South Korea. Trump set different tariff rates and boasted that the US would get large investments.</p>
            <p>On August 1, Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te posted on Facebook. He wrote that the US equal tariff policy had a first good result on August 1, after the US government told them. The tariff rate was lowered from 32% to 20%. But because the final meeting has not happened yet, the final rate is not set. This is why the 20% tariff is "temporary."</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun and her team recently had new talks in Washington about the new US equal tariff rates. She returned to Taiwan this morning and said, "The talks must continue. We will keep working hard to get a better tariff rate."</p>

            <h1>Financial Companies' Money Abroad Drops to 27 Trillion Taiwan Dollars, Biggest Fall in One Quarter</h1>
            <p>Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that by the end of the second quarter, the total risk of financial groups in other countries was 27.02 trillion Taiwan dollars. Because the Taiwan dollar got much stronger in the second quarter, this money abroad fell by 2.09 trillion Taiwan dollars in just one quarter, which is a 7.2% drop. This is the biggest drop since they started keeping records in 2015. Out of this, 9.56 trillion Taiwan dollars was in the United States. The US is still the country where Taiwan's financial groups have the most money, but its share of the total money abroad dropped to 35.39%.</p>
            <p>The FSC has been tracking how much money Taiwan's financial groups have at home and in other countries every quarter since the second quarter of 2015. This includes money lent to other banks, loans, and total investments.</p>
            <p>In the first quarter of this year, the total money financial groups had abroad reached a record high of 29.12 trillion Taiwan dollars. However, when the money abroad (which is in US dollars) was changed to Taiwan dollars, the amount seemed to drop. This is because the Taiwan dollar became 10.97% stronger in the second quarter, which affected the numbers.</p>
            <p>The FSC's numbers show that by the end of the second quarter, financial groups' money abroad fell to 27.02 trillion Taiwan dollars, a big drop of 2.09 trillion Taiwan dollars in one quarter. However, the total money financial groups have in Taiwan continued to go up to 47.56 trillion Taiwan dollars, an increase of 1.12 trillion Taiwan dollars this quarter. The total money in Taiwan and other countries combined was 74.587971 trillion Taiwan dollars, which is 974.503 billion Taiwan dollars less than last quarter.</p>
            <p>Looking at the top 10 countries or areas where financial groups have money abroad, they are the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates. Compared to the first quarter, only the money in Japan increased this quarter, while the money in other countries decreased.</p>
            <p>The money in the United States was 9.5635 trillion Taiwan dollars, making it number one. However, the money financial groups have in the US fell below 10 trillion Taiwan dollars, dropping by 792.3 billion Taiwan dollars in one quarter. This is the biggest drop ever for money in the US. The US share of the total money abroad also went down a little from 35.56% to 35.39%. Compared to the first quarter of this year, both loans and investments went down, but changes in exchange rates also played a part.</p>
            <p>Next, China is still the second biggest country for Taiwan's financial groups' money abroad. By the end of the second quarter, the total money in China was 1.8958 trillion Taiwan dollars. This is the lowest it has been since records began, falling below 2 trillion Taiwan dollars for the first time. It dropped by 149.9 billion Taiwan dollars in one quarter. The changes show that money invested, loans, and money lent to other banks all went down.</p>
            <p>Among the top 10 countries for money abroad, financial groups' money in Japan was 1.1279 trillion Taiwan dollars, which is 12.309 billion Taiwan dollars more than last quarter. This was mainly because investments went up. Because of this, Japan is now again in sixth place, ahead of South Korea. Financial groups' money in South Korea was 1.0731 trillion Taiwan dollars, putting it in seventh place, a drop of 52.536 billion Taiwan dollars this quarter.</p>

            <h1>"Huang Yi & KUKA" Debuts in Osaka for We TAIWAN, Human-Robot Dance Touches Hearts</h1>
            <p>As part of "We TAIWAN Taiwan Culture in Osaka and Kansai Expo," a series of performances showing Taiwan's cultural power is being held at the historic Osaka Central Public Hall during the Osaka Expo. The human-robot dance "Huang Yi & KUKA" had its first show this afternoon. The detailed and warm performance amazed the Japanese audience.</p>
            <p>Choreographer Huang Yi and the industrial robot arm "KUKA" have performed together since 2012, visiting 47 cities. Since 2017, they have also added audio descriptions especially for people who cannot see well. This is the first time "Huang Yi & KUKA" has performed in Japan. They invited Japanese voice actors to record the Japanese version. After launching an English version at the Lincoln Center in the US last year, this is another time the team has made art easy for everyone to enjoy in their own language.</p>
            <p>During the talk after the show, Huang Yi said that adding audio descriptions helps more people participate in art. He said that if art can be closer to more people, and if audio descriptions let friends who cannot see well also enjoy art, it is a way for art, which might seem not useful, to truly help people's lives.</p>
            <p>Huang Yi said performing in Japan felt like "making a dream come true." This is because the idea for dancing with a robot actually came from the popular Japanese comic book "Doraemon." He also showed a "Doraemon" drawing he made as a child, which his father had kept safely for many years.</p>
            <p>He said that even though his life was harder when he was young, the stories of "Doraemon" made him believe that "technology can change lives." And "Doraemon's" way of using tools to help people influenced how he created shows with robots. He also joked that he really had to thank Fujiko F. Fujio for creating "Doraemon."</p>
            <p>Huang Yi also shared his thoughts on KUKA. He said that after working with KUKA for over ten years, it feels "a little like I transferred part of my soul to KUKA." But he, as a dancer, gets older and his body changes. "However, KUKA's timeline seems to have stayed the same as when we first worked together."</p>
            <p>Some audience members were curious about how KUKA feels. He said KUKA is like a child who will never grow up, always looking at the world with a child's eyes. He said that when he sees the dancers he works with getting older, "I really want to know what KUKA is thinking too."</p>
            <p>"Huang Yi & KUKA" has three shows today and tomorrow. Almost all 600 seats for each show were booked. An hour before the show, hundreds of people were in a long line waiting to enter.</p>
            <p>Miyuki Torii, a 54-year-old audience member from Osaka, told CNA that she saw an advertisement for this "human-robot dance" performance at the "Taiwan Spectrum" exhibition venue (at GRAND GREEN OSAKA). She was very curious, so she signed up to attend.</p>
            <p>She said she had not heard of Huang Yi before. She thought "human-robot dance" meant dancing with a human-like robot. But when she saw the show, she found out it was with a robot arm. Yet, it showed human emotions and love so completely, which deeply moved her. She realized that "love can truly be shown through dance." She said that because this performance was so wonderful, she really wanted to join other We TAIWAN activities.</p>
            <p>Besides "Huang Yi & KUKA," We TAIWAN will also present other shows at the Osaka Central Public Hall. These include "Let Go of Your Mind," a new immersive show by "Gang-a-tsui Theatre," "Leaving Future VR360 Screening," which has 10 works in 4 parts, "The Bright Past and Present of Taiwanese Cinema," showing 10 selected Taiwanese movies, and "Magical Taiwan â€“ Taiwan Literature Exhibition," which is for Japan's Obon festival.</p>
