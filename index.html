Wildfires in western Syria, in the Latakia area, have now been controlled after spreading for 10 days. The fires destroyed a lot of forests and farms, and many people had to leave their homes.

The Civil Defense said that the fires stopped spreading yesterday and are now completely under control. Firefighters are working to cool down the affected areas and check for any new fires. Around 100 square kilometers of land were burned. Fire teams from other countries like Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, and Iraq helped put out the fires. Officials said this is the best situation in the last 10 days, but they are still working to prevent the fires from spreading again, especially if the wind changes.

**Baseball Player Chen Chieh-hsien Envies Young Taiwan Team Players**

Chen Chieh-hsien, who was the captain of Taiwan's baseball team in the Premier12 tournament, attended a special event for young baseball players chosen for different Taiwan teams (U12, Asia Youth, U18). He said he felt a bit envious of them.

Chen explained that when he was in elementary and junior high school, he was a very good pitcher and could throw the ball very fast, but he never got to join an official national team. He remembered playing in a special international game when he was young, which was a great memory. He believes that being chosen for the national team is a big honor and shows that a player's hard work has been noticed. He was very moved by the ceremony and thanked the baseball association for helping young players.

**Prague Zoo Helps Animals Stay Cool with Ice**

The Prague Zoo is finding fun ways to help its animals stay cool as summer gets hotter. For example, they give their polar bears 3 tons of ice blocks to play with. The polar bears love rolling around and rubbing on the ice, which is very funny to watch for visitors.

The zoo orders ice when the weather forecast says it will be hotter than 30 degrees Celsius. Other animals, like European bison, Przewalski's horses, and kea parrots, also receive ice because they live in cold mountain areas. Capybaras also get ice, which helps make their living space more interesting. The zoo also gives special ice cream to gorillas and orangutans. They also use water spray systems and air conditioning to keep the animals comfortable during the hot summer.
