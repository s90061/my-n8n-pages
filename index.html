            <h1>US denies visas to Palestinian officials before UN summit</h1>
            <p>Today, the United States announced that it will not give visas to members of the Palestinian Authority who want to attend the UN General Assembly in September. France is leading an effort to recognize Palestine as a country.</p>
            <p>This unusual action shows that the Trump government is supporting the Israeli government even more. The Israeli government strongly disagrees with Palestine becoming a country. It also tries to link the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank with Hamas, a group in Gaza that is against it.</p>
            <p>The US Department of State said in a statement: "Before the UN General Assembly, Secretary Rubio refused to give and also cancelled visas for members of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority."</p>
            <p>The Department of State added: "The Trump government has made it clear that holding the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority responsible for not keeping their promises and harming the chances for peace is good for our national security."</p>
            <p>When Trump had legal problems after leaving office, he often used the term "lawfare" to describe his situation. Now, the Department of State uses this idea to say that Palestine is fighting "lawfare" by complaining about Israel to the International Criminal Court and the International Court of Justice.</p>
            <p>The Department of State asked the Palestinian Authority to stop "trying to get one-sided recognition for a imagined Palestinian state."</p>
            <p>The Palestinian Authority said in a statement through its official news agency, WAFA, that it "asks the US government to think again and cancel this decision." It also said that this action "clearly goes against international law and the UN Headquarters Agreement."</p>
            <p>Israel's Foreign Minister, Gideon Saar, posted on X (a social media platform). He thanked the Trump government for "taking this brave step and standing with Israel again."</p>

            <h1>Super Micro shows weaknesses in financial control; stock price drops almost 5%</h1>
            <p>Super Micro Computer, a company that makes servers for AI, said again that it still has problems with how it controls its financial reporting. Today, its stock price fell by almost 5% during trading in the US market.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Super Micro revealed in a document filed on August 28th that unsolved problems could "negatively affect" how the company reports its business results on time and correctly.</p>
            <p>In its report for the financial year ending June 30th, Super Micro repeated a similar statement it made in its quarterly report in May this year. The company said it is working to fix these problems.</p>
            <p>Last year, Super Micro, which is based in San Jose, California, missed the deadline in August for handing in its yearly financial report. Then, in October, Ernst & Young, an accounting firm, stopped being its auditor because they had worries about how the company was run and how clear its information was.</p>
            <p>Super Micro submitted its late annual report earlier this year.</p>
            <p>Super Micro's stock price dropped a lot today during trading in the US market. If it keeps falling, the company could lose more than 1 billion US dollars from its market value, which is around 26 billion US dollars.</p>
            <p>Dell, a company that competes with Super Micro, also saw its stock price fall by about 10% today. This happened because making AI servers is expensive and there is more competition, which cancelled out the positive predictions for the demand for AI infrastructure.</p>
