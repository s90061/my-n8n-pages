            <p>Taiwanese player Yang Po-hsiang has joined the first team of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles in Japan. This is his first time being promoted. He started his baseball career in Japan when he was in high school. Last year, the Rakuten Golden Eagles chose him in the draft as their 6th pick. This season, he played 87 games in the second team. He might play his first game today when Rakuten plays against the Seibu Lions.</p>
            <p>Yang Po-hsiang is 20 years old and plays infield. He comes from Taitung. He went to Meishu Gakuen Hitachi High School in Japan. He also played for the Ibaraki Amity Planets in an independent league in Japan.

Japanese news outlet Sponichi Annex reported yesterday that Yang Po-hsiang is expected to play his first game with the first team today. Yang Po-hsiang told Japanese reporters, "I want to show how fast I am. I also want to play good defense. It would be even better if I could get my first hit."</p>
            <p>Mune„ÇÑ„Åæ Rui, who was the first player picked by Rakuten in the same year as Yang Po-hsiang, said, "I will work hard. I want to play alongside him in the future, and maybe even be better than him."</p>

            <h1>Wu Chih-chung Attends Korean National Day Event, Hopes Taiwan and Korea Stay Friends</h1>
            <p>Yesterday, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wu Chih-chung went to the "2025 Republic of Korea National Day Celebration" party. The Korean Representative Office in Taipei hosted it. Wu Chih-chung said that Taiwan and Korea believe in democracy. Taiwan wants to use its strengths to make the friendship between Taiwan and Korea stronger. He finished his speech in Korean, wishing for a long-lasting friendship between the two countries and for them to do well.</p>
            <p>Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent out a news release. It said that Wu Chih-chung spoke at the event. He said that the world is changing very fast. The current international system, which is based on rules, is being challenged by unstable forces. Taiwan and Korea both believe in democracy. They are also close to each other geographically and their industries help each other. Taiwan wants to use its three main strengths: "global democratic value chain," "first island chain in the Indo-Pacific," and "non-red supply chain." With these, Taiwan wants to make its relationship with Korea even stronger.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung also thanked the foreign ministers of Korea, the US, and Japan. After their meeting in September, they said in a joint statement that they support peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. He also said that Taiwan always supports peace and no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. Taiwan is against any military actions or threats that could harm peace. The friendship between Taiwan and Korea is also based on the good interactions between their people. In 2024, 2.5 million people traveled between Taiwan and Korea. Both countries are the third biggest source of tourists for each other. They talk to each other a lot, even with different languages, and share their cultures often.</p>
            <p>Wu Chih-chung ended his speech in Korean. He hoped that the friendship between Taiwan and Korea would last a long time and that both countries would be successful.</p>
            <p>Mr. Koh Sangwook, who is the acting representative of the Korean Representative Office in Taipei, first sent his sadness and sympathy to those who died or were hurt by Typhoon Kanas in Taiwan. He said that Taiwan and Korea are not only "close neighbors" who share similar ideas, but also "friends" who often interact in culture, economy, and other areas. Many people travel between Taiwan and Korea. Lately, the term "Taiwanese feeling," which describes the warm and kind atmosphere of Taiwan, has become popular in Korea.</p>
            <p>Koh Sangwook pointed out that Taiwan and Korea are very good at making semiconductors. Their roles in the global supply chain help each other. This year, for the first time, a forum about the Korean-Taiwanese semiconductor supply chain was held at SEMICON TAIWAN. This is a very important event for the semiconductor industry. This forum helped increase communication between the two countries' semiconductor industries. He also hopes that the APEC meeting, which will be held in Gyeongju, Korea, at the end of this year, will be an important step for international cooperation.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the friendship between Taiwan and Korea has been strong for a long time. The two countries keep talking and working together in many areas. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will follow Minister Lin Chia-lung's idea of "total diplomacy." They hope to build on the existing strong relationship to work together more and help the Indo-Pacific region be successful and stable.</p>

            <h1>Two Children and One Adult Hurt in Random Attack in Miaoli, Now in Hospital</h1>
            <p>In Miaoli City, a man named Chiu randomly attacked people. Three people were hurt. An 11-year-old girl named Ting and a 50-year-old man named Lin were seriously hurt. They are now in intensive care units in hospitals in Taichung and Miaoli. Their condition is stable. Another girl named Hsu is also in the hospital for observation. She will also receive counseling to help her mentally.</p>
            <p>The attack happened yesterday around 3:40 PM. The 48-year-old attacker, Mr. Chiu, used a knife to hurt people for no clear reason. Three people were injured: one adult man and two 11-year-old girls. The Miaoli County Fire Department received calls and sent the injured to the hospital. About an hour after the incident, the police found and arrested Mr. Chiu at his home on Sheliao Street in Miaoli City.</p>
            <p>Videos from nearby security cameras show that Mr. Chiu was riding his motorcycle around Sheliao Street in Miaoli City yesterday afternoon. He saw Ms. Hsu, a young girl, standing alone by the road. He stopped his motorcycle, went to her, grabbed her hair, and then attacked her with a sharp knife. The girl was very scared, screamed, moved away, and ran away when she had a chance.</p>
            <p>Ms. Hsu, who had cuts on her chest and elbow, ran quickly. She ran to a convenience store at the corner of Jianzhong Street and Zhongzheng Road to ask for help. But then, the attacker, Mr. Chiu, showed up again in front of the convenience store. He used the sharp knife to stab Mr. Lin and then Ms. Ting, the other girl.</p>
            <p>Mr. Lin was taken to Tachien Hospital. When he arrived, he was awake. He had stab wounds on his upper right stomach and back. Mr. Lin's wife said that her husband was going to the convenience store to pay a bill. He saw the girl asking for help on the side of the road. He wanted to be brave and help by calling the police, but then he was also stabbed.</p>
            <p>She said that her husband, even though he was hurt, had to run away with other people to save his life. But he fell down in front of a nearby clinic, possibly because he lost too much blood.</p>
            <p>Today, Dr. Yuan Kuo-ching, the head of the intensive care unit at Tachien General Hospital, said that Mr. Lin has an 8 to 9 centimeter wound where his chest and stomach meet, and a 6 centimeter wound on his back. An urgent surgery showed that his diaphragm and liver were pierced and torn. He had a lot of blood in his chest. Now, his vital signs are stable, and he is still being watched closely and treated in the intensive care unit.</p>
            <p>Right after the attack, the two girls were taken to Miaoli Hospital, which is part of the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Ms. Ting, one of the girls, was stabbed in her left chest by the attacker. After doctors put a tube into her windpipe, her vital signs became stable. She was then moved to China Medical University Hospital in Taichung for more treatment.</p>
            <p>As for Ms. Hsu, she had cuts of 0.5 to 1 centimeter on her chest and a 3 centimeter cut on her right elbow. After her wounds were sewn up, she stayed in the hospital for observation. She is expected to rest for a while and might go home tomorrow. Her family did not want to talk to reporters. Miaoli Hospital said that they will continue to give her all the necessary medical care. They have also arranged for psychological counseling to help her fully recover, both physically and mentally. They want to give the patient and her family time and space to rest and feel better.</p>
