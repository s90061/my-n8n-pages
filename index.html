            <h1>Documentary about Hundred-Pace Snake Guarding Eggs in the Wild Wins Ecological Film Festival Award</h1>
            <p>The Taichung Branch of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency, which is part of the Ministry of Agriculture, announced today that its film "Guardians: Documenting the Wild Hundred-Pace Snake Guarding its Eggs and Hatching" won the "Science Exploration Award" at the 3rd Taiwan Eco-Environmental Film Festival.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Branch said the film shows the first complete record in the world of a hundred-pace snake guarding its eggs, hatching, and caring for its young in the wild. This is a very important ecological discovery. The film also became very popular on video platforms, getting more than 420,000 views. This shows how much the promotion of snake conservation can do.</p>
            <p>The director, Yan Wen-ju, said in her acceptance speech that she was thankful to the Taichung Branch for always supporting scientific ecological research and caring about local conservation issues. She also thanked the Wild Sound Ecological Environment Company team for using their special equipment and people to watch and record in the wild for a long time, which helped create the film.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Branch stated that making the film took two months. They used special tools like infrared automatic cameras, time-lapse cameras, night vision devices, and hidden cameras. They watched and recorded for 24 hours a day, without stopping. Finally, they got the first complete video in the world showing a mother hundred-pace snake with 20 eggs, how she guarded them, how they hatched, and how she took care of the young.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Branch also said that for the first time, the film used a harmonic reflector to successfully follow the young snakes after they left their nest. This information was then compared with records of hundred-pace snake breeding that Director Lin Hua-qing of the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency made when he worked at the Taipei Zoo, where the snakes were kept in a special area. This helped them show this important information to the public completely.</p>
            <p>The Taichung Branch explained that snakes are a vital part of the forest ecosystem and are necessary for keeping nature balanced. However, for a long time, people have misunderstood snakes because of how they look or what people believe. The agency hopes that this valuable video record will give scientific information and spread the message widely. This will let people see that snakes also have warm behaviors, like protecting their young. This can change what people usually think about snakes and help them understand how important snakes are in the ecosystem.</p>

            <h1>China Issues Security Alert; Philippines Retorts: Mostly Chinese Harming Compatriots</h1>
            <p>There is new disagreement between the Philippines and China. After China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs told its citizens to be careful when traveling to the Philippines, the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs replied. They said that Beijing was "wrongly describing" the safety situation in the Philippines. They also said that many crimes against Chinese citizens were committed by "Chinese people harming their own people."</p>
            <p>On August 30th, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a safety warning on its consular service website. It said that the Philippines has had many safety problems recently, and many crimes against Chinese citizens have happened. It told Chinese citizens in the Philippines to protect themselves more and avoid dangerous areas. If they plan to visit the Philippines, they should carefully check the risks and plan their trip wisely.</p>
            <p>Angelica Escalona, a spokesperson for the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs, said today that Philippine law enforcement has been "strongly fighting" against reported crimes. This includes many cases where "Chinese people harmed their own people."</p>
            <p>In mid-July, the Philippine police anti-kidnapping unit arrested 12 people suspected of kidnapping. Six of them were Chinese, and they were accused of kidnapping one Chinese person. In early August, the Philippine police anti-kidnapping unit arrested four more Chinese people who were accused of kidnapping two Chinese people.</p>
            <p>Most of the criminals tricked victims into meeting them by pretending to exchange foreign money or buy/sell cars. Then, they would kidnap them.</p>
            <p>Escalona said that the safety warning from China "wrongly described" the safety situation in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>She mentioned the 9th Joint Consular Consultation Meeting between the Philippines and China, which took place in Beijing in July this year. She said that both sides talked about working together on law enforcement then. The Philippines is willing to solve China's worries through discussion.</p>
            <p>China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released this safety warning after Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung visited the Philippines with a trade delegation.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed on August 30th that Lin Chia-lung helped a Taiwanese trade delegation visit the Philippines from August 25th to 30th. The Filinvest Innovation Park in the Philippines had posted a photo of Lin Chia-lung giving a speech at an event on Facebook and called him the head of the delegation.</p>
            <p>Since Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. took office, the relationship between the Philippines and Taiwan has become closer. In April, the Philippine President's office issued a memo. It made the rules for exchanges between Philippine and Taiwanese government officials less strict. This allows Philippine officials to welcome trade and investment groups from Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>New Legislative Yuan Session Begins; President Lai to Invite Legislators from Different Party Factions for Dinner</h1>
            <p>The 4th session of the 11th Legislative Yuan starts today. Legislators from different groups within the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have received phone calls inviting them to dinner from President Lai Ching-te. President Lai is also the chairman of the DPP. It is said that before the new session officially begins, President Lai will invite legislators from various groups to his official residence for dinner in four separate gatherings. He wants to understand the situation in the Legislative Yuan and know what the members of the party caucus think. The main goal is for the national budget to pass smoothly.</p>
            <p>People within the party said that President Lai's dinner invitations are mainly to help everyone agree. The most important thing for the new session of the Legislative Yuan is to deal with the national budget. Whether the budget passes or not directly affects how the government can work. The President is concerned about how the party caucus will handle this in the future, and he wants to talk about it with everyone.</p>
            <p>Regarding the debate about whether the party caucus leader will be changed, people in the party said, "The party caucus leader, Ker Chien-ming, is also on the guest list for the dinners." President Lai respects the party caucus's independence, and the President will not get involved in how the caucus works.</p>
            <p>People in the party also said that it is a good thing for President Lai to exchange ideas with members from different groups during the new session. This allows the President to understand the situation in the Legislative Yuan and know what the members of the party caucus think. The main goal is for the national budget to pass smoothly.</p>
