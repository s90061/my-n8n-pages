            <h1>Venezuela Says US Military Held Fishing Boat, Calls It a Provocation</h1>
            <p>Venezuela said today that the US military held a Venezuelan fishing boat for eight hours in its special economic zone. This happened when US warships were patrolling the Caribbean Sea to fight drug groups.</p>
            <p>According to AFP, Venezuela's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the US destroyer USS Jason Dunham illegally and aggressively held a Venezuelan fishing boat with nine fishermen yesterday.</p>
            <p>The statement said, "The warship put 18 armed people on board and controlled this small, harmless fishing boat for eight hours." The statement also called this event "a direct provocation using too much military force illegally."</p>
            <p>Venezuela's Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the people who ordered this action "are looking for reasons to increase conflict in the Caribbean Sea to change the government in Caracas."</p>
            <p>The statement also asked the United States to "immediately stop these actions that endanger safety and peace in the Caribbean region."</p>
            <p>The situation between the United States and Venezuela has become more tense in recent weeks. This is because US President Donald Trump has put more pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Also, the US has sent warships to the southern Caribbean Sea.</p>
            <p>The US says that Maduro, a leftist leader, is in charge of a cocaine smuggling group. Not long ago, the reward for finding him was doubled to 50 million US dollars (about 1.52 billion New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Earlier this month, the US military destroyed a boat in the Caribbean Sea that they thought was carrying drugs. This caused 11 people to die. Trump said the boat belonged to a Venezuelan crime group called "Tren de Aragua," which is connected to Maduro.</p>

            <h1>Will Trump Visit Beijing? Ex-Official Says New US-China Trade Talks Are Important</h1>
            <p>Many people are asking when President Trump and President Xi will meet. High-level officials from the US and China have been talking about defense and foreign policy. Also, the US and China are planning new trade talks starting tomorrow. A former US diplomat said that China wants US President Trump to visit Beijing. The trade talks between officials will discuss how big a "gift package" Trump will get for his visit. This will decide if the visit happens.</p>
            <p>Foreign news reports say that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will go to Spain. They will talk with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and other Chinese economic officials. They plan to discuss trade and other money matters, including worries about the social media app TikTok and national security.</p>
            <p>Kurt Tong, a former US diplomat and now a managing partner at The Asia Group, recently spoke to the US financial news channel CNBC. He said that, as far as he knows, Donald Trump has officially been invited to visit China. Both the US and China are actively discussing this.</p>
            <p>He believes the most important meetings and talks will be between Bessent and He Lifeng. They need to discuss how big the "gift package" Trump expects from China should be. This package needs to make his visit to China worthwhile.</p>
            <p>Tong, who used to be the US Consul General in Hong Kong and Macau and a senior official in the State Department's economic affairs office, said that right now, there's about a two-thirds chance the visit will happen. But it's not final yet. In the end, what's in the "gift package" will decide if the visit happens, or if Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet in a different way.</p>
            <p>He expects that the new talks between the US and China might include things like agreements to buy products such as airplanes and soybeans, or they might set a goal for how much China will buy from the US. TikTok will definitely be one of the topics discussed.</p>
            <p>Regarding when the Trump-Xi meeting might take place, Tong said that China has suggested Trump visit China before he goes to South Korea for the APEC summit. Then, the leaders of the US and China would meet again during the APEC summit.</p>
            <p>The APEC summit in 2025 will begin on October 31st in Gyeongju, South Korea.</p>

            <h1>Australia to Spend A$12 Billion on Defense Buildings for AUKUS Submarine Deal</h1>
            <p>Australia announced today that it will spend 12 billion Australian dollars (8 billion US dollars) to build defense facilities in Western Australia. This will help with the plan to get nuclear submarines through the AUKUS agreement.</p>
            <p>Australia, the UK, and the US made the AUKUS agreement in 2021. Its goal is to provide nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia starting in the next ten years. This is to respond to China's growing power in the Indo-Pacific area. The government of US President Trump is now officially reviewing this agreement again.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said that the planned area is very important for Australia's ship building and repair industry. It will help Western Australia continue to build warships and support Australia's nuclear-powered submarine plan.</p>
            <p>Last year, the Australian government first spent 127 million Australian dollars (84 million US dollars) to improve the Henderson shipyard near Perth. They also said they will spend billions of Australian dollars over the next 20 years. This will make it a main place for repairing the AUKUS submarine fleet.</p>
            <p>The AUKUS agreement is worth hundreds of billions of US dollars. Under this agreement, the United States will sell several Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. Later, the UK and Australia will also work together to build new AUKUS-class submarines.</p>
