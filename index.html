            <h1>Ministry of Finance: 60% of Taiwan's Companies Last 5 Years; 1% Show High Growth in 2023</h1>
            <p>The Ministry of Finance recently shared new company information. In 2023, about 1% of active companies in Taiwan grew very fast. This means their sales or number of workers increased by more than 20% for three years in a row. Their total growth was 72.8%. Most of these fast-growing companies (90%) earned more than NT$10 million a year and paid taxes automatically.</p>
            <p>Compared to other countries, the Ministry of Finance found that fewer new companies start and fewer old companies close in Taiwan. About 80% of companies in Taiwan, Australia, the UK, and New Zealand stay open for their first year. But Taiwan has a higher survival rate after 5 years, with 60% of companies still open.</p>
            <p>In September, the Ministry of Finance released a report called "Building Taiwan's Company Activity Statistics from Tax Data." They used rules from the EU and OECD handbook number 5. They looked at how much companies sold and how many people they hired. From all tax records, they found active companies. Then, they calculated four things: how many companies started, how many closed, how many kept going, and how many grew fast.</p>
            <p>The Ministry explained that an "active company" is one that earned money or hired people during the year. "Company birth" means new active companies that started each year. "Company death" means active companies that closed each year. If a company is active for two years in a row, it is considered to have "survived."</p>
            <p>The Ministry's numbers show that between 6.5% and 7.2% of companies started each year, and between 5.4% and 5.7% closed. Companies with less income and those owned by one person had higher birth and death rates than average. Companies earning less than NT$500,000 a year had the highest rates, with 17.1% starting and 18.1% closing. This is about three times higher than the average. Companies owned by partners also had a higher death rate than average.</p>
            <p>When looking at different types of businesses, the Ministry said that manufacturing, transport, and storage businesses have low birth and death rates because they need a lot of money to start. Electricity and gas supply businesses have high birth rates and low death rates because of energy policies. Online shopping and food service businesses have the most companies starting and closing.</p>
            <p>The Ministry stated that the rate of companies closing each year has gone down. It was 10% in the first two years and dropped to 4.9% by the fifth year. This shows that the market helps strong companies stay and weak companies leave. About 40% of new companies close within five years. More than half of these close in the first two years. This means the first two years are very important for a new company's survival.</p>
            <p>The Ministry said that how long companies last depends on their industry. For example, 80% of electricity and gas supply companies last 5 years because of energy policies. But hotel and restaurant businesses only have a 55% survival rate after 5 years due to strong competition. Arts, entertainment, and recreation services have an even lower rate of 41%, partly because of claw machine arcade shops.</p>
            <p>The Ministry noted that in 2023, about 1% of all active companies were high-growth companies. 90% of these were companies that earned more than NT$10 million a year and used the automatic tax payment system. The number of high-growth companies is higher for those with more income. Companies earning between NT$10 million and NT$100 million were 3.1%, which is three times the average. Companies earning over NT$100 million were 13.4%, which is 13 times the average.</p>
            <p>The Ministry added that these high-growth companies are often in industries affected by big events or short-term changes in supply and demand. For example, shipping companies grew a lot in 2021 and 2022 because of port delays. In 2023, banks and travel companies grew due to higher interest rates and people traveling more after the pandemic.</p>
            <p>Compared to international data, the Ministry explained that Taiwan's company birth and death rates are quite low. This is because of how tax data is collected and differences in industries. Taiwan's rates are about 60% of the EU average (10.5% birth, 8.7% death) and also lower than South Korea. The percentage of high-growth companies in Taiwan is also lower than the EU average of 9.2%, but higher than South Korea's (0.1%). However, Taiwan's companies have a similar survival rate of over 80% in their first year as Australia, the UK, and New Zealand. Taiwan's 5-year survival rate of 60% is higher.</p>

            <p>Because the stock market is doing well, more foreign money is coming in. The New Taiwan Dollar started at 30.21 against the US Dollar today. With the stock market rising and more money coming in, the New Taiwan Dollar became even stronger. It reached a high of 30.119, meaning it gained 1.09 cents.</p>
