After 100 years, people in Paris can now swim in the Seine River again. The city cleaned the river to make it safe. Many people waited in line early in the morning to be the first to swim. They were very happy to cool down in the river.

The city has opened three places for swimming. It is free to enter. This is part of a plan that started in 2016 to make the river cleaner. Last year, the Seine was used for some Olympic swimming events. The city promised to let people swim this summer.

One swimmer named Sabine said she waited for 40 minutes, but the mood was good. She said the water was not perfectly clear but felt soft and warm. Another person said the safety measures were very good, with many lifeguards. People are glad that families who cannot go on vacation can now swim for free and safely.

**US Denies Report of Choosing Taiwan Official for Security Council**

There was a report in the news that the US State Department chose Zhao Yixiang, a city council member from Taipei, to join Taiwan's National Security Council. The report said the US wanted him for this job because he knew many people from the US during his past work there.

However, a US State Department spokesperson has said that this report is "completely made up and not true." The spokesperson said that the US does not tell Taiwan who to choose for its government jobs.

Zhao Yixiang himself did not say much about the rumor before. He said his current job at the city council was his main focus. He became a city council member at the end of 2022.

**France Asks Europe to Increase Tariffs on Chinese Goods**

France's finance minister, Eric Lombard, has said that Europe needs to put higher taxes (tariffs) on goods imported from China. He believes this will help protect European industries from Chinese products. He also said that the European Union (EU) and the United States might agree on tariffs this weekend.

Mr. Lombard said that Europe has already taken action on steel and cars. But he believes more rules are needed to cover more Chinese goods. He said that Europe must protect its businesses in all areas. If not, China's plan to make more than 50% of global goods in many industries could hurt European businesses.

France is worried that if the US puts tariffs on European goods, and China sells many cheap products to Europe, it will be a problem. The EU and US are talking now to avoid high tariffs starting again soon. China recently put tariffs on some European brandy after the EU put tariffs on Chinese electric cars.
