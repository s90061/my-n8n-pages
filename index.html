Former US President Donald Trump said that a part of the government, called the "Department of Government Efficiency," should look into money given to Elon Musk's companies. Musk owns companies like Tesla, which makes electric cars. Trump believes that Musk has received a lot of help from the government, more than anyone else. He thinks that if Musk didn't get this money, his companies might have to close, and he might go back to his home country, South Africa. Trump said checking these payments could save the US government a lot of money.

Elon Musk replied on his social media site, X. He wrote, "Seriously, cut all subsidies, cut them now." This means he agrees that the government should stop giving money to companies.

Musk used to work with Trump's government to help reduce government spending, but he left in May. Recently, Musk also said that a new tax and spending plan by Trump was "crazy and bad."

**Chiayi Prison Helps Inmates Find Jobs and Avoid Scams**

Chiayi Prison has started a new program to help people in prison. The program, which began in May, teaches them how to find jobs and how to stay safe from job scams. Many people in prison for fraud were used by scam groups. They often believed promises of jobs that paid a lot of money, but these were traps.

The prison explained that more than 45% more people are now in prison because of fraud. This program helps these inmates understand how scams work so they don't make the same mistakes when they leave prison. They learn to spot dangers when looking for work and how to protect themselves.

Many inmates said the course was very helpful. One inmate named A-Qiang wrote that he learned that some jobs with high pay are fake. He said he doesn't want to be used by criminals again after he gets out. The course also uses acting to help inmates practice what to do in real-life situations. The prison wants to give inmates the skills to find a job and the wisdom to not get tricked.

**New "Pig Fly Theater" at Science Museum Opens with Crayon Shin-chan**

The National Museum of Natural Science has opened a new special theater called the "Pig Fly Theater." For over 30 years, this theater was a 3D movie theater. Now, it has changed. The first movie they are showing is a popular Japanese cartoon called "Crayon Shin-chan." In the movie, the cartoon characters explore space.

The museum director, Huang Wen-shan, said that the old 3D theater was a favorite place for many visitors. It helped a lot of people learn about science. Now, with new kinds of technology like XR and VR, the museum wanted to make the theater better. They also fixed problems like it being hard to get to and having only a few movies.

The name "Pig Fly Theater" comes from an English saying, "when pigs fly," which means something that is impossible. This idea came from a gift given to the museum's first director â€“ a pig with bird wings. This gift is still at the museum. The new theater also has a new entrance from inside the museum, so it's easier for visitors to go in. The first "Crayon Shin-chan" movie is about visitors from space and teaches about planets and stars in a funny way.
