Heavy rains caused terrible floods in Texas, USA. At least 27 people have died, and search teams are still looking for 27 girls who are missing from a summer camp by a river. More rain is expected soon.

The police chief of Kerr County, Larry Leitha, said that over 850 people who were not hurt have been moved to safety. Eight people who were injured were also helped. Among the 27 people who died, 9 were children. The search for everyone will continue.

The floods started yesterday when a lot of rain fell in just a few hours. The Guadalupe River rose by 8 meters in only 45 minutes. The weather service has warned that more heavy rain will come, which could cause "very bad" floods in some areas.
