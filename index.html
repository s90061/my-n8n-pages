            <h1>CDMO Business Grows, Bora Pharmaceuticals Earns NT$19.5 EPS in First Half of Year</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals shared its financial report for the first half of the year. Their sales reached 9.347 billion New Taiwan Dollars. Thanks to the growth in their CDMO business, the company's net profit was 2.016 billion New Taiwan Dollars, which is 11.9% more than last year. Their earnings per share (EPS) were 19.5 New Taiwan Dollars, almost earning two times their stock value.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals announced today that their CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year, reaching over 5.01 billion New Taiwan Dollars. This growth was due to more production capacity and new types of products. However, during a period of merging, there were delays in production at their sterile injection factories in Maryland, USA, and Zhunan, Taiwan. This slowed things down. But this problem got better in June, and delayed orders will be filled soon. The company's orders look good for the future, and there is a steady need for their services.</p>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals said they continue to invest more in their CDMO business around the world. Recently, their factory in Canada added a new production line for filling high-performance skin medicines. This will help them produce these orders faster, in larger amounts, and more flexibly. This new line will help the Canadian factory grow.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injection production line in Maryland, USA, is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. From 2026, the automatic AST isolated filling systems will begin to operate. Also, in the first half of this year, clients at their Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, became stronger, long-term partners. Many drug companies are now signing contracts because they want to use the benefits of making products in the USA.</p>
            <p>Sheng Pao-hsi, the chairman of Bora Pharmaceuticals, said that their CDMO business has gained 8 new clients this year. Most of these new clients are handled by the Maple Grove factory, which focuses on manufacturing in North America. This year, new orders worth 138 million US dollars have been received. Most of these new orders are for the Canadian and sterile product factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was part of the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started operations. Many American drug companies that are in the later stages of development have asked about the plan to increase production capacity to 2000 liters.</p>
