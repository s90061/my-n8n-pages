            <h1>National Guard in Washington, Trump Says He Will Go on Patrol with Police and Army at Night</h1>
            <p>US President Trump sent the National Guard to Washington, D.C., the capital city, last week. Today, he said he will go on patrol with the military and police in the streets of Washington tonight.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that Trump spoke on a radio show with Todd Starnes, a reporter from the conservative news channel Newsmax. Trump said, "I think I'll go out tonight with the police, and of course, the military."</p>
            <p>Trump used his power as president to send one thousand National Guard members and federal officers to Washington. He said this was because of a lot of violent crime in the city.</p>
            <p>Officials in Washington disagreed with Trump. They said that numbers from the government and the city show that violent crime has gone down a lot after it went up in 2023.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, US Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth looked at the National Guard at Union Station in Washington. People protesting there shouted and laughed at them.</p>
