British households are still finding it hard to manage their money, even though inflation, the rate at which prices rise, has almost reached the government's target. New figures show that inflation in the UK fell to 2.3% in April, which is close to the 2% goal set by the Bank of England. This fall was mainly because food prices went down more than they have in recent years. For example, milk, butter, and bread cost less than they did before.

However, the cost of services, such as hotel stays, restaurant meals, and hairdressing, continues to rise quickly. This means that while some grocery items are cheaper, many everyday activities and necessities like rent and energy bills are still expensive for families. Experts believe that the Bank of England might start lowering interest rates later this year, which could make borrowing money cheaper. But for now, many people are still feeling the pressure on their budgets and are looking for ways to save money in their daily lives.

**How Artificial Intelligence Could Change Your Job**

Microsoft, a major technology company, is investing heavily in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and believes this will transform how people work. AI tools, such as those that can write emails or create presentations, are becoming more common in the workplace. While some people worry that AI will take jobs, Microsoft's view is that AI will mostly change existing jobs by making them more efficient. This means workers might spend less time on repetitive tasks and more time on creative or strategic work.

For example, a customer service agent might use AI to quickly find answers, allowing them to help more people or focus on more complex problems. However, this shift means workers will need new skills, such as understanding how to use AI tools effectively and adapting to new ways of working. Companies and employees will need to learn how to work together with AI to get the most benefit. Experts say lifelong learning will be essential as technology continues to develop rapidly.

**Americans Hit the Road and Sky for Busy Summer Travel**

Millions of Americans recently traveled for the Memorial Day weekend, which is often seen as the start of the summer travel season. This year, travel numbers reached new highs, with many people choosing to drive to their destinations. Experts predicted that over 43 million people would travel at least 50 miles from home during the holiday period, showing a strong desire to take vacations. Despite higher gas prices compared to last year, the number of drivers increased significantly.

Airports also saw a large number of passengers. On the Friday before Memorial Day, for instance, security checkpoints processed over 2.9 million travelers, setting a new record for the busiest day ever for air travel in the United States. This trend suggests that the summer months will be very busy for airlines, hotels, and tourist attractions across the country. Travelers should expect crowds and plan their trips carefully, especially if they are flying or visiting popular places.
