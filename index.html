            <h1>Major League-Level Home Run Derby: Wang Chien-Ming Pitches, Kuo Hong-Chih Hits a Home Run</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 20 (CNA) The CPBL All-Star Game was held today at Taipei Dome. Before the home run derby, two famous baseball players from Major League Baseball, Wang Chien-Ming and Kuo Hong-Chih, played a charity game. Kuo Hong-Chih successfully hit a home run in the end. He said that the bat he used was a gift from Jonathon Long, a mixed-heritage player.</p>
            <p>It was the second day of the CPBL All-Star Game. Before the home run derby finals, there was a charity game. Wang Chien-Ming threw the ball, and Kuo Hong-Chih hit it. At first, Kuo Hong-Chih missed the ball. But in the end, he successfully hit the ball over the home run fence. Kuo Hong-Chih happily threw his bat and ran around the bases. It was a rare match between former Major League Baseball stars.</p>
            <p>After hitting the home run, Kuo Hong-Chih smiled and said, "The pitcher deserves a lot of credit. Wang Chien-Ming threw the ball perfectly. I believe he rarely makes such a mistake in his career. It was the right time to meet the right batter, and the ball went far."</p>
            <p>About missing the ball, Wang Chien-Ming said, "He tried too hard to hit a home run." Kuo Hong-Chih replied, "Actually, I rarely miss the ball in my career. My first miss was for my senior, Wang Chien-Ming."</p>
            <p>Kuo Hong-Chih said he was nervous when CPBL President Tsai Chi-Chang invited him. "The president told me it was a special task, which made me restless. I had many thoughts and was worried I would fail the president's kind request if I didn't hit the ball." But Kuo Hong-Chih also said he was very happy to play at Taipei Dome for the first time. "Playing with Wang Chien-Ming on the field is a dream for many people."</p>
            <p>Kuo Hong-Chih shared that the bat he used was a gift from Jonathon Long, a talented player for the Chicago Cubs, who has both Taiwanese and American heritage. Kuo Hong-Chih and Tsai Chi-Chang recently went to the US to ask Long if he wanted to play for the Taiwan team in the World Baseball Classic. Kuo Hong-Chih said, "I told him I was going to play in a home run derby, and he gave me a bat. It's very special to hit a home run in Taiwan with his bat."</p>
            <p>Seeing Taiwan's baseball environment getting better, with Taipei Dome now available, Kuo Hong-Chih said, "I feel very happy. In our time, it was a bit harder. Now the environment is improving, and everyone is pleased to see it."</p>

            <h1>CIER: Stable Economy and Fed Rate Cuts to Lead to Slow Rise of New Taiwan Dollar</h1>
            <p>Taipei, July 20 (CNA) Lately, the New Taiwan Dollar (NTD) has become weaker, reaching 29.5 against the US dollar, due to worries about tariffs. However, since the start of this year, it is still the strongest among Asian currencies. The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER) looked at the long-term trend of the NTD. They think that this year, the NTD will slowly become stronger. This is because Taiwan's economy is stable, and the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. They believe the NTD will stay strong at 28 by the end of the year, with an average of 28.39 in the fourth quarter.</p>
            <p>Starting from the second quarter of this year, the NTD began to get much stronger. This happened because people expected the currency to rise due to talks between Taiwan and the US. Also, Taiwan's exports were very good, and companies changed their US dollars to NTD, which helped the NTD get stronger. In early May, the NTD even saw a "huge rise," jumping more than 1 NTD against the US dollar during trading for two days in a row. After that, the Central Bank stepped in and used different ways to make the currency stable. The period of unstable exchange rates ended, but the NTD continued to become stronger slowly.</p>
            <p>In July, the NTD weakened and went back to 29.5 against the US dollar. This was because US President Trump announced new tariffs for different countries, which caused bad feelings in the market. Other Asian currencies also started to get weaker. However, most people in the market still believe that the NTD will get stronger in the middle and long term.</p>
            <p>CIER thinks there are three main reasons why the NTD has been getting stronger in the short term. First, exporters want to change their US dollars back to NTD quickly. Second, people expect the Central Bank to let the currency become stronger to help with trade talks with the US. Third, the Taiwan stock market has risen a lot, causing many foreign investors to bring money into Taiwan.</p>
            <p>CIER explained that when exporters change their money, it is closely related to Taiwan's trade balance. If the trade balance gets worse and exports go down, the NTD will not get stronger as much, or it might even get weaker.</p>
            <p>As for the expectations about the trade talks with the US, CIER said that once these talks are finished, the expectations will go down. This will also help the NTD return to its normal value.</p>
            <p>Regarding money coming in from foreign investors, CIER believes that financial markets are not reacting as strongly to tariff issues anymore. Because the US stock market and Taiwan's stock market are closely linked, we should first watch how the US stock market performs. This is because it might also affect the Taiwan stock market.</p>
            <p>In the long term, CIER says that the NTD is still expected to get stronger slowly. This is mainly because of the basic strength of the economy and how many times and by how much the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.</p>
            <p>According to CIER's economic forecast for the third quarter, the US dollar will remain relatively weak in the second half of the year. Also, based on what the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has shown, the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in the second half of 2025. Considering inflation, interest rate differences, and the economic situation, the NTD exchange rate against the US dollar will go from 32.89 in the first quarter to about 28.39 in the fourth quarter. The average price for the whole year will be about 30.32, which is about 5.92% stronger than 32.11 in 2024.</p>
