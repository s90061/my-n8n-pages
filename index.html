            <h1>India and China to Resume Direct Flights Before End of October After Over 5-Year Break</h1>
            <p>The Indian Embassy in China announced tonight that India and China's civil aviation authorities have talked and agreed. Direct flights between the two countries will start again before the end of October.</p>
            <p>Direct flights between India and China stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. After that, there were serious fights at the border, which made it unclear when flights would start again. Both sides only started to work on improving their relationship this year.</p>
            <p>The Indian Embassy in China posted a statement on its official Weibo page on the evening of the 2nd. It said that earlier this year, as part of the Indian government's efforts to slowly make relations between India and China normal again, the civil aviation departments of both countries had technical talks. These talks were about bringing back direct flights and changing the 'Air Services Agreement'.</p>
            <p>The statement said that after these talks, both sides have now agreed: Direct flights between India and China, connecting specific cities, can start again before the end of October 2025. This will follow the flight schedule for the winter season of 2025. The actual start of these flights depends on the business choices of the airlines from both countries. Also, all flight rules must be followed.</p>
            <p>The statement ended by saying that this agreement between the civil aviation authorities will help people from India and China meet more often. It will also help the relationship between the two countries slowly become normal again.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported that before this, on August 18th, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with India's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi. They agreed on 10 things. One of them was: 'Both sides agreed to bring back direct flights between mainland China and India soon. They also agreed to change the air transport agreement between the two countries. Both sides agreed to make it easier for people who travel for tourism, business, and media from both countries to get visas.'</p>
            <p>Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said on August 14th that China and India have been talking closely about this for some time. They have been working hard to start direct flights again soon.</p>
            <p>Foreign news reports earlier said that four Chinese airlines applied for flight times at Delhi Airport (DEL) in August. This showed that direct flights between China and India would start again soon. At the same time, Indian airline IndiGo is also getting ready to restart flights to Chengdu and Guangzhou. This will work well with Chinese airlines and help to reconnect the two countries by air after a long stop.</p>

            <h1>CTBC Brothers Win Second-Half Championship, Coach Hirano Keiichi Aims for Best Overall Win Rate</h1>
            <p>Today, the CTBC Brothers baseball team won the second-half championship at their home stadium, Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium. This is their 20th championship in the team's history. After throwing yellow ribbons, they are now only one step away (M1) from having the best win rate for the whole year. Head coach Keiichi Hirano told fans that their next goal is to be number one for the whole year.</p>
            <p>Before the game, the Brothers needed just one more win to become the second-half champions. Tonight, they beat the Wei Chuan Dragons 6-2. This win gave them their 20th championship in team history. They are the first team in the league to reach this number. They are also just one step (M1) away from having the best win rate for the whole year, which means they are very close to playing in the Taiwan Series.</p>
            <p>After the game, Keiichi Hirano told all the fans that he was very sorry they didn't win the first-half championship. He said it also made the fans sad. So, the whole team decided to make all the fans very happy in the second half. They have worked hard to get to this point.</p>
            <p>He said that now they have won the second-half championship, their next goal is to have the best win rate for the whole year. He hopes everyone will come to the stadium tomorrow to 'cheer for us.'</p>
            <p>The starting pitcher, Lin Hui-sheng, pitched very well for 7 innings and only allowed 1 run. He said he felt very excited when he learned he would start in this important game. He played 'as if it were the last game.' He thanked the coaches for believing in him and trusting him. He showed what he could do.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow, the Brothers will play against the TSG Hawks at Intercontinental Stadium. If they get the best win rate for the whole year, they will not need to play in the playoff challenge series. They will go straight to the Taiwan Series and get to play 5 home games, which is an advantage.</p>

            <h1>Rumored to Run for Taipei Mayor, Wu Yi-nung: Will Indeed Seek Opportunity to Serve Citizens</h1>
            <p>Wu Yi-nung, who started the Forward Alliance, is rumored to be a surprise choice for the Democratic Progressive Party to run for the next Mayor of Taipei. Wu Yi-nung said in a statement today that he will indeed try to get the chance to serve the people of the city. He believes that Taiwan's society needs to move past a time of unclear politics. However, he also thinks that for Taipei, there is no need to rush to start the election process. He suggested that the election committee should think about it more.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the Democratic Progressive Party's Election Strategy Committee had a meeting. In the meeting, they looked at possible candidates for leaders in 22 cities and counties. They decided to use a 'late entry rule' for areas where they invite people to run, like Taipei, New Taipei, and Taichung. This means people who want to be nominated can still sign up. CNA reported that for the Taipei Mayor election, besides Taipei City Councilor Miao Po-ya, Wu Yi-nung, the founder of the Forward Alliance, is seen as a surprise candidate.</p>
            <p>Today, Wu Yi-nung gave a speech in Kaohsiung. Through his assistant, he released a statement saying that he will definitely try to find a chance to serve the citizens. He also believes that society needs to turn a new page from messy politics. However, he continues to suggest that the election committee should think again about whether they need to finish choosing candidates before the end of the year. There is still more than a year until the election. For Taipei, there is no need to rush to start the election.</p>
            <p>He also said that Hualien is currently still recovering after the disaster. The Forward Alliance team and volunteers are still working on rebuilding and helping. He hopes that society will pay more attention to fixing the basic structures in the disaster area, helping residents feel calm, and making better plans for future disasters. This is to stop similar problems from happening again. He believes these are the most important things people care about right now.</p>
