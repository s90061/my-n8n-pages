            <h1>French, UK, German Leaders to Discuss Peace in Ukraine</h1>
            <p>The French president's office announced that leaders from France, the UK, and Germany will hold an online meeting tomorrow. This meeting will include countries that support Kyiv (Ukraine). They will talk about how to make peace in Ukraine. They call these countries the "Coalition of the Willing."</p>
            <p>The French president's office also said why this meeting is happening. French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will lead it. It's because the leaders of the US and Russia met yesterday. Also, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will go to Washington on the 18th to talk with US President Donald Trump.</p>
            <p>After his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday, Trump said at a press conference that they agreed on many things. But they did not reach a full agreement.</p>
            <p>Later, Trump spoke to Fox News. He added that he and Putin agreed on how the Russia-Ukraine war could end. It would involve exchanging land and the US giving some kind of safety promise.</p>

            <h1>Famous Chef Jos√© Andr√©s to Provide One Million Meals Daily in Gaza</h1>
            <p>Jos√© Andr√©s, a famous chef from Spain, recently went to Gaza. He visited the team of World Central Kitchen, a group he started that gives food to people. He asked for more help to be sent to Gaza. His goal is to give 1 million meals every day to help stop the hunger crisis.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s is 56 years old. He was born in northern Spain and built a successful restaurant business in the US. He started World Central Kitchen (WCK) in 2010 after a big earthquake in Haiti. WCK is based in Washington, D.C. It helps people who are hungry because of natural disasters or wars. They try to give fresh, hot meals. Since the conflict between Israel and Palestine began, WCK has given over 145 million meals to people in Gaza.</p>
            <p>It is very hard to send help to Gaza. In April 2024, seven WCK workers died when the Israeli army bombed them. Because of this, their help stopped for a short time. But WCK still sends food by land, sea, and air. They have set up four large cooking places in southern and central Gaza. They have also made a network of local kitchens run by Palestinians. With help from local partners, they now send meals to northern Gaza too.</p>
            <p>WCK says that they can give about 200,000 meals daily in Gaza right now. But the amount of food they cook this year is much less because food supplies often stop or are limited.</p>
            <p>According to El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper, Jos√© Andr√©s went to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza on August 14. He visited the cooking places WCK built there. He encouraged the local workers and volunteers.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s asked for much more help for Palestinians. He promised to work fast to make more food. His goal is to give 1 million meals a day, which is more than ever before. This is to stop the hunger crisis in Gaza from getting worse.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s also visited a bakery and two places where aid is given. He saw how the local teams still tried to cook meals, even though hunger was spreading and there was not enough help.</p>
            <p>Andr√©s wrote on Instagram that his feelings were hard to explain. He said, "How can we be very happy and excited about feeding people, but at the same time feel very sad because we see so much hunger?"</p>
            <p>He asked for WCK to grow bigger because of this. He said 1 million meals a day means: 5 big cooking places, 100 local kitchens and bakeries, more than 100 trucks for supplies, steady fuel and food, safe roads, and clean drinking water.</p>
            <p>He said, "Gaza is almost in a famine. The world should not ignore it."</p>
            <p>Besides Gaza, Andr√©s also went to Israel. He visited the place where the Nova Music Festival was attacked by Hamas. He paid his respects to the people who died and their families.</p>
            <p>The conflict between Israel and Palestine started on October 7, 2023. On that day, Hamas attacked southern Israel. About 1,200 people died, and 251 people were taken hostage. After that, Israel attacked Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas. Israel said it would destroy Hamas. According to the Gaza health department, more than 60,000 Palestinians have died in this war so far.</p>
            <p>During his trip, Andr√©s also said that "World Central Kitchen is on the side of humanity, providing food for people." He asked for people to care for both Palestinians and Israelis. He also asked for "the release of Israeli hostages, a ceasefire to end the war, and an end to all cruelty and suffering."</p>

            <h1>Jody Chiang Invites Stella Chang to Stage, Addresses Golden Melody Awards Comment</h1>
            <p>Jody Chiang, a famous Taiwanese singer, had a concert tonight at the Taipei Arena. She invited another famous singer, Stella Chang, to join her on stage. Jody Chiang talked about how Stella Chang told award winners at the Golden Melody Awards to walk faster. Jody Chiang laughed and said, "Now it's your turn to run!" She also said that Stella Chang is just a very direct person.</p>
            <p>After singing "A Woman's Story" tonight, Jody Chiang saw her good friend Stella Chang in the audience. So she asked her to come on stage. When Stella Chang came up, Jody Chiang jokingly hurried her. She said, "Can you walk faster? Last time at the Golden Melody Awards, she told people to walk faster. Really, she is just a very direct woman. People who don't know her might think she speaks strangely. But she actually cares a lot about younger artists. (This time) it's your turn to run, right?"</p>
            <p>Jody Chiang said that after Stella Chang's actions at the awards caused talk, she called Stella Chang. She told her, "I understand you, and everyone knows you often do good work for charity. But the audience doesn't know your personality is very straightforward!" Stella Chang replied in a funny way, "Today on this stage, I will say I will never give out awards again! Because almost 9 years ago, I gave out the last award. I get along well with the staff. I just felt everyone was so tired, it was almost midnight, so I thought, 'Everyone, hurry up!'"</p>
            <p>Besides Stella Chang's surprise appearance, Jody Chiang also sang her classic songs like "Love Me for Three Minutes" and "Put Feelings Aside." She often turned the microphone to the audience to sing with them. This made the concert a very warm and friendly event.</p>
