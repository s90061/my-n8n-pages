            <h1>Joshua Young, Randall Schriver's ProtÃ©gÃ©, Appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Taiwan and China Affairs</h1>
            <p>The US State Department confirmed today that diplomat Joshua Young will be the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the Taiwan Coordination Office. Young is known to be against China. He used to be the Executive Director of the "Project 2049 Institute." When Randall Schriver, a friend of Taiwan and former official, was Assistant Secretary of Defense during Trump's first term, Young worked under him.</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia first reported this news. This morning, the US State Department told CNA that Joshua Young has officially become the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for the China Coordination Office (also called China House) and the Taiwan Coordination Office, both part of the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs (EAP).</p>
            <p>Nikkei Asia recently said that the "China House" will have a bigger role. It will help carry out Trump's orders faster and work closely under Secretary of State and National Security Advisor Marco Rubio. It will be important in preparing for Trump's visit to China.</p>
            <p>The "China House" is still under the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs. But a State Department official told Nikkei Asia, "It is clear that the State Department is trying to pay more attention to China." "Young will be in charge of all China policies in the State Department."</p>
            <p>Young is the fourth coordinator since "China House" started in 2022. He is also the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China and Taiwan affairs. The people before him were Rick Waters, Mark Lambert, and Kevin Kim.</p>
            <p>State Department officials said that Young has strong support from the "7th floor leaders," which is where Rubio and Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker have their offices. Young will work closely with Hooker.</p>
            <p>Young's appointment is expected to make Kevin Kim's job easier. Kevin Kim is the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for China, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, and Taiwan affairs, which is a very big job.</p>
            <p>A State Department official who knows Kevin Kim's schedule said that Kim had so much to do that he had meetings every 15 minutes, from early morning until late at night.</p>
            <p>Michael George DeSombre has been nominated to be the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, but the Senate still needs to agree. So, the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs has been led by senior diplomat Sean O'Neill.</p>
            <p>After O'Neill was nominated to be the Ambassador to Thailand, Kevin Kim got promoted. He also became responsible for Southeast Asia, Oceania, and Pacific Island countries, which made his workload even bigger.</p>
            <p>Before Young took over "China House" earlier this month, he was the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Security Policy. He was in charge of stopping the spread of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
            <p>He also used to be the Executive Director of the "Project 2049 Institute," a think tank in Washington. The "Project 2049 Institute" recently changed its name to the Indo-Pacific Security Institute (IIPS). Randall Schriver is its chairman.</p>
            <p>When Young worked for Schriver at the Department of Defense, he was in charge of China and the strategies with US allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific.</p>
            <p>Schriver told Nikkei Asia that Young is very good at working with different parts of the government. When he was at the "Project 2049 Institute," he "looked at the competition between the US and China from an economic and trade point of view, thinking about how to use more tools and how to make trade policies for China better to be more competitive."</p>
            <p>One of the most important tasks for "China House" this year will be to get ready for Trump's visit to China. Bonnie Glaser, who is in charge of the Indo-Pacific Program at The German Marshall Fund, a think tank in Washington, said that National Security Advisor Rubio will lead the preparations for this visit.</p>
            <p>"But I also think people like (Treasury Secretary) Scott Bessent will be important because he continues to lead trade talks, and Trump's main goals, including this (US-China) meeting, are about trade."</p>
            <p>Glaser said that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick will also be important in the preparations. He has already been contacting CEOs of big companies to see if they want to go with Trump to China.</p>
            <p>She said that Trump makes the final decisions on many issues. "He is a manager who likes to be involved in everything. When he meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he will definitely not just follow a script."</p>

            <h1>Intel Cancels Chip Factory Investment in Poland, Moves it to Flagship Project in Magdeburg, Germany</h1>
            <p>The big American chip company Intel announced that it will not continue with its plan to build a new chip packaging and testing factory in Lower Silesia, Poland. Intel said it will now focus on its main factory in Magdeburg, Germany.</p>
            <p>According to the Polish News Agency (PAP), this plan was first announced in 2023. It was going to cost 4.5 billion US dollars (about 146.2 billion New Taiwan Dollars). The factory was planned for the WrocÅ‚aw area, near MiÄ™kinia, in Lower Silesia, and would create about 2000 jobs.</p>
            <p>An Intel spokesperson said that they will now put their money and effort into building the main chip factory in Magdeburg. This place is seen as very important for Europe's chip plans. After getting money from the German government and the EU Chips Act, Intel decided to invest more there. They will also move some of the production work planned for Poland to this location.</p>
            <p>The Intel spokesperson stressed, "Our main goal now is to make sure the main factory in Magdeburg is successful. We will continue to make our chip production and packaging better in Germany and Ireland. We will also support our other sites in Israel, Malaysia, and the United States."</p>
            <p>Intel also thanked the Polish government and local groups for their help. In a statement, the company said, "Even though we decided not to invest in Poland, we are very thankful for the support and cooperation from the Polish government and local officials for this project." There are no plans for other investments in Poland at this time.</p>
            <p>The original plan for Poland was part of the EU's effort to make its own chips and have a safer supply chain. Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister of Poland, and the Lower Silesia government had high hopes for this investment. They had already bought the land and done some early preparations there.</p>

            <h1>Trump Signs Executive Order, Announces 50% Tariff on Brazil</h1>
            <p>US President Donald Trump signed an order today. It officially announced a 50% tax on products coming into the US from Brazil. However, some products like oil, orange juice, and airplanes are not included in this tax.</p>
            <p>On April 2, Trump had already announced a 10% tax on Brazilian products. Earlier today, Trump signed another order. This order added an extra 40% tax on Brazilian products, on top of the first 10%.</p>
            <p>The new order also said that about 700 types of products would not have the extra 40% tax. These include orange juice, airplanes, iron ore, fuel products, and fertilizers.</p>
            <p>Meat, fruits, and coffee are not on the list of exceptions. But US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on July 29 that Trump's government is thinking about having no tax on foods that the US does not produce, like coffee, mangoes, pineapples, and cocoa.</p>
            <p>The new tax will start on August 6. Before this, it was thought that the new tax would start on August 1.</p>
            <p>The White House said in a statement that the new tax is meant to "deal with the Brazilian government's recent actions, which are a strange threat to US national security, foreign policy, and economy."</p>
            <p>The White House statement said, "The Brazilian government has been unfairly treating former President Jair Bolsonaro and thousands of his supporters. They have been targeting them, scaring them, bothering them, censoring them, and taking them to court for political reasons. This is a serious violation of human rights and hurts Brazil's rule of law."</p>
            <p>Brazil's former president, Bolsonaro, is accused of trying to plan a coup after he lost the 2022 election to the current president, Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro says he did not do this.</p>
