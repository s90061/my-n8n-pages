            <h1>Government Says Reports of Stopping Rescue Teams from Going to Guangfu Are Not True</h1>
            <p>After the Matadaan Stream dam lake overflowed and caused floods, many people came to help with recovery efforts. Some online reports said that rescue teams were told to stop going to Guangfu, Hualien. However, Ji Lian-cheng, who is the main coordinator for the Central Disaster Emergency Operations Center and a political advisor, said that the government has not told volunteers to stop. The government continues to help volunteers with their needs.</p>
            <p>The Matadaan Stream dam lake caused a big flood in Hualien. Guangfu Township was hit hard, and more than 1,500 homes were affected. People from all over came to help clean up and fix things after the disaster.</p>
            <p>Regarding the online reports that rescue teams should stop going to Guangfu, Ji Lian-cheng told reporters today that the government has not sent any message to stop volunteers. He also said that they are still helping volunteers at Guangfu Station to sign in, get assigned jobs, and get rides. On October 2nd, about 560 volunteers will be needed. He thanked all volunteers for their enthusiasm and selfless help in the recovery work.</p>
            <p>Ji Lian-cheng explained that Guangfu's seven villages are divided into seven areas. In each area, an army officer (Lieutenant Colonel or higher) works with the county government and the village head. They manage rescue workers, volunteers, and equipment. They quickly solve any problems or needs. The Council of Indigenous Peoples and the Ministry of Transportation are still helping volunteers at Guangfu Station. They help with transportation, places to stay, and assigning tasks for volunteers from all over Taiwan. This helps volunteers with their housing and travel needs.</p>

            <h1>Bank Teller Stole Customer Money, Financial Watchdog Fines Bank NT$2 Million</h1>
            <p>Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) announced that a former teller at Hua Nan Commercial Bank took money that belonged to customers and money collected for others. The bank did not follow its own internal rules properly. This goes against several banking laws and rules. Because of this, the FSC has fined the bank 2 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>The FSC said on its website today that the former teller at Hua Nan Commercial Bank took money from customers by not putting tax and fee payments into accounts on time. Also, accounting staff did not properly check all payment slips or do cash checks. In addition, when the teller helped customers with transactions, they often used withdrawal slips to take out cash. These problems show that the bank did not follow its internal control rules correctly.</p>
            <p>The FSC stated that according to Article 129, Item 7 of the Banking Act, Hua Nan Commercial Bank has been fined 2 million New Taiwan Dollars.</p>

            <h1>Lee Da-hye Donates NT$300,000, Then Becomes a "Shovel Superhero" and Shares How Victims Gave Her Courage</h1>
            <p>Hualien was hit by floods from the Matadaan Stream dam lake, and Guangfu Township suffered a lot of damage. Lee Da-hye, a Korean member of the Wei Chuan Dragons cheerleading team, posted on social media on September 26th that she donated NT$300,000 through the disaster relief fund. Today, some people shared that Lee Da-hye quietly went to Guangfu Township and became a "shovel superhero" to help clean up the mud. Many internet users left comments thanking her for her help.</p>
            <p>In the evening, Lee Da-hye also shared her thoughts about helping with the disaster. She said it was her first time using a shovel, and her movements were clumsy. She felt ready to help, but her body couldn't always keep up with her eagerness.</p>
            <p>Lee Da-hye mentioned that a mother from an affected home in the area taught her something important. "She didn't show sadness on her face. Instead, she welcomed us warmly. Her positive attitude, even in a difficult situation, helped me a lot," Lee Da-hye said. She added that she thought she was there to help, but she actually received courage from the volunteers and the people affected by the disaster. She also expressed "deepest respect and gratitude to everyone who is still working hard in their own roles."</p>
            <p>This is not the first time Lee Da-hye has helped with public causes. Last year, after the Hualien earthquake on April 3rd, she donated NT$300,000 for disaster relief. In January this year, she also gave NT$500,000 from her YouTube channel earnings to a children's welfare organization.</p>
