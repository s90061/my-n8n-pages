The United States is considering ending exceptions that currently allow foreign chipmakers, such as Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and TSMC, to use American technology in their manufacturing operations in China. These exceptions were initially granted after the U.S. imposed broad export limits on China's semiconductor industry in 2022. For South Korean and Taiwanese chip companies, having production in China is crucial to their business, as China is the world's largest market for semiconductors. This potential decision to remove these exceptions for allies' operations in China marks an important moment in U.S. technology policy.

**SoftBank Pitches $1 Trillion US AI Hub to TSMC and Trump Team**

Masayoshi Son, the founder of SoftBank Group Corp., is proposing what could be his largest investment yet: a trillion-dollar industrial area in Arizona for building robots and artificial intelligence. SoftBank officials are keen for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) to play a prominent role in this project. TSMC, which makes advanced AI chips for Nvidia Corp., already plans to invest $165 billion in the U.S. and has begun production at its first Arizona factory. Son has listed SoftBank Vision Fund companies that might join the Arizona project, as he aims to boost SoftBank's stock and repay long-term investors.

**Chinese Tugboat "Union Offshore 5001" Enters Taiwanese Waters Without Obstruction**

A large Chinese tugboat named "Union Offshore 5001," reportedly carrying an unknown load, openly entered Taiwan's territorial waters without any apparent interception by Taiwanese authorities. The Hengchun Coast Guard's PP3559 vessel reported being unable to receive signals from the ship, leading to no further action. Taiwan ADIZ (Air Defense Identification Zone) issued a warning, expressing concern about the unknown motives of "Union Offshore 5001." They suggested that if the tugboat were transporting large military weapons or engaging in "grey zone" intrusions, such as damaging Taiwan's undersea cables, strict monitoring and interception would be necessary. The incident highlights potential vulnerabilities in Taiwan's maritime security.
