Canada has decided not to tax digital services from American technology companies. Because of this, the United States will quickly start trade talks with Canada again.

A White House advisor, Kevin Hassett, said that US President Trump had asked Canada to stop this tax during a big meeting of world leaders. Canada has now agreed, which means talks can begin again.

Canadaâ€™s finance department said that their Prime Minister, Mark Carney, and President Trump will talk again. They want to make a trade deal by July 21. A US official, Howard Lutnick, thanked Canada. He said the tax would hurt new ideas and trade agreements.

**Female truck driver held for stabbing colleague**

A woman who drives a truck in Linkou, New Taipei City, is now in police custody. She is accused of stabbing a male co-worker to death. This happened yesterday at a logistics company, possibly because of a fight about work.

The police were called around 8 AM yesterday. They found a man, Mr. Chen, who had been stabbed. He was taken to the hospital but sadly died. The woman, Ms. Xu, is 36 years old and Mr. Chen was 41. They both worked as truck drivers for the same company.

Police say that Ms. Xu used a knife to stab Mr. Chen in his chest and neck. She was arrested at the scene and is now charged with murder. A judge decided she must stay in custody because the crime is serious and there is a risk she might try to escape or do something similar again.
