            <h1>UK Punishes 18 Russian Agents, Including a News Editor</h1>
            <p>The UK Foreign Office said on July 18 that it would punish 18 Russian secret agents. This is the biggest punishment the UK has given to Russian agents since 2018. In 2018, a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, was poisoned in the UK but lived. This new list of agents includes someone called a news editor-in-chief.</p>
            <p>David Lammy, the UK Foreign Secretary, said that Russia should not doubt that the UK knows what they are trying to do in secret. He added that the UK will not allow it. He said that Russia's mixed threats and aggressive actions will not weaken the UK's strong will.</p>
            <p>In early March 2018, Russian agents tried to kill Skripal and his daughter, Yulia Skripal, in the UK. They used a military-grade nerve agent. Skripal and his daughter survived, but a British woman died because she mistakenly thought the poison was perfume.</p>
            <p>This attempt by Russia to kill people in another country, which even caused a local person to die, made the UK government and its friends react strongly. By early April, a total of 153 Russian diplomats were sent out of several countries. Russian agents often pretend to be diplomats when they work in other countries.</p>
            <p>The list of people punished by the UK Foreign Office on July 18 includes some Russian military intelligence (GRU) officers who were involved in the Skripal poisoning case. The Foreign Office said that before the poisoning in 2018, Russian agents used spy software called X-Agent to secretly watch Yulia's phone for five years.</p>
            <p>Besides the 18 agents, the UK Foreign Office also punished three other groups that belong to Russian military intelligence. One group, Unit 26165, took part in Russia's attack on the city of Mariupol in southeastern Ukraine. This includes the terrible event at the Mariupol theatre in March 2022, where hundreds of ordinary people died. At that time, Ukrainian people, including small children, were hiding in the theatre from air attacks. Unit 26165 used internet spying to help the Russian military find targets for their missiles.</p>
            <p>Information from the UK Home Office about these three Russian military intelligence groups shows that they attacked countries that are part of NATO. This includes attacking and hacking websites and email systems of governments, parliaments, and political parties in NATO countries. They stole, damaged, removed, changed, or replaced information, or stopped systems from working. National news organizations were also victims.</p>
            <p>The UK Home Office also said that Russian agents sometimes pretend to be hackers from North Korea or China when they do online attacks.</p>
            <p>Also, among the Russian agents punished by the UK government on July 18, three key people are from something called "African Initiative." "African Initiative" is a news website started by Russia in 2023. It is mainly for people in Africa or those interested in Africa. It uses social media and other online tools to change information and people's thoughts. It always has Russian military intelligence officers working there.</p>
            <p>On the same day the UK announced the punishments, "African Initiative" put out news. They said that their editor-in-chief, deputy editor-in-chief, and the owner of the Telegram channel "Smiling and Waving" were also punished. They suggested this was because "African Initiative" showed that the UK was doing secret "anti-Russian" activities in Africa.</p>
            <p>Telegram is an app for private messages and a social media platform. It has strong ties to Russian intelligence groups. The "Smiling and Waving" channel, which is linked to "African Initiative," has been shown many times to use false information and change facts. It attacks the work of the United Nations and Western countries in Africa. At the same time, it tries to make Russia look like a good power.</p>
            <p>"African Initiative" has versions in English, Russian, French, Spanish, and Arabic. The UK Home Office's information shows that the editor-in-chief and deputy editor-in-chief of "African Initiative" have been linked to Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Wagner Group, a private military company. They also arranged for bloggers and media people to visit parts of Ukraine that are controlled by Russian forces.</p>

            <h1>Singapore Brings Military Units Together to Fight Cyberattacks</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Minister of Defense has announced that military groups have been asked to help stop a cyberattack. This attack is aimed at Singapore's important basic systems. Experts believe the spy group trying to do this attack is connected to China.</p>
            <p>Singaporean media says that Defense Minister Ng Eng Hen stated that the chosen military groups will work with the Cyber Security Agency (CSA). This is part of the government's plan to deal with this threat together.</p>
            <p>The report says that Ng Eng Hen described this cyberattack as "one example of new threats" that the military must handle.</p>
            <p>So far, there are no reports that any of Singapore's systems have been broken into.</p>
            <p>On July 18, Singapore's Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, K. Shanmugam, first spoke about this cyberattack. He said it is a type of "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT) that is very dangerous for Singapore.</p>
            <p>An "Advanced Persistent Threat" is a type of cyberattack. It means that someone who is not allowed gets into a system and stays there for a long time without being found.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said, "I can say that the situation is serious, and it is still happening." He directly named the group suspected of making the attack as UNC3886.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam did not give more details in his speech about who is supporting this group or where the attack came from.</p>
            <p>However, Mandiant, a cybersecurity company owned by Google, said that UNC3886 is "a spy group linked to China."</p>
            <p>Shanmugam stated that groups using "Advanced Persistent Threat" often steal important information and damage basic services. These services include healthcare, telecommunications, water, transport, and electricity.</p>
            <p>He added, "If the attack succeeds, it can be used for spying and cause big problems for Singapore and its people."</p>
            <p>Regarding media reports that the UNC3886 hacker group is linked to China, the Chinese Embassy in Singapore said yesterday that they were "very unhappy." They made a statement saying that China "strongly opposes any unfair accusations against China." They also said that "in fact, China is one of the main victims of cyberattacks."</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Asks Russia for New Peace Talks Next Week</h1>
            <p>On July 19, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy said that Kyiv has suggested to Moscow that they hold new peace talks next week. He also hopes to speed up discussions about stopping the fighting.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Ukraine and Russia have had two rounds of talks in Istanbul, Turkey, over the last five months. In these talks, both sides agreed to exchange prisoners of war. However, they did not make much progress in ending the war between Russia and Ukraine, which has lasted more than three years.</p>
            <p>In his evening speech to the country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, "We should do everything we can to stop the fighting. Russia should not avoid making a decision any longer."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said that Rustem Umerov, who led the Ukrainian group in the first two Istanbul talks, has invited Russia to a meeting next week. Zelenskyy did not share more details.</p>
            <p>Last week, Rustem Umerov, who used to be Ukraine's Minister of Defense, was made the head of the National Security and Defence Council. He was given the job of moving the peace talks forward.</p>
