            <h1>Chinese Media: Restrictions on Wanda Chairman Wang Jianlin's High Spending Lifted</h1>
            <p>Wang Jianlin, who used to be China's richest man and is the chairman of Wanda Group, was stopped from high spending by a court. But now, Chinese news reports say that this ban has been lifted.</p>
            <p>According to news outlets like Caijing, checks on September 29 showed that information about Wang Jianlin's spending limits was no longer on China's public record of court orders. Also, another company information service, Qichacha, did not show any high-spending risks for Wang Jianlin.</p>
            <p>On September 28, other news sources reported that someone inside Wanda said the spending limit was because of a money problem with a Wanda project company. This person said that both sides had been trying to solve the problem in different ways. They also said the issue might have happened because of wrong information when carrying out the court order.</p>
            <p>Wang Jianlin was once the richest person in China. In 2015, he was at the top of the "Hurun Global Chinese Rich List" with 260 billion Chinese Yuan (about 1.3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars at that time), becoming China's richest man.</p>
            <p>After his wealth reached its highest point in 2016, it has been going down for 10 years. In 2019, Wang Jianlin's money dropped a lot, from 156.63 billion Yuan the year before to 88.39 billion Yuan. As he kept selling assets to pay debts, by 2024, his wealth had shrunk by 80% compared to 10 years ago. He then left the Hurun Rich List.</p>

            <h1>Taipei City Gongguan Traffic is Normal After Changes; More Signs Will Be Added for Motorcycle Left-Turn Areas</h1>
            <p>Taipei City's Gongguan roundabout changed into a regular crossroad where Roosevelt Road and Keelung Road meet starting today. Vice Mayor Li Sichuan visited the area in the morning and said that traffic was normal during the holiday. However, he noted that tomorrow, during rush hour, will be the real test. He also saw that some motorcyclists were afraid to make direct left turns, so more signs will be put up to show the motorcycle left-turn area clearly.</p>
            <p>The Gongguan roundabout in Taipei City changed into a normal crossroad at 6 AM. Almost all cars and motorcycles can now turn left directly. Only motorcycles coming from Fuhe Bridge still need to make a two-stage left turn (waiting in a special area). However, there is still a waiting area marked for riders who need it.</p>
            <p>This morning, Taipei City government officials, including Vice Mayor Li Sichuan, Director of Transportation Department Hsieh Ming-hung, and Director of Public Works Department Huang Yi-ping, were at the site. They watched the traffic situation on the first day.</p>
            <p>Li Sichuan said that today is a holiday for Teachers' Day, so even though there are not as many cars as on a normal weekday, there are still more than on a typical holiday. He observed that traffic was moving normally. For example, buses no longer have to go down to the underground road and then come back up, making their journey faster. However, he stressed that tomorrow, when people go to work and school, will be the real challenge.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung said that tomorrow, the traffic light times will be adjusted. For example, the green light time used today was shorter because it was off-peak. Tomorrow, a longer green light time will be used for peak hours, allowing buses more time to pass through the crossroad.</p>
            <p>Li Sichuan said that some motorcyclists are still afraid to wait in the dashed area that extends from the left-turn lane for the left-turn signal. He thinks they might not be used to it yet. He said that the city will add more signs and mark the motorcycle left-turn waiting area more clearly so riders understand and use it better.</p>
            <p>Hsieh Ming-hung said that "Gongguan roundabout" will soon be a name from the past. He also noted that some motorcyclists might be scared to turn left directly because the intersection looks big.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, Hsieh Ming-hung said that the sidewalks in the turning areas will be extended outwards in the next two weeks. This will make the distance for pedestrians to cross the street shorter. Also, police officers and volunteer traffic assistants will always be on site to help and guide road users.</p>

            <h1>Australian Media: China is Quickly Building Many Commercial Ferries to Prepare for Invading Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A secret report from US military intelligence, seen by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), shows that China is quickly building more commercial ferry boats. This is to get ready for a possible attack on Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The report, written by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) for the Pentagon earlier this year, says that China's big ocean ferries have been changed. They can now carry tanks and take part in attacks from the sea onto land.</p>
            <p>The ABC got this report and agreed not to directly quote from it to protect its sources.</p>
            <p>According to the report, in 2022 alone, the "Five Eyes" intelligence group watched about 30 Chinese commercial ferries. These ferries took part in military exercises with China's army. The Five Eyes group includes Britain, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and Canada, and they share intelligence.</p>
            <p>The ABC also stated that China plans to build more than 70 big ferries by the end of 2026. Taiwan sees this as part of China's "plans to expand" into Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Ambassador Hsu Yu-tien, Taiwan's representative in Australia, told the ABC, "We also see more and more of China's 'grey zone' actions, like cyberattacks. These try to weaken Taiwan's democracy and society."</p>
            <p>He added, "Using civilian boats or other things that can be used for both civilian and military purposes at sea is also part of China's plan."</p>
            <h2>New Landing Barges</h2>
            <p>Satellite pictures show that China tested new landing barges along its coast earlier this year. These barges were used in military exercises with sea-to-land forces. These barges have very long ramps at the front and loading ramps at the back. They can connect smoothly with "Ro-Ro" (roll-on/roll-off) ferries to create a continuous way for troops to land.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Defense report believes that if there is a conflict with China, these commercial ferries could become military targets. This means that even if there are civilian crews on board, US forces might sink these ferries during a crisis in the Taiwan Strait.</p>
            <p>The US Indo-Pacific Command is increasingly worried about this. An internal document said that "sending troops directly into battle is an act of aggression usually done by warships. But the Chinese military seems to plan to use commercial Ro-Ro ferries for this."</p>
            <h2>Satellite Images Show Preparations</h2>
            <p>The US think tank, Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), says China plans to build more than 70 big ferries by the end of next year. These ferries usually carry people and goods, but sometimes they are seen taking part in the Chinese army's exercises.</p>
            <p>Hu Bo, director of Peking University's Center for Ocean Strategy Research, said that the US intelligence report is "a clear threat" to China. He stated that it is normal for China to get ready for a possible crisis in the Taiwan Strait and that it does not mean they will act immediately.</p>
            <p>US intelligence believes that Chinese President Xi Jinping has told his military to be ready to attack Taiwan by 2027. One of the biggest problems for China is whether it can land many troops and equipment on the beaches.</p>
            <p>Earlier this year, many pictures appeared on Chinese social media. They showed mysterious landing barges taking part in exercises about 350 kilometers southwest of Guangzhou.</p>
            <p>James Corera, an expert from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), said, "China is certainly building the ability to attack Taiwan."</p>
            <h2>What Do These Images Show?</h2>
            <p>The US intelligence report found that China has three different sizes of new landing barges. The shortest is 110 meters, and the longest is 185 meters. They can form a pier to deploy troops and vehicles onto the beach.</p>
            <p>Satellite images show that Chinese shipyards are building more landing barges.</p>
            <p>The US Naval War College said that these landing barges seem to be made to work with China's Ro-Ro ferries. They can connect to each other to form a floating pier up to 820 meters long.</p>
            <p>Corera said, "China is building floating ports, but they only make sense if they control the sea first. The barges themselves cannot take over a beach. They only work after the beach has been captured."</p>
            <h2>What Are Ro-Ro Ferries?</h2>
            <p>Ro-Ro ferries are commercial cargo ships that can carry hundreds of passengers and vehicles.</p>
            <p>As early as 2019, a 15,000-ton Ro-Ro ferry called "Bangchuidao" took part in a Chinese military sea-to-land attack exercise.</p>
            <p>According to CSIS, China will build 76 large ferries for its own use from 2023 to 2026. The report says, "There is clear proof that the Chinese military plans to use Ro-Ro ferries to help with military operations."</p>
            <p>Corera said that these ferries, owned by state-run companies and changed for "national defense needs," have been used in the Chinese army's sea-to-land attack exercises. This shows that Xi Jinping's plan for "military-civilian blending" is making big progress.</p>
            <h2>Are Chinese Ferries and Landing Barges New?</h2>
            <p>Other countries, including the United States, have also used similar ferries to move troops during peacetime. However, the large number of China's Ro-Ro ferries means that the US military faces a situation where they might have to sink civilian ships during a Taiwan Strait crisis.</p>
            <p>According to the "laws of war," attacking civilian ships goes against international rules, unless they are taken over and clearly used for military purposes. A US Indo-Pacific Command document argues that if the ferries are controlled by the Chinese military, they are legal military targets.</p>
            <p>However, Corera said that what is truly important is how often China trains, its aircraft carriers, and its rocket forces. The ferries and landing barges might just be a "distraction."</p>
            <p>Hu Bo warned that if the US tries to destroy Chinese ships during a Taiwan Strait crisis, "it will face very serious counteractions."</p>
            <p>The US Department of Defense and Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles both refused to comment.</p>
