            <h1>US and Venezuela Have More Problems, Trump Wants to Send 10 F-35 Fighter Jets to Puerto Rico</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 5 (Central News Agency) â€“ People who know about this said today that US President Trump will send 10 F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico. This is part of a plan to fight drug gangs. Also, the US military is sending more forces to the Caribbean area, and problems with Venezuela are getting worse.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that these fighter jets will join US warships already in the southern Caribbean Sea. President Trump is putting more pressure on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro. The US says that Maduro is leading a group that sells drugs.</p>
            <p>Problems have grown in the past few days. The US Department of Defense said that two Venezuelan military planes flew close to a US Navy ship in international waters yesterday. They called this action "very challenging."</p>
            <p>On September 2, the US military blew up a boat in the Caribbean Sea. They said the boat was used for carrying drugs. President Trump said this boat belonged to a Venezuelan criminal group called "Tren de Aragua," which has links to Maduro. 11 people died in this event.</p>
            <p>US sources said that these F-35 fighter jets will be placed at an air force base in Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is a US territory in the Caribbean Sea, and more than 3 million people live there.</p>
            <p>Maduro is a strong left-wing leader. The US believes he did not win the 2024 election fairly. He said that the US military actions are "the biggest danger our continent has faced in the last hundred years."</p>
            <p>He announced that his country is ready to "fight with weapons to protect its land." He has gathered about 340,000 active soldiers and more than 8 million reserve soldiers.</p>
            <p>Maduro told foreign journalists, "If Venezuela is attacked, we will start fighting with weapons immediately."</p>

            <h1>UK Deputy Prime Minister Rayner Leaves Her Job, Starmer Changes His Government</h1>
            <p>London, September 5 (Central News Agency) â€“ Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister, has left her job. She did this because she did not pay enough tax on her house. Today, the British Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, made many changes to his government. He wants to make the Labour Party government, which is having problems, strong again.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that an investigation found Rayner broke rules for ministers when she bought a house in southern England. Rayner, who is a left-wing member of the Labour Party, decided to leave her job. This made Starmer change his government for the first time since he became Prime Minister 14 months ago. During this time, the Reform UK party, which is very right-wing, has become more popular than the Labour Party that is in power.</p>
            <p>The BBC reported that David Lammy, who was the Foreign Secretary, will take Rayner's place. Yvette Cooper, who was the Home Secretary, will become the new Foreign Secretary. The report also said that Shabana Mahmood, who was the Justice Secretary, will become the new Home Secretary. Lammy will also be in charge of justice matters.</p>
            <p>Since Starmer became Prime Minister last July, his government has faced many problems and difficulties. Rayner's issue is the newest one.</p>
            <p>During this time, Starmer's government had to change its mind about welfare changes and help for older people with heating costs. It also could not stop illegal immigrants who arrived in small boats. This has made the Reform UK party, led by Nigel Farage, who is against immigration, more popular.</p>
            <p>This week, Rayner said that she did not pay enough tax on a house she bought by the sea. She asked for help from the government's independent advisor on ethics. Laurie Magnus, the advisor, wrote in a letter to Starmer that Rayner did not "listen to" the legal advice she was given. Because of this, he believed she "broke the rules."</p>
            <p>Rayner wrote in her letter to Keir Starmer, "Because of what the investigation found and how it affects my family, I have decided to leave my job." She also left her jobs as Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, and Deputy Leader of the Labour Party.</p>
            <p>Many people thought Rayner might lead the Labour Party in the future. She has also been a main target for political attacks from the Conservative Party, which is the opposition, and right-wing news groups.</p>
            <p>Rayner left school at 16 after she got pregnant. Working-class people like her open and honest way of speaking.</p>
            <p>Rayner is proud to support socialism. But she knows she must be practical first. One of her favorite sayings is, "Ideas alone cannot feed me."</p>

            <h1>New York Times: US Navy SEALs Went to North Korea in 2019, Mission Failed, North Korean Sailors Killed</h1>
            <p>New York, September 5 (Central News Agency) â€“ The New York Times reported today, using information from many current and past military officials. It said that in early 2019, US Navy SEALs went secretly to North Korea. President Trump at that time agreed to this. The goal was to put electronic listening devices there. However, North Korea found out about the plan. The US soldiers met a North Korean boat near the shore. They shot the sailors and then left. The mission did not succeed.</p>
            <p>One winter night in early 2019, US Navy SEALs came out of the water in North Korea. They swam quietly to a rocky shore. Their job was to put in electronic listening equipment. If they had succeeded, the US could have heard messages from North Korea's leader, Kim Jong Un.</p>
            <p>This was a very secret mission, very difficult, and could cause big problems. Nothing could go wrong.</p>
            <p>At that time, President Donald Trump was going to have a meeting with Kim Jong Un. The SEALs' mission could have given the US very important secret information. But the soldiers had to go onto North Korean land. If they were seen, the meeting would stop. It could also start a situation where people were taken captive and make the problems worse between the two countries that have nuclear weapons. This mission was very risky and needed the President's permission.</p>
            <p>The mission was done by SEAL Team 6, Red Squadron, the same group that killed Osama bin Laden, who planned the 9/11 attacks. The soldiers practiced for several months and knew they had to be very precise. But that night, the special forces soldiers, wearing wetsuits and night vision goggles, met a North Korean boat with bright searchlights at its front.</p>
            <p>To avoid being found, the SEALs started shooting. Within seconds, all the people on the boat died. The soldiers did not put in the listening devices. They left the shore and went back into the water.</p>
            <p>This mission is still a top secret. It was never made public. The US and North Korea did not say that anything happened. At that time, Trump's government also did not tell important members of Congress who watch secret operations. The New York Times is the first newspaper to report this. It also said that the White House did not tell Congress about a possible illegal action. The White House did not answer the New York Times' report.</p>
            <p>The New York Times talked to over 20 US government workers, former Trump government officials, and military people who know about the mission. Because it is a top secret, they could only speak without giving their names.</p>
            <p>The New York Times said it reported this secret military action carefully. It still has sensitive information about the mission. This information could affect how secret information is gathered and how special operations are done in the future.</p>
            <p>For many years, the US has tried to get closer to North Korea and control its nuclear weapons program. But neither making relations better nor using more economic punishments has worked. The SEALs' mission was one of the things the US did against North Korea. But even now, it is not clear how North Korea found out about the US military's secret mission in 2019.</p>
