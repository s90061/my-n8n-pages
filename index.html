            <h1>Countries Compete for Humanoid Robots; Taiwan Companies Aim for Key Parts Business</h1>
            <p>The Taiwan Robot and Smart Automation Exhibition will take place from August 20th to 23rd. Artificial Intelligence (AI) humanoid robot uses will be an important topic at the exhibition. Looking at the big picture, countries like China, the United States, Japan, the European Union, and South Korea are actively making robot bodies. Taiwanese companies want to get business for important parts and components. Taiwanese companies are carefully positive about humanoid robots being used in daily life.</p>
            <p>Big technology companies like NVIDIA, Tesla, and Amazon, as well as new companies like 1X Technologies (funded by Open AI) and AI robot startup Figure, are all working hard to make humanoid robots. Also, Meta, Apple, Samsung, Hyundai, and LG want to be leaders in humanoid robots.</p>
            <p>Hon Hai (Foxconn) continues to work with NVIDIA to make humanoid robots. Hon Hai recently said that they are working with NVIDIA on brain technology and AI model training. Hon Hai is using different types of humanoid robots in its AI smart factories. Hon Hai keeps investing in automation and robots to make smart manufacturing better.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg recently reported that Apple is planning to make a robot for desktops, which might come out as early as 2027. Earlier this year, there were also rumors that Apple was working with Carnegie Mellon University in the United States to make a humanoid robot called ARMOR.</p>
            <p>Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, said in late July that the third version of their humanoid robot, Optimus, will be ready by the end of this year. He expects to start making Optimus in large numbers in 2026, with a goal of producing 1 million units per year within 5 years.</p>
            <p>Amazon has invested in a new robot company called Agility Robotics. In May, Agility Robotics showed their Digit humanoid robot, which is used in warehouses for logistics. They are still working to make its design better.</p>
            <p>Japanese company Honda, British company Engineered Art, and American company Boston Dynamics have been working on humanoid robots for a long time. Israeli robot startup Mentee Robotics and German robot startup NEURA Robotics are also actively joining this field.</p>
            <p>Chinese companies like Ubtech, Unitree Robotics, Fourier Intelligence, Daru, Xiaomi, XPeng, Huawei, iFLYTEK, and Zhiyuan are strongly trying to win in the humanoid robot market.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that over 150 companies around the world are making robots. China, the United States, and Japan are the top three countries, with their companies making up 65% of the total. Chinese companies make up about 37%, and their number has doubled in the last five years.</p>
            <h2>AI Humanoid Robots Move Smoothly; Joint Modules Are Key</h2>
            <p>Overall, the main parts inside AI humanoid robots include AI chips, controllers, and AI software, which handle guiding, controlling, and interacting. They also have power systems with servo motors, linear guide rails, ball screws, harmonic reducers, planetary reducers, and servo couplings for movement. Besides these, they have sensors for vision, position, pressure, torque, touch, and hearing, as well as important parts like batteries and microphones.</p>
            <p>Inside an AI humanoid robot, the joint modules are very important for the robot to move naturally and smoothly. These modules are made of motors, drivers, encoders, reducers, and sensors. People in the industry say that one humanoid robot needs 14 to 30 joint modules.</p>
            <p>Also, the robot's clever hands are made of small motors, drivers, encoders, small reducers, and sensors. One hand usually needs 6 joint modules, so a robot needs 12 modules for both hands.</p>
            <h2>Taiwanese Companies Aim for Key Modules and Parts in Humanoid Robot Business</h2>
            <p>Things like power systems, moving parts, chips, and sensors are already important parts used in automated machines. Taiwanese companies already have a good base in these areas.</p>
            <p>Experts point out that for reducers, companies like Taiwan Precision Gear, U-Long, Allystar (a joint venture of Moy-Li and Hota), Jin Hsing, and Li-Ming are actively involved. For screw drive parts, there are Hiwin, U-SCREWS, and CPC. For control software and hardware, there are Nexcom, Delta Electronics, and Syntec Technology. TECO and Hiwin are working on joint modules. For servo and drive motors, there are Actron Technology, Fukuta Electric, TECO, and Hiwin Technologies. For machine vision and sensor modules, there are Solomon, Adlink Technology, Techman Robot, Largan Precision, Altek, and Enable Technology.</p>
            <p>Looking at how much joint modules cost for humanoid robots, people in the industry say that joint modules make up about 15% to 20% of Tesla's Optimus robot cost, and 40% to 50% for China's Unitree Robotics.</p>
            <p>Industry experts explain that Tesla's robots have higher costs for the brain chip and software. Unitree Robotics might focus more on the robot's physical parts. If the control and sensor software becomes good and cheaper, the cost could go down a lot.</p>
            <h2>Taiwanese Companies Are Carefully Hopeful About Humanoid Robots Being Used Commercially</h2>
            <p>Looking forward to when humanoid robots will be used in everyday business, the industry is carefully hopeful. TSMC's Chairman and CEO, C. C. Wei, said in a meeting in mid-July that humanoid robots will not be a main reason for industry growth this year, and probably not in 2026 either. He expects that the first use of humanoid robots will likely be in healthcare.</p>
            <p>Wei explained that humanoid robots not only have a "brain" (the computer processor) but also include many different sensors and integrated software and hardware designs. Making humanoid robots is very complex, and because they will interact directly with people, their design must be extra careful.</p>
            <p>Richard Huang, the Chief Operating Officer of Techman Robot (part of Quanta Group), said that cost and how smart they are are the most important things for humanoid robot development. Humanoid robots that move like humans need good sensors and AI technology. He expects that human-like robots might start to appear in about 10 years.</p>
            <p>Frank Kuo, the General Manager of Taiwan Precision Gear, said that the uses for humanoid robots are not yet clear, the technology still needs to become better, and the rules for parts also need to be decided. So, it is still early to say when humanoid robots will be commonly used in business.</p>

            <h1>Osaka, Japan to Increase Accommodation Tax Starting September; Travel Writer Says Be Ready with Cash Upon Check-in</h1>
            <p>The Osaka government in Japan recently announced that from September 1st, they will change the accommodation tax. If you stay at a place that costs 5,000 Japanese Yen or more per person per night, you will pay an extra 200 to 500 Japanese Yen in tax. Travel writer 943 reminds travelers that the accommodation tax is usually collected in cash when you check in.</p>
            <p>The Osaka government in Japan announced that starting September 1st, the tax-free amount for accommodation will decrease from 7,000 Japanese Yen (about 1429 New Taiwan Dollars) to 5,000 Japanese Yen (about 1021 New Taiwan Dollars). From September 1st, if you stay at a place costing 5,000 to 15,000 Japanese Yen (about 3063 New Taiwan Dollars) per person per night, you will pay an extra 200 Japanese Yen (about 41 New Taiwan Dollars) accommodation tax.</p>
            <p>For stays costing 15,000 Japanese Yen (about 3063 New Taiwan Dollars) to 20,000 Japanese Yen (about 4083 New Taiwan Dollars), the tax will be 400 Japanese Yen (about 82 New Taiwan Dollars). For stays costing more than 20,000 Japanese Yen (about 4083 New Taiwan Dollars), the tax will be 500 Japanese Yen (about 102 New Taiwan Dollars).</p>
            <p>Regarding this, travel writer 943 said today that many tourist cities in Japan, including Tokyo, Kyoto, and Kanazawa, also collect accommodation taxes.</p>
            <p>943 pointed out that many people have already booked their rooms in advance, but the room price they booked does not include the accommodation tax. Therefore, if travelers go to Osaka starting in September and their stay is subject to the accommodation tax, they will be asked to pay cash when checking in. She reminds travelers to always have Japanese Yen cash with them to avoid problems if they cannot pay the accommodation tax when checking in.</p>

            <h1>Trump-Putin Summit Does Not Reach Agreement on Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire; Ukrainians Feel Frustrated and Angry</h1>
            <p>Ukrainians today expressed anger and frustration. This is because the US and Russian presidents did not agree on the need for a ceasefire in the Ukraine war at their meeting. Also, US President Trump rolled out the red carpet for Russian President Putin in Alaska, showing him great welcome.</p>
            <p>A 26-year-old soldier, who only gave his call sign Dzha, said: "He (Putin) won. Trump showed how he feels about him, and at the same time, how he feels about us. This meeting was not good for Ukraineâ€¦ We must end this war. We truly need to sit down and talk to reach an agreement, because every day soldiers are dying or getting hurt."</p>
            <p>Some Ukrainians were angry that Trump invited Vladimir Putin to visit the United States and treated him with so much respect, as if they were equals.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that a fake photo was shared widely online. In the picture, Trump and Putin are shaking hands on an airport tarmac, with bombed-out Ukrainian residential areas in the background.</p>
            <p>Tetiana Vorobei, a retired person from Kyiv, said: "I don't know what Trump is thinking? I feel he (and Putin) are exactly the same. They are completely alike!"</p>
