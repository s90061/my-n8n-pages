Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily reported that after the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, Iran has restarted negotiations with China to purchase J-10C fighter jets. According to Iranian and Russian financial media on Thursday (June 26), this 4++ generation medium multi-role fighter, developed by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, is expected to address the long-standing combat capability shortcomings of the Iranian Air Force.

The report states that despite multiple unsuccessful negotiations between Iran and China over the past two decades, Iran is now eager to strengthen its air force fleet after its air defense capabilities were weakened during the 12-day conflict with Israel, with a potential demand for 400 aircraft. Currently, Russia's aircraft production capacity is constrained by its domestic needs due to the war in Ukraine, and Russian think tanks admit that Chinese fighter jets have become the best solution.

Sing Tao Daily quoted Russia's Kommersant newspaper as reporting that as early as 2015, Iran and China were close to signing a contract for up to 150 J-10C fighter jets, but the deal fell through due to disagreements over payment methods. China at the time did not accept oil or natural gas as payment, and Iran, constrained by foreign exchange shortages and UN embargoes, found it difficult to complete the transaction. After the arms embargo was lifted in 2020, negotiations briefly resumed but eventually stalled for the same reasons.

In early May, an aerial combat broke out between Pakistan and India, where Pakistani J-10CE fighter jets, equipped with PL-15 air-to-air missiles, shot down five Indian military aircraft, including three French-made Rafale jets, near the border, attracting global attention.

The report states that the J-10CE is a single-engine, multi-role fighter developed and produced by China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, with "E" denoting the export version. It is considered an economical alternative to the F-16V and Swedish JAS-39 Gripen E, with a unit price ranging from 40 million to 50 million US dollars (approximately 310 to 390 million Hong Kong dollars), depending on the configuration and training package. In contrast, Russia's Su-35 and MiG-35 are more expensive and face greater challenges in terms of production capacity and delivery.

The report cited data from the UK-based IISS think tank's "The Military Balance 2025," which indicates that before the war, Iran had approximately 150 serviceable fighter jets, mostly old US-made models from the 1970s, such as the F-4, F-5, and F-14. Their maintenance relies on domestically produced parts, making operations difficult. Other aircraft, like the MiG-29s acquired in the late 1980s, are also in poor condition due to a lack of spare parts.

Iran had planned to expand its military through the Su-35 procurement deal signed in 2023, ordering 50 units, but has only received four so far. As most of Russia's production capacity is dedicated to the war in Ukraine, it is difficult to fulfill the contract in the short term, forcing Iran to seek alternative solutions.

The report notes that the Israeli airstrike on June 13 highlighted Iran's weak air defense system. The US's agreement on June 24 allowing China to legally purchase Iranian oil could enable Iran to conduct oil-for-goods transactions with China, accelerating the J-10C procurement process.

Ilya Kramnik, a strategic researcher at the Primakov Institute of World Economy and International Relations (IMEMO) of the Russian Academy of Sciences, pointed out that even if Iran successfully receives the Su-35s, it would still require a large fleet to support comprehensive air defense capabilities, estimating a demand of 400 aircraft. The J-10C, with its lower cost and stable supply, is currently the only viable option. He also mentioned that while the Russian-made MiG-35 is a potential alternative, this model has not yet entered mass production, making it difficult to serve as a primary supplementary aircraft.

Brigadier General Hamid Vahedi, Commander of the Iranian Air Force, met with high-ranking Chinese Air Force officials and inspected the J-10CE during the 2024 China Airshow. The performance of the J-10CE is comparable to, or even surpasses, that of an upgraded F-16. Its operational victories in Egypt and Pakistan further demonstrate its performance, reliability, and readiness.

Additionally, according to a recently published article by observer Umud Shokri from the American conservative think tank "Middle East Forum," Brigadier General Hamid Vahedi, Commander of the Iranian Air Force, met with high-ranking Chinese Air Force officials and inspected the J-10CE during the 2024 China Airshow. The article believes that the performance of the J-10CE is comparable to, or even surpasses, that of an upgraded F-16. Its operational victories in Egypt and Pakistan further demonstrate its performance, reliability, and readiness. In addition to filling Iran's air capability gaps, Iran's purchase of the J-10CE also signifies its shift towards Chinese military equipment and strengthens economic and security ties with Beijing.

However, the article also notes that disagreements related to payment have stalled negotiations for the purchase of approximately 36 J-10CEs. Tehran proposed oil-for-goods, but Beijing sought cash payment.

The article points out that Iran also expressed interest in the JF-17 Block III, a Sino-Pakistani jointly developed fighter that incorporates fifth-generation fighter technology but is less expensive than the J-10CE. However, the article states that the J-10CE better meets Iran's operational needs. If Iran wants to reduce its reliance on a single supplier, it is a modern multi-role fighter that can integrate well with larger Russian aircraft purchased in the future.

**Lai Ching-te's Third-Degree Relative Clause Criticized as "Stupid"; DPP National Congress to Temporarily Suspend Proposal**

Today marks the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) National Congress. It was initially anticipated that a "third-degree relative clause" proposal would be introduced, aiming to amend the party charter to prohibit the employment of family members of DPP public representatives as publicly funded assistants, under the strong will of party chairman Lai Ching-te. However, due to significant internal party opposition, the DPP Central Party Headquarters did not propose this motion today, effectively postponing its implementation indefinitely.

In February of this year, several public representatives were investigated by prosecutors for alleged irregularities concerning assistant salaries. President Lai Ching-te, also serving as the DPP chairman, issued a directive during a Central Standing Committee meeting, demanding that DPP public officials adhere to the highest standards. He stipulated that the assistant teams of public representatives should follow the "Civil Service Employment Act," prohibiting the employment of spouses and relatives within the third degree of kinship or affinity. While family members could serve as volunteers, they should not be publicly funded assistants. This directive immediately drew strong opposition within the party.

Taipei City Councilor Chien Shu-pei was reportedly overheard privately criticizing the policy as "super stupid," and several other green camp councilors admitted that the party headquarters' directive, issued without prior communication, caught public representatives across the north, central, and south regions off guard. They particularly questioned who would assist them after work, given that councilor assistants are on call 24 hours a day.

According to Article 26 of the Civil Service Employment Act, agency heads are prohibited from employing their spouses or relatives within the third degree of kinship or affinity within their own agency, or appointing them as heads of directly subordinate agencies. Furthermore, spouses and relatives within the third degree of kinship or affinity of heads of various levels within the agency should be avoided in their respective supervised units.

Party insiders revealed that after Lai Ching-te ordered research into amending internal regulations in February, Party Secretary-General Lin Yu-chang also stated that he would follow Lai's instructions to explore amending the party charter to incorporate clear regulations. According to DPP regulations, any amendment to the party charter must be proposed to the National Congress and passed by the national party representatives to take effect.

While Lin Yu-chang was still in the research phase, many within the DPP had already criticized the party headquarters. New Taipei City Councilor Lin Ping-yu of the DPP believed the logic was "too far-fetched" and questioned if someone was "finding governing too easy" and wanted to increase the difficulty by trying to incorporate such "ridiculous ideas" into the party charter. Taipei City Councilor Chien Shu-pei was also exposed for criticizing the policy as "super stupid."

Party insiders noted that public criticism was merely the tip of the iceberg, with numerous green camp public representatives appealing to the party headquarters, asserting that this amendment would undoubtedly cause problems and should be avoided at all costs. The most frequently mentioned argument was that the focus should remain on resolving issues related to defrauding assistant fees and reducing risks, rather than "throwing the baby out with the bathwater." They argued that political aides and assistants cannot operate like typical 9-to-5 jobs, requiring reliance on highly compatible individuals like family members, which is common in local politics. In fact, with family assistance, politicians often operate more smoothly.

Party insiders stated that, based on internal party feedback, the party headquarters has decided not to propose the motion at today's National Congress. As long as no party representative suddenly raises the issue during the ad-hoc proposal session, the matter will essentially be postponed indefinitely.

**Iranian Ambassador to China: Supports Xi Jinping's Four-Point Proposal; Iran Willing to Promote Comprehensive Cooperation Plan with China**

According to Xinhua News Agency, Iranian Ambassador to China, Mohsen Fakhari, stated in Beijing on June 27 that Iran and China have maintained close communication recently. He expressed Iran's support for President Xi Jinping's four-point proposal on the current situation in the Middle East and thanked China for condemning Israel and the United States' attacks on Iran in multilateral forums, including the United Nations Security Council. He also stated that Iran is willing to work with China to implement the comprehensive cooperation plan between China and Iran.

The comprehensive cooperation plan between China and Iran is an investment cooperation plan involving 400 billion US dollars. According to the agreement signed in Tehran in 2021, China's investment in Iran will reach 400 billion US dollars over 25 years. In addition to establishing free trade zones, China and Iran will cooperate on dozens of projects in various fields, including banking, telecommunications, ports, railways, and global navigation systems. However, the actual implementation progress after signing has been minimal.

At a media briefing held at the Iranian Embassy in China on the same day, Fakhari expressed Iran's gratitude for the support provided by the Chinese government and people during Iran's most difficult times. He stated that Iran is committed to promoting Iran-China cooperation and is willing to work with China to implement the comprehensive cooperation plan and jointly strive to maintain international and regional security.

Fakhari is the newly appointed Iranian Ambassador to China, who recently assumed his post in Beijing. On June 23, Liu Bin, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, met with Fakhari. At that time, Liu Bin stated that China is highly concerned about the developments in the regional situation, opposes infringements on Iran's sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and opposes the escalation of conflicts. He added that China is willing to maintain communication with Iran and play a constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East. Fakhari responded by expressing gratitude for China's impartial stance and looked forward to China continuing to play an active role in de-escalating the situation and upholding international fairness and justice.

In fact, the new Israeli Ambassador to China, Irit Ben-Abba, also recently assumed her post, and Liu Bin met with Ben-Abba on June 25.

At yesterday's media briefing, Fakhari reportedly discussed Iran's recent counter-attacks against Israeli and US military strikes, stating that the goals of Israel and the US were to overthrow the Iranian government, destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities, and incite the Iranian people against the government, but none of these three goals were achieved. He stated that Iran's military counter-attacks maintained national stability and unity. He noted that Iran has not yet exhausted its military counter-attack capabilities.

US President Trump stated on June 25 that the US and Iran would hold talks next week and might sign an agreement. Fakhari responded by saying that Iran has never voluntarily left the negotiating table, but "now is not a good time for negotiations." He emphasized that Iran would only reconsider negotiations if the US and Israel abandon their oppression and bullying of Iran.
