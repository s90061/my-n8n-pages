            <h1>Hsinchu City Destroys Rice with Mercury; Environmental Department Helps Farmers for a Short Time</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Reporter Chang Hsiung-feng, Taipei, July 31st) Farmland in Hsinchu was polluted with mercury. The city government destroyed the rice crops and is cleaning the land. The Ministry of Environment said it will first pay for destroying the crops, helping farmers with their daily lives while farming stops, and cleaning up the land. This is to help farmers. If they find the person who caused the pollution, they will ask for money back.</p>
            <p>Hsinchu City's Environmental Protection Bureau said in a press release that they found too much mercury in the mud at the bottom of the Jiujiangpu main channel's branch 10 when checking the water recently. This could affect rice growing on three pieces of land. After testing the soil on the farmland, they confirmed the mercury levels were higher than the safety limit. Today, the rice and rice stalks have been removed and destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Protection Bureau said the mercury pollution might come from dirty water around and upstream, which flowed into the land through irrigation channels. They have started to find out where the pollution came from. They have also marked the three pieces of land and made farmers stop growing crops there to clean up the pollution.</p>
            <p>The Environmental Management Administration of the Ministry of Environment said in a press release this evening that protecting the environment and people's food safety is the most important job. The Ministry of Environment has started to help Hsinchu City Government announce the contaminated farmland, stop growing food crops, improve the soil, and find the source of the pollution.</p>
            <p>As for the costs of destroying crops, helping farmers with their daily lives while farming stops, and cleaning the polluted farmland, the Ministry of Environment said that its Soil and Groundwater Pollution Remediation Fund will temporarily pay for these. This is to help farmers. Once they find the person who caused the pollution, they will immediately ask them to pay back the money.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment stressed that the quality of water in irrigation channels, mud at the bottom of channels, quality of farmland, and food safety in farming areas will be managed by central and local environmental and agricultural departments working together. They will stay in touch to stop pollution and make sure the environment is good and people's food is safe. (Edited by Wu Su-rou) 1140731</p>

            <h1>China Tries Many Ways to Encourage Marriage; More People Got Married in the First Half of the Year</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, July 31st) Last year, the number of marriages in China was the lowest in 45 years. So, the government has started many plans to encourage people to get married. The Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs said yesterday that 3.539 million couples registered their marriages in the first half of this year. This is 109,000 more than the same time last year.</p>
            <p>In 2024, 6.106 million couples registered their marriages in mainland China. This was a big drop of 20.5% from 2023, the lowest number since 1980.</p>
            <p>Regarding the increase in marriages in the first half of the year after a drop, Chinese media reported that the government has introduced many plans to encourage marriage.</p>
            <p>First, they have made wedding leave longer. In 28 of China's 31 provinces and regions, wedding leave is now longer. Shanxi and Gansu have the longest leave, up to 30 days.</p>
            <p>Second, it's now much easier to register a marriage. From May 10th, new rules for marriage registration started. People can now register their marriage anywhere in the country, and they don't need to show their household registration book to get a marriage certificate. This means young people don't need their parents' permission to get married, making it easier for them to decide their future together.</p>
            <p>Also, many places are now giving money to encourage marriage. For example, in Lvliang City, Shanxi Province, couples who register their marriage for the first time, where the woman is 35 years old or younger, get 1,500 Chinese Yuan (about 6,300 New Taiwan Dollars) in a red envelope right away. Zhejiang Province encourages some areas to give wedding red envelopes and shopping coupons. Other places are giving gifts of different values.</p>
            <p>According to Southern Daily, since January, Nanling Village in Longgui Street, Baiyun District, Guangzhou City, has offered a prize of up to 40,000 Chinese Yuan for couples marrying for the first time. If they then have three more children, they can get up to 100,000 Chinese Yuan in total.</p>
            <p>For the serious problem of "sky-high bride prices" in rural areas, by June, 127 counties, cities, and districts in 18 provinces and regions in mainland China had set limits on bride prices. For example, in central provinces like Henan and Anhui, the limit is usually 50,000 to 80,000 Chinese Yuan. In richer provinces like Shandong and Jiangsu, it's 80,000 to 120,000 Chinese Yuan. In western provinces like Guizhou and Yunnan, it's 30,000 to 60,000 Chinese Yuan.</p>
            <p>A report from China's Ministry of Civil Affairs in 2024, called "China Marriage and Family Development Report," showed that the average bride price in rural areas across the country has gone up a lot, from 88,000 Chinese Yuan in 2015 to 187,000 Chinese Yuan in 2024. In some areas, it's even more than 300,000 Chinese Yuan. This makes it hard for young people in rural areas to get married. (Edited by Yang Sheng-ru / Chiu Kuo-chiang) 1140731</p>

            <h1>Keelung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan Promote Tourism; Taiwan's Concerts Attract Visitors from Singapore and Malaysia</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Reporter Huang Hsu-sheng, New Taipei, July 31st) New Taipei City's Tourism and Travel Department said today that tourism leaders from New Taipei, Keelung, Taipei, and Taoyuan cities met with local travel companies in Singapore. Taiwan's "concert economy" is a big reason why travelers from Singapore and Malaysia want to visit. They expect to attract a thousand visitors to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City's Tourism and Travel Department announced that the four cities (New Taipei, Keelung, Taipei, Taoyuan) are trying to be more known in the Singapore and Malaysia travel market. On July 30th, they held a tourism event in Singapore called "Shiok you around" (meaning "making you very happy"). 70 travel companies from Singapore and Malaysia, and 60 from Taiwan, joined the event.</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department said today, July 31st, they visited many important tourism groups and companies in Singapore, including the famous Tseng Brothers Travel and Datong Travel. They expect to bring 1,000 visitors from Singapore and Malaysia to travel in northern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The press release also said that today they visited the Republic of China (Taiwan) Office in Singapore, China Airlines, and the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS). They talked about marketing plans and how to promote regional travel. They believe their efforts will show good results in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
            <p>The Tourism and Travel Department stated that during detailed talks with two travel agencies that have a large market share in Singapore and Malaysia, they learned what travelers from Southeast Asia prefer. NATAS said that there are fewer free big concerts in Singapore and Malaysia. So, Taiwan's "concert economy" is a main reason that attracts visitors from Singapore and Malaysia to northern Taiwan.</p>
            <p>New Taipei City's Tourism and Travel Department also said that on this trip, they promoted places like Shifen Sky Lanterns, New Pingxi Coal Mine Museum, Laomei Green Reef, Wulai, and Jinshan Old Street. They also talked about events like the Jiufen Red Lantern Festival, New Taipei City River and Ocean Music Festival concerts, and the New Taipei City Christmasland "Superstar Concert." These show the many different attractions of New Taipei. (Edited by Lin Shu-hui) 1140731</p>
