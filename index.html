            <h1>Low-Pressure Area Brings More Rain to Central and Southern Taiwan; Be Careful of Local Heavy Rains</h1>
            <p>Due to a low-pressure area, the Central Weather Administration said today that there is a high chance of rain in western Taiwan. Especially in central and southern Taiwan, there will be short showers or thunderstorms at different times throughout the day. There is also a chance of heavy rain in some local areas. For northern Taiwan, there will be some short showers or thunderstorms because of moisture left from the low-pressure system. For eastern Taiwan, it will be mostly cloudy with some short thunderstorms in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, most places will have high temperatures of 30 to 32 degrees Celsius. When it is not raining, it will feel hot and humid. Low temperatures will be between 26 and 28 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>For the outlying islands: Penghu will be cloudy, sometimes overcast, with short showers or thunderstorms. Temperatures will be 27 to 31 degrees Celsius. Kinmen will be cloudy with short showers or thunderstorms, and temperatures from 27 to 32 degrees Celsius. Matsu will be cloudy with short showers or thunderstorms, and temperatures from 26 to 29 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>The Weather Administration reminds everyone that strong winds are likely in parts of Orchid Island, Green Island, areas north of Taichung, Hengchun Peninsula, and Penghu. These winds can be strong, with average speeds of level 6 or gusts of level 8 and above. Along the coasts of Keelung North Coast, eastern Taiwan (including Orchid Island and Green Island), and Hengchun Peninsula, there is a chance of long waves, which can reach 2 to 3 meters high. Please be careful when doing activities near the sea.</p>
            <p>Also, until July 27th, it is a time of very high tides. In Tainan, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Taitung, Hengchun Peninsula, and along the coasts of Keelung North Coast and Yilan, water levels will be high during high tide. Low-lying areas near the coast might experience seawater flowing inland and local floods. Please pay special attention to areas where water drains slowly and avoid staying in coastal areas, ports, or tidal zones.</p>
            <p>About typhoons: Tropical Storm CO-MAY, the 8th typhoon, was located 370 kilometers southeast of Taipei at 2 AM today. It is moving north-northeast and will soon become a tropical depression. Tropical Storm KROSA, the 9th typhoon, was about 2410 kilometers east of Eluanbi at 2 AM. Because it is very far away, it does not affect Taiwan's weather directly right now.</p>
            <p>According to air quality reports from the Ministry of Environment, the wind will change to west or southwest because of the low-pressure area. The southwest wind might bring small amounts of pollution from other places to Taiwan and its islands. Northern Taiwan is in a downwind area, so pollution might build up there more easily. The air quality in Hualien-Taitung is "good." Air quality in Northern, Hsinchu-Miaoli, Central, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Yilan, and Matsu is "normal." Some small areas in western Taiwan might briefly reach "orange alert" levels. Kinmen and Penghu are at "orange alert" level.</p>

            <h1>"The Kidnapping" and "What's on My Mind" to Be Shown at New York Asian Film Festival; Directors Explain How to Tell Good Stories</h1>
            <p>Two movies from Taiwan, "The Kidnapping" and "What's on My Mind," will be shown at the New York Asian Film Festival. They are part of a special section called "Taiwan's Hidden Gems." The directors, Chien Hsueh-pin and Pan Ke-yin, spent a long time working on the movie scripts. They came to New York to tell the audience about good new commercial and drama films from Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Pan Ke-yin's movie, "What's on My Mind," will be shown on July 26th. Chien Hsueh-pin's movie, "The Kidnapping," will be shown on July 27th. Both movies talk about serious topics like real-life social problems and family secrets. The directors held a press conference on July 25th at the Taipei Cultural Center in New York.</p>
            <p>"The Kidnapping" has famous actors like Chang Hsiao-chuan, Li Mu, and Lou Jun-shuo. The story starts with a father looking for his daughter. Then, it shows social issues such as illegal organ trading and secret live broadcasts on the internet, showing how hard life can be for different social classes. The movie came out in Taiwan in April and was shown specially in Hong Kong in June.</p>
            <p>Director Chien Hsueh-pin said that making "The Kidnapping" was difficult. They had delays because of the pandemic and an actor getting hurt. He said the movie was first planned as a drama. But over the last 10 years, the film industry in Taiwan and global online streaming services changed a lot. People in Taiwan wanted different kinds of movies, so they changed it into a crime thriller.</p>
            <p>He said, "'The Kidnapping' shows real-life problems, and many countries, especially Korea, make similar movies. Taiwan also needs to tell these kinds of stories. The problem of organ trading in poorer countries is serious and important to see. We want to tell people about it in a movie that everyone can enjoy."</p>
            <p>Talking about the problems that the movie industry around the world faces, Director Chien said that the story for "The Kidnapping" was changed for 10 years. The world keeps changing, and what audiences like also changes. Making genre films (like crime thrillers) is popular, but it's hard. Getting people to come to movie theaters is a big challenge for directors now.</p>
            <p>He explained that Taiwanese movies usually have a budget of about 50 million New Taiwan Dollars. Makers of films must create movies with this amount of money. They cannot write scripts that need a lot of money. This is a challenge: to tell a good story within these limits and make the plot, action, and choice of actors better under these conditions.</p>
            <p>"What's on My Mind" is the first long movie by director Pan Ke-yin, who used to be an editor. The story grew from his short film "Sister" to become a story about a family of four. In April this year, it got a lot of praise at the Udine Far East Film Festival in Italy.</p>
            <p>Pan said, "My older sister was adopted into our family. My relationship with her was just like with any other brother or sister. I wanted to share my feelings about my family." He continued, "My sister was very ill in the hospital, and my mother held her hand and cried. I felt very strongly at that moment that even though they were not related by blood, they had a very strong connection. I wanted to create something to show why this exists, this unconditional care and love between people."</p>
            <p>"What's on My Mind" tells the story of a family from the viewpoints of all four family members. It looks at the family at different times to see how it started and how it changed.</p>
            <p>He said that when he grew up and left home for school and work, he rarely went back home. Each time he did go back, he felt that the situation of his home was always changing. Home is like a person's growth and change. After leaving home for a while, you might find that someone is no longer there, or people have gone to work or gotten married. The home itself also gets older, and this feeling is a bit sad.</p>
            <p>Both of these movies are about family. This has made some people connect Pan Ke-yin with the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who is known for making movies about families.</p>
            <p>Pan thought carefully and said that their styles are different, and he is not as gentle. But this comparison puts a lot of pressure on him. He does not want to think too much about what his style is right now. He just wants to follow his feelings and do what he thinks of.</p>
            <p>He said that if he makes a second movie in the future, it probably won't be like the first one. Being put in the same sentence as Kore-eda is certainly a compliment and an honor. He believes that if he continues to make movies, people will start to see his own style.</p>
            <p>"What's on My Mind" stars Tseng Jing-hua, Lan Wei-hua, Kao I-ling, Huang Pei-chi, Yao Chun-yao, and Chu Yi-ming. It is expected to be released in Taiwan in September.</p>

            <h1>Recall Vote Time Ends at 4 PM: 7 Important Rules to Know â€“ No Campaigning, No Cell Phones</h1>
            <p>Today, July 26th, there will be recall votes for 24 lawmakers from the KMT party and for Kao Hung-an, the mayor of Hsinchu who is currently suspended. Voting will be open from 8 AM to 4 PM. People should bring their national ID card, personal stamp (chop), and voting notice to their voting place.</p>
            <p>If you do not have your personal stamp, you can still vote by signing your name or using your thumbprint. If you do not have your voting notice, you can still vote. But if you know your number on the voter list (for example, "page X, number Y"), telling this to the election staff can save time.</p>
            <p>The Central Election Commission has listed 7 important rules for voting:</p>
            <p>First, from midnight on July 26th, you cannot do any campaigning for or against the recall on social media like LINE or Facebook, or on any other media. If you break this rule, you will have to pay a fine of NT$100,000 to NT$1,000,000. If you continue after being told to stop, you will get more fines. Political parties, candidates, their workers, or people using their services will pay a higher fine of NT$200,000 to NT$2,000,000.</p>
            <p>Second, you cannot shout, cause trouble, or try to convince others to vote or not vote within 30 meters of a voting place. If you do this and continue after a security guard tells you to stop, you could go to jail for up to 1 year, or pay a fine of up to NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>Third, you cannot bring cell phones or other cameras into the voting place. However, you can bring your phone if it is turned off. If you break this rule, you will pay a fine of NT$30,000 to NT$300,000.</p>
            <p>Fourth, you cannot put anything other than your recall ballot into the ballot box, or purposely tear your ballot. If you do this, you will pay a fine of NT$5,000 to NT$50,000.</p>
            <p>Fifth, you cannot use a camera to secretly see how someone voted. If you do this, you could go to jail for up to 5 years and/or pay a fine of up to NT$500,000. Any camera used will be taken away.</p>
            <p>Sixth, you cannot take your recall ballot out of the voting place. If you do this, you could go to jail for up to 1 year, or pay a fine of up to NT$15,000.</p>
            <p>Seventh, if you mark your recall ballot using your personal stamp or a thumbprint, your vote will not count. You also cannot use your own tools or ink pads to mark your vote. You must use the special tool provided by the election committee to mark your vote.</p>
            <p>According to the rules for public officials' elections and recalls, a recall will pass only if there are more "yes" votes than "no" votes, and the number of "yes" votes is at least one-fourth (1/4) of all the voters in that area. If the recall passes, the Central Election Commission will announce it on August 1st. The person who was recalled will lose their job on August 1st and can no longer be a legislator or mayor.</p>
            <p>If the "no" votes are more than the "yes" votes, or if the "yes" votes are less than one-fourth (1/4) of all voters, then the recall will not pass. If a recall does not pass, no one can try to recall the same person again during their current time in office.</p>
