Recent news shows that overall inflation in the United States is slowing down. This is good news for the economy in general. However, there's one area where prices are still going up: food. This means that even though other costs might be stable, families are still spending more money on groceries every week.

Many people are noticing that their supermarket bills are much higher than before. This continued rise in food prices is making it harder for households to manage their daily budgets. Experts say several reasons are causing this problem. These include ongoing issues with supply chains, which means getting food from farms to shops is still difficult. Also, bad weather in different parts of the world has affected harvests, leading to less food being available. Finally, the cost of paying workers in the food industry has also increased, which adds to the final price consumers pay.

This situation highlights a challenge for many people's daily lives, as essential goods like food continue to become more expensive.

**How AI Will Change Jobs, Not Replace Them**

A new report suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) is unlikely to cause a large loss of jobs. Instead, AI will mostly change the way people work. The report explains that while AI might take over some tasks, it won't completely replace human workers in most jobs. This means that instead of robots doing everything, AI will become a tool that helps people do their jobs more efficiently.

However, the report also emphasizes that workers will need to learn new skills. As AI develops, certain parts of jobs might become automated. Therefore, people will need to adapt and gain new abilities to work alongside AI technology. Some jobs might be affected more than others, but new types of jobs are also expected to appear because of AI. The main message is that the future of work will involve humans and AI working together, and learning new skills will be important for everyone.

**Venice Starts New Fee for Day Visitors**

The beautiful city of Venice, Italy, has started a new system to manage its many visitors. From now on, people who visit Venice just for one day will have to pay a small fee. This trial program aims to control the large number of tourists who come to the city, especially during busy times. Venice is famous for its canals and historic buildings, but it often gets too crowded.

The fee is about 5 euros ($5.30) and applies to day-trippers aged 14 and over. These visitors need to book their visit online before they arrive and get a QR code. City officials hope this system will help reduce pressure on the city's infrastructure and improve the experience for both locals and tourists. If visitors don't pay the fee and don't have a valid QR code, they could face a fine. This new rule is a way for Venice to try and balance its popularity as a tourist destination with the need to protect its unique environment.
