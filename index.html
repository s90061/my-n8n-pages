            <h1>Forward Command Post Halts Meetings, Focuses on Rescue Work for Heavy Rain</h1>
            <p>Due to stronger southwest winds, Tainan, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung cities had very heavy rain from early morning today. Many areas along the coast in Tainan City were flooded, and roads were closed. The Executive Yuan's disaster recovery center said that their recovery meetings for these two days are stopped. Instead, they will help different areas with rescue and relief work. They also reminded Tainan to check roofs covered with tarpaulins to see if they have fallen off again or are leaking because of the rain.</p>
            <p>Li Meng-yen, the deputy head of the center, said in a press release today that the southwest winds quickly formed late last night. It was hard to see them on radar. This is typical for southwest winds that form quickly and bring sudden, heavy rain. When it rains over 100 millimeters in one hour, it is usually too much for the current drainage systems.</p>
            <p>Li Meng-yen explained that Tainan City was hit by Typhoon Danas and later by heavy rain. About 26,000 homes were damaged, mostly their roofs. So, Tainan City government should pay special attention to whether temporary tarpaulin covers have come off again or are leaking due to continuous strong winds and heavy rain. They also need to check on and help older people who live alone.</p>
            <p>Li Meng-yen also said that if local areas need things like water pumps, help from the army, or supplies, the Tainan City government should tell the center right away. The center will work hard to help.</p>
            <p>The center stated that planned recovery meetings in Tainan's Liuying, Dongshan, Madou, Xiaying, and Liujia districts today, and Houbi and Baihe districts tomorrow, will be postponed. The center will focus completely on helping local areas with rescue and relief work.</p>

            <h1>Japan Finds First Fossil of New Sea Animal, Fourth in the World, Over 14 Million Years Old</h1>
            <p>(Tokyo, August 2nd, Central News Agency) A research team in Japan recently announced that they found the fossil of an extinct sea animal called "Neoparadoxia" for the first time in Japan. This animal is believed to have lived between 16 and 14 million years ago.</p>
            <p>Kyodo News reported that this team, which includes researchers from Okayama University of Science, re-examined fossils found in Hokkaido in the past. They found this result and published it in a science journal.</p>
            <p>The research team said that before this, fossils of this animal were only found on the west coast of the United States. This new discovery is the fourth time a fossil of this animal has been found in the world.</p>
            <p>This animal is thought to have been about 2.5 meters long. It is believed to have lived in shallow seas. However, we do not know much about how it lived. Some people think it looked like a rhinoceros or an elephant.</p>
            <p>The research team re-examined three skull fossils that were found in Akanko Town, Hokkaido (now Kushiro City), between 1996 and 2000. These fossils were previously thought to be from an ancient sea mammal called "Paleoparadoxia," which belongs to the same group of animals.</p>
            <p>But one of these fossils had strong, big bones. Because of this, it was confirmed to be a "Neoparadoxia," which is also in the same animal group.</p>

            <h1>Trump Criticizes Powell for Not Lowering Interest Rates, Asks Fed Board to Take Control</h1>
            <p>(Washington, August 1st, Central News Agency) Today, former U.S. President Donald Trump again criticized Jerome Powell, the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). Trump said Powell was "stubborn" because he would not lower short-term interest rates. Trump even asked the Fed's board members to take power from Powell.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that the Federal Reserve is the central bank of the U.S. Its job is to keep prices stable and help as many people as possible find jobs. This year, Powell has kept the Fed's main interest rate the same. He said that Fed officials need to see how Trump's big taxes on imported goods affect prices. Because of this, Trump has strongly criticized Powell for many months.</p>
            <p>Donald Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social," today that if Powell does not lower interest rates "a lot," then "the Fed board members should take control and do what everyone knows needs to be done!"</p>
            <p>The Federal Reserve has seven board members. Two of them, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, were chosen by Trump. At their meeting on July 30, the Fed decided not to change interest rates. But Waller and Bowman did not agree. They wanted to lower interest rates, even if it was less than what Trump wanted.</p>
            <p>Today, Waller and Bowman released a statement explaining that they believe the taxes on goods will only cause prices to go up once. However, they also think that the job market in the U.S. is likely becoming weaker.</p>
            <p>Trump praised what Waller and Bowman said and what he called their strong disagreement with the Fed's decision. But Trump has said in the past that the U.S. economy is doing very well.</p>
            <p>Later today, the Fed also announced that board member Adriana Kugler will leave next week. After this, Trump said that Powell should also leave.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote, "She (Kugler) knows he (Powell) was wrong about interest rates. He should quit too!"</p>
