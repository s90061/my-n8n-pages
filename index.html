The big event for the biotech industry, the 2025 Asian Biotech Conference, will be from July 23 to 27. Before the conference, there will be a press meeting on July 8. At this meeting, they will announce the winners of the "2025 Taiwan BIO Awards for Excellent Biotechnology Industry." The winning companies will also share their newest technologies and what's new in the industry this year.

The Asian Biotech Conference is organized by the Global Biotech Association and the Taiwan Bio Industry Development Association. The head of the Taiwan Bio Association, Liu Li-cheng, said in April that this year's main idea is "Finding New Chances in Asian Biotechnology." They hope to help the biotech industry grow more even when things are not stable around the world.

The conference will have almost 850 companies and about 2200 booths. This makes it the largest in Asia and one of the top three most important biotech shows in the world. There will be 14 special areas for things like medicine, medical tools, and cell therapy. Companies from 19 countries, like the USA, Japan, and Switzerland, will be there. This will help Taiwan's biotech industry find new international friends and business chances.

**Typhoon Danas is Coming, Yushan National Park's Special Area is Closed**

Typhoon Danas started early this morning. The weather office has now said there is a typhoon warning for the sea. Because of this, the Yushan National Park office has announced that starting at 8:30 AM today, no one can enter the special protection area of the park. If you had a permit to enter, it is now not valid.

The park office wants hikers who are in the park to quickly go to the exits and go down the mountain. They should tell their friends and family where they are. If you applied to enter the park and have already left, please tell them you are out. As of 11 AM today, 169 groups (587 people) had applied to enter. 44 groups (144 people) decided not to go up after being told about the typhoon. They are still trying to reach 17 groups (60 people) who entered and have not checked in. Other groups have either gone down the mountain or are on their way down, and some are staying in safe places.

The park will stay closed until the typhoon warning is over and they can check if everything is safe again. Also, a talk about culture and nature that was planned for July 5th and 6th in the southern part of the park has been moved to a later date. Visitors should leave the mountains early, be careful of falling rocks, and drive safely.

**Typhoon Danas is Near, Wuling Farm to Close from Noon on July 6th**

Wuling Farm announced today that it will close at 12:00 PM (noon) on July 6th. This decision is made because of a message from the Veterans Affairs Council and the newest information about Typhoon Danas. The farm will close as a safety measure. Visitors should not go to the mountain. The farm will announce when it will open again after checking the weather and road conditions.

Right now, the weather at the farm is good, and the roads leading to it are open. But the farm decided to close because there could be strong winds, falling rocks, or closed roads during the typhoon. The farm has already started getting ready for the typhoon.

While the farm is closed, they will not let visitors in. If you have plans to visit, please check the farm's official website and social media for updates. If you have already booked a room or an activity, the farm will contact you to help you with your booking.
