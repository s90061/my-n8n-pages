            <h1>New Taiwan Dollar Falls Below 30.6; Early Morning Drop Does Not Grow</h1>
            <p>During the national holiday, China put limits on exporting rare earth minerals. In response, the United States said it would greatly increase taxes on Chinese goods. Because of these bad changes, Taiwan's stock market and currency both went down today. The Taiwan stock market dropped more than 800 points when it opened. The New Taiwan Dollar also fell below 30.6 against the US dollar.</p>
            <p>China's decision to control rare earth exports made US President Trump say that Beijing was acting in an unfriendly way regarding trade. He then announced that from November, new taxes of 100% would be added to goods from China. This caused the US stock market to fall sharply on the 10th.</p>
            <p>The US stock market fell a lot during the holiday, which caused many people to sell their stocks. Today, the Taiwan stock market dropped over 800 points at the start of trading. The New Taiwan Dollar also went down. This morning, it started at 30.57 and quickly fell below 30.6. It reached a low of 30.62, losing 0.075. But the drop did not get worse.</p>
            <p>People who work with money said that the market was worried about the trade war between the US and China getting worse. This bad news could cause problems for both Taiwan's stocks and its currency. However, President Trump posted a message early in the morning saying that the US wants to help China, not hurt it. This seemed to make him sound less strict. This helped calm the sad feelings in the market. Financial markets might correct themselves now, but people are not too worried.</p>

            <h1>80-Year-Old Finishes Hawaii Ironman; Grabow Sets Record for Oldest Woman</h1>
            <p>Today, an 80-year-old American athlete, Natalie Grabow, made a new record in Kona, Hawaii. She became the oldest woman to finish the Ironman World Championship. She showed everyone that age is just a number.</p>
            <p>According to Reuters, Grabow, who is from New Jersey, took part in this race for the tenth time. She finished a 3.8-kilometer swim, a 180-kilometer bike ride, and a 42-kilometer marathon. Her total time was 16 hours, 45 minutes, and 26 seconds. This won her first place in the women's 80-84 age group at the Ironman World Championship.</p>
            <p>Grabow started doing triathlons when she was in her sixties, but she had run for many years before that. This year, she finished the Maryland race in 15 hours and 53 minutes. This allowed her to enter the World Championship. She was also the first woman in history to finish in the 75-79 age group.</p>
            <p>Before today's race in Kona, Grabow said: "Everyone who plays sports wants to win and be the best, but the journey itself is more important."</p>
            <p>"If you compete in an age group, few people will remember your exact place. But they will remember your positive attitude, your smile, and how hard you tried. I am very lucky to be in this race, so I compete with a thankful heart."</p>
            <p>Her coach, Michelle Lake, said that Grabow is "strong" and "disciplined." She praised Grabow for training well. "She is very driven. She not only competes with other athletes her age, but she also looks at how men in her group perform and tries to do better than them."</p>
            <p>Natalie Grabow, at 80 years old, broke the record for the oldest woman to finish the Ironman. The previous record was set by Cherie Gruenfeld, a member of the Ironman Hall of Fame, when she was 78.</p>
            <p>The event organizers praised Grabow's achievement, calling her a "symbol of endurance." They posted on social media, honoring her with the phrase, "Age is just a number."</p>
            <p>In the professional women's group, Solveig Lovseth from Norway won first place with a time of 8 hours, 28 minutes, and 27 seconds. Kat Matthews from the UK came in second. Laura Philipp from Germany, who won in 2024, finished third. The men's race already happened in September.</p>
            <p>This year, more than 1700 athletes in different age groups finished the race in very hot and humid weather, pushing their limits.</p>
