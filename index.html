On July 4th, American tennis player Madison Keys, who won the Australian Open this year, unexpectedly lost her match at Wimbledon. She was defeated by Laura Siegemund from Germany in the third round. Keys is the latest well-known player to be eliminated surprisingly early in this year's Wimbledon tournament.

According to AFP, Siegemund beat Keys 6-3, 6-3. This was a big surprise. Keys is the Australian Open champion from this year and is ranked 8th in the world. She was the 6th seed at Wimbledon. Siegemund, on the other hand, is ranked 104th in the world.

Many top players in the women's singles have already been knocked out of Wimbledon this year. These include Coco Gauff (2nd seed), Jessica Pegula (3rd seed), Jasmine Paolini from Italy (4th seed), and Zheng Qinwen (5th seed). The number one seed in the women's singles, Aryna Sabalenka from Belarus, is still playing in the tournament.

**Netizen Posts Threats; Jiang Chi-chen Condemns Violence and Reports to Police**

On July 4th, a netizen posted threats against Jiang Chi-chen, the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, on Facebook. Jiang Chi-chen said today that he has reported this to the police and strongly spoke against the violent threats. He said that the recent recall movements have caused more conflict in society, and now there are even violent threats. This makes people very worried and uncomfortable, as it is no longer the Taiwan society everyone knows.

A netizen posted in a Facebook group called "Professor Tsai Ting-kuei - Free Taiwan Party (Liberty Party) Support Group," saying things like "Jiang Chi-chen will be beheaded in public soon." Jiang Chi-chen said in a press release today that he has reported the issue to the police. He strongly spoke against the threats of violence. He respects freedom of speech but will not allow any violent threats.

Jiang Chi-chen stated that yesterday, in a Facebook group named "Professor Tsai Ting-kuei - Free Taiwan Party (Liberty Party) Support Group," a post was openly shared threatening to "behead Jiang Chi-chen in public." There were also rude and untrue posts that defamed him. He said this goes too far beyond the limits of free speech, and Taiwan will not allow violent threats.

Jiang Chi-chen pointed out that these actions may be crimes under Article 305 of the Criminal Code (threats) and Article 310 (defamation). Also, under Article 104 of the Public Officials Election and Recall Act, it is a crime to try to get someone recalled. He asked the police to investigate quickly and hoped that everyone would stay calm and respect different political views.

Jiang Chi-chen said that the ongoing recall efforts have made society more divided and hateful. Verbal violence has made the gap in society wider. Now, there are even violent threats against the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan. This makes him very worried and uneasy, as he feels this is no longer the Taiwan society everyone knew.

Jiang Chi-chen stated that he fully respects freedom of speech and citizens' basic rights under the constitution. However, he will not tolerate or allow open threats to personal safety. He also asked President Lai Ching-te, "Is this what you mean by national unity? Is this what you call precious citizen power?"
