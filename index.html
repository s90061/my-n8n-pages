            <h1>Trump and Putin Meet: Red Carpet Welcome and Military Planes Fly Over</h1>
            <p>On August 15, the presidents of the United States, Donald Trump, and Russia, Vladimir Putin, met in Alaska. This meeting might decide if the war between Russia and Ukraine can stop. When they walked on the red carpet, American military planes flew loudly above them.</p>
            <p>Before the meeting, Trump and Putin smiled and shook hands on the red carpet. This happened at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska. Several American military planes, like a B2 stealth bomber, flew in a group over them. News from Reuters and the New York Times reported this.</p>
            <p>This was the first time the two leaders met since 2019. They sat with their teams for photos and did not speak. Behind them, a blue sign said "Pursuing Peace."</p>
            <p>BBC News reported that during the private meeting, talks were held in a "three-on-three" format. This means that each president from Russia and Ukraine had two helpers with them.</p>
            <p>With Trump were Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special representative Steve Witkoff.</p>
            <p>With Putin were Russian officials Yury Ushakov, who advises on foreign policy, and Sergei Lavrov, the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p>A European official told CNN that it was good that Trump and Putin did not meet alone anymore. The official said this was "perhaps a comforting step forward."</p>
            <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that in bigger talks later, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and Chief of Staff Susie Wiles would also join.</p>
