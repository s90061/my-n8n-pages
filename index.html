            <h1>Bora Pharmaceuticals' CDMO Business Grows, Half-Year Earnings Per Share Reach NT$19.5</h1>
            <p>Bora Pharmaceuticals announced its financial report for the first half of the year. Its revenue was NT$9.347 billion. Because its CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) business grew, the net profit for the company's owners was NT$2.016 billion. This is an increase of 11.9% compared to last year. The earnings per share (EPS) was NT$19.5, which is almost NT$20.</p>
            <p>Bora stated in a press release today that its CDMO business grew by 69.5% in the first half of this year, reaching over NT$5.01 billion. This growth includes internal orders and is due to more production capacity and new types of medicines. However, during a period of combining businesses, there were delays in production at the sterile injection factory in Maryland, USA, and the Zhunan factory in Taiwan. This slowed down their progress. But this problem got better in June, and delayed orders will be filled soon. The company has a good outlook for orders and strong demand for a long time.</p>
            <p>Bora said that they are continuing to invest more in their CDMO business around the world. Their factory in Canada recently added a new production line for high-performance skin medicines. This will help them produce these orders faster, in larger amounts, and more flexibly. This is one reason for the growth of the Canadian factory.</p>
            <p>The Flex-Pro sterile injection production line in Maryland, USA, is expected to start working in the third quarter of this year. The AST isolated filling system's automatic line will start working in 2026. Also, in the first half of this year, clinical-stage clients at the Maple Grove factory in Minnesota, USA, became stronger, long-term partners. Many pharmaceutical companies have started signing agreements because they want to use the benefits of making products locally in the USA.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheng Pao-hsi, the chairman of Bora, said that the CDMO business has gained 8 new clients this year. Most of these new clients are handled by the Maple Grove factory, which focuses on local manufacturing in North America. This year, the value of new orders received is US$138 million. These new orders are mainly for the Canadian factory and sterile medicine factories. For large molecule CDMO, the San Diego factory, which was part of the integration after the merger with TaiFu Biologics, has started operations. The project to increase production by 2000 liters has led many American late-stage drug development companies to ask about it.</p>
