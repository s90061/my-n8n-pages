The Central Bank of China has a new rule to stop money laundering. Starting August 1st, if you buy gold or diamonds with cash and the amount is more than 100,000 Chinese Yuan (about 400,000 Taiwan Dollars) in one go or in a day, the seller must tell the government. This rule is made to stop illegal money activities.

The new rules, called "Measures for the Administration of Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing by Precious Metals and Gemstone Dealers," will help prevent and stop money laundering and related crimes. Businesses selling precious metals and gems must follow these rules. They need to know their customers well if a cash deal for gold or diamonds is 100,000 Yuan or more.

If a customer pays 100,000 Yuan or more in cash in one go or over a day, the business must check the customer's information. This check depends on the customer's background, the type of the deal, and how risky it is for money laundering. Businesses must send a report about big cash deals to China's Anti-Money Laundering Monitoring and Analysis Center within five working days. They also need to keep customer information and deal records for at least 10 years. If they see any suspicious deals, they must report them quickly, no matter the amount.
