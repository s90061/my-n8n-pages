            <h1>Taiwan Still Needs to Win Against Germany in U18 World Cup; Left-Hander Chung Yi-en Will Start Again</h1>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup happens every two years. The top three teams from the Asian Youth Baseball Championship the year before get to join the U18 World Cup from the Asia-Pacific region. Taiwan won against strong rival Japan in the last Asian Youth Championship. This helped them get a spot in the U18 World Cup again. Taiwan has made it to the championship game in the past three tournaments. This year, they hope to win again after 2019 and take home their fourth U18 championship trophy.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan team for the U18 Baseball World Cup has already made it to the Super Round. However, they still need to win their last game in the preliminary round against Germany tomorrow. Left-handed pitcher Chung Yi-en will start this game. Germany's starting pitcher will be left-hander Tom Apfelbaum. Taiwan's hitters will need to find a way to get hits against a left-handed pitcher.</p>
            <p>The U18 Baseball World Cup is taking place in Okinawa, Japan. Taiwan won their first game in Group B against China, then lost to the USA. Yesterday, they beat Panama. Today, they played well in both pitching and hitting to win against Australia. This means Taiwan has won 3 games and lost 1 in the preliminary round. They have already secured their spot in the Super Round.</p>
            <p>Even though the Taiwan team has already made it to the next stage, their last preliminary game against Germany tomorrow at 5:30 PM is still important. The result of this game will affect their record in the Super Round, so they must try their best to win.</p>
            <p>Taiwan will have Chung Yi-en, a left-handed pitcher, start the game. He was chosen in the first round of this year's professional baseball draft by the Rakuten Monkeys team. Chung Yi-en also started the first preliminary game against China. He pitched for 4 innings, only allowed 1 hit, struck out 8 batters, and walked 3, giving up no runs. He showed strong pitching skills and got the win. Tomorrow, he will be a key pitcher again.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's hitters need to improve their hitting. In their first three preliminary games, the opposing teams all used left-handed starting pitchers. Taiwan's hitters did not do very well against left-handed pitchers. Germany's starting pitcher tomorrow will be left-hander Tom Apfelbaum.</p>
            <p>Apfelbaum started the game against Australia on September 5th. He pitched for 2 innings, allowed 2 hits, struck out 3 batters, and walked 2. He gave up 2 earned runs, but the game result was not his fault.</p>

            <h1>Taiwan Bank and 8 Other Banks Work Together to Make Gold Digital; First Test Expected by End of Year</h1>
            <p>Taiwan Bank has announced a new project. It is called the "Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization Technology Application for Precious Metals Business Across Banks." This project is about making real-world assets like gold into digital tokens. Taiwan Bank will work with 8 other banks, including Land Bank and Hua Nan Bank. Together, they will explore new ways to use blockchain technology for precious metals. They plan to finish the first test results by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>Today, Taiwan Bank sent out a press release. It said that Taiwan's financial industry is taking a big step forward with the global trend of making real-world assets digital. On August 22, Taiwan Bank officially started the "Precious Metals Business RWA Tokenization Technology Interbank Application Joint Verification" project. This is a big project for local banks to test making precious metals into digital tokens.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank explained that they suggested this project. They are working with 8 other banks: Land Bank, Hua Nan Bank, Chang Hwa Bank, Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, Taiwan Business Bank, E.SUN Bank, CTBC Bank, and LINE Bank. They are using a special program called the FinTechSpace joint self-verification system. This lets them explore new ways to use blockchain technology in the precious metals business.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank also said that many international projects focus on making digital financial assets into tokens. But their project is different because it uses real gold as the main topic. They are especially looking at how to use smart contracts to deliver physical assets between different banks. They want to improve customer service, make things more efficient, and lower costs. They are also thinking about how to combine physical bank services with token technology.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank pointed out that the 9 banks in the project have more than a hundred experts. These experts come from different departments like business, legal rules, digital finance, information technology, and cybersecurity. This shows how much importance these banks place on new financial technology.</p>
            <p>Yang Tien-li, manager of Taiwan Bank's Precious Metals Department, said that this test uses a two-layer system. For transactions between banks, they will use alliance chain tokens for settling accounts. For customers, they will still use gold passbook accounts to buy and sell. They will test if this system works in a fake environment for things like withdrawing gold from different banks.</p>
            <p>Yang Tien-li stressed that smart contracts can automatically follow transaction rules. This will make it easier and faster for banks to settle accounts. It will also create many new possibilities for precious metals business. It will lead to new ways of decentralized financial services. In the future, people who own gold tokens might not only keep them for their value but also earn extra money through new methods like "liquidity staking." This will create more types of value.</p>
            <p>Lu Chien-chih, director of Taiwan Bank's Innovation Lab, said that the project will get technical help from BSOS (Wangu Technology), a blockchain company. They will look deeply into how to manage the whole process of making tokens. This includes creating, transferring, taking out, and destroying tokens. The experience they gain from this project with many banks will help create industry standards and best practices. This will build a strong base for Taiwan's financial industry to grow in the world of virtual assets.</p>
            <p>Taiwan Bank said that the first results of this project are expected by the end of this year. They will then suggest specific ways to create tokens, business models, and other ideas. These suggestions can help the government make new rules. This project with many banks is not just a test of new technology. It is also an important step for Taiwan's financial industry to become more digital and international. They hope to make Taiwan an important center for new digital asset ideas in the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

            <h1>Reuters: More Competition Makes Tesla's Share of US Market Drop to Nearly 8-Year Low</h1>
            <p>According to information given to Reuters by Cox Automotive, a company that studies car markets, Tesla's share of the US market went down in August. This is the lowest it has been in almost 8 years. More and more customers are choosing electric cars from new competing companies.</p>
            <p>Experts believe that sales of electric cars in the US will keep growing until September. After that, sales might go down because a federal tax discount for buying cars will end this month. This will put more financial pressure on Tesla and other car companies.</p>
            <p>Early information from Cox Automotive shows that Tesla used to have more than 80% of the US electric car market. However, in August this year, Tesla only sold 38% of all electric cars in the US. This is the first time since October 2017 that their sales share has been less than 40%.</p>
            <p>While other car companies are making new electric cars, Tesla is focusing on making self-driving taxis (robotaxis) and human-like robots. Tesla has even put off or canceled plans to make cheaper electric cars.</p>
            <p>Tesla's value as a company depends on these big bets. On September 5th, the company's board suggested a huge pay plan worth a trillion dollars for CEO Elon Musk. This plan is linked to the company's value growing to 8.5 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, along with other goals.</p>
            <p>Until now, making and selling cars has been Tesla's main way to earn money. Their newest car is the Cybertruck, an electric pickup truck, which came out in 2023. But its sales are much lower than the Model 3 sedan or the Model Y SUV. Tesla also made small changes to its popular Model Y car, but these changes were not as good as expected. Tesla's sales are expected to drop for the second year in a row.</p>
            <p>Stephanie Valdez Streaty, an analyst at Cox Automotive, told Reuters, "I know they see themselves as a robot and artificial intelligence (AI) company. But when you are still a car company and you don't release new products, your market share will naturally start to go down."</p>
            <p>Elon Musk's right-wing political views and his relationship with former US President Donald Trump have also affected the brand's image. This year, Musk helped Trump with a plan to make the federal government smaller. But in May, Musk left the government team, and his relationship with Trump changed.</p>
            <p>According to early data, Tesla's sales growth slowed to 3.1% in August. In the same period, the overall market grew by 14%.</p>
