Chinese company ByteDance's short video app TikTok faces a "sell or ban" rule in the United States. The deadline has been extended three times. US President Trump said in an interview today that he has found buyers for TikTok. He said the buyers are a group of "very rich people."
Trump spoke with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News Channel's "Sunday Morning Futures." He stated, "We have found buyers for TikTok."
He also added, "I think I might need approval from China, and I believe President Xi Jinping might give it. (The buyers) are a group of very rich people."
Reports say Trump did not share more details about the buyers. However, he said he would announce the buyers in about two weeks.
A US law requires TikTok to be sold or it will be banned in the US. This law is based on national security concerns. It was supposed to start the day before Trump took office in January this year.
When Trump took office, he first announced that the "sell or ban" deadline for TikTok in the US would be extended by 75 days. Then, it was extended a second time to June 19. Earlier this month, the deadline was extended again.

**China Announces Conditional Resumption of Imports of Some Japanese Aquatic Products, Excluding 10 Prefectures Including Fukushima**

China's customs office announced tonight that it will restart importing some aquatic products from Japan. This decision comes after continuous international monitoring of the Fukushima nuclear wastewater discharge. China also did its own tests, and the results were normal. The Japanese government also promised that the quality of aquatic products sent to China would be safe. However, products from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo, are still not allowed.
The 10 Japanese prefectures whose aquatic products are still banned are Fukushima, Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Niigata, Nagano, Saitama, Chiba, and Tokyo. With this new announcement, China's customs office has canceled its 2023 ban on Japanese aquatic products.
The Chinese customs office stated that China made this decision based on these rules, its food safety laws, and the WTO's agreement on health and plant safety measures. They decided to allow imports of some aquatic products (including edible aquatic animals) from certain parts of Japan, but with conditions.
The announcement said that Japanese companies sending aquatic products to China must follow China's rules for foreign food producers. Companies that were stopped from importing must apply again to be registered in China. Only products made after they are registered can be sent to China. Also, farms and packaging companies for edible aquatic animals must apply again to be registered in China. They can only start trading with China after they are registered.
The announcement also said that when importing Japanese aquatic products, companies must provide a health certificate from the Japanese government, a certificate showing no radioactive substances, and a certificate showing where the product came from. China's customs will carefully check Japanese aquatic products. If they find that products do not meet China's laws and food safety standards, or if Japan "fails to properly do its job," China will take action quickly.

**China Conditionally Resumes Import of Japanese Aquatic Products, Excluding 10 Prefectures Including Fukushima and Tokyo**

China's customs office announced today that it will allow some aquatic products from Japan to be imported again. However, products from 10 prefectures, including Fukushima and Tokyo, are still not allowed.
The Asahi Shimbun reported that according to China's customs announcement, Japanese companies can start exporting aquatic products to China again after they complete registration procedures with China. When exporting, they must provide a health certificate from the Japanese government, a certificate showing no radioactive materials, and a certificate of origin.
The 10 prefectures that are still banned from importing are Fukushima, Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Niigata, Nagano, Saitama, Tokyo, and Chiba.
China had completely stopped importing Japanese aquatic products in August 2023 because of the discharge of treated nuclear water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Last September, China and Japan agreed to ease the ban. Japan said that both sides agreed on the conditions for restarting imports of Japanese aquatic products at the end of May.
