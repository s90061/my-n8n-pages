**Large Chinese Tugboat Enters Taiwan's Waters**

A large Chinese tugboat named "Lian He Hai Gong 5001" was seen in Taiwan's territorial waters. It is unclear what the vessel was towing or why it was there. The Hengchun Coast Guard reported that they could not receive the ship's signal. An alert from Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) suggested the tugboat's purpose was unknown. There are concerns that it could be carrying military equipment or engaging in disruptive activities, such as damaging underwater cables. This has led to calls for close monitoring and interception of the vessel.
