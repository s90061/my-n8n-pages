            <h1>President Lai's National Day Speech: 3 Strategies for Competition and "Taiwan's Shield" for Defense</h1>
            <p>The Double Tenth National Day celebration happened on October 10th. This year, the Ministry of National Defense's band played a song from last year's World Baseball WBSC Premier12. Teams like the Little League World Series champions rode in special "hero" cars. Also, five "Brave Eagle" advanced jet trainers from the Air Force Thunder Tiger team flew over the Presidential Office, spraying colored smoke.</p>
            <p>President Lai Ching-te gave a speech. He said that "democratic Taiwan," which was built with much effort, is the clear identity for 23 million people in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu. Taiwan is like a light of democracy in Asia, always giving hope to everyone living under strict rule.</p>
            <p>President Lai stated that to keep Taiwan strong in competition, the government will use three main plans. These include investing more, working closely with other countries on trade, and building strong industries. Taiwan wants to become one of the top five computing centers in the world.</p>
            <p>Also, next year, Taiwan's defense budget will be more than 3% of its GDP, and by 2030, it will reach 5%. The increase in defense spending has three main goals. One goal is to quickly build "Taiwan's Shield" (T-Dome). This system will create a strong air defense for Taiwan with different layers, good detection, and effective interception.</p>

            <h1>China Limits Rare Earth Exports; Trump Announces 100% Tariffs Starting November</h1>
            <p>U.S. President Donald Trump said today that he will add a 100% tariff on Chinese goods starting November 1st. This is because China has put "very strong" controls on exporting rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Trump stated that these extra tariffs and new export rules for "all important software" will begin on November 1st. This is to get back at what he called Beijing's "very strong" actions.</p>
            <p>He wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," "It's hard to believe China would do such a thing, but they did. The results are clear."</p>
            <p>Hours before, Trump made a surprise post threatening to raise tariffs on China. In that post, he said China had sent letters to many countries around the world, explaining its export controls on rare earth minerals.</p>
            <p>Currently, Chinese goods have a 30% tariff from the U.S. Trump put these tariffs in place because Beijing did not stop the illegal trade of the drug fentanyl and for unfair trade practices.</p>
            <p>In return, China currently has a 10% tariff on U.S. goods.</p>
