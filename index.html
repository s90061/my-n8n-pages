            <h1>Global Oil Prices Go Down as Market Worries About Too Much Oil</h1>
            <p>Today, global oil prices went down. This happened because people in the market were worried that there was too much oil available. This worry was stronger than the generally positive feeling in the money markets.</p>
            <p>In New York, the price for West Texas Intermediate crude oil for November went down by 0.7%. It closed at $58.27 for one barrel.</p>
            <p>In London, the price for Brent crude oil from the North Sea for December went down by 0.8%. It closed at $61.91 for one barrel.</p>

            <h1>Trump Considers Sending Soldiers to Attack Drug Groups in Venezuela</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Trump said he is thinking about sending soldiers to attack drug groups in Venezuela. Before this, the US had already attacked Venezuelan ships suspected of carrying drugs many times, which caused deaths.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that a reporter asked Trump in the White House if he would consider a ground attack. Trump answered, "We are indeed considering ground actions now because we already control the situation at sea."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump also confirmed a report from The New York Times today. The report said he allowed the CIA to do secret operations in Venezuela.</p>
            <p>The New York Times was the first to report this news. The information came from US officials who knew about the secret order.</p>

            <h1>Is India Changing Its Foreign Policy? Trump Says Modi Promised to Stop Buying Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>Today, US President Donald Trump said that India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi told him India would stop buying oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump told reporters at an event in the White House, "I was unhappy that India was buying Russian oil. But today, Modi promised me that they will not buy oil from Russia anymore. This is a big step forward. Next, we will make China do the same thing."</p>
            <p>In recent years, the US and India have made their relationship stronger. This happened even during Trump's first time as president. Both countries were worried about China becoming more powerful.</p>
            <p>However, after Trump returned to the White House, the future of the US and India working together against China became unclear. This was because India did not stop buying Russian oil, and Trump put high taxes on Indian goods.</p>
            <p>Reuters said that the war between Russia and Ukraine is still happening. Washington is trying harder to reduce the money Russia gets from selling oil. If India truly promises to stop buying Russian oil, it could be a very important moment for global energy policy.</p>
