**New Taipei Helps Ocean Life: 3,000 Corals Restored in Gongliao**

New Taipei City's Fisheries Department said today that coral reefs are very important for the Earth's environment. They provide homes, food, and safe places for sea animals. In Aohua Bay, Gongliao, they have grown 3,000 new corals. 80% of these corals are alive, creating a good home for them.

Chen Xi-hui, the head of the city's agriculture department, said at a meeting today that keeping ocean resources healthy means focusing on "production, ecology, and living." New Taipei has protected areas for sea animals and plants. It is also the first city to make fishermen register their fishing nets by name to prevent harm to the environment.

Since 2019, the city has been working on a plan to restore nature. They are working with National Taiwan Ocean University and the Taiwan Shan Hai Angel Association to grow corals again.
