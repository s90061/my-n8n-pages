The Ministry of Education in Taiwan has changed its list of recognized universities in mainland China for the first time in ten years. Jinan University in Guangzhou is no longer on the list. The list now includes 154 universities and 191 colleges.

Taiwan's Minister of Education, Cheng English-Yao, said earlier this year that schools controlled by China's United Front Work Department are not truly academic. He believes it is important to stop working with them, and Taiwan will no longer recognize their degrees.

The Ministry of Education officially removed Guangzhou Jinan University from its list. They stated that Jinan University has been under the control of China's United Front Work Department since 2019. To make sure Taiwanese students learn in a normal academic environment, they decided to remove the university.

The Ministry of Education also repeated that exchanges between Taiwan and China should be fair and respectful. Schools that arrange trips for students to China should follow Taiwan's rules. They should be careful about invitations from China and check the purpose, organizers, and materials of any event. They should avoid anything with a political aim or political messages, and not accept one-sided offers or help with China's political plans.

The Ministry also said that if schools are unsure about event organizers or plans, they can ask the Mainland Affairs Council or the Ministry of Education for clarification. Taiwan still hopes for exchanges between young people from both sides to learn and understand each other. However, they also reminded everyone to be aware of risks during exchanges and check the background of organizers to avoid political goals.
