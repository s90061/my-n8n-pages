            <h1>Global Talks on Plastic Pollution Treaty Extended to August 15th, Hope to Solve Disagreements</h1>
            <p>Talks to create the world's first strong, legally binding agreement against plastic pollution went into extra time today. The meeting will continue tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Countries were supposed to finish their last day of talks at the United Nations office in Geneva. They were trying to agree on how strict future rules should be.</p>
            <p>But with only 30 minutes left until the meeting was supposed to end, the head of the International Negotiating Committee, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, told the representatives that talks would continue tomorrow.</p>
            <p>Before ending the meeting, Valdivieso said, "Our discussions on the updated draft are still happening. So, this full meeting will continue and start again on August 15, 2025. The exact time will be announced later."</p>
            <p>The International Negotiating Committee was started by the UN Environment Assembly (UNEA) in 2022. Its job is to create a legally binding global agreement to stop plastic pollution.</p>
            <p>Plastic pollution is everywhere. Tiny pieces of plastic have been found on the highest mountains, in the deepest oceans, and in almost every part of the human body.</p>
            <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says that if nothing changes, the yearly production of plastic from fossil fuels will almost triple by 2060, reaching 1.2 billion tons. Plastic waste will be more than 1 billion tons. This will harm the oceans, affect health, and make climate change worse.</p>
            <p>Countries like Panama, Kenya, the UK, and the European Union (EU) were unhappy. This is because important parts of the draft treaty about the whole life of plastic (from making it to throwing it away) and its harm to health were removed.</p>
            <p>Countries that produce oil do not want limits on making new plastics from oil, coal, and natural gas. Other countries want these limits and stronger rules for plastic products and dangerous chemicals.</p>
            <p>Jessika Roswall, an EU Environment Commissioner, said that a "weak, stiff agreement will not help anyone."</p>
            <p>She said in a statement, "An agreement that covers the whole life of plastic and can improve with new scientific discoveries is a very important step... The next few hours will show if we can use this chance."</p>

            <h1>During WWII, Taiwanese Soldiers and Filipino-Chinese People Helped Each Other in the Philippines</h1>
            <p>During World War II, the Japanese army entered the Philippines. Many Taiwanese people were forced to join the Japanese army. At first, they fought, but later they worked as laborers. They left their mark in a foreign land. Some Taiwanese soldiers also became good friends with overseas Chinese people in the Philippines because they helped each other.</p>
            <p>After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese army began to attack the Philippines. On December 10, 1941, the 48th Division of the Japanese army landed in many places on Luzon Island. This was before the big Japanese attack on December 22.</p>
            <p>Anthony Feredo, a historian of World War II in the Philippines, said that two groups from the Japanese 48th Division were made up of Taiwanese soldiers led by Japanese officers. They were called the 1st Formosa Regiment and the 2nd Formosa Regiment.</p>
            <p>Feredo, who has written several books about World War II, said that the Philippines was a very important place. The Japanese army used it as a stepping stone to attack Southeast Asia and other Pacific islands. They gathered soldiers, helped injured soldiers rest, and got food, fuel, and minerals in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>In the same way, when the American army fought back, they also used the Philippines as an important base. They kept as many as 300,000 Japanese soldiers in the Philippines so they could not go back to Japan to fight.</p>
            <p>Feredo said, based on old records, that on December 26 of that year, the American army lost and said Manila was an "open city," meaning it would not be defended. Taiwanese soldiers were among the first Japanese troops to enter Manila. In the Chinese area, people heard Japanese soldiers speaking Chinese to Chinese residents, or looking for Chinese guerrilla members who might have helped against Japan.</p>
            <p>The Japanese 48th Division left Luzon Island in January 1942. They then went to Indonesia to fight Dutch troops and did not take part in the fierce battle of Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Later in the war, most Taiwanese people sent to the Philippines were laborers. They worked as farm workers, loaders, and dock workers to support the Japanese army. But a few Taiwanese soldiers still fought. For example, in November and December 1944, Japanese paratroopers fought their last paratrooper battle with the American army on Leyte Island. The main fighters were the "Takasago Volunteer Unit," made up of Taiwanese indigenous people.</p>
            <p>Feredo said that after the Filipino and American forces fought back, the Japanese soldiers lost and ran into the mountains. Many Taiwanese-Japanese soldiers were left behind and surrendered. For example, at the Manila port, there were at least 150. In southern Luzon Island, there were about 200 to 300.</p>
            <p>He said that during the war, soldiers had no choice. Historical documents do not say that Filipinos hated Taiwanese-Japanese soldiers. Instead, they felt sorry for them. This is because some Taiwanese people who worked for the Japanese army were killed by the Japanese army, either because there was not enough food or because they got sick.</p>
            <p>When asked about the lessons from the war, Feredo said that war seems exciting when you read about it in books, but real war is very different. Countries should solve their disagreements through talking.</p>
            <p>He said, "I had two uncles who fought in the war. Only one survived. Although he sometimes didn't want to admit it, in the last days of his life, I could see the trauma of the war in his eyes."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a reporter spoke to overseas Chinese in Manila who lived through World War II years ago. They said that a Taiwanese-Japanese soldier once caught a Chinese person giving out anti-Japanese flyers. The soldier only whispered, "Aren't you afraid of dying?" and then told him to leave quickly.</p>
            <p>Zhuang Zhendang, the deceased secretary-general of the "Filipino-Chinese Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army," once told CNA that after the Japanese army lost, they planned to retreat. Some Taiwanese soldiers were left behind. Filipino guerrilla groups searched for and killed the remaining Japanese soldiers. Taiwanese soldiers also became targets.</p>
            <p>He said that luckily, Taiwanese soldiers often secretly helped Chinese people who were arrested by the Japanese army because they spoke the same language. For example, they stopped the Japanese army from hurting them and took care of them in prison. So, after the war, Chinese anti-Japanese groups took in Taiwanese soldiers, over 70 of them, and helped them return to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>He said that because of this friendship, many Taiwanese soldiers kept writing letters to their Filipino-Chinese friends after returning to Taiwan.</p>

            <h1>More Trucks on Roads for Ghost Festival: Keep Distance from Big Vehicles on Highways</h1>
            <p>The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) said today that more goods are being transported because of the Ghost Festival in the seventh lunar month. Big vehicles are large and heavy, so they are not as easy to control as small cars. The DGH reminds drivers of small cars to keep a safe distance from big vehicles when driving on national highways.</p>
            <p>It is now the middle of the sixth lunar month. As the Ghost Festival in the seventh lunar month gets closer, more goods need to be moved. The Ministry of Transportation and Communications' Freeway Bureau (DGH) has shared a press release. It tells drivers of small cars three ways to drive safely when they are near big vehicles on highways.</p>
            <p>The DGH advises drivers not to drive between two big vehicles. If you are in this situation, you should keep a good distance from the cars in front and behind you. Also, change lanes quickly to move away from the big vehicles. If there is a lot of traffic and you cannot move away, you can turn on your hazard lights to tell the big vehicle behind you to keep its distance.</p>
            <p>If a big vehicle is following closely behind you, the DGH suggests speeding up to create more space or changing to another lane. This will lower the chance of being hit from behind.</p>
            <p>If a big vehicle is in front of you, the DGH says you should keep a longer distance. This is because your view can be blocked. A longer distance gives you enough time to react if something sudden happens.</p>
