            <h1>British Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate to 4%; Decision Makers Disagree</h1>
            <p>The Bank of England's committee for money rules decided today to lower a main interest rate to 4%. This decision was made with 5 votes for and 4 votes against. Four members of the committee wanted to keep the rate the same because they were worried that prices were going up too much.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the committee had to vote a second time. This was because they could not agree in the first vote. It was the first time they ever needed a second vote.</p>
            <p>The committee found it hard to agree on what to do about rising prices and more people losing their jobs. The central bank thinks that prices might soon go up twice as much as their goal of 2%.</p>
            <p>In the first vote, four members wanted to lower the rate by a small amount. Four other members wanted to keep it the same. One member, Alan Taylor, wanted to lower it by a bigger amount, 0.5 percent.</p>
            <p>In the second vote, the head of the central bank, Andrew Bailey, and four other members voted to lower the main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%. This passed by one vote (5 to 4).</p>
            <p>Some members wanted to keep the interest rate at 4.25%. These included Clare Lombardelli, the bank's deputy head for money rules, who voted differently from most for the first time. Huw Pill, the bank's main economist, also voted this way.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England also said again that it will lower borrowing costs slowly and carefully. But they also gave a hint about the future, suggesting that they might stop lowering rates soon.</p>
            <p>The Bank of England said that because they lowered the main interest rate, their money policy is now less strict. This means they are not saying the policy is still strict. They also said again that they do not have a set plan for future borrowing costs.</p>

            <h1>80th Anniversary of End of WWII: Chen Yi-shen says US adopted "undetermined status of Taiwan" after Korean War</h1>
            <p>This year is 80 years since World War II ended. Today, a scholar named Li Jun-shan said, based on old records, that the United States once saw Taiwan as "an island with no owner." Chiang Kai-shek dealt with the question of who owned Taiwan by "waiting for changes." This is why the situation in the Taiwan Strait is still unclear today. Chen Yi-shen, who is the head of the Academia Historica, explained that after the Korean War, the US decided that Taiwan's status was "undecided." He said this was almost a basic rule for the US, not just a plan.</p>
            <p>As it's 80 years since World War II ended, the Academia Historica and the National Taiwan Museum of History are holding six talks. Chen Yi-shen said in his speech that two talks will be in Taipei and four in Nantou. All these talks will show the latest research on the history of the Republic of China and Taiwan.</p>
            <p>The first talk was this afternoon. Professor Li Jun-shan from National Chung Hsing University talked about "The Nationalist Government's land claims during World War II and changes after the war." Li Jun-shan said that Taiwan has gone through many big historical events since the 1800s. But it has always been lucky and avoided many wars. Taiwan became a "clean land," which means "God bless Taiwan."</p>
            <p>Li Jun-shan said that in 1944, the US Navy planned to land in Taiwan. But General MacArthur, who was the US commander in the Southwest Pacific, wanted to get the Philippines back first. The next place to attack was Okinawa. Because of this, Taiwan did not have a big fight. If it had, the results would have been very bad.</p>
            <p>He believes that Taiwan's situation after the war was very complex. The US at that time saw Taiwan as "an island with no owner." The US Seventh Fleet entered the Taiwan Strait. On the surface, it was to help defend the Republic of China. But in truth, it was to protect themselves and keep a safe path for the US in the Korean War. The Seventh Fleet "put a hold" on Taiwan. This means Taiwan was held by the US, and its future was not decided yet.</p>
            <p>Li Jun-shan said that in 1949, the US government published a report that strongly criticized Chiang Kai-shek for being corrupt and not able to lead. The report showed that the US wanted to "protect Taiwan but not Chiang." Later, Chiang heard that the US planned to make the Taiwan Strait "neutral." He wrote in his diary that he would never publicly agree to this and would not give up Taiwan's right to rule itself. This way of "waiting for changes" has made Taiwan's status undecided until today.</p>
            <p>Li Jun-shan said that when the US and China signed a defense treaty, they talked about Taiwan's status being undecided. But since the 1960s, the US government has slowly stopped saying this.</p>
            <p>He believes that there are many different ideas about Taiwan inside the United States. They have not yet agreed on one clear idea, so it is hard to say it is a formal policy. However, the US State Department and other groups mostly deal with Taiwan using "three statements." Official papers do not often mention "Taiwan's status is undecided" anymore. Also, US foreign policy uses different rules because of different interests and views. This makes their position on Taiwan's status unclear.</p>
            <p>About the different words people use for the end of World War II, Li Jun-shan said from a history of diplomacy point of view that for the 80th anniversary of WWII, people mostly say what they believe. Whether it's called a victory, a return of land, the end of the war, or even a new occupation, everyone can say their own opinion. In a society with many different ideas, everyone should accept these different views.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Chen Yi-shen told a reporter that Chiang Kai-shek first asked US President Roosevelt for support for the Cairo Declaration. Only then could he convince the British. This led to the plan to return Taiwan and Penghu. But in 1949, General MacArthur said the Cairo Declaration was not the final word. In 1950, President Truman said that Taiwan's status was undecided. This happened because China became communist and because of the Korean War.</p>
            <p>Chen Yi-shen said that Li Jun-shan focused on how powerful countries are connected and how weaker countries' diplomacy depends on stronger ones. This is often called "great power politics." But weaker countries can still have their own diplomacy. Taiwan went through two crises in the Taiwan Strait in the 1950s and a third one in the 1990s. Taiwan was safe each time because the US and the Republic of China (Taiwan) worked closely together.</p>
            <p>About Li Jun-shan saying Taiwan was an island with no owner, Chen Yi-shen said he understood it to mean that the Seventh Fleet could come and go as it wished. This was not related to whether the Republic of China owned Taiwan and Penghu. He added that after the Korean War, the US has always said Taiwan's "status is undecided." This is almost a basic rule for the US, not just a plan.</p>

            <h1>Trump says 100% semiconductor tariffs; Kuo Chih-hui invites TSMC and other major manufacturers for talks</h1>
            <p>Former US President Donald Trump announced that there will be a 100% tax on semiconductors sent to the US. But if a company has a factory in the US or is building one there, they will not have to pay this tax. Today, Taiwan's Minister of Economic Affairs, Kuo Chih-hui, met with big companies like TSMC, UMC, Powerchip, Nanya Tech, ASE, GlobalFoundries, and Hon Hai. The companies at the meeting suggested that Taiwan should try to stop the US from adding different taxes that could be unfair to the industry.</p>
            <p>Trump said that all computer chips and semiconductors sent to the US will have a 100% tax. But if a company promises to build a factory in the US, or is already building one, they will not pay this tax. Many companies are doing this. If a company does not keep its promise to build a factory in the US for some reason, the US will collect the tax later, including for past shipments.</p>
            <p>Taiwan's Industrial Development Bureau, which is part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, sent out a press release this evening. It said that Kuo Chih-hui today invited leaders from Taiwan's semiconductor industry groups (SEMI) and big Taiwanese semiconductor companies to a meeting. They discussed what the US plans to do and how Taiwan might respond.</p>
            <p>At the meeting, the companies generally said that the US plans to add taxes on semiconductors and chips. But the details are not yet clear, like how much the tax will be, how it will be collected, and who will not have to pay it. They need to wait and see more. They looked at how the US added taxes on steel, aluminum, and cars before. They suggested that the government should actively talk with the US to get good conditions for the industry. They also said it's important to stop the US from adding different taxes that could be unfair to the industry.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that they will give the companies' suggestions to the Taiwan-US trade group. This group will continue talking with the US. The ministry will also stay in close touch with the companies. They will prepare different ways to deal with any problems that might come up in the future.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that Taiwan's semiconductor industry has worked closely with US customers for a long time. Taiwan provides valuable computer chips that help the US technology industry stay strong and invent new things around the world.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Taiwan and the US often work well together in semiconductors and high-tech areas. They work closely on research, making things, and using the final products. They both help each other. Taiwan's industry is very important for keeping the world's supply chains strong. It will continue to help in the future.</p>
