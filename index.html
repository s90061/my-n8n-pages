            <h1>Thousands Caught in Scam Compound, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Asks Cambodia for Names of Taiwanese Suspects</h1>
            <p>On July 16, Cambodian police attacked a large online scam area. They caught over one thousand suspects, and 75 of them were from Taiwan. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said today that it has told its office in Ho Chi Minh City to check with the local police. MOFA is asking Cambodia to quickly give the names of the people involved and information about the crimes.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that Cambodian police attacked an online scam area on July 16. They caught over one thousand suspects. Most of these people were from other countries. This included at least 271 Indonesians, 213 Vietnamese, and 75 Taiwanese.</p>
            <p>MOFA answered questions from Central News Agency (CNA) tonight. They said that Cambodian police have recently done many big attacks on online scam areas across the country. They might have caught suspects, including Taiwanese. MOFA is very worried about this. It has told its office in Ho Chi Minh City to talk to the local police right away to check the information. MOFA is also strongly asking Cambodia to quickly give the names of the people involved and information about the crimes. This will help to understand what really happened.</p>
            <p>MOFA said that if it is confirmed that Taiwanese people were involved, they will ask Cambodia to send them back to Taiwan. This would follow the "principle of nationality jurisdiction." Then, Taiwan's law enforcement will check and handle the cases according to the law.</p>
            <p>MOFA strongly warns everyone again: Do not try to do illegal things like phone fraud overseas. If you do, you might break local laws. This could lead to you being put in prison or stuck in a scam area. The results can be very bad, and it is not worth it.</p>
            <p>MOFA also said that for Taiwanese people who are already stuck in scam areas overseas or are in prison, different government departments will continue to work together. They will work with other countries to fight international crime more strongly. They will also actively help Taiwanese people involved in these cases and their families, following local laws.

            <h1>Police Agency Holds Meeting to Fight Crime as Recall Vote Day Nears</h1>
            <p>The day for the recall vote, July 26, is coming soon. The Ministry of Interior's National Police Agency (NPA) said that today it gathered 430 important police officers for a special video meeting. They asked to set up special command centers for the entire time the recall activities are happening. This shows their strong decision to enforce the law seriously.</p>
            <p>The NPA sent out a press release tonight. It said that because the recall vote day is near, they held a special video meeting today. They invited directors, deputy directors, and chiefs from different police departments, a total of 430 important police officers. At the meeting, they clearly stated their strong decision to enforce the law and stop violence.</p>
            <p>Also, they asked that during the recall activities, they set up joint command centers for keeping public order. This will be like what they do for presidential, vice presidential, and legislative elections. This is to make sure the recall vote is "safe, smooth, and stable." This will help society be safer and more peaceful.</p>
            <p>The NPA said that its Director-General, Chang Jung-hsing, gave clear instructions about information on gang violence in the recall process. He said they should clear out and strongly punish such groups. He also asked that if any false information cases are reported, they should be solved and corrected as fast as possible. This is to give people the right information.</p>
            <p>In addition, to prevent vote-buying and illegal betting from affecting this recall, police will keep putting in effort to gather information and strictly investigate. They promised to protect the fairness and honesty of the vote results.</p>
            <p>Chang Jung-hsing reminded everyone that this is the first time they are doing security for such a big recall vote in Taiwan. Police officers must stay neutral. For security work, he asked local police to work with election offices. They need to check every step carefully, control who comes in and out, and do security checks. They must make sure security is perfect.</p>
            <p>The NPA said that during the official recall activity period, many more recall events will happen. They will follow the law and stay neutral. They will strictly stop fights and problems. For violent actions, they will definitely enforce the law seriously and will not let anyone challenge the government's power. The NPA also asks everyone in society to express their opinions and demands for all recall activities in a peaceful and sensible way. They ask people to support the police in their law enforcement. This will help them complete the recall security work successfully. (Edited by Chang Ming-kun) 1140717</p>

            <h1>Tainan's Xiliao Flood Wall Is Now Higher to Stop Storm Surges and Waves</h1>
            <p>When Typhoon Danas passed, water flooded Xiliao village in Tainan's Qigu District. President Lai Ching-te visited the area on July 11 to see the damage. Today, the city government announced that they have finished making the flood wall there higher. The wall is 600 meters long and 60 centimeters high. It is built to stop strong storm surges and waves from coming in.</p>
            <p>The city government explained that when Typhoon Danas hit, the Qigu area had very strong winds, with an average wind speed of level 13 and gusts of level 16. Very large waves went over the Qing Shan Gang sandbar. The water then flowed over the Daliao drainage channel and into Xiliao village, causing floods for a short time.</p>
            <p>Because tropical low-pressure systems have been developing recently, the city government used a method of stacking pre-made concrete blocks. This way is energy-saving, works well, and is fast to build. It made sure that the work to make the Xiliao village flood wall higher was completed in the shortest time.</p>
            <p>In addition, when Premier Cho Jung-tai visited on July 15 to see the damage, Tainan Mayor Huang Wei-che asked for 1.76 billion New Taiwan dollars for water control projects. These plans include improving the Daliao drainage system and rebuilding the Wangzailiao sandbar. They hope the central government will approve these plans quickly. This will help Tainan be stronger against floods. (Edited by Chen Ching-fang) 1140717</p>
