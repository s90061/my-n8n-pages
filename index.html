            <h1>Wu De-rong: Typhoon Yangliu's Path Moves South, Will Pass Taiwan on August 13-14</h1>
            <p>Weather expert Wu De-rong said that from today until August 12, it will be sunny and hot everywhere. Typhoon Yangliu's path is now expected to move south. It will pass by northern Taiwan on August 13 and 14, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. On August 15 and 16, the weather will get better. There might be some showers or thunderstorms in mountain areas in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>Wu De-rong, who is also an associate professor at National Central University's Department of Atmospheric Sciences, wrote today in his "Leak Heaven's Secrets Classroom" column for the Meteorological Application Promotion Foundation. He said that the newest typhoon path map from the Central Weather Administration shows Typhoon Yangliu's path has moved south. It will pass northern Taiwan on August 13 and 14. The map that shows the chance of the storm hitting Taiwan now says there is a 60% chance. Even though the typhoon might get weaker before it reaches Taiwan, its danger is still serious.</p>
            <p>Wu De-rong explained that the average path from the newest European weather models shows Typhoon Yangliu passing northern Taiwan on August 13 and 14. The paths from different models are spread out on both sides. The models also show the typhoon's strength. As it gets closer to Taiwan, it will enter an area with strong "vertical wind shear" (winds blowing in different directions at different heights). Paths that are more to the north will show the typhoon getting weaker more clearly. Paths that are more to the south will be less affected, keep their strength better, and be more dangerous. He noted that weather models from different countries might still change, so we should watch closely.</p>
            <p>Today, the Central Weather Administration shared a high-temperature warning. It will be hot everywhere. During the day, Keelung City, Taipei City, New Taipei City, Tainan City, and Pingtung County are under an "orange light" warning, meaning there's a chance of temperatures reaching 36 degrees Celsius for several days. Kaohsiung City and Hualien County are under a "yellow light" warning, meaning temperatures could go above 36 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Wu De-rong said that the newest European weather models show it will still be sunny and hot from today until August 12. People should protect themselves from the sun and avoid heatstroke. There will be a bit more moisture from the south, making the air unstable. There's a chance of local showers or thunderstorms in mountain areas in the afternoon, which might spread to some flat areas.</p>
            <p>Wu De-rong mentioned that the newest European weather models show Typhoon Yangliu will pass by on August 13 and 14, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. At that time, people should pay attention to the latest information and get ready for the typhoon.</p>
            <p>Also, he stated that on August 15 and 16, the weather will get better. But there will still be a lot of moisture. There's a chance of local showers or thunderstorms in mountain areas in the afternoon, which might spread to some flat areas.</p>
