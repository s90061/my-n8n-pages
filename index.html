New research from UC Davis Health suggests that young adults who spend a lot of time looking at screens might have poorer brain health. The study, published in May 2024, examined the effects of digital screen usage on the brains of people aged 18 to 30. Researchers found a connection between high screen time and problems with memory and attention. They believe that spending too much time on phones, computers, and tablets can lead to less physical activity, worse sleep quality, and fewer social interactions, all of which are important for a healthy brain. This new information highlights the need for young adults to find a good balance between their digital lives and real-world activities to protect their mental and brain health.

**AI Will Transform Jobs, Focusing on Human Skills**
The World Economic Forum recently stated that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will change jobs significantly, but it won't destroy them. Instead, AI will transform the workplace, creating a need for different kinds of skills. The report from April 2024 suggests that future jobs will require more "human" skills rather than just technical or STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) abilities. Companies will look for employees who are creative, can think critically, solve problems, and communicate well. These so-called "soft skills" are becoming more important as AI handles routine tasks. Workers are encouraged to adapt by developing these human-centered skills to succeed in the evolving job market.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day-Trippers to Manage Tourism**
The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging a fee for day visitors to help manage its large number of tourists. From April 2024, people visiting Venice for just one day must pay an entrance fee. This new rule aims to reduce overcrowding and protect the city's delicate environment and infrastructure, which are struggling under the weight of millions of tourists each year. The fee is currently 5 euros and applies during peak times when the city is most crowded. Not all visitors have to pay; for example, those staying overnight in hotels are usually exempt. Venice is one of the first major tourist destinations to introduce such a system, and other popular cities around the world might watch to see if it helps create more sustainable tourism.
