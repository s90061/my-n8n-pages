Imagine a virtual copy of yourself that doctors could use to test treatments. This idea, called a "digital twin," is a new and exciting development in healthcare. A digital twin would be a computer model of a patient, built using their unique medical information like genes, lifestyle, and past health records.

This virtual model could help doctors predict how a patient might react to different medicines or surgeries. For example, instead of trying a new drug and waiting to see the effects, doctors could test it on the patient's digital twin first. This could lead to much more personalized treatments, meaning medicines and care plans are made just for you.

The main goals of using digital twins are to make treatments more effective and to reduce unwanted side effects. While this technology is still in its early stages, experts believe it could greatly change how we receive medical care in the future. It offers a promise of better health outcomes tailored to each individual.

**Venice to Charge Day-Trippers an Entry Fee**

The famous Italian city of Venice will soon start charging a fee for visitors who come just for the day. This new rule, a first for a major city in the world, is planned to begin on April 25, 2024, as a trial. Day-trippers over the age of 14 will need to pay 5 euros to enter the city during busy times.

This fee is aimed at managing the huge number of tourists who visit Venice. The city is very popular, and during peak seasons, it can become extremely crowded. This overcrowding puts a lot of pressure on the city's old buildings and delicate environment, and it also makes daily life difficult for local residents.

Officials hope that the new entry fee will help control the flow of visitors and protect Venice's unique culture and historic beauty. The money collected will help pay for the city's upkeep and services. This move shows how cities are trying to find ways to balance tourism with keeping their heritage safe for future generations.

**New Research Suggests Forcing Workers Back to the Office Isn't Working**

After the pandemic, many companies told their employees to return to working in the office, moving away from remote or hybrid models. However, new studies are showing that this approach might not be good for businesses. Instead of helping, these "return-to-office" rules are often making things worse.

Research indicates that when companies force employees back, it can lead to lower spirits among staff and more people quitting their jobs. Some studies even suggest it doesn't improve how well people work. Employees often prefer the flexibility they gained during the pandemic, allowing them to balance work and personal life better.

Companies often want people back in the office to improve teamwork, strengthen company culture, or make use of their office buildings. But for many employees, being told to return feels like a lack of trust and control over their work. Companies that continue to offer flexible working options are often seeing happier employees and better results. This suggests that trusting employees with how and where they work might be the best way forward.`;
