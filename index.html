            <h1>Low-Income Woman Asks Not to Support Father; Court Says Father Not Responsible, Denies Request</h1>
            <p>A single mother, who is low-income and has a disability, said that her father drank too much and did not care for his children. She also said he sold her to a brothel. Because of this, she asked the court to free her from having to support her father. The father said he worked hard to earn money and did not have much time at home. He also said his wife sold their daughter, and he was not involved. The court decided in favor of the father.</p>
            <p>The 91-year-old man lives in a nursing home in Taitung. The cost for the nursing home is NT$31,800 per month. After government help, he still needs to pay about NT$15,000 each month. So, he asked his youngest daughter for money to help pay for his care.</p>
            <p>The youngest daughter asked the Taitung District Court to free her from her duty to support her father. She said that when she was 4 years old, her father drank a lot and did not take care of the children. She and her three older sisters often had no food. They only got meals from their grandmother. When she was between 14 and 15 years old, her parents sold her to a brothel. She managed to escape, and a neighbor told the police. Her mother went to prison because of this.</p>
            <p>The daughter said she has a moderate disability and is low-income. She is also a single mother and has to support her two adult sons who are still in school. One of her sons has a mental or physical disability. She said she can barely pay her rent now. She hoped the court would free her from her duty to support her father.</p>
            <p>The man's third daughter also came to court to give a statement. She said that the money their grandmother used to support them came from selling paper offerings. She said, "I never saw my father give money to my grandmother."</p>
            <p>The third daughter also said that her oldest sister and second oldest sister were also sold. She knew clearly what happened. She saw that the oldest sister took the younger sister to the brothel. But she knew that the father made all the decisions in the family, and no one dared to go against him. She said the father told the oldest sister to take the younger sister away.</p>
            <p>The man told the court that he asked his mother to help take care of the children at that time. He said he gave the money he earned to his mother. He said their family was very poor, and he was busy earning money, so he did not have time to take care of the children. He also said that his son-in-law and wife sold the youngest daughter to the brothel, and it had nothing to do with him.</p>
            <p>The court looked at old records. The man's wife, Ms. Lin, was indeed sent to prison for selling three of her daughters. When the prosecutor looked into the case, Ms. Lin always said that she sold her daughters without her husband's permission. She said her husband and others were not involved in selling the daughters.</p>
            <p>Regarding the father not taking care of his daughters, the judge said that even if the daughter did not see her father give money to the grandmother, it does not mean the father did not give money.</p>
            <p>The judge said that the daughter's accusations against her father were not strong enough to believe. The judge also said that the father did not purposely abuse, seriously insult, or cause other physical or mental harm to his daughter. Therefore, the court denied the daughter's request to be freed from supporting her father. This case can still be appealed.</p>

            <h1>AI and Net Zero: Mayor Lu Shiow-yen Visits Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre to Boost Taichung's Strength</h1>
            <p>Moving to digital ways of working is happening in all industries. Artificial intelligence (AI) and reaching "net zero" carbon emissions are two big challenges for governments and businesses. These challenges are important for Taiwan's ability to compete in the future. The Central News Agency's reporters are sharing how the government and different industries are using AI to make work processes better and create new green ideas. This shows how Taiwan's industries are growing stronger again.</p>
            <p>Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen visited Australia recently. Yesterday, she went to the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre to learn how it is run. The Taichung International Convention and Exhibition Center will open at the end of this year. Mayor Lu hopes to learn from Brisbane's success and ideas about being sustainable. This will help make Taichung's center better and stronger in the world.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government shared a news release today. It said that on August 8th, Mayor Lu focused on visiting the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre. This center is in the main city of Queensland. She learned about the center's new ways of operating sustainably, managing smartly, and helping the city grow.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that the Taichung International Convention and Exhibition Center has been planned for many years. It will start operating at the end of this year. In the future, it will be an important place for exhibitions and meetings in central Taiwan. She said it is very important for improving industries, growing the economy, and making Taichung more known around the world.</p>
            <p>She also said that the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre is the second largest exhibition place in Australia. For many years, it has focused on green operations, sustainable buildings, and connecting with the community. For example, the center uses systems to save energy, uses renewable energy, and recycles food. These actions show that the center cares about and practices ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance). This was very impressive.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government's Economic Development Bureau said that the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre is in the middle of the city, in the South Bank cultural area. The Queensland state government paid for building it completely. The company ASM Global is in charge of running it and getting events. The center opened in 1995. Every year, it holds more than 1,000 meetings, exhibitions, shows, and banquets. More than 700,000 people from Australia and other countries visit it each year.</p>
            <p>Also, Mayor Lu met with Brisbane Mayor Adrian Schrinner and City Council Speaker Sandy Landers. They talked about the 2032 Brisbane Olympic Games, public transport, building parks, and preventing floods and disasters.</p>

            <h1>Tool Machine Industry: Agreement on Similar Tariffs; Hope Government Negotiates</h1>
            <p>The U.S. has started new tariffs (taxes on goods from other countries) that match what other countries charge. For Taiwan, the temporary tax rate is 20%. The Trade Administration said that Taiwan must add this 20% to the current "Most Favored Nation" (MFN) tax rate. Any anti-dumping or anti-subsidy taxes must also be added. The Taiwan Association of Machine Tool and Component Industries said that they understand this in the same way. They hope the government will talk with the U.S. through diplomatic ways. They want the government to get the best benefits for Taiwan's industries.</p>
            <p>The Machine Tool Association said that when the U.S. announced the 20% temporary matching tariff for Taiwan, the association already thought that the tax rate would not just become 20%. Instead, they believed it would be an extra 20% added to the existing Most Favored Nation tax rate.</p>
            <p>The Machine Tool Association also said that this new tax on goods sent to the U.S. will greatly affect the machine tool industry. They hope the government will help clear up how products are classified. They want the government to try to get better tax rates for businesses. They also hope the government will offer plans to help during this change.</p>
            <p>The association also wants the government to help the industry make two big changes faster. They want to use AI technology to help with digital transformation and green transformation. This means making industries more modern with technology and also more friendly to the environment. They also want to build a system for the machine tool industry and set up a center to check machine tool products.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the association hopes the government will continue to provide help for developing international markets. They also want loans for operations and help with interest payments. This would help businesses build more places overseas faster. They also want the government to bring together resources from industry, government, and schools. They want to find international partners to make the machine tool industry strong and able to handle challenges.</p>
