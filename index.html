            <h1>NVIDIA and OpenAI Work Together to Build a Huge AI Center</h1>
            <p>NVIDIA, a big company that makes computer chips, and OpenAI, a top company for artificial intelligence, have announced they will work together. NVIDIA will build a new kind of AI data center for OpenAI. This center will use a lot of electricity, 10 gigawatts, and will have millions of special computer parts called GPUs. These will help develop very advanced AI programs.</p>
            <p>Both companies sent out a press release. It says that NVIDIA will invest up to 100 billion US dollars, which is about 3 trillion New Taiwan Dollars. This money will be invested in stages. The first part of this big system will start working in the second half of 2026. It will use NVIDIA's Vera Rubin technology.</p>
            <p>Jensen Huang, the boss of NVIDIA, said that NVIDIA and OpenAI have helped each other for 10 years. They started from the first DGX supercomputer and then made the big step with ChatGPT. This new investment and working together on the building will be a new big step. It will create a system that uses 10 gigawatts of power to start a new time for artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p>Sam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, said that computing power is very important for everything. He believes that strong computing systems will be the base for how the economy works in the future. He added, "By building this system with NVIDIA, we will help create new AI discoveries. We will also help people and companies grow their work at the same large scale."</p>
            <p>The Wall Street Journal reported that NVIDIA and OpenAI are leading the USA in the race to create "superintelligence" in AI. They have announced they are working together. OpenAI will be able to build and use NVIDIA systems that use at least 10 gigawatts of power. These systems will be used in OpenAI's own data centers to train and run their next-generation AI programs. This amount of electricity is like what 8 million homes use.</p>
            <p>This shows that a lot of money and resources are needed to run AI programs. The goal is to make "superintelligence" that is smarter, faster, and stronger than humans.</p>
            <p>This partnership is based on the idea that AI programs will keep getting better. It means that hundreds of billions of dollars from investors, companies, governments, and money people will help create AI programs. These programs could change the economy and society a lot. This shows a future economy that needs much more computing power than we have now.</p>

            <h1>Porsche Lowers Money Forecast, Affecting Car Companies and European Stock Markets</h1>
            <p>Porsche, a famous company that makes expensive sports cars, said it expects to earn less money in the future. This made the price of its shares and the shares of its main company, Volkswagen Group, go down a lot. At the same time, people who invest in the stock market are still hoping to see new signs that the economy is growing. Because of these reasons, most major stock markets in Europe closed lower today.</p>
            <p>In London, the FTSE 100 index went up a little, by 10.01 points or 0.11%. It closed at 9226.68 points.</p>
            <p>In Frankfurt, the DAX index went down by 112.36 points or 0.48%. It closed at 23527.05 points.</p>
            <p>In Paris, the CAC 40 index fell by 23.48 points or 0.30%. It closed at 7830.11 points.</p>
