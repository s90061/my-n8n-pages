            <h1>Trump and Putin to Talk About Russia-Ukraine War; German Leader Thinks Zelenskyy Will Be There</h1>
            <p>US President Trump will meet with Russian President Putin on August 15th to talk about ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. Today, the German Chancellor, Mr. Merz, said that Germany expects the Ukrainian President, Mr. Zelenskyy, to be at this important meeting.</p>
            <p>The AFP news agency reported that Putin and Trump will meet in Alaska, USA. They will try to solve the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which has been going on for more than three years. Ukraine and European countries say that the Ukrainian government in Kyiv must be part of these talks.</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz spoke on German TV (ARD). He said, "We hope and expect that the Ukrainian government, President Zelenskyy, will be part of this meeting."</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz told ARD that Germany is working closely with the US government in Washington to make sure President Zelenskyy is there for the talks.</p>
            <p>He also said: "We cannot agree to a situation where Russia and the United States talk about, or even decide, land issues without Europeans and Ukrainians. I believe the US government thinks the same way as us."</p>
            <p>Mr. Merz said he hopes these talks will lead to important progress towards a peaceful solution, maybe even a "breakthrough."</p>
            <p>He said, "We hope for a big step forward on August 15th. Most importantly, we want a ceasefire to happen and peace talks to begin in Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Russia and Ukraine have had three rounds of talks this year, but they have not reached a ceasefire.</p>
