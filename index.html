            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Lu Tai-cheng, Taitung County, July 23) A female police officer from the Taitung County Police Bureau's Taitung branch was riding a seized electric scooter back to the police station. A citizen reported her for not wearing a helmet.</p>

            <h1>Recall Vote Nears: Green Camp Calls It a Fight for Democracy, Blue and White Camps Ask People to Vote Against Recall</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency reporter Huang Li-yun, Taipei, July 23) The day for the recall vote is coming soon, and the election in Taipei City is very active. Today, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) group in the parliament and the Kuomintang (KMT) group in the Taipei City Council met near each other, just one street apart. The DPP group shouted that this is a fight between democracy and anti-democracy. The KMT group asked people to go out and vote against the recall on July 26, no matter the weather.</p>
            <p>With only 72 hours left until the recall vote on July 26, the DPP's "51st Battle Team" in the parliament was at the corner of Nanjing East Road Section 3, Bade Road Section 3, and Guangfu North Road in Taipei City this morning. They were supporting the recall effort in Taipei. Many members of parliament, like Wu Pei-yi, Wu Ssu-yao, Wu Li-hua, Wang Mei-hui, Huang Jie, Shen Fa-hui, and Lai Rui-long, along with several Taipei city council members from the party, stood at the intersection to greet people. They asked everyone to vote for the recall on July 26.</p>
            <p>Wu Ssu-yao said that Taipei City is very important, especially because KMT members of parliament Wang Hung-wei and Hsu Chiao-hsin are "the worst of the worst" in their eyes. She said the 51st Battle Team will stand with the citizens at this important time to protect democracy in the parliament. They will not be absent. They want the parliament to go back to normal and follow democratic rules to speak for the people. She said this is a competition between democracy and anti-democracy.</p>
            <p>News reporters at the site asked about the issue of "rejecting China's twisting of UN General Assembly Resolution 2758," which has not been discussed for 10 months. Wu Ssu-yao said that Resolution 2758 helps set things right for Taiwan's power in the world. Many countries around the world have made decisions and taken political actions to correct this. But only Taiwan's parliament does not support its own country. The KMT and Taiwan People's Party (TPP) members even stood up and left. She said it felt like "talking to thin air."</p>
            <p>Wu Ssu-yao also said that when Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim went to the Czech Republic, China attacked her. The DPP wanted to condemn this in the parliament, but the KMT and TPP stopped it. She said that if you say "no" to China, "the KMT and TPP hide." She hopes new public opinion will lead to a new parliament.</p>
            <p>At the same time, the KMT group in the Taipei City Council was asking for votes at the Taipei Arena intersection. They asked people to "go out on July 26 and vote 'disagree with the recall'." Taipei City Mayor Chiang Wan-an, Speaker Tai Hsi-chin, and other city council members from the KMT were there to show their support.</p>
            <p>Chiang Wan-an said in an interview that today, the main reason was that the Speaker called on all KMT city council members. They stood at the intersection three days before the vote to ask all voters to come out and vote "disagree with the recall" on July 26.</p>
            <p>Reporters asked him what he thought about the "agree with recall" flyers that had pictures of two former leaders named Chiang. They also asked if he would take time off work to help with the campaign, like Taichung City Mayor Lu Shiow-yen. Chiang Wan-an only said that in these last days, he asks all citizens again to come out and vote "disagree with the recall." He also said he would help with the campaign according to the rules. He still has some city work to do, but most of his campaign work is in the evening. He will fully follow the plans of the members of parliament and take time off work as needed.</p>
            <p>Because a typhoon might affect July 26, Chiang Wan-an smiled and said, "No matter what, come rain or shine, vote against the recall." He believes that every area is an important place to protect. Taipei City will fully gather everyone, and come rain or shine, they will vote "disagree with the recall."</p>
            <p>Reporters asked again about Wu Ssu-yao's comment that the KMT and TPP disappear when they need to "say no to China." Hsu Chiao-hsin said that the DPP has always been the one supporting Chinese spies. She said that it was the KMT who revealed the spy cases and made national security safer. She asked the DPP to stop hiding things. She said that Wu Chao-hsieh, the Secretary-General of the National Security Council, has not dared to be checked by the parliament and only uses other events to hide. She asked him to come out and face the public.</p>
            <p>Regarding rumors that the village chiefs in Songshan District went abroad and would not support them, Wang Hung-wei also said that all village chiefs and supporters will come out on July 26 to support voting "disagree with the recall." She added that currently, people are most worried about tariffs with the US. She said that while Japan's tariffs went down, they opened up for things like rice and trucks. But Taiwan's situation is still unclear. She asked the government to quickly explain what problems industries will face.</p>
            <p>Tai Hsi-chin explained that with the vote coming soon, the KMT group in the city council specially asked all their council members to support Mayor Chiang's team and the five KMT members of parliament from Taipei City. He said these members are very important for Taipei's building and getting money from the central government. He also said that many village chiefs from Songshan District came out to support them today. But because they had planned trips abroad a long time ago, it is not true that they do not support voting against the recall, as some bad rumors say.

            <h1>Magong Mahjong Competition Starts July 26, Nearly 200 Players Will Compete for "King" and "Queen" Titles</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Penghu County, July 23) The second Magong City Mahjong Competition will start on July 26. It will be a two-day "brain battle." One hundred ninety-two players will compete for the titles of "Mahjong King" and "Mahjong Queen," and a prize of NT$10,000. This event combines competition and social interaction, showing the excitement and energy of Magong citizens.</p>
            <p>The Magong City Office said that the first "Mahjong Competition" in June last year was very popular, and all spots were filled quickly. This year, many people also signed up. The age limit was changed to 45 years old and above. A total of 192 people joined, which is more than 60 more than last year. The event is bigger than before. To have more players and space for people to watch, the competition was moved to the new Xiewei Activity Center.</p>
            <p>This year's "Mahjong Competition" will happen on July 26 and 27. For the competition rules, players will draw lots to decide their tables. There will be group elimination games. After six rounds, players will go to the final round to compete for the "Mahjong King" or "Mahjong Queen" title and the NT$10,000 prize.</p>
            <p>Magong Mayor Huang Chien-chung said that the "Mahjong Competition" is not just about competing. It is also a way for people to connect and make friends. It shows the city's spirit of being open and including everyone. It also shows the city's energy and the style of its citizens. This lets citizens enjoy talking and playing together in a healthy and safe place.</p>
            <p>After Magong City held its first "Mahjong Competition" last year, many "Mahjong parlors" opened in the city. This started a new trend. In Qimei Township, the local office also held a fun mahjong game this Mother's Day. Because of this, mahjong culture is becoming popular in different parts of Penghu and is now a special local feature. (Editor: Huang Shih-ya) July 23, 2025.</p>
