            <h1>Female Boxer Khelif Appeals Against WB's Genetic Testing Rule</h1>
            <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said today that Algerian female boxer Imane Khelif has appealed. She wants to overturn a rule from World Boxing (WB) that asks for genetic testing. Khelif was part of a gender discussion during last year's Paris Olympics.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that CAS stated World Boxing (WB) decided Khelif could not join upcoming WB matches without first having a genetic test. Khelif is unhappy with this decision.</p>
            <p>Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-ting were involved in gender discussions during the Paris Olympics. Both of them won gold medals. Lin Yu-ting will not be at this week's WB World Boxing Championships in Liverpool, UK.</p>
            <p>Lin Yu-ting had already finished all her tests more than a month ago and sent the report to WB. It is now understood that WB needs 4 to 6 weeks to discuss these cases. Because of this, Lin Yu-ting cannot participate in this year's World Championships for now.</p>
            <p>Khelif, who is 26 years old, denied last month that her former agent said she had stopped her boxing career.</p>
            <p>Khelif wrote on Facebook, "I want to make it clear to the public that the news about me quitting boxing is not true."</p>
            <p>She said her former agent, Nasser Yesfah, "betrayed my trust and my country with false and harmful words."</p>
            <p>She added, "This person can no longer speak for me."</p>

            <h1>US-India Alliance Against China Might Change; Trump Criticizes India's High Taxes Again</h1>
            <p>Today, on September 1st, US President Trump said that India charges very high taxes on goods from the US. India has offered to lower these taxes to zero, but Trump thinks it's too late. This happened while Indian Prime Minister Modi showed unity with leaders from China and Russia at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Prime Minister Modi is in China for the SCO summit. At the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke about his idea for a new global safety and money system. He wants to put "Global South" countries first, which directly challenges the US.</p>
            <p>In recent years, the US and India have made their relationship stronger. This happened during Trump's first time as president because both countries were worried about China's growing power.</p>
            <p>But if Trump becomes president again, the partnership between the US and India against China might change. This is because India does not want to stop buying oil from Russia. Trump added a 25% tax on goods from India because of this.</p>
            <p>Trump wrote on his social media platform, "Truth Social," today: "Not many people understand that we do very little business with India, but India's business with us is huge. In other words, they sell us a lot of goods, they are our biggest 'customer,' but we sell very little to them."</p>
            <p>He also said, "Because India has charged us very high taxes until now, the highest of all countries, our businesses cannot enter India. This is a completely unfair disaster! Also, India buys most of its oil and military products from Russia, and very little from the United States."</p>
            <p>Trump also claimed, "They (India) are now offering to lower the taxes to zero, but it's too late. They should have done this a long time ago."</p>
