            <h1>Police Charge Two for Helping Shooter, Search for Gunman and Mastermind After Influencer's Car Shot 12 Times</h1>
            <p>A well-known internet personality, "Pineapple" Wu Hong-yi, was driving with his wife in Chiayi City in July. A man named Hsieh shot their car 12 times with a gun. Luckily, no one was hurt. The Chiayi Prosecutor's Office has finished its investigation. Hsieh, the shooter, and Chen, who is thought to be the planner, are still at large and wanted by the police. However, two men, Lin and Chang, who helped the shooter, have been charged with attempted murder and hiding a criminal.</p>
            <p>According to the indictment from the Chiayi District Prosecutor's Office on October 14, Mr. Hsieh and Mr. Chen planned together to shoot Wu Hong-yi. On the evening of July 15, at 8:05 PM, Mr. Hsieh followed Wu Hong-yi's car on a motorcycle to Bo'ai Road Section 2 in Chiayi City. When Wu's car stopped at a red light, Hsieh used a non-military pistol to shoot the back right side of the car 12 times. Fortunately, Wu Hong-yi and his wife inside the car were not injured.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi Prosecutor's Office said that after the shooting, Mr. Hsieh rode his motorcycle to a park on Wenhua Road in Chiayi City. He left the motorcycle and his helmet there. Then, he took a taxi south to Tianliao District in Kaohsiung City. A 36-year-old man named Lin drove Hsieh and hid him at his home in Tianliao. After that, Lin removed the car's driving recorder to destroy evidence and gave Hsieh a mobile phone and NT$30,000 for his escape.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi Prosecutor's Office explained that on the afternoon of July 16, Lin drove Hsieh north to Baihe District in Tainan. There, Mr. Chang, a 36-year-old man from Tainan City, picked them up in his car. Chang then drove Hsieh to Chen's home in Baihe District to hide him. Hsieh was last seen on July 17 in Xinying District, Tainan City, and has not been found since.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi Prosecutor's Office stated that Lin and Chang were arrested by the police in mid-to-late July. Chen, believed to be the person who planned the crime, left the country from Songshan Airport on July 20. Chen had told Chang to pick up and hide Hsieh on July 16 and 17.</p>
            <p>The Chiayi Prosecutor's Office believes that by shooting the car 12 times, Mr. Hsieh could have easily killed Wu Hong-yi and his wife. His actions were clearly an attempt to kill. Therefore, the prosecutor's office thinks Hsieh intended to kill. Lin and Chang, who helped Hsieh escape and hide, have been charged with attempted murder and hiding a criminal.</p>

            <p>Seoul, October 16 (Central News Agency) â€“ South Korea's President's office announced today that US President Donald Trump is expected to arrive in Seoul on October 29. He will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, which starts on October 31.</p>
            <p>An official from the South Korean President's office told Agence France-Presse that Trump is indeed expected "to arrive on the 29th."</p>
            <p>This year's APEC summit will be held in South Korea from October 31 to November 1. Chinese President Xi Jinping is also expected to be there.</p>
            <p>Last week, China announced stricter rules on exporting rare earth technology. After this, Trump said he might not meet with Xi Jinping at the APEC summit as a way to show his disapproval. However, yesterday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the financial news channel CNBC that Trump still plans to meet with Xi Jinping.</p>
            <p>Seoul also mentioned that the United States and North Korea "might" have talks on the side of the APEC summit.</p>

            <h1>NCKU Establishes "Low-Carbon Digital Construction Alliance" to Achieve Sustainable Net Zero Goals</h1>
            <p>National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) announced today in a press release that the "Low-Carbon Digital Construction Alliance" (LCDCA) has been formed. This alliance is supported by a grant from the National Science and Technology Council. It was started by Professor Shih-Hsien Yang from NCKU's Civil Engineering Department and Professor Shih-Hung Yang from the Architecture Department.</p>
            <p>NCKU explained that the main goal of the alliance is to use and approve "Green-BIM Objects" (green building information modeling parts). They will build a database called "Low-Carbon Digital Twin." This database will help make accurate decisions for reducing carbon emissions during all stages of building. These stages include planning, design, construction, and maintaining buildings.</p>
            <p>The alliance offers several services. These include approving Green-BIM components, helping companies measure their carbon footprint (ISO 14064-1) and product carbon footprint (ISO 14067), and putting in place energy management systems (ISO 50001). They also provide advice on how to reduce carbon in engineering designs, measure carbon emissions during construction, and create BIM models for design, construction, and use. Furthermore, the alliance helps with writing applications for government funding, transferring technology, and connecting companies with universities for projects. All these efforts aim to make businesses more sustainable and competitive in the market.</p>
