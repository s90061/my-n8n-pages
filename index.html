            <h1>Trump: Soon to Announce New Federal Reserve and Labor Statistics Leaders</h1>
            <p>President Trump of the United States said he will soon name a new member for the Federal Reserve Board and a new head for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These choices could affect his economic plans, especially when people are worried about the global economy growing.</p>
            <p>Trump told reporters this as he was returning to the White House after a weekend trip to Bedminster, New Jersey. Recently, he has been criticized for often speaking against the Federal Reserve. He also fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, after job growth numbers were weak. People say these actions hurt the trust in these organizations, which are usually not affected by politics.</p>
            <p>Bloomberg News reported that Trump is "considering several people" for the Federal Reserve job. This position became empty when Adriana Kugler announced on August 1st that she would leave, even though her term was supposed to end in January next year. Her leaving gives Trump a chance to pick someone who agrees more with his ideas and is likely to support lower interest rates.</p>
            <p>People who might lead the Federal Reserve include Kevin Hassett, who is the White House National Economic Council Chairman, Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve board member, Christopher Waller, a current Federal Reserve board member, and Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary. The new Federal Reserve member chosen by Trump might also become the chairman when Jerome Powell's term ends in May next year.</p>
            <p>On August 1st, Trump said he ordered McEntarfer to be fired. He accused her of changing job numbers for political reasons. Data from the U.S. Labor Department showed that job growth in July was lower than expected. Also, job numbers from the past few months, when corrected, were the worst since the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2019.</p>
            <p>After the report came out, Trump criticized McEntarfer. He said she had "made up" job numbers to help the Democratic Party win the last presidential election.</p>
            <p>On his social media site, "Truth Social," Trump wrote about the latest July data: "McEntarfer said only 73,000 jobs were added (shocking), but more importantly, they made a big mistake by lowering the numbers for the previous two months by 258,000 jobs in total."</p>

            <h1>Zelenskyy Says Mercenaries from China and Other Countries are Fighting for Russia; Will Take Action</h1>
            <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said today that Ukrainian soldiers in the northeast part of the country are fighting against "mercenaries" from many countries, including China, Pakistan, and parts of Africa. He promised to act against this.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Zelenskyy had earlier said that Moscow was hiring Chinese people to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, but Beijing said this was not true. North Korea has also sent thousands of soldiers to Russia's Kursk region to help in the fighting.</p>
            <p>After visiting a front-line area in Kharkiv region, northeastern Ukraine, Zelenskyy wrote on X, a social media site: "My commanders and I talked about the situation at the front lines, how we are defending Vovchansk, and how the fighting is going."</p>
            <p>He also said: "Our soldiers in this area reported that mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries are taking part in this war. We will act against this."</p>
            <p>Reuters has contacted the embassies of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, to ask for their comments on this matter.</p>
            <p>Russia has not said anything publicly yet about what Zelenskyy said.</p>
