Artificial intelligence (AI) is quickly transforming many industries, and experts believe it will significantly impact the world of work. While some fear AI might replace many jobs, others suggest it will change how we work, requiring new skills and creating new roles.

AI is becoming more powerful, able to do tasks that once only humans could, such as writing, coding, and customer service. This means jobs with repetitive tasks or those that involve processing large amounts of information are likely to be affected first. Companies are already using AI tools to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

However, it's not all about job losses. Many argue that AI will free up human workers from dull tasks, allowing them to focus on more creative, strategic, and complex problem-solving activities. The demand for jobs involving AI development, maintenance, and ethical oversight is also growing. People will need to adapt by learning new digital skills and focusing on uniquely human abilities like critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Education and training systems will need to change to prepare the workforce for these new demands. The future of work will likely involve humans and AI working together, rather than AI completely taking over.

**Tokyo's Ramen Shops Face Tough Times**

Tokyo, Japan, is famous for its delicious ramen, a popular noodle soup dish. Ramen shops are a big part of the city's food culture, but many are now struggling to stay open. They are facing two main problems: rising costs and a shortage of workers.

The cost of ingredients for ramen, like flour, meat, and vegetables, has increased significantly. Energy prices, such as gas and electricity, are also much higher. This makes it more expensive for shop owners to prepare their dishes. If they raise prices too much, they worry customers might stop coming.

Another big issue is finding enough staff. Many young people are less interested in working long hours for low pay in physically demanding kitchen jobs. This shortage means existing staff are overworked, and it's hard for shops to maintain their service quality. Some shops are closing down, while others are trying new ways to attract staff or are considering raising their prices, which might change the traditional, affordable image of ramen. The future of these beloved local eateries depends on how they can adapt to these challenges.

**Venice Introduces Fee for Day Visitors**

The historic city of Venice, Italy, has started charging a small fee for day visitors, hoping to manage the large number of tourists. This new rule began in late April and applies to people who visit for just one day and do not stay overnight in a hotel or guesthouse.

Venice is famous for its beautiful canals and unique architecture, attracting millions of tourists each year. However, this popularity has led to problems like overcrowding, especially in busy areas. The city also faces challenges protecting its fragile environment and historical buildings from the impact of so many visitors. The new â‚¬5 fee is a trial to help control the flow of tourists and encourage them to stay longer, which would benefit local businesses more.

Visitors must book their visit online and pay the fee before they arrive. They will receive a QR code, which they might need to show if asked. There are some exceptions, such as people staying overnight in Venice, children under 14, and those visiting for work or study. City officials hope this measure will help make tourism more sustainable and protect Venice for future generations.`;
