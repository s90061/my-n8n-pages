            <h1>50 Years After Vietnam War: Documentary Explores Memories of Second Generation from Penghu Refugee Camp</h1>
            <p>This year marks 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War. A documentary called "Strangers and Their Children" was filmed in Taiwan, Penghu, Vietnam, America, and Russia. It tells the stories of four people who were born in a Vietnamese refugee camp in Penghu. They look back at their national memories of escaping, surviving, and finding their identity.</p>
            <p>"Strangers and Their Children" had its first showing today. The director, Liu Ji-hsiung, and his team were there. Hu Yuan-hui, the head of Public Television Service, also came to support. Hu Yuan-hui said, "I grew up during the time of the 'Blood Letters from the South Sea.' When I got older, I studied news about the Vietnam War. But this forgotten part of history still felt new to me. I believe this film will help us understand this time better and think about human nature and civilization."</p>
            <p>Speaking about making the film, Liu Ji-hsiung said, "Taiwan is not part of the United Nations and is not recognized by other countries. I even think Taiwan is like a refugee. But by filming the lives of these 'strangers' in Taiwan, my view of the world became wider. I believe the help we gave to these people will have an impact around the world in the future."</p>
            <p>After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, for 20 years, political refugees left by boat to start new lives. Those who survived, called "boat people," were placed in refugee camps in Southeast and Northeast Asia. But because of Taiwan's limited diplomatic situation at that time, these refugees were not officially registered by the United Nations. They were different in language, society, and culture, so to Taiwanese people, these refugees were like strangers from other places.</p>
            <p>Records show that 106 babies were born in the Penghu Vietnamese refugee camp. Many of them later came back to Taiwan to find their roots. One person, Nguyen Quoc Viet, who lives in America now, shared in a press release that he recently went to New Taipei City. He visited Huang Chin-yu, the former deputy director of the Penghu refugee camp, who is over 100 years old. Nguyen thanked him for helping his parents a lot.</p>
            <p>Nguyen Quoc Viet looked at old photos and said sadly, "I was only 6 months old then. I cannot imagine how they felt having to leave everything behind. Thanks to Uncle Huang (Huang Chin-yu)'s help, we can now live happily together."</p>
            <p>Chau Kit-yee, a 70-year-old overseas Chinese from Vietnam, arrived in Penghu in 1979 and lived in the refugee camp. She met and dated Mr. Ni, a young man from Jiangmei Village. At the end of that year, they had a rare wedding inside the camp. In 1980, she gave birth to their daughter, Ni Yan-yan. The whole family settled down in Penghu. Chau Kit-yee said, "I am different from other refugees. They all left, but I stayed in Penghu and became a Penghu mother."</p>
            <p>The documentary "Strangers and Their Children" will first be shown on Public Television Service at 10 PM on July 31st. It will also be available on the "PTS+" platform. Liu Ji-hsiung hopes that through this film, more people will learn about this valuable, forgotten history.</p>

            <h1>Starlux Airlines: Direct Flights to Phoenix from January 15 Next Year, No Stops</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 29, Central News Agency) Taiwanese airlines are adding new flights to Phoenix. Starlux Airlines announced today that they will start flights from Taipei to Phoenix on January 15 next year. Tickets are on sale now. Phoenix will be Starlux Airlines' fifth destination in North America. This route will also be the first direct flight from Arizona to Asia without any stops.</p>
            <p>Taiwanese airlines are starting flights to Phoenix, USA. China Airlines announced earlier that they will begin new flights to Phoenix on December 3 this year, being the first to do so. They will use an Airbus A350-900 plane and have three round-trip flights each week.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines announced today that their flights to Phoenix will begin on January 15 next year. They see a steady demand for tourism and business in Phoenix. Also, because TSMC built a factory there, the technology industry is growing. Starlux Airlines is using this chance to grow its business in North America and improve its connecting flights between Asia and North America.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines said that the Taipei-Phoenix route will use a new generation Airbus A350 airplane. At first, there will be three flights per week. From March 2026, this will increase to four flights per week.</p>
            <p>Glenn Chai, the CEO of Starlux Airlines, said that the Starlux Taipei-Phoenix route is the first direct flight from Arizona to Asia without stops. Phoenix is the fifth largest city in the United States. Starlux Airlines believes it has great potential for business and tourism. It has many tourist attractions. In recent years, many technology companies have moved there, making Phoenix an important center for new industries. This shows that Phoenix is good for both tourism and technology.</p>
            <p>He said that in recent years, because TSMC moved there, other related industries also built factories nearby. This has led to more frequent exchanges between Taiwan and Phoenix. Starlux Airlines starting this flight will meet the growing need for travel between the two places.</p>
            <p>Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said that Starlux Airlines starting flights to Phoenix from Taipei makes Phoenix stronger as a top city in North America. It shows that Phoenix's international business is growing. It also highlights that Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is one of the best-managed airports in the world.</p>
            <p>Starlux Airlines stated that for its U.S. routes, there are currently 10 round-trip flights per week between Taipei and Los Angeles. There is one round-trip flight daily between Taipei and San Francisco, and Taipei and Seattle. Also, there are four round-trip flights per week between Taipei and Ontario, California. As Starlux Airlines continues to grow its presence in North America, travelers will have more convenient connecting flights.</p>

            <h1>Eric Chu: DPP Should Actively Discuss Dujuan Typhoon Disaster Special Act</h1>
            <p>(Taipei, July 29, Central News Agency) Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Eric Chu today asked the government to think about the people. He said that for urgent disaster relief, giving money back to people, and making the economy better, the government should stop being proud of its power. Everything should be for the people. The KMT group in the Legislative Yuan has quickly suggested a bill called "Dujuan Typhoon Post-Disaster Reconstruction Special Act." He said the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should actively talk about it to pass the bill faster.</p>
            <p>There are rumors that the Executive Yuan will not ask for a review of the special bill that would give NT$10,000 to everyone. This has caused a lot of discussion. Wu Szu-yao, the head of the DPP group in the Legislative Yuan, said today that the deadline for asking for a review is July 31. The time has not yet come, and she believes the government is still thinking about it.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu wrote on Facebook this afternoon that he saw the DPP facing a big recall election result. He said the DPP did not humbly think about it and listen to the new public opinion. Instead, they blamed the people for wanting NT$10,000. He asked if the ruling party did not know that this money was from the government collecting too much tax, and it should be given back to the people. Also, giving money to everyone is meant to encourage spending, help the economy grow, and solve economic problems caused by tariffs.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said it is rumored that the Executive Yuan wants to use a trick. They say they will not ask for a review on the surface, but they still want to go to the Constitutional Court. They might even decide not to set aside money for it. They just want to get through the second wave of big recall elections on August 23. He believes that the government is busy with politics every day and does not care about people's lives. He thinks people's anger is still growing.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu strongly said that he sincerely asks the government to think about the people. This includes urgent disaster relief, giving money back to the public, and helping the economy. He said the government should let go of its proud use of power and always put the people first. He explained that democracy is not about power. The most important thing in democracy is people's lives and their well-being. People do not want the government to focus on politics. They want to live in peace and work well.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu also said that after a big recall election, President Lai Ching-te still does not seem to care about the people and cannot see the disaster victims. Recently, the government has been slow to react to the serious damage caused by Typhoon Dujuan and the heavy rain that followed. He said that the government has not used the standard emergency procedures for helping disaster victims that Taiwan has had for a long time. Even the reconstruction plan, which should start quickly, has not been presented by the Executive Yuan yet.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu said that the KMT group in the Legislative Yuan quickly suggested a bill called "Dujuan Typhoon Post-Disaster Reconstruction Special Act." They hope that the lives of disaster victims will return to normal soon. After the Legislative Yuan approved it for a second reading, it still needs to go to discussion, which means a "cooling-off period" of one month. He said that disaster victims are still suffering now, so the DPP should actively talk with the KMT group that proposed the bill to pass it faster.</p>
