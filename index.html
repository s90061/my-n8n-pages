American consumers spent more money in March, causing retail sales to rise more than experts predicted. This increase suggests that people are still buying a lot, which means the U.S. economy remains strong. The government reported a 0.7% increase in retail sales last month. Economists had only expected a 0.3% rise.

This strong spending shows that consumers are still confident, even though interest rates are high and prices have increased recently. People are buying more goods, from cars to clothes. Sales went up at online stores, gas stations, and restaurants, as well as in other areas. This continued spending could make the Federal Reserve, America's central bank, wait longer before lowering interest rates. The Federal Reserve uses interest rates to control inflation. If the economy is too strong, it might lead to higher prices again.

The strong retail sales figures provide a clear picture of how healthy the economy is. This positive news shows that many Americans have jobs and feel secure enough to keep spending money on a variety of products and services.

**New AI Technology from Google Could Make Weather Forecasts Better**

Google DeepMind, a company known for its artificial intelligence, has created a new computer program that could greatly improve how we predict the weather. This program, called GraphCast, uses AI to learn from a massive amount of past weather data. Scientists say it can forecast weather up to 10 days ahead, doing so faster and more accurately than traditional methods.

Currently, weather forecasts rely on complex physics equations and powerful supercomputers. GraphCast, however, uses a different approach. It analyzes previous weather patterns to understand how different atmospheric conditions lead to future weather. For example, it can predict how a storm might move or how temperatures will change with high precision. In tests, GraphCast was better at predicting severe weather events like cyclones and extreme temperatures.

This new AI technology is very important because more accurate weather forecasts can help people prepare for dangerous weather and protect lives and property. It could also benefit many industries, including agriculture, travel, and energy. While traditional methods are still very valuable, this AI represents a significant step forward in understanding and predicting our planet's complex weather systems.

**Venice Introduces New Fee for Day Visitors to Manage Crowds**

The popular Italian city of Venice has begun charging a special fee for people who visit for just one day. This new rule started on April 25th and is an effort to control the large number of tourists, a problem often called "overtourism." Day-trippers now have to pay 5 euros (about $5.35) to enter the city on certain busy days.

The fee will apply on 29 specific days between late April and mid-July, mostly during weekends and holidays when the city expects the most visitors. Tourists who plan to visit Venice for a day must book their ticket online in advance and receive a QR code, which they might be asked to show at entry points. People staying overnight in hotels or other accommodations, residents, and children under 14 years old are exempt from this charge.

City officials hope this new system will encourage visitors to stay longer and help reduce the daily crowds, which can put a lot of pressure on the city's small streets and infrastructure. While some have criticized the fee, arguing it could discourage visitors, the city believes it is a necessary step to protect Venice's unique environment and improve the experience for both tourists and locals.`;
