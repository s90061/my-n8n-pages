            <h1>Putin's Special Envoy Says Some Countries Don't Want Russia-Ukraine Ceasefire, Will Try to Stop Trump-Putin Meeting</h1>
            <p>Kirill Dmitriev, who is President Putin's special envoy for international economic and investment cooperation, said today that some countries will work very hard to stop the meeting between US President Trump and Russian President Putin. Trump announced yesterday that this meeting will happen on August 15th.</p>
            <p>Trump had previously said that Russia and Ukraine are almost ready to agree to a ceasefire. This could solve the conflict that has lasted for three and a half years. The details of this agreement are not yet public. However, Ukraine might need to give up a large amount of its land. Many countries in Europe do not agree with this outcome.</p>
            <p>Dmitriev said today that some countries want the war to continue. He wrote on his Telegram social media account, "Some countries that want the conflict to keep going will definitely make big efforts to stop this planned meeting between President Putin and President Trump."</p>
            <p>Dmitriev also said that these efforts mean "actions that cause trouble and spreading false information." But he did not say which countries he meant or what kind of "trouble-making actions" they might do.</p>
            <p>The Kremlin had already confirmed that this meeting between the leaders of Russia and America will happen. Yuri Ushakov, who works for Putin, said that the two leaders will "talk mainly about ways to find a long-lasting peaceful solution for the Ukraine crisis."</p>
            <p>Ushakov also said, "This will clearly be a difficult process, but we will work hard and with energy."</p>

            <h1>World Swimming Masters Championship: 97-Year-Old Grandma Tang Cheng-yao Breaks Record, Wins Gold</h1>
            <p>In the World Aquatics Masters Championships in Singapore, a famous Taiwanese swimmer, Grandma Tang Cheng-yao, won a gold medal today. She swam in the 100-meter breaststroke for people aged 95-99. She finished the race in 5 minutes and 44.50 seconds. She also set a new record for the championship.</p>
            <p>The World Aquatics Masters Championships began in 1986. They usually happen every two years. Many water sports are part of it, such as swimming, diving, water polo, swimming in open water, and artistic swimming. Since 2015, this event has taken place at the same time as the main World Aquatics Championships.</p>
            <p>Tang Cheng-yao is 97 years old. She was the only person in her age group (95-99 years old) for the 100-meter breaststroke. Even so, Tang Cheng-yao swam strongly until the end. She was very happy to break the record for the championship. When she finished the race, all the people watching cheered for her.</p>
            <p>In May this year, Tang Cheng-yao competed in both water and land sports at the Taipei World Masters Games. She won a total of 5 gold medals. She will turn 98 in October this year. She has often said that she wants to keep moving as she gets older. She said, "I hope I can be an athlete who lives to be one hundred years old."</p>
