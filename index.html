        const text = `**Global Economy Shows Resilience, But Risks Remain, Says IMF**

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently updated its forecast for global economic growth, suggesting a slightly more positive outlook for 2024. The organization now predicts the world economy will grow by 3.1% this year, a small increase from its previous prediction of 2.9%. This improved forecast is largely due to the unexpected strength of the US economy and strong financial support from the Chinese government.

Despite this brighter picture, the IMF has warned of several potential challenges. These include ongoing problems in Chinaâ€™s property market, high levels of government debt in many countries, and possible sudden changes in the prices of raw materials like oil, especially because of conflicts in the Middle East. However, the IMF also believes that inflation, which is the rate at which prices are rising, will decrease more quickly than previously thought. This could lead central banks to cut interest rates later in the year, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and individuals.

While the overall growth forecast is up, global trade is expected to slow down. The IMF also noted that many countries have faced significant economic difficulties, including the recent cost-of-living crisis and high inflation, which have pushed millions into poverty. The world economy has shown resilience, but these underlying risks need careful management.

**Scientists Develop 'Electronic Soil' to Accelerate Plant Growth**

In a significant step forward for agriculture, scientists have created an "electronic soil" that can make plants grow much faster. This innovative material, made from cellulose (a natural fiber found in plants) and a conductive polymer, was successfully used to grow barley seedlings. Researchers observed that the barley plants grew 50% larger in just 15 days when planted in this new soil.

The electronic soil works by sending a very low electrical charge directly to the plantsâ€™ roots, which stimulates their growth. This method is highly efficient, using less water and energy compared to traditional hydroponics, a system where plants are grown in water without soil. The invention could offer a crucial solution to increasing global food production, especially as the world's population continues to grow and climate change impacts traditional farming.

This new technology is particularly promising for urban farming and vertical farms, where space is limited. By speeding up growth and reducing resource use, electronic soil could help ensure food security in areas where arable land is scarce. It represents a potential breakthrough in sustainable agriculture, offering a way to produce more food with fewer environmental resources.

**Venice Introduces Entry Fee for Day-Trippers to Combat Overtourism**

Starting on April 25, 2024, Venice will begin charging a â‚¬5 fee for day visitors entering the historic city on its busiest days. This new measure aims to manage the overwhelming number of tourists and protect the cityâ€™s delicate environment and unique cultural heritage. The trial period will last for 29 specific peak days throughout the year, primarily during spring holidays and summer weekends.

Visitors who are staying overnight in Venice, residents, commuters, children under the age of 14, and some other specific groups will be exempt from the fee. Those required to pay must book their visit online beforehand and show a QR code upon arrival. Local authorities hope this fee will encourage tourists to avoid the most crowded periods and spread out their visits, thereby reducing the pressure on the cityâ€™s infrastructure and improving the quality of life for its residents.

This initiative is part of a broader effort by Venice to combat the negative effects of overtourism, including overcrowding and damage to its historic sites. It marks a significant step for one of the worldâ€™s most popular tourist destinations, as cities worldwide seek sustainable ways to manage tourism while preserving their cultural and natural assets.`;
