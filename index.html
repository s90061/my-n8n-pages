            <h1>Incoming Economics Minister Kung Ming-hsin Discusses 3 Main Goals, Hopes to Achieve President's "Economy that Never Sleeps" Vision</h1>
            <p>Kung Ming-hsin, who will soon become the Minister of Economic Affairs, said today that he has three main goals for the future. These are: making the country's economic foundations stronger, helping traditional industries and small-to-medium businesses, and planning for the technology industry around the world. He said that small-to-medium businesses and traditional industries are very important for Taiwan's economy. "The Ministry of Economic Affairs will always support industries," he added. Also, in a changing global trade situation, it's important for high-tech companies to plan how they will work globally. He hopes to make President Lai Ching-te's idea of an "economy that never sleeps" come true.</p>
            <p>The Executive Yuan held a press conference today to announce new members of the cabinet. Premier Cho Jung-tai said that Kung Ming-hsin, who was the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, will now be the Minister of Economic Affairs. Kung Ming-hsin thanked Premier Cho Jung-tai and Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun for their trust and support over the past year. He also thanked them for letting him return to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</p>
            <p>Kung Ming-hsin spoke about the future goals of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. First, he will make the basic parts of the country's economy stronger, like energy and water management. The budget for water management will be much larger next year and in the future, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will make sure these plans happen.</p>
            <p>Second, Kung Ming-hsin said that plans to help small-to-medium businesses and water management are things Premier Cho Jung-tai specifically added to the budget. Because of this, they are very important goals. Traditional industries and small-to-medium businesses are the base of Taiwan's economy, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will always stand with them. He said that they have faced challenges like the US-China trade war and the pandemic in the past and "we got through them." He believes they can also get through current challenges with traditional industries and small-to-medium businesses this time.</p>
            <p>Third, for the technology industry, Kung Ming-hsin said that over the past 9 years, with technology growing and the "Invest in Taiwan" projects, Taiwan's industries have become a key part of the global supply chain. In the future, new plans for AI development, like silicon photonics, quantum computing, and robotics, will continue. Also, President Lai hopes that Taiwan can "stand in Taiwan, plan globally," and build an "economy that never sleeps." This is a very important step, as Taiwan's industries need to be part of the global market.</p>
            <p>Kung Ming-hsin said that the future global trade rules might change, which could affect world orders. The government needs to be ready for this. From Trump's first term to a possible second term, global supply chains and orders have changed. Facing the challenges of a new world order, how high-tech industries plan globally and make the "economy that never sleeps" policy happen are all very important issues.</p>
            <p>Finally, Kung Ming-hsin said that for the past year, he has been thinking about how to help industries plan, achieve their goals, and deal with challenges. He said he would "report to everyone when I go to Fuzhou Street (the Ministry of Economic Affairs)."</p>

            <h1>Offshore Wind Farm "Hai Ding No. 1" Environmental Review Needs More Work; Committee Asks for Better Talks with Fishermen</h1>
            <p>Today, the environmental review for the Hai Ding No. 1 offshore wind farm was discussed again. Because Hai Ding No. 1 did not get enough power capacity from the Ministry of Economic Affairs in the third phase of development (3-2), the committee suggested that a real review should happen only after the project gets its needed capacity. They also said that the company must talk more with local fishermen. The project needs to make changes and be reviewed again.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Environment today held the third meeting of a special team to review changes to the environmental impact report for the Hai Ding No. 1 offshore wind power project.</p>
            <p>The company building the wind farm said that they have changed the project. The original area of 95 square kilometers is now smaller, about 31.6 square kilometers. The maximum power of each wind turbine has changed from 12MW to 20MW. The total power produced will stay the same, but there will be fewer turbines, no more than 45. Also, to connect to the power grid more easily, a new shared path in southern Changhua was added. This path will go through a new land substation and then connect to the Yongxing switching station.</p>
            <p>Because the plan for the undersea cables is to bring them ashore in southern Changhua, local fishermen protested in Taipei. Hung Hsin-you, the head of the Changhua Environmental Protection Alliance, said that offshore wind farms have caused problems over the past 3 or 4 years. A lot of building work has made the water muddy, which affects how fishermen make a living. He also said that the cable path will "cut open" the wetlands.</p>
            <p>A local fisherman, Hung Chiu-yueh, was very angry with the company. He said that in the past, he could harvest oysters in about 1 to 1.5 years. But since the offshore wind turbines started being built, he hasn't been able to harvest for 3 years. Another fisherman, Lee Kuo-chung, said that the mud under the sea and the water currents often make the water near the coast cloudy. Oyster farmers lose at least NT$2 million a year.</p>
            <p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently announced that two wind farms, Coriolis Hai Ding No. 1 (360MW) and Wpd's Dekun wind farm (240MW), did not sign their contracts in the third phase of development (3-2).</p>
            <p>Both the Changhua County Government and the environmental review committee said that the company should get permission for the power capacity first, then submit their detailed plans for review. The committee felt that the current report was "not clear or specific." They also said the company should listen to the fishermen and offer proper payment if the project goes ahead and causes problems for local fishing and farming.</p>
            <p>The committee asked the company to add information about the worst-case effects of the undersea cables coming ashore. This includes how it would affect water quality, the seabed, sea animals, and the intertidal zone (the area between high and low tide). They also need to plan ways to reduce these effects. In addition, they should look for ways to avoid the Fanyuan Township intertidal zone and special fishing areas where the cables come ashore.</p>
            <p>The committee also asked the company to show clear maps of the wind farm, where the cables come ashore, and how these areas relate to the intertidal zone and nearby fish farms. They also need to plan how to reduce the combined effects on fish farming. The committee suggested that the project should be reviewed again after these changes are made.</p>

            <h1>Meituan's Second Quarter Profit Falls by 89% Due to Food Delivery Competition</h1>
            <p>Meituan, a big food delivery company in China, released its financial report for the second quarter on August 27. Its adjusted net profit dropped by 89%. This big drop happened because a "food delivery war" started in China in April this year. To deal with this tough competition, Meituan spent more money on promotions, advertising, and encouraging users. Its marketing costs went up by 51.8% compared to last year. The CEO, Wang Xing, clearly stated that the results were affected by "unreasonable competition."</p>
            <p>According to reports from First Financial, The Paper, and the Hong Kong Economic Times, Meituan announced its second-quarter earnings on August 27. Its income was 91.84 billion Chinese yuan (about 385.7 billion New Taiwan dollars), which is an 11.7% increase from last year. However, this was less than the expected 93.724 billion yuan. The adjusted net profit was 1.49 billion yuan, a huge drop of 89% compared to the same time last year. This was much lower than the expected 9.971 billion yuan.</p>
            <p>Many people were concerned about the impact of the "food delivery war." Meituan's main local business only made 3.721 billion yuan in operating profit in the second quarter. This is a large decrease of 11.512 billion yuan, or 75.6%, from the same period last year. The operating profit margin also fell by 19.4% to 5.7% from last year. During Meituan's earnings call, CEO Wang Xing clearly said that the second quarter results were affected by "the unreasonable competition that began this quarter."</p>
            <p>Reports say that Meituan's sales costs went up to 61.426 billion yuan, an increase of 27.0% from last year. This was because more instant delivery orders were made, delivery drivers got more money, and the company expanded its grocery delivery and international businesses. Meituan also spent more on promotions, advertising, and encouraging users to deal with the strong competition in its food delivery and instant retail businesses. In the second quarter, its sales and marketing costs reached 22.519 billion yuan, an increase of 51.8% from last year.</p>
            <p>Regarding the food delivery war this year, Wang Xing said, "We strongly disagree with pointless internal competition." However, he noted that competition in the food delivery market continues to get tougher, and Meituan will keep fighting to protect its market position. "Meituan grew through competition, and we achieved our current leading position through continuous competition." He also pointed out, "After all the fancy things, it comes down to the basics: making sure deliveries are fast and reliable, and prices are fair."</p>
            <p>However, the second-quarter financial report mainly shows the effects of the competition between Meituan and JD.com in food delivery. The competition with Taobao Flash Purchase is not yet clearly shown in the report. This means that future losses might get even bigger. It is expected that both the food delivery and core local business parts of Meituan will have significant losses in the third quarter.</p>
            <p>The day after the financial report was released, on August 28, Meituan's shares in Hong Kong dropped sharply by 9.72%, trading at 105 Hong Kong dollars.</p>
