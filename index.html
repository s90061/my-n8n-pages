            <h1>Labor Dispute Again: Boeing Fighter Jet Factory Workers to Strike Soon</h1>
            <p>Thousands of union workers at Boeing's fighter jet factories in Missouri and Illinois, USA, will start a strike very early tomorrow morning. This comes after they said no to a new work contract from the company.</p>
            <p>The IAM union (International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers) said in a statement: "About 3,200 skilled IAM union members at Boeing factories voted on August 3, 2025, to refuse the company's new four-year work agreement."</p>
            <p>The union added, "The strike will begin at midnight on Monday, August 4."</p>
            <p>Boeing, a very large airplane company, first offered to raise wages by 20% over four years and give more holiday days. But workers said no to this offer a week ago. Boeing said their new offer would double the pay raise.</p>
            <p>Dan Gillian, who is a vice president at Boeing Air Dominance and the general manager of the St. Louis factory in Missouri, said in a statement: "We are sad that our employees voted against this offer. This offer would have raised average pay by 40% and fixed their main worries about different work hours."</p>
            <p>Gillian also said, "We are ready for the strike and have started our plans to deal with it. This is to make sure that employees who are not striking can continue to help our customers."</p>
            <p>Boeing, a very old company, has had many problems since last year. These problems include issues with making products well and a seven-week strike. That strike stopped work at two of Boeing's main factories.</p>
            <p>IAM is one of the biggest unions in North America. It helps about 600,000 workers in industries like airplanes, defense, shipbuilding, transport, healthcare, and making things.</p>

            <h1>LPGA British Open: Hsu Wei-ling Tied for 6th, Sets Career Best</h1>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling, Taiwan's top female golfer, finished tied for 6th place at the LPGA British Open today. In the last round, she got 3 birdies, 1 eagle, and 3 bogeys, making her score 70. Over four days, her total score was 282, which is 6 strokes under par. This is her best result ever in this event.</p>
            <p>The British Open has a total prize money of 9.5 million US dollars. It is the last of the five biggest tournaments in the LPGA tour each year. This year, the tournament was held in Wales. Taiwan's Hsu Wei-ling and Yani Tseng both made it through to the final rounds.</p>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling started the final round from the first hole today. She got two bogeys right away. But luckily, she got a birdie on the 4th hole. Then, she got a great eagle on the 6th hole, which is a par-5 hole. This helped her get back on track.</p>
            <p>After the game, Hsu Wei-ling told reporters that she was a bit nervous at the start. Her rhythm was too fast in the first two holes. She felt a bit more relaxed after getting a birdie on the 4th hole. After getting the eagle on the 6th hole, she finally got back to her normal game rhythm.</p>
            <p>This year was Hsu Wei-ling's 8th time playing in the British Open. Her best result before this was tied for 23rd place in 2017. This year, she not only got tied for 6th place, but she also won 302,000 US dollars in prize money.</p>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling said that she did not play well on holes 14 to 17 in the first three days. She said, "So today, I told my caddie that if I could get through these four holes well, it would be fine. That's why I chose to play more carefully. Because of this, I was able to relax and get a birdie on the last hole."</p>
            <p>After four tough days at the British Open, Hsu Wei-ling decided to take at least one week off. She laughed and said, "The wind here was very strong, so strong that it even affected putting. I have played three games in Europe in four weeks, so I really need to rest. Now my knee muscles feel very sore."</p>
            <p>Hsu Wei-ling was planning to play in the LPGA Portland Classic, which starts on August 14. However, her good result at this week's British Open helped her move up to 52nd place in the LPGA rankings. This means she can afford to rest for one or two more tournaments.</p>
