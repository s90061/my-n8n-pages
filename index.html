            <h1>Judge Stops Trump from Sending National Guard to California</h1>
            <p>A federal judge today said that the U.S. government, led by President Trump, cannot use soldiers to fight crime in California. President Trump, who is a Republican, has said he might send soldiers to other American cities like Chicago.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Judge Charles Breyer, from the federal court in San Francisco, decided that Trump's government purposely broke the Posse Comitatus Act. This law stops federal military forces from helping with police work inside the country.</p>
            <p>In June, President Trump sent 4,000 National Guard members and 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. This was because people were protesting against a big operation to find immigrants.</p>
            <p>Today's decision is a setback for Trump. He wanted to use the military more inside the U.S. People who disagree with him say this is a dangerous increase in the president's power. They also say it could cause problems between the military and regular people.</p>

            <h1>Nepalese Teacher Gets 10.5 Years in Prison for Growing Marijuana, Will Be Sent Out of Taiwan</h1>
            <p>A teacher from Nepal, Mr. Jin, was involved in growing 291 marijuana plants with other people. The drugs were worth more than 20 million New Taiwan Dollars. The Shilin District Court recently sentenced Mr. Jin to 10 years and 6 months in prison. After his prison time ends or if he gets a pardon, he will be sent out of Taiwan. Mr. Ma, who was also involved in the case, was sentenced to 14 years and 6 months. They can both appeal the decision.</p>
            <p>According to the Shilin District Court's judgment, Mr. Jin, a teacher from Mexico named Mr. Sheng (whose case was handled separately), and Mr. Ma from Taiwan, grew marijuana in places like Taoyuan and Tamsui, New Taipei, between 2023 and 2024. Mr. Jin and Mr. Sheng grew the plants and dried them to make drugs. Mr. Ma then used secret words like "party" or "group buy" to sell the drugs to different people through messaging apps.</p>
            <p>Police started two investigations at the end of 2024. They found 291 marijuana plants, finished drugs, half-finished drugs, and marijuana seeds. The total weight was almost 2 kilograms, and it was worth about 20 million New Taiwan Dollars. The prosecutors asked the court to hold Mr. Ma and Mr. Sheng in custody without contact, and the court agreed. Mr. Jin was sent to prison.</p>
            <p>During the court case, Mr. Jin's lawyer said that Mr. Jin grew the marijuana to help with his pain, not to sell or give to others. Mr. Ma's lawyer said that Mr. Ma used it to treat his anorexia and make him feel hungry. Both lawyers asked for shorter sentences.</p>
            <p>The Shilin Court decided that even if Mr. Jin and Mr. Ma felt unwell, they should have gotten proper medical help. They should not have ignored the government's rules against drug crimes, which helps drugs spread. The court considered that Mr. Jin always admitted what he did. Mr. Ma only admitted to selling drugs during the trial. Based on this, they received different sentences.</p>
            <p>The Shilin Court found Mr. Jin guilty of making Class 2 illegal drugs, which breaks the Narcotics Hazard Prevention Act. He was sentenced to 10 years and 6 months in prison. After his sentence or a pardon, he will be sent out of Taiwan. Mr. Ma was found guilty of making Class 2 illegal drugs and selling Class 2 illegal drugs. He was sentenced to 14 years and 6 months in prison. They can appeal this decision.</p>
