            <h1>National Guard in Washington D.C., Trump Says He Will Patrol Streets with Military and Police Tonight</h1>
            <p>After sending the National Guard to Washington D.C. last week, US President Trump said today that he will patrol the streets of the city tonight with military and police.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Trump spoke on a radio show with Todd Starnes from Newsmax, a conservative news outlet. He said, "I think I will go out with the police tonight, and of course, the military."</p>
            <p>Trump used his power as president to send a thousand National Guard members and federal agents to Washington D.C. He said this was because of a lot of violent crime in the city.</p>
            <p>However, officials in Washington D.C. do not agree with Trump's reason. They said that official numbers from both the federal government and the city show that violent crime has gone down a lot after it increased in 2023.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, when US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth checked on the National Guard at Union Station in Washington D.C., people protesting there made a lot of noise and laughed at them.</p>
