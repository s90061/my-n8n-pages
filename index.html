        const text = `**Nvidia Becomes the Worldâ€™s Most Valuable Company**

Nvidia, a leading company that makes computer chips, recently achieved a significant milestone by becoming the worldâ€™s most valuable public company. Its market value, which is the total value of all its shares, surpassed both Microsoft and Apple. This historic moment highlights the rapid growth and importance of artificial intelligence (AI) in today's economy.

The main reason for Nvidia's rise is the extremely high demand for its specialized chips, called GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). These chips are essential for training and running complex AI models. As more and more companies invest in developing AI technologies, they rely heavily on Nvidia's powerful hardware. The company's stock price has soared, reflecting investors' strong belief in its future in the AI industry. Experts believe that the demand for AI technology will continue to grow, keeping Nvidia at the forefront of this technological revolution.

**The Four-Day Work Week: A Growing Trend**

The idea of a four-day work week is becoming increasingly popular around the world, with many companies experimenting with this new model. Instead of working five days a week, employees work just four days, often with no reduction in pay. This means they get a three-day weekend every week. The aim is to improve employees' work-life balance and overall well-being.

Early trials of the four-day week have shown promising results. Companies report that employees are often more productive, less stressed, and take fewer sick days. This can lead to happier staff and better quality work. Some businesses have even seen an increase in profits. However, the four-day week is not suitable for every industry, particularly those requiring constant customer service or manufacturing. Despite these challenges, the movement is gaining momentum, with more governments and businesses considering it as a standard working model for the future.

**Europe Faces Intense Heatwaves as Climate Change Impacts Worsen**

Parts of Europe are currently experiencing severe heatwaves, with temperatures reaching dangerously high levels. Several countries, including Greece, Italy, and Turkey, have recorded temperatures well above average, leading to discomfort and serious health risks for residents and tourists. The extreme heat is causing problems like dehydration, heatstroke, and increased pressure on emergency services.

Scientists confirm that these intense and frequent heatwaves are a clear sign of climate change. As global temperatures rise due to human activities, extreme weather events become more common and more severe. Beyond immediate health concerns, the heat also contributes to drought conditions, increases the risk of wildfires, and puts a strain on energy grids as people use more air conditioning. Experts emphasize that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to these new climate realities.`;
