            <h1>US Stock Market Reaches New Highs as Data Unlikely to Stop Rate Cuts</h1>
            <p>After the US released new information about consumer prices, some experts believe it will not change the Federal Reserve's plan to cut interest rates next week. Today, the three main US stock market indexes reached new record highs in early trading.</p>
            <p>AFP reported that the US Department of Labor announced today that the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 2.9% in August compared to the same month last year. This is faster than the 2.7% increase in July.</p>
            <p>Experts said this number was mostly what people expected. However, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits for the first time went up, which caught more attention. Other experts believe that last month's CPI will not stop the Fed from cutting interest rates next week.</p>
            <p>In early trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 536.23 points, or 1.18%, to 46027.15 points. The S&P 500 index went up by 44.41 points, or 0.68%, to 6576.45 points.</p>
            <p>The Nasdaq Composite Index, which has many technology companies, rose by 121.44 points, or 0.56%, to 22070.50 points. These three main indexes all reached new record highs during the trading day.</p>
            <p>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in the week ending September 6, 263,000 people applied for unemployment benefits for the first time. This was 27,000 more than the week before and the highest number since October 2021.</p>
            <p>Art Hogan, a strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, said, "What was truly important today was the number of people who applied for unemployment benefits last week. This shows that the job market is clearly getting weaker. So, the Federal Reserve's goal of having enough jobs for everyone will be key to their decisions."</p>
            <p>Hogan expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 0.75% (75 basis points) before the end of the year.</p>

            <h1>China's Fujian Aircraft Carrier Seen in East China Sea, Japan Sends Plane to Watch</h1>
            <p>Today, for the first time, Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force saw China's aircraft carrier, the Fujian. It was sailing in the East China Sea, about 200 kilometers northwest of the Diaoyutai Islands (which China calls the Senkaku Islands). The Fujian was sailing southwest with two missile destroyers. Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force sent a P-3C anti-submarine plane to watch it.</p>
            <p>Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported that Japan's Ministry of Defense said a Japanese P-3C anti-submarine plane saw the Fujian sailing southwest around 1 PM today (noon Taiwan time). It was about 200 kilometers northwest of the Diaoyutai Islands. Also, a Chinese Navy Sovremenny-class missile destroyer and a Luyang II-class missile destroyer were sailing with it.</p>
            <p>The Fujian is China's third aircraft carrier. It was built after the Liaoning and Shandong carriers. The Fujian weighs more than 80,000 tons and is 315 meters long. People say it is "the world's largest conventionally powered warship."</p>
            <p>The Fujian has an advanced electromagnetic catapult system that helps fighter jets take off. Today, when Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force saw the Fujian, there were no aircraft on its deck.</p>
            <p>Japan's Nikkei newspaper reported that the 2025 Defense White Paper says the Fujian can carry about 60 to 70 J-15 fighter jets. As of the end of March this year, the Fujian was doing tests at sea. Japan's Ministry of Defense did not say if the Fujian is officially working yet.</p>
            <p>The report also said that the Chinese Navy keeps doing things that challenge Japan in the waters near Japan. In June, Japan's Ministry of Defense saw the Liaoning and Shandong carriers sailing in the Pacific Ocean at the same time. At that time, a J-15 fighter jet from the Shandong carrier flew close to a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force P-3C anti-submarine plane.</p>
