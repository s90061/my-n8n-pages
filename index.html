            <h1>Trump's New Plan to Bring Back Manufacturing: What it Means for the American Dream</h1>
            <p>(CNA Taipei, August 1) After becoming president, Donald Trump promised a plan to make manufacturing strong again. He wants to bring jobs back to America. The August issue of "Global Central" magazine has a cover story called "Trump's American Dream." It explains how Trump plans to make manufacturing better, the problems he faces, how conservative ideas are growing in American society, and how Taiwan, the EU, and China view this "American Dream."</p>
            <p>"The American Dream is coming back. It will be stronger than before and unstoppable," said 79-year-old Trump. He gave a speech in Congress in March this year. He told the world that a good time for America was starting.</p>
            <p>After he became president, he signed many orders. He promised to use high taxes on imported goods to help American manufacturing. He wants to bring jobs back to the country. This will create more jobs, make supply chains shorter, and help America be more independent in its economy.</p>
            <p>China makes 230 times more ships each year than the US. Because of this big difference, Trump also dreams of rebuilding the shipbuilding industry in America. But to make manufacturing strong again, the US needs to fix three main problems: not enough skilled workers, weak technology, and complicated supply chains.</p>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic, artificial intelligence (AI), and Trump's global trade war have changed jobs in America. Young Americans are now more interested in working for family businesses. Also, more young people are choosing blue-collar jobs, which are jobs that require manual labor.</p>
            <p>Trump's conservative ideas have also made society more right-wing. Young men from Generation Z strongly support Trump's return to the White House. On social media, there is also a trend for women to be "traditional wives."</p>
            <p>However, Trump's strict rules about immigration, cutting money for research at universities, and making it harder for international students to get visas have caused skilled people to leave. This also makes the atmosphere tense on university campuses. America no longer seems to be a place where talented people from all over the world can come to follow their dreams.</p>
            <p>The way Egyptians speak is like a dish with many different spices. They use big, fancy words, poetic comparisons, and ideas from Islam to show the warmth and beauty of their language.</p>
            <p>Sweet words are very important in Egypt for social interactions. When foreigners first hear these words, they might think they are not real. But this is part of how Egyptians talk. They can easily use these words, and it is a natural and polite way of talking to others.</p>
            <p>In Argentina, where prices are rising very quickly (over 100%), birthday parties still happen. In this country, even when the economy is very unstable, people still choose to have birthday parties with music, balloons, and laughter. It's like they are telling the uncertain world, "We can still control some things."</p>
            <p>"Global Central" magazine has a special section called "Unpacking the Global Village." In this section, reporters from all five continents share what they see in different countries. From a Taiwanese point of view, they talk about food, clothes, housing, transport, education, entertainment, social systems, various experiences, and culture shock when living abroad.</p>
            <p>In this issue, the "Seeing the World" section talks about wetlands, which are like the Earth's kidneys. It shows the natural red salt flats in the San Francisco Bay Area, the natural water reserve called Walthamstow Wetlands in London, the Tin Shui Wai Wetland Park in Hong Kong where you can watch birds and fish, the Benjakitti Park in Bangkok which creates many different homes for animals, the Gaomei Wetland which is a must-visit place, the Shezi Island Wetland that connects Taipei's natural areas, and the Beijing Cuihu Wetland Park where it is very hard to get tickets.</p>
            <p>You can subscribe to "Global Central" magazine for one year (12 issues) for a special price of NT$1,280. Students can get a discount price of NT$998. Please call (02)2505-1180, extension 817. You can also buy digital versions of "Global Central" from the CNA eBook website, ysgoshopping.com. Each digital issue costs NT$79. We welcome you to try it.

            <h1>US to Punish Two Taiwan Companies, Mecatron and Joemars, for Helping Iran's Drone Program</h1>
            <p>(CNA Reporter Chung Yu-chen, Washington, July 31) The US State Department today said that some companies and people in China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong helped Iran get technology and equipment for its drone program. The US will now punish them. According to a statement from the US Treasury Department, the two companies in Taiwan that will be punished are Mecatron Machinery Co Ltd and Joemars Machinery and Electric Industrial Co Ltd, both located in Taichung.</p>
            <p>The US State Department said in a statement this afternoon that the US is punishing five companies and one person today. These companies and people are in Iran, China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, for the reasons mentioned above.</p>
            <p>This action is part of "National Security Presidential Memorandum-2," signed by President Trump. Its purpose is to stop Iran from making more missiles and other unusual or normal weapons.</p>
            <p>The State Department said that the US will use all possible ways, including punishing companies in other countries, to find and stop Iran's attempts to buy equipment and materials for its drone program. This program causes problems and instability in the Middle East and wider areas.</p>
            <p>According to the US Treasury Department's statement, an Iranian company called Control Afzar bought Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines and equipment for HESA. HESA is the Iran Aircraft Manufacturing Industrial Company, which is controlled by Iran's Ministry of Defense.</p>
            <p>CNC machines are used to make high-level parts for airplanes and defense. They can make very exact and strong parts for both civilian and military planes.</p>
            <p>The Treasury Department said that Control Afzar used Mecatron Machinery Co Ltd and Joemars Machinery and Electric Industrial Co Ltd to send CNC machines and equipment to Iran. These companies knew they were helping to avoid sanctions and export rules.</p>
            <p>Joemars Machinery and Electric Industrial Co Ltd also has a smaller company in China called "Changzhou Joemars Industrial Automation Co Ltd."</p>
            <p>According to Joemars' website, the company started in 1989. Its products include wire-cutting electrical discharge machines and high-speed small-hole electrical discharge machines. Mecatron's website says it has 30 years of experience in making machine tools, selling them, and all the technical operations.</p>
            <p>The US Treasury Department stated that all money and property owned or controlled by these five companies and one person in the US, or by American people, are frozen. Accounts of companies that they directly or indirectly own (50% or more) are also frozen.</p>
            <p>Generally, rules from the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Treasury Department stop Americans or people in the US from doing business with the frozen money or property. This is unless OFAC gives special permission or there are special exceptions.</p>
            <p>Also, no related business can happen during transit in the US.</p>
            <p>The Treasury Department's statement says that breaking US sanctions can lead to civil or criminal punishment for people in the US and other countries. Also, banks and other people who take part in certain business or activities with those who are being punished might also face punishment. (Edited by Chen Hui-ping) August 1, 2025.</p>
