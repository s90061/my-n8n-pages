            <h1>CK Hutchison: Selling Port Business Will Take Longer, Won't Finish in 2025</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Taipei, August 14) Chinese financial news says that CK Hutchison's leaders talked about their half-year business results today. They said that selling their port business is now in a "new stage." For example, they have asked important Chinese investors to join the talks. They hope to get "approval from all the right government groups." This will take more time than they first thought, and the sale will not be done in 2025.</p>
            <p>Daily Economic News reported that CK Hutchison's leaders said at the meeting that selling port businesses has "different things to think about for government groups in different countries."</p>
            <p>CK Hutchison's leaders said that the company had already stated it would not do any deal until all the right government groups and departments approved it. Now, the sale is in a "new stage." They have asked "mainland (China) important investors" to join the talks. They hope to get "approval from all the right government groups."</p>
            <p>According to the report, CK Hutchison's leaders said that this process will take more time than they planned. The sale will not be finished in 2025.</p>
            <p>On March 4, CK Hutchison said that they had a first agreement with BlackRock from the US and Terminal Investment Limited (TiL). They planned to sell 43 port businesses outside Hong Kong, including two ports at both ends of the Panama Canal. This made China very unhappy, and CK Hutchison felt pressure.</p>
            <p>After this, on July 28, CK Hutchison announced on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that the special talking period with the group was over. But CK Hutchison is still talking with the members of that group. They also want to ask "important strategic investors" from China to join and become "important members" of the group. The group members and the way the deal is set up need to change so that all the right government groups will approve the sale. CK Hutchison will not do any deal until all the right government groups and departments approve it.</p>

            <h1>One Volunteer Firefighter Dies in Spain, Summer Wildfire Deaths Reach Three</h1>
            <p>(Central News Agency, Madrid, August 14) Today, Spanish officials said that a volunteer firefighter died while fighting a fire in the Leon area in northwestern Spain. This means that three people have now died because of wildfires this summer.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Nicanor Sen Velez, the head of the Castile and Leon region, wrote on X: "Today, we are sad for the firefighter who died while fighting a fire in the Valderia area of Leon province. He is the newest person to die in the summer wildfires."</p>
            <p>Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Spain's Interior Minister, confirmed this death when he was interviewed by Spanish Broadcasting Corporation. He sent his sadness to the family, co-workers, and community of the person who died.</p>
            <p>Before this, Grande-Marlaska asked the European Union (EU) for help to put out the fires.</p>
            <p>The Spanish government specifically asked for two planes that drop water to help fight the fires. Before this, local governments said that nearly 6,000 people had to leave their homes in 26 towns.</p>
            <p>Spain is one of several European countries that have been very hot this week. The high temperatures are making the wildfires worse. Scientists say that changes in the climate caused by people are making this problem bigger.</p>
            <p>So far this year, Spain has had 199 wildfires. These fires have burned almost 98,784 hectares of land. This is more than twice the area that burned during the same time last year.</p>
