            <h1>India's Pilots Want Boeing 787 Planes Stopped Because of Problems</h1>
            <p>The Indian Pilots' Association is worried about many problems with Air India's Boeing 787 airplanes. They have sent letters to the Civil Aviation Authority and the Ministry of Civil Aviation. They want all these planes to stop flying and be checked carefully.</p>
            <p>The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that Air India's Boeing 787 planes had two electronic problems in October. Because of this, the pilots' group wrote to the government body that controls airlines. They asked for all Boeing 787 planes in Air India to have their electronic parts checked fully. They also want these two recent problems to be looked into.</p>
            <p>On October 4th, an Air India flight from Amritsar, India, to Birmingham, UK, had a problem. When the plane was landing, a special emergency power device called a "Ram Air Turbine" (RAT) turned on by itself. This made the plane stay in the UK after it landed.</p>
            <p>Another Air India plane on October 9th was flying from Vienna, Austria, to New Delhi, India. During the flight, systems like the autopilot and flight controls stopped working. The plane had to land quickly in Dubai. After a short stop and necessary checks, it flew again and arrived in New Delhi.</p>
            <p>India Today newspaper said that the Indian Pilots' Association sent a letter to the Civil Aviation Authority on October 5th. Today, they sent another letter to Mr. K Ram Mohan Naidu, the Minister of Civil Aviation. This shows how worried the pilots' group is.</p>
            <p>In their letter to the Civil Aviation Authority, the pilots' group said that Air India's planes often have problems with their electronic parts. So, they asked the authority to do a special check.</p>
            <p>In the letter to Minister Naidu, the Indian Pilots' Association said that these two incidents with Air India were "big problems with the planes." They also said that the "autopilot system suddenly failed, causing many important parts to stop working."</p>
            <p>The pilots' group also remembered a plane crash in June that killed at least 260 people. They said that if the reasons for the Boeing 787 problems are not found, air travel will not be safe.</p>
            <p>The Indian Pilots' Association said, "We ask the Minister to stop all Air India Boeing 787 planes from flying. We also ask for a full check, especially of the electronic parts. This is because there are more and more problems, and this greatly affects flight safety."</p>
            <p>The Indian Pilots' Association made three requests to Minister Naidu. First, they want a full investigation into the two recent problems. Second, they want all Air India Boeing 787 planes to stop flying and have all their electronic parts and other systems that often fail checked completely. Third, they want the Civil Aviation Authority to do a special review of Air India, including what is in the company's Minimum Equipment List (MEL).</p>
            <p>NDTV reported that even though the Indian Pilots' Association made strong demands, Air India strongly said that their planes do not have electronic problems.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for Air India said, "Air India always puts the safety of passengers and crew first." They also said that the RAT device turning on in the October 4th flight was "not caused by a system fault, and pilots did not start it." They added that the October 9th flight changed its path because of "technical issues." It landed safely in Dubai for a short time, then took off again and arrived in New Delhi without problems.</p>

            <h1>Explosion at a Bomb Factory in Tennessee, USA: Many People Dead or Missing</h1>
            <p>Today, a bad explosion happened at a factory in Tennessee, USA. This factory makes explosives. Emergency workers quickly went to the place. Authorities asked people to stay away from the area. Reports say that many people have died and others are missing.</p>
            <p>The Sheriff's office in Hickman County, Tennessee, wrote on Facebook, "We can say that an explosion happened at the Accurate Energetic Systems factory. This factory makes explosives and is in the Bucksnort area."</p>
            <p>The Sheriff's office said, "Emergency workers are now at the place. Please stay away from this area. This will help the rescue workers do their job well."</p>
            <p>The Hickman County Mayor's office told AFP news agency that they could not quickly say if anyone had died or what caused the explosion.</p>
            <p>However, US news reports said that Sheriff Chris Davis of Humphreys County stated that "several people died" because of the explosion. Also, many other people are missing.</p>
            <p>NBC News quoted Sheriff Davis saying, "Several people are still not found. We are trying our best to think about their families. We can confirm that several people have indeed died."</p>
            <p>Accurate Energetic Systems is a company that started in 1980. It makes explosives. The company has not yet answered questions from AFP news agency.</p>

            <h1>Switzerland Hopes to Make a New Trade Deal with China Early Next Year</h1>
            <p>Switzerland's Foreign Minister, Ignazio Cassis, spoke with China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, today. After their talk, Cassis said that Switzerland wants to sign a new and improved free trade agreement with China by early 2026.</p>
            <p>Reuters news agency reported that China is Switzerland's third biggest trading partner, after the United States and the European Union. The current trade agreement started in 2014. In August, the US added high taxes on Swiss products. This makes updating the trade agreement between China and Switzerland even more important now.</p>
            <p>After the meeting, Cassis told reporters in Bellinzona, "We are happy that our talks to update the trade agreement are going well. Both sides want to finish this work as soon as possible."</p>
            <p>He also said, "We probably won't be able to finish the agreement by the end of this year, as we first hoped. But now, we are aiming to create a more open, fair trade situation that follows international free trade rules by early next year."</p>
            <p>China and Switzerland signed a free trade agreement in 2013. However, some Swiss products, like watches and medicines, still have high taxes when they enter China. China also wants to get more investments from Switzerland. The first agreement did not offer many ways for service businesses to operate freely.</p>
            <p>In the past, talks to update the free trade agreement stopped for a while. This happened because people outside China were worried about how China treats human rights.</p>
            <p>In recent years, Switzerland has been trying to work more with other countries for trade. This helps them spread out their risks and find new places to sell their goods.</p>
            <p>In July this year, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) signed a trade agreement with countries in South America's MERCOSUR group. EFTA includes Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This new agreement covers 95% of what Switzerland sells to other countries. Last year, EFTA also signed a deal with India. This deal lowers taxes on products like medicines, machines, watches, and optical tools when they are sent to India.</p>
