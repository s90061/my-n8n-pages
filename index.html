            <h1>Art Banana Worth NT$180 Million Eaten Again</h1>
            <p>A visitor recently took a bite out of a fresh banana that was part of an art piece. The banana was taped to a wall and was worth about 180 million New Taiwan Dollars (NT$). This happened at the Pompidou Centre-Metz in eastern France. This is not the first time this art piece has been eaten.</p>
            <p>The art piece is called "Comedian." Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan created it. It uses a banana taped to a wall. This bold artwork was sold for 6.2 million US dollars (about 182 million NT$) in New York last year.</p>
            <p>Cattelan said he was sad that the visitor did not eat the banana peel and the tape too.</p>
            <p>The Pompidou Centre-Metz said that after the visitor ate the art piece on July 12th, "security guards quickly and calmly stepped in." The art piece was "put back up in a few minutes."</p>
            <p>The museum added: "Because bananas go bad easily, we change them regularly as the artist told us to."</p>
            <p>Cattelan said the visitor who ate the banana "mixed up fruit and art." This is because the person "only ate the banana itself, not the peel or the tape."</p>
            <p>"Comedian" has been eaten before. When it was first shown in 2019 at the Art Basel show in Miami Beach, Florida, a performance artist named David Datuna ate it. He said he was "hungry" at the time.</p>
            <p>Justin Sun, a cryptocurrency businessman born in China, bought the art piece for 6.2 million US dollars last year. He also ate the banana in front of cameras.</p>
            <p>Cattelan's artwork caused strong opinions when it was first shown. Cattelan said "Comedian" is a comment on the art market. He has said before that the art market is too focused on making money and does not help artists enough.</p>
            <p>The New York Post, an American newspaper, said in 2019 that "Comedian" cost 120,000 US dollars (about 3.53 million NT$). This showed that the art market was "crazy" (using the word "banana," which means crazy in some slang).</p>
            <p>Besides "Comedian," Cattelan is also known for another art piece called "America." This piece is a real toilet made of 18-carat gold. During Donald Trump's first time as US President, the museum that owned this piece offered to lend it to the White House.</p>

            <h1>Singapore Names Hacker Group, China Says It Is Not Involved</h1>
            <p>Singapore's Minister for Home Affairs, K. Shanmugam, said that cyberattacks have increased in recent years. One group responsible is a hacker group called UNC3886. He said Singapore will continue to make its online defenses stronger. A cybersecurity company believes this group is connected to China. China has said it is not involved.</p>
            <p>Newspapers like Lianhe Zaobao reported that Singapore's Cyber Security Agency celebrated its 10th anniversary. Minister Shanmugam, who also handles national security, spoke at the dinner. He talked about the online security threats Singapore is facing now.</p>
            <p>Shanmugam said that serious cyberattacks in Singapore increased more than four times between 2021 and 2024. The government found earlier that international hacker groups tried to get into some important basic systems. One group that made such attacks in the past was the hacker group called UNC3886. "This group's goal is very clear. They target important places that have high value and are important for strategy, including crucial systems that provide necessary services." The Singapore government will keep making its online protection stronger, focusing on stopping and preventing threats.</p>
            <p>Lianhe Zaobao said that Shanmugam spoke to the media after a community event today. He talked about naming specific hacker groups. He said that after thinking about it, the authorities felt it was important for Singaporeans to understand the online security threats they face. "The number of incidents we share is much less than the actual number of attacks. For reasons of national security or public interest, we do not share all incidents."</p>
            <p>Mandiant, a cybersecurity company owned by Google, said that UNC3886 is a spy group linked to China. This group has attacked defense, technology, and telecom organizations in the United States and Asia.</p>
            <p>According to Lianhe Zaobao, China's CCTV.com reported that a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Singapore said that when Singaporean media reported on cyberattacks in Singapore, they used information from a certain country's cybersecurity company that said the UNC3886 group was linked to China. China "strongly opposes any false accusations against China."</p>

            <h1>Taipei Tech and United Hospital Deny Being Part of NTNU Women's Soccer Blood Test Case</h1>
            <p>Coach Chou Tai-ying of National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's soccer team is thought to have used threats of losing credits to make players take part in a research blood test. A professor from Taipei City University (Taipei Tech) and a doctor from Taipei City Hospital (United Hospital) were also said to be involved. Taipei Tech said today that this is not true. United Hospital said the doctor did not actually take part in or do this research.</p>
            <p>After the NTNU women's soccer blood test case became known, it has been a big topic in society for days. Media reported that besides Coach Chou Tai-ying becoming the main target, the research team also included a professor from Taipei City University and a doctor from Taipei City United Hospital, Ren'ai Branch.</p>
            <p>Taipei Tech said today that what the media reported is not true. The professor was not a co-leader of the research project and did not take part in doing it.</p>
            <p>United Hospital's Ren'ai Branch explained that the doctor's name was listed as a co-leader because they could give advice to the research team based on their special knowledge. However, their role was to give expert advice in their field. Also, after looking into it, this doctor did not actually take part in planning the research, collecting information, or doing the work. They also have not yet given any advice or worked together further.</p>
