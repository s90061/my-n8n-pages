Barbora Krejcikova, the champion from last year's Wimbledon women's singles, lost in the third round today. She was defeated by American player Emma Navarro with scores of 6-2, 3-6, 4-6. Iga Swiatek, a former world No. 1 from Poland, easily won her match in two sets and is now in the round of 16.

Krejcikova, who is the 17th seed, won the first set but then played worse. In the last set, she seemed very tired and even needed a doctor. Krejcikova has had back problems this season. She got upset and cried when the score was 3-5 in the final set, but she still fought hard to keep her serve and make the score 4-5. However, Navarro, the 10th seed, stayed calm and won the match. Navarro will now play against Mirra Andreeva, an 18-year-old Russian player who is the 7th seed.

In another match, Iga Swiatek easily won her third-round match at Wimbledon. She beat American player Danielle Collins 6-2, 6-3. Swiatek wants to show she can play well on grass courts. She broke Collins' serve early in the first set and then won the set with strong serves. Collins had beaten Swiatek earlier this year, but she made many mistakes in this match. Swiatek, who has won five Grand Slam titles but only reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon before, won her match with a strong forehand shot. She will play Clara Tauson from Denmark, the 23rd seed, next.

**Texas Floods Kill 27, 27 Children Missing from Summer Camp**

Heavy rain in Texas, USA, has caused severe floods, killing at least 27 people. Search teams are looking for 27 girls missing from a summer camp near a river. Weather forecasts say there will be even more rain.

Larry Leitha, the sheriff of Kerr County, Texas, said that over 850 people who were not hurt have been rescued, along with 8 injured people. He also said that 27 people have died, including 9 children. Leitha promised that they will keep searching until everyone is found. Dalton Rice, an official in Kerrville, Texas, said that hundreds of people are helping with the rescue, many using helicopters.

The floods started yesterday when several months' worth of rain fell in just a few hours. This caused the Guadalupe River to rise by 8 meters in only 45 minutes. The National Weather Service has warned that more heavy rain is coming, which could cause "local catastrophic" floods northwest of San Antonio. Today, the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, which is usually calm, became very fast and carried a lot of things floating in the muddy water. Gerardo Martinez, a 61-year-old local, said, "It rained a whole year's worth in just one day." He also said, "The water went up to the tops of the trees, about 10 meters... cars and houses were washed away by the river, it was really terrible."

Rice also stated today that 27 children from the Camp Mystic Christian summer camp in Kerr County are still missing because of the flood. American news has reported, based on what families said, that two of the missing girls have died.

**US Wishes Dalai Lama Happy 90th Birthday, Supports Tibetans' Right to Choose Leader**

Ahead of the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sent a message today. He wished the Tibetan spiritual leader a happy birthday and said that the Dalai Lama continues to inspire people with messages of unity and peace. The US strongly supports respecting the human rights and freedoms of Tibetans. It also supports their right to freely choose their religious leaders without outside interference.

The Dalai Lama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize, has lived in India since 1959. He will turn 90 on July 6th. Rubio's statement on behalf of the US congratulated the Dalai Lama. He mentioned that the Dalai Lama's messages of unity, peace, and kindness continue to inspire people. Rubio also said that the US is committed to protecting the human rights and basic freedoms of Tibetans. "We support efforts to keep the unique language, culture, and religious traditions of Tibetans safe, including their right to freely choose and follow their religious leaders without interference," he added.

Tibet tried to fight against Chinese rule in 1959 but failed. The Dalai Lama then left Tibet and has lived in Dharamshala, India, ever since. News reports say that a few days ago, the Dalai Lama said he would be reborn after he dies. This was to calm worries about who would follow him. China sees the Dalai Lama as someone who wants to separate Tibet from China. China insists that the next Dalai Lama must be approved by Chinese leaders, as this is an old tradition from the time of emperors. The Dalai Lama has said that he will be reborn in a "free world." Earlier this week, he told his followers that only his non-profit organization, "Dalai Lama Gaden Phodrang Foundation," has the right to identify his future reincarnation.
