Taiwan's central bank has issued a warning that the United States' quickly increasing national debt might negatively affect confidence in U.S. Treasury bonds. The central bank governor stated that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important globally, the continuous growth of debt could present risks. Taiwan, a significant holder of U.S. debt, is closely observing these developments, highlighting concerns about the long-term sustainability of the debt and its potential impact on international financial markets.

**Key Chipmakers Face Risk as US Considers Revoking China Waivers**

The United States is reportedly planning to cancel waivers that currently allow global chip manufacturers to send American technology to their factories in China. This potential policy change could significantly impact major companies such as Samsung, SK Hynix, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). If these waivers are revoked, it would mean that these chipmakers would require individual licenses to export American semiconductor equipment to their facilities in China. This move is seen as a way to further restrict China's access to advanced chip technology, especially as concerns rise about its use in China's military and artificial intelligence development.

**Taiwan Adds Huawei and SMIC to Export Control List, Affecting China's AI Chip Goals**

Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs has officially included Chinese chipmakers Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on its export control list. This decision is expected to be a major obstacle to China's development of artificial intelligence chips. The move aligns Taiwan more closely with Washington's efforts to restrict companies that are advancing Beijingâ€™s AI capabilities. Experts suggest that while not a direct response to a single event, the discovery of TSMC-made chips in Huawei products last year prompted Taiwan to review its oversight mechanisms to prevent indirect supply chain loopholes. This action highlights increasing trade and technology tensions between Taiwan, China, and the United States.
