            <h1>US and China might agree on TikTok; US lawmakers are worried about China's continued influence.</h1>
            <p>Washington, September 17 (Reuters) â€“ Reports say that the United States and China might agree on a plan for the video app TikTok. This plan would change who owns TikTok to US control. Today, John Moolenaar, who leads a US House committee about competition with China, said he is worried about this.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Moolenaar made a statement. He said, "Based on early reports, I am worried that the new TikTok might still use ByteDance's computer programs and apps. This could mean the Chinese Communist Party still has control or influence."</p>
            <p>Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary, recently said that the US and China have a basic agreement for TikTok. This agreement is made so that US owners can control it.</p>
            <p>US President Trump also mentioned that he has an agreement with China about TikTok. He said many big companies want to buy it. He will talk to Chinese President Xi Jinping to make sure everything is confirmed.</p>
