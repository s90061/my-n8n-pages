            <h1>Philippine Military: Joint Patrols to Increase Due to China's South China Sea Expansion</h1>
            <p>The Philippine navy said that they will do more joint patrols with other countries. This is because China is strongly expanding in the South China Sea. More countries will also join these patrols.</p>
            <p>Roy Trinidad, who speaks for the Philippine navy, said today that China's actions change every time the Philippines and other countries do "Maritime Cooperation Activities" (MCA) together. These joint patrols include areas like Scarborough Shoal and islands north of the Philippines.</p>
            <p>Trinidad said, "We have seen that China does not threaten or attack foreign ships when they sail in Philippine waters."</p>
            <p>He pointed out that in 2023, the Philippines only did 3 joint patrols with countries that think like them in the "West Philippine Sea." In 2024, this number went up to 11 times. This year, they have already done more than 10 patrols.</p>
            <p>The "West Philippine Sea" is what the Philippines calls the area it claims in the South China Sea. This area includes 200 nautical miles of sea from the Philippines' coast, which is their special economic zone. This area is also claimed by China using its ten-dash line. For many years, both countries have had problems in these disputed waters.</p>
            <p>In November 2023, the Philippines and the United States did their first joint patrol called "Maritime Cooperation Activities." After that, countries like Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, France, and India also joined. Manila sees this as other countries supporting the Philippines' stance in the South China Sea.</p>
            <p>Trinidad said that other countries have shown they want to join. In the future, the Philippines will do joint patrols with even more countries in the "West Philippine Sea."</p>
            <p>On the other hand, on August 11, Chinese warships and coast guard ships forced a Philippine coast guard boat away near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea. Even though two Chinese ships crashed into each other, experts think that China using warships makes the situation more tense.</p>
            <p>The media asked how the Philippine military would help the coast guard if something similar happens again. Trinidad said the military has a plan for emergencies. They will act differently for different situations, but he did not share the details.</p>
            <p>Trinidad said that China's actions will not change how the Philippines protects its waters.</p>

            <h1>New Taipei City to Broadcast Warnings Before Towing Illegally Parked Cars, Starting September for One Year</h1>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Transportation announced today that they will try a new rule for one year starting in September. Before towing illegally parked cars, they will broadcast a warning. This will happen every day from 9 AM to 12 PM and from 2 PM to 7 PM. However, cars parked illegally near schools, or within 10 meters of bus stops, will be towed right away without a warning.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Department of Transportation said in a press release that they signed new agreements with towing companies this year. These agreements say that all tow trucks must have broadcasting equipment. They will use this equipment to warn drivers before towing their cars. This new plan will be tested for one year starting in September.</p>
            <p>The Department of Transportation said that currently, tow trucks in New Taipei City do not need to use sirens or broadcasts. They added the broadcast system to encourage people to move their cars faster. The department also said that to avoid disturbing people living nearby and to keep things safe and orderly, warnings before towing will only happen from 9 AM to 12 PM and from 2 PM to 7 PM.</p>
            <p>The department reminded that for places important for pedestrian safety, like near schools, libraries, hospitals, sidewalks, and crosswalks, cars parked illegally will be towed right away without a warning. This also applies to cars parked within 10 meters of bus stops (front or back), cars parked next to another car (double parking), or cars parked within 10 meters of an intersection.</p>
            <p>The department added that broadcasting before towing is a reminder and a helpful step, but it is not a required part of law enforcement. The police department will continue to fine and tow illegally parked cars as per Article 56 of the Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act. During the trial period, the department will keep collecting opinions from everyone. The Department of Transportation also asked people to follow traffic rules and not park illegally to avoid their cars being towed.</p>
