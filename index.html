            <h1>Trump suggests returning money from taxes; Republicans say pay off national debt first</h1>
            <p>US President Trump suggested giving back money from new taxes on imported goods to the public. He called this a 'tax refund.' But Republican lawmakers in the Senate do not like this idea. Some of them think the money from these taxes should be used to pay back the country's debt first.</p>
            <p>The Washington Post reported that by mid-July, the US government had collected over 93 billion US dollars from these taxes. Most Republican lawmakers want to use all this money to reduce the national debt.</p>
            <p>The US national debt is now more than 36 trillion US dollars. In early July, big tax cuts and immigration laws supported by Republicans were made into law. Because of this, the national debt is expected to grow by another 3.4 trillion US dollars in the next 10 years.</p>
            <p>Last week, Donald Trump told reporters, 'Paying off our debt is an important goal. But we are also thinking about tax refunds. We have so much money from tariffs, so giving a little refund to people with a certain income level would be great.'</p>
            <p>However, the US Congress must pass a law for Trump's idea to happen.</p>
            <p>On July 28, Republican Senator Josh Hawley from Missouri suggested a plan. He wants to use the tax money to give taxpayers a 600 US dollar refund. Each child who depends on the taxpayer would also get 600 US dollars. With this plan, a family of four would get 2,400 US dollars.</p>
            <p>But most Republican Senators said that the government's most important job is to get rid of debt.</p>
            <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin said, 'We already owe 37 trillion US dollars, and we are spending almost 2 trillion US dollars more than we get. I do not support this idea. This crazy spending must stop someday.'</p>
            <p>Some Senators said that using tax money for refunds is not needed yet. This is because people's trust in the economy has recently gone up.</p>
            <p>Republican Senator Roger Marshall from Kansas said, 'I just don't know if these steps are needed. People don't feel hurt by the tariffs; it's the opposite. Prices have stayed steady.' He believes the best way to use the tariff money is to 'pay back debt.'</p>

            <h1>Eurozone July inflation rate stays at 2%, not falling as expected</h1>
            <p>Today, the European Union (EU) announced that the Eurozone's inflation rate in July remained at 2%. This is the same as in June. It did not slow down as experts thought it would.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, had earlier reported that the Eurozone's inflation rate in June was 2%. Financial data providers FactSet and Bloomberg News analysts had expected the July inflation rate to fall slightly to 1.9%.</p>

            <h1>National Chengchi University and 8 universities partner to promote inter-university doctoral program in business and management</h1>
            <p>National Chengchi University (NCCU) is working with eight other universities. Together, they are starting a 'Taiwan Business and Management Doctoral Student Joint Training Program.' The Ministry of Education has approved this plan and will provide 10 million New Taiwan dollars over three years. This program will bring together teachers and resources from different universities. This will improve the quality of business and management education in general.</p>
            <p>NCCU released a press statement today. Vice President of NCCU and head of the Taiwan Business School Alliance, Tsai Wei-chi, said that Taiwan's business doctoral education has faced challenges for a long time. These include not enough shared resources between universities, limited international connections, and research efforts being spread out. This is happening as the world becomes more connected and technology grows quickly.</p>
            <p>Tsai Wei-chi believes that training doctoral students is very important for academic strength in higher education. It also affects the country's plans for talent and academic development. So, he brought together the deans from nine business schools, including NCCU. They formed a committee to start this program. After many meetings, they decided on the course structure and how to move forward.</p>
            <p>Tsai Wei-chi explained that the main courses will focus on areas like finance, accounting, strategic management, and human resource management. New courses will cover topics such as 'AI and Business Strategy' and advanced research methods. International teachers will be invited to teach these courses. This will help doctoral students connect with global trends and gain wider academic knowledge. Currently, 13 core management sub-field courses and 4 international new topic courses have been planned. Doctoral students from all participating universities will be able to take these courses soon.</p>
            <p>This program is planned to last for three years. In the second half of this year, universities will first be asked to change their rules for choosing courses from other universities and accepting credits. Doctoral students will also be allowed to attend courses at other universities as 'auditors.' In the first semester of the 2025-2026 school year, four core management sub-field courses will begin. These will mainly be taught in person. However, for doctoral students from outside the local area, some weeks will offer online participation at the same time. More information can be found on the NCCU website.</p>
