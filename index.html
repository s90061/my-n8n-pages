Heavy rain has been falling in the mountains of Pingtung for many days. A bridge called Wuda No. 2, which connects Dawu Village to other areas, has been destroyed. The road is now closed.

The head of Dawu Village said that this bridge is the only way for people to enter or leave the village. After Typhoon Danas, only a small part of the bridge was left. Then, it rained all night, and the bridge completely collapsed. About 100 people live in the village, and they have enough food for about a week. Two people need to go to the hospital today, and they are trying to find a way.

The weather office said that Pingtung is having very heavy rain. Roads going to AlÃ¬ Village in Wutai Township are also dangerous because of damaged surfaces and falling rocks. People are asked not to go to these areas.

**Taiwan Sugar Helps Farmers After Typhoon Danas with Rent Cuts**

Typhoon Danas caused serious damage in southern Taiwan. To help farmers, Taiwan Sugar Company will reduce their rent for up to three months. This will help farmers who grow crops on their land.

Taiwan Sugar said today that if farmers rent land from them and their crops were damaged by the typhoon, they can get help. Farmers need to show proof of the damage from their local government office.

If 20% to 40% of their crops are damaged, they don't have to pay rent for one month. If 40% to 60% are damaged, it's two months. If more than 60% are damaged, it's three months. If the situation is very bad, they might get more help. If they have already paid rent, it can be used for next year's rent, or their rental period can be longer.

**MediaTek Focuses on AI Chips, Needs to Improve Core Technology**

A research company called DIGITIMES says that MediaTek is working hard on special AI chips (ASIC) for cloud computing. They want to find new business chances in the AI market. DIGITIMES believes that for MediaTek to succeed, they need to combine their computing power well with high-performance AI system design.

DIGITIMES pointed out that the phone market is not growing as fast. So, MediaTek is changing its business to focus on cloud AI. They are designing AI ASIC chips. This is a big change for MediaTek to stay strong in the AI world.

The research firm explained that making AI ASIC chips needs three main things: fast data transfer, good packaging technology, and strong computing core design. MediaTek is trying to get better at all these. They hope to be a leader in high-end AI chips for cloud data centers and other smart devices.
