            <h1>China Says No More Talks with Czech President After He Met Dalai Lama, Czech Office Says "No Change"</h1>
            <p>China is unhappy because the Czech President, Petr Pavel, met the Dalai Lama in India. Because of this, China said it will not talk to President Pavel anymore. The Czech President's office said that this does not change anything. They said that the Czech Republic and China do not have direct talks between their presidents anyway.</p>
            <p>On July 27, Czech President Petr Pavel met the Dalai Lama, who is a spiritual leader from Tibet, in India. He also wished him a happy 90th birthday. China was very unhappy and complained about this meeting.</p>
            <p>Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's Foreign Ministry, said that President Pavel ignored China's repeated warnings and strong protests. He went to India to meet the Dalai Lama anyway. China said this seriously broke the Czech government's promise to China. They also said it harmed China's control over its land. Because of President Pavel's "bad and challenging actions," China decided not to have any talks with him.</p>
            <p>The Czech President's office replied on X (formerly Twitter). They said, "The President's meeting with the Dalai Lama was a private meeting. Right now, there are no direct talks between the presidents of the Czech Republic and China. So, this action does not change the current situation."</p>
            <p>Some important Czech politicians also spoke about this. The Czech Foreign Minister, Jan Lipavsk칳, said that President Pavel's visit was personal. He only went to wish the Tibetan spiritual leader a happy important birthday. Minister Lipavsk칳 said China should see it this way.</p>
            <p>The Czech Health Minister, Vlastimil V치lek, posted on X. He said that he supports the President on behalf of his political party, "TOP 09." He said they support the President just like they supported the party leader, Mark칠ta Pekarov치 Adamov치, when she visited Taiwan in the past.</p>
            <p>Minister V치lek wrote, "We are not interested in Chinese friends telling our country's leaders where they can and cannot go. Let those who want to pull us back to the East try this method."</p>
            <p>The Czech Minister for Research and Innovation, Marek 콯en칤코ek, commented on X. He said, "I don't think this will affect the President much. The Chinese Communist Party's main leaders can only feel helpless."</p>
