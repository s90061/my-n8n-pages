            <h1>Trump at UN: Criticizes Allies for Palestine, Russian Oil</h1>
            <p>Today, during his speech at the United Nations, US President Trump said that America's allies who recognize Palestine are "helping" the Palestinian group Hamas. Trump also told European allies to stop buying oil from Russia.</p>
            <p>The main discussion at the UN General Assembly started today. About 150 country leaders are expected to speak this week.</p>
            <p>News agencies like CNN, Reuters, and AFP reported that Trump joked at the start of his speech. He said, "I don't mind speaking without a teleprompter, because it's broken." But he added he was still happy to be there.</p>
            <p>Trump then began with a familiar idea: he said America was doing badly under the last president, Joe Biden. But he claimed things got better quickly since he became president in January this year.</p>
            <p>Trump stated, "Under my leadership, prices for energy, gas, food, and home loans have gone down. We have also beaten inflation. Only the stock market has gone up, reaching a new high."</p>
            <p>Trump said he was responsible for ending seven wars, like the conflict between Pakistan and India, and a 12-day war between Israel and Iran. He then said, "It's a shame I had to do these things, and the United Nations didn't."</p>
            <p>Trump questioned why the UN exists. He said the UN has much power but doesn't use it well. He explained, "Most of the time, for now, they just write strong letters and then do nothing. These are just words, and words don't stop wars."</p>
            <p>In his speech, Trump also talked about the war between Israel and Hamas, and the war in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Trump argued that if America's allies recognize Palestine while Hamas still holds Israeli hostages and refuses a ceasefire, it "rewards" Hamas for its "terrible acts." This includes Hamas's big attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.</p>
            <p>Trump also told European allies to stop buying Russian oil right away. He said China and India are helping Russia pay for the war in Ukraine by buying oil. He stated, "They must stop buying all energy from Russia immediately, or we are all wasting a lot of time."</p>
            <p>About immigration, Trump criticized the UN for giving money to immigrants who need help. He said the UN "helps attacks on Western countries and their borders" and "supports people who enter the US illegally."</p>
            <p>Trump praised his tough immigration rules. He also said that European allies are in "hell" because of immigration problems. He said, "It's time to stop the bad idea of open borders."</p>
            <p>Recently, the US military destroyed at least three boats from Venezuela that were likely smuggling drugs. More than ten people died. In his UN speech, Trump promised to completely stop drug smugglers. He warned, "To every criminal who brings drugs into the US, we will completely destroy you."</p>
            <p>Trump also spoke against green energy. He said it is too expensive and that renewable energy is "a joke." He added, "I think climate change is the biggest trick ever... the carbon footprint is a lie made up by bad people who are going to cause total destruction."</p>
            <p>Trump spoke today after Brazil's President, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Trump had strongly criticized Lula for accusing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro of planning a coup. But Trump still said he would meet Lula next week.</p>
            <p>Even though Trump strongly criticized the energy and immigration policies of UN member countries and the UN itself, he finished his nearly one-hour speech with a calmer tone.</p>
            <p>He said, "Let's work together to make a bright and beautiful planet. A planet we share, a peaceful planet that is richer, better, and more beautiful than ever before. This can happen, and it will happen."</p>

            <h1>Russia Claims Gains in Ukraine's Kharkiv Region, Takes Part of Kupiansk</h1>
            <p>Today, Russia said it has taken a big part of Kupiansk. This city is in Ukraine's Kharkiv region in the northeast. Russia also wants to move further into this region.</p>
            <p>The Russian army said in a statement, according to AFP, that "controlling Kupiansk will let us go deeper into the Kharkiv region, towards Izium and Chuhuiv."</p>
            <p>Kharkiv region is not one of the five regions in Ukraine that Russia says it has taken. Most Russian soldiers were pushed out of Kharkiv in 2022 after a good counterattack by Ukraine's army. Russia's new statement shows it still wants to take this region.</p>
            <p>Today, the Russian army said that more than 65% of the buildings in Kupiansk are now under its control. AFP could not check if this is true.</p>
            <p>Last week, Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, told reporters that Ukrainian soldiers are still fighting to keep Kupiansk. He said "strong fights are happening there, and troops are ready."</p>
            <p>Kupiansk is a key place for transport. Russia said taking this city will help it move forward in the Donetsk region, which is next to Kharkiv.</p>
