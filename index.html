Recent reports show that more and more families in the UK are needing help from food banks, even though people in these families have jobs. The high cost of living, including expensive food, energy, and rent, is making it very difficult for many to afford basic necessities.

Charities that run food banks are seeing a big increase in the number of people asking for support. They say that some individuals are working full-time but still cannot earn enough money to pay for all their essential needs.

This situation highlights a serious problem: many wages are not keeping up with the rising prices of everyday items. It means that hard-working families are struggling to buy enough food and other important things for their homes. Organisations are calling on the government to do more to support those who are finding it hardest to cope with these financial pressures.

**Flexible Work Still Important For Everyone, Says New Study**

A recent study shows that flexible working arrangements are still very important for both employees and the companies they work for. This includes options like working from home some days, choosing your own hours, or a mix of both.

Many workers want more freedom in where and when they do their jobs. They feel that flexibility helps them balance their work and personal lives better. Companies also see the benefits. Offering flexible options helps them attract good new employees and keep the ones they already have. It can also make staff happier and more productive.

The study suggests that flexible work is no longer just a new idea; it is now a normal part of how many businesses operate. This trend is expected to continue as companies try to meet the needs of their employees and create better working environments.

**Ireland Welcomed Record Tourist Numbers in 2023**

Ireland saw more tourists visit in 2023 than ever before. This is great news for the country's economy, as tourism is a very important industry. The high numbers show that travel is recovering well after the pandemic.

Most of these visitors came from the United States, the UK, and different parts of Europe. They came to enjoy Ireland's beautiful scenery, rich history, and friendly culture.

While more tourists mean more money for local businesses and jobs, there are also talks about how to manage this growth. People are discussing how to make sure tourism helps communities and doesn't harm the environment. This includes thinking about things like enough hotels and transport for everyone. The aim is to continue growing tourism in a way that benefits everyone and protects Ireland's natural beauty.
