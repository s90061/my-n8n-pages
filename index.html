            <h1>Mexican Freight Train Hits Double-Decker Bus: At Least 8 Dead, 45 Injured</h1>
            <p>Authorities in Mexico said that a freight train hit a double-decker bus today. This happened in a town northwest of Mexico City. At least 8 people died, and 45 people were hurt.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that this big accident happened in Atlacomulco, a town northwest of Mexico City.</p>
            <p>The civil defense office in Mexico State said on social media platform X that officials are still working at the accident site.</p>
            <p>CNN reported that it is still not clear why the freight train hit the double-decker bus.</p>
            <p>A video shared on social media shows the double-decker bus slowly crossing the train tracks. Then, a fast-moving train suddenly appeared and hit the bus directly in the middle.</p>
            <p>Another video shows the bus after it was hit. It was stopped next to the tracks, and its roof was gone.</p>

            <h1>French Prime Minister Bayrou Fails Confidence Vote, Will Resign</h1>
            <p>Today, the French parliament voted on whether they trusted Prime Minister Bayrou's government. Bayrou had only been in office for nine months, but he did not get enough votes. Because of this, President Macron will look for a new prime minister, and France is now in a new political problem.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the vote in the French National Assembly showed that 364 members of parliament did not trust the government, while only 194 members did.</p>
            <p>Yael Braun-Pivet, the leader of the National Assembly, said that according to Article 50 of the French Constitution, the prime minister must resign with the entire government.</p>
            <p>An unnamed person close to Bayrou told AFP that Bayrou will tell President Emmanuel Macron tomorrow morning that he is resigning.</p>
            <p>The French President's office has already stated that Macron will choose a new prime minister in the next few days.</p>
            <p>Bayrou was the sixth prime minister under President Macron, who started in 2017. He is also the first prime minister in modern French history to be removed by a confidence vote, not a no-confidence vote.</p>
            <p>Bayrou's government did not have a lot of support. Recently, they tried to get enough votes for a budget plan that would save money. On August 25, he announced that he would ask for a confidence vote in parliament. This decision surprised many people in French politics.</p>

            <h1>Trump Loses Appeal in Defamation Case, Ordered to Pay Millions to Writer</h1>
            <p>In New York, a group of people in a court case (a jury) decided last year that former President Trump had unfairly said bad things about a writer named E. Jean Carroll. They said he must pay her 83.3 million US dollars. This is about 2.56 billion New Taiwan dollars. Trump appealed this decision, but today, a higher court said the original decision was correct.</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that the jury believed Trump showed bad intentions many times when he talked about Carroll in public. In January last year, the jury decided Trump had to pay 65 million US dollars as punishment, 7.3 million US dollars for her losses, and 11 million US dollars for online activities to help fix Carroll's reputation.</p>
            <p>When this decision was read in the federal court, people were very surprised. The amount of money to be paid was much more than the 10 million US dollars or more that Carroll had asked for.</p>
            <p>At that time, Trump used his own social media platform, "Truth Social," to post many rude messages. He attacked Carroll, the court process, and the judge.</p>
            <p>Today, the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals said, "We believe the federal district court made no mistakes in any of its decisions that were questioned. Also, because the facts of this case are very special and bad, the amount of money the jury decided was fair."</p>
            <p>Carroll, who is 81 years old, said that Trump said bad things about her in 2019. At that time, she first said publicly that Trump had sexually assaulted her. But Trump said, "She's not my type," and said she made up the story to sell more of her book.</p>
            <p>In another civil court case in 2023, a different jury in New York decided that Trump was responsible for sexually assaulting Carroll in a department store changing room in 1996. They also said he said bad things about her in 2022, when he called her story "a complete lie." In that case, the jury decided Trump had to pay Carroll 5 million US dollars.</p>
            <p>The appeals court wrote in its decision today, "We agree with the federal district court that the jury had good reasons to believe that Trump would not stop saying bad things about Carroll unless he had to pay a lot of money."</p>
            <p>Trump was not asked to appear in court or give evidence. However, he used this case to get media attention, saying he was being treated unfairly, and used it to help his campaign to become president again.</p>
