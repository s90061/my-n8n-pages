            <h1>Eric Chu Criticizes Those Who Consider Using "Nazi" Methods, Calling It Disrespectful to History's Victims</h1>
            <p>Taipei, August 4 (CNA) â€“ Eric Chu, the chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, today criticized the ruling party's supporters. He said they are thinking about using the word "Nazi" as a political tool. They want to attack people who disagree with them and stop free speech. He believes their goal is not to warn people but to cause conflict. It is not to think deeply but to stir up strong feelings. He called this a very bad copy of democracy and a great insult to people who suffered in history.</p>
            <p>On August 3, a social media influencer named "Min Nan Lang" Chen Bo-yuan said that another influencer, Bajiong, privately spoke about "studying how Nazis controlled people to fight communism" and creating "Nazi stormtroopers to start a revolution." These comments caused a lot of discussion.</p>
            <p>This afternoon, Eric Chu posted on Facebook. He said that if people allow hatred to spread, society will lose its freedom. He added that Taiwan's democracy is something everyone is proud of. It is also a value that the KMT always protects. He strongly believes that a healthy society can accept many different opinions. Also, a mature democracy should value discussions between people with different ideas.</p>
            <p>Chu said that when the ruling party uses democracy to remove people from office, it actually becomes a way to find enemies within the country and remove opposing parties. He said this makes people remember famous cases in history. In these cases, groups gained power using democracy but then slowly became very strict and controlling. He warns about extreme political movements because of lessons from history.</p>
            <p>Chu thinks that hatred is the most dangerous thing that can damage democracy. When a society labels people who disagree and removes "different voices," if people do not quickly realize the danger, they will lose more than just a few voices. They will lose freedom for the whole society.</p>
            <p>Eric Chu stressed that the main idea of democracy is "living with people who disagree," not "getting rid of people who disagree." He gives warnings to stop extreme power from returning and to protect Taiwan's hard-won democracy. But he said it is sad that the ruling party's supporters are really thinking about using the word "Nazi." They want to use it as a political weapon to attack those who disagree and stop free speech. These people do not want to warn others. They want to fight. They do not want to think deeply. They want to create strong emotions. He called this kind of action a very bad copy of democracy and a great insult to people who suffered in history.</p>
            <p>Chu said that Taiwan must be a country where everyone, no matter their background, beliefs, religion, or political views, can be treated equally and talk to each other calmly. He said everyone should reject extreme ideas and hatred. They should work together to keep Taiwan truly free for future generations.</p>

            <h1>Man Who Lied About Being a Master's Graduate from NTHU Sentenced to 1 Year and 2 Months for Investment Fraud</h1>
            <p>Hsinchu County, August 4 (CNA) â€“ A man named Lu applied for a programming technician job at a company. He lied, saying he had a master's degree from National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). He also claimed he had been asked by TSMC to create software to make their machines work better. Because of these lies, he was hired and tricked people into giving him over NT$2.35 million. The Hsinchu District Court has sentenced him to 1 year and 2 months in prison for fraud. He can appeal this decision.</p>
            <p>Court documents from the Hsinchu District Court show that in 2019, Mr. Lu applied for a programming technician job at a company in Hsinchu City and was hired. However, Mr. Lu had only partly finished his studies at a private university, Chung Hua University. He falsely claimed he had graduated with a master's degree from the Department of Information Management at National Tsing Hua University.</p>
            <p>The court documents also state that Mr. Lu even told the company's boss, Mr. Peng, that he used to run a company in the semiconductor industry. He said he had good technology and connections in that field. He also claimed to know high-ranking people at TSMC well. He lied, saying he had been asked to develop software for semiconductors to help TSMC's machines work better.</p>
            <p>The court documents point out that Mr. Peng believed Mr. Lu had this experience. So, Mr. Peng signed a contract with Mr. Lu, hiring him as a special technical consultant. Mr. Peng paid him a signing bonus of NT$600,000. Mr. Lu also tricked Mr. Peng into investing more than NT$2.35 million for development work. Later, Mr. Lu kept delaying the work. This is when Mr. Peng found out he had been tricked.</p>
            <p>The judge decided that Mr. Lu did not try to earn money honestly. He used the victim's trust and made up stories about developing semiconductor software. He then took money unfairly. This shows he did not follow the law and did not respect other people's property. The judge said his actions should be strongly criticized.</p>
            <p>The judge said that during the trial, Mr. Lu kept making excuses and did not show he was sorry. So, the judge sentenced Mr. Lu to 1 year and 2 months in prison for fraud. The money he got illegally, NT$2,958,495, will be taken by the government. He can appeal the decision.</p>

            <h1>Taichung International Stepping Dance Festival to Start in September, Moving to Coastal Area for the First Time</h1>
            <p>Taichung, August 4 (CNA) â€“ The 2025 Taichung International Stepping Dance Festival will take place from September 27 to 28. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said today that unlike previous years when it was held in the city center, this year it will be in the coastal Qingshui District for the first time. They have also planned a joint event with the international brand Smurfs and invited Nantou County Magistrate Hsu Shu-hua to be the ambassador.</p>
            <p>At the press conference, Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that 19 dance groups from 7 different countries will perform. This is the largest number of groups ever. Since the event is celebrating its 10th year, they have planned a big promotion with the Belgian comic characters, the Smurfs. From now on, you can see Smurf figures in different parts of Taichung.</p>
            <p>She added that they invited Hsu Shu-hua, who collects over 3,000 Smurfs, to be the event's ambassador. They also borrowed hundreds of her Smurf items for a special exhibition. To protect these items from damage, the Taichung City Government even bought insurance for them. People who like the Smurfs can visit the exhibition.</p>
            <p>In addition, Mayor Lu said that people can sign up online or in person for the "All-People Stepping Dance Fun Competition." Participants can legally perform freely on the streets. There is also a total prize money of NT$100,000. Over 30 groups have already signed up for the competition.</p>
            <p>Hsu Shu-hua said it is not easy for an event to run for 10 years in a row. She came to Taichung to learn from their experience and hopes to learn a lot. This year, Taichung, Changhua County, Nantou County, and Miaoli County also promoted their areas in Hong Kong and Japan. Also, this year's National Day Party will be in Taichung, and the National Day Fireworks will be in Nantou. Taichung and Nantou will promote these events together.</p>
            <p>She said that because she loves the Smurfs, when Mayor Lu invited the Belgian Ambassador to Taiwan to the event, she also received three Smurfs in the colors of the Belgian flag from the Ambassador. She was very touched by this gift.</p>
