            <h1>South Korean Unification Church Leader Detained Over Bribery Accusations Against Former First Lady</h1>
            <p>Seoul Central District Court today ordered the detention of Han Hak-ja, the leader of the Unification Church. She is accused of trying to bribe Kim Keon-hee, the wife of former President Yoon Suk-yeol. The court is worried she might destroy evidence.</p>
            <p>Yonhap News Agency reported that the Seoul Central District Court in South Korea issued an arrest warrant. This is because they feared Han Hak-ja might hide evidence. This was one of the reasons why prosecutors asked for her detention.</p>
            <p>Han Hak-ja, who is 82 years old, was questioned last week about allegedly bribing former First Lady Kim Keon-hee. After that, prosecutors asked the court to detain her. Han Hak-ja is the wife of Sun Myung Moon, who started the Unification Church and passed away in 2012.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that South Korean prosecutors have already charged Kim Keon-hee with several crimes, including bribery. Kim Keon-hee is accused of taking bribes worth 80 million Korean won. These bribes included two Chanel bags and a diamond necklace. They were given to her to help the Unification Church with its business goals.</p>
            <p>Kim Keon-hee's lawyer said that she did not receive any gifts and denied all accusations. Han Hak-ja also said she did not take part in any illegal activities. She called the accusations against her "fake news."</p>

            <h1>Jimmy Kimmel's Talk Show Returns on September 23rd After Suspension for Comments</h1>
            <p>Jimmy Kimmel, an American talk show host, had his show stopped on September 17th. This happened because of comments he made about the death of a conservative online personality named Charlie Kirk. Today, Disney announced that his late-night talk show will be back on TV on September 23rd.</p>
            <p>ABC, which is owned by Disney, said on September 17th that Jimmy Kimmel's show would be stopped for an unknown time. This was because his comments on September 15th about Charlie Kirk's death received a lot of criticism.</p>
            <p>In his show at that time, Jimmy Kimmel said, "Last weekend, we saw that people from the MAGA group had no limits. They tried to separate themselves from the person who killed Kirk and tried to gain political benefits from it."</p>
            <p>Disney released a statement today: "Last Wednesday, we decided to stop the show. We did this to avoid making tensions worse at a time when emotions were high across the country. We made this decision because we thought some of the comments were not appropriate and lacked sensitivity at that time."</p>
            <p>"Over the past few days, we have had deep conversations with Jimmy Kimmel. After talking, we decided to bring the show back on Tuesday, September 23rd."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that Jimmy Kimmel's sudden suspension seemed to be because the Trump administration put pressure on ABC. This also made liberal people very angry. Critics said that Jimmy Kimmel was targeted because he often spoke badly about President Trump.</p>
