        const text = `**Trump Changes Stance on FEMA After Texas Floods**

After a deadly flood in Texas last week, President Trump and his team are no longer talking about getting rid of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For months, Trump and his Homeland Security Secretary, Kristi Noem, had suggested closing down FEMA. However, after seeing the damage in Texas, White House officials said that removing FEMA is no longer the plan.

A week ago, heavy rains in central Texas caused rivers to flood. This washed away homes, camps, cars, and people. At least 120 people died, including many children. The New York Times reported that in January, after a hurricane hit North Carolina, Trump strongly criticized FEMA, saying it was not doing its job and was a "disaster." After he returned to the White House, he said he wanted to suggest getting rid of FEMA because he thought it was big and not working well. Noem said in March, "We are ready to cut FEMA."

Now, because the government needs to help Texas after the floods, Trump and his staff have stopped talking about cutting FEMA. As people across the country are focused on whether the federal government can respond well to disasters, White House officials are now saying their plan is to completely change FEMA, and that this was always their goal.

**Rubio Says Trump and Xi Want to Meet; Experts Say August Tariff Talks are Key**

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi yesterday. Rubio said that the leaders of both countries want to meet. However, China's Foreign Ministry did not mention this at all. Chinese experts believe this shows that the US wants the meeting more than China does. They also said that a meeting needs the right conditions, and the next one to two months are important. The key will be if there is progress on tariffs and technology restrictions when both sides talk about trade in August.

This was the first face-to-face meeting between the foreign ministers of the US and China since US President Donald Trump started his second term in January. China's Foreign Ministry said the meeting was positive and helpful, and both sides agreed to talk more at all levels. Wang Yi said he hopes the US will make policies that help both countries and find a good way for the US and China to get along.

Rubio said his talks with Wang Yi were good and constructive. When asked if Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping might meet, he said it was very likely and that both leaders strongly want to meet, but there is no date yet. China's statement did not mention a meeting between Trump and Xi.

**Typhoon Danas Damages 50 Historical Sites in Tainan**

Typhoon Danas caused a lot of damage in Tainan. The city government has reported that 50 historical places were damaged, including 31 old monuments and 19 historical buildings. Out of these 50 places, 17 need to be checked closely to see how bad the damage is. They plan to finish checking by July 14th. After that, they will gather information on how much money is needed for repairs and make a plan.

The Tainan Cultural Heritage Management Office said today that some places, like the Japanese-era Tainan Patriotic Women's Association Hall and Tainan Butokuden, show clear damage. Also, the Tainan Forestry Office had damaged windows and water leaks. The shrine gate at Yanshui Elementary School is leaning, and the protective steel frame at the Lin Family Ancestral Home in Madou was damaged, with possible sinking foundations and broken roof tiles. The Saltwater Octagonal Building has peeling walls on the first floor, and fallen wooden screens and windows on the second floor, with broken and moved roof tiles. The Beimen Office and Salt Washing Factory have large areas of moved roof tiles and missing ridge tiles.

The Cultural Heritage Office stated that the overall damage is still manageable. They plan to quickly collect information on repair costs and create a plan after the checks are done. This will help with fixing and restoring the damaged cultural sites.
