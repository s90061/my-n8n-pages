Taiwan's central bank has warned that the United States' rapidly increasing national debt could affect global trust in U.S. Treasury bonds. This concern was highlighted in a report by the central bank, noting that while the U.S. dollar and Treasuries remain important for global finance, the continued accumulation of debt could pose risks. Taiwan, holding over 80% of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Treasuries, is closely watching these developments. The central bank emphasized that this situation raises questions about the debt's long-term sustainability and its potential impact on international financial markets.

**Chipmakers Face Risk as US Considers Revoking China Waivers**

The U.S. may be preparing to cancel waivers that allow global chipmakers to send American technology to China, according to the Wall Street Journal. This potential move could significantly impact key players like Samsung, SK Hynix, and TSMC. The waivers, originally granted in 2022, permitted these companies to continue production in China despite strict U.S. export restrictions on semiconductors. The potential revocation is reportedly due to concerns that these waivers are inadvertently assisting Chinaâ€™s advanced military and AI development. Such a decision would mark a notable escalation in U.S. tech policy and likely force these companies to seek individual licenses for their China operations.
