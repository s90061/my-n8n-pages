            <h1>US Stops Danish Wind Power Project, European Stock Markets Fall</h1>
            <p>A Danish company called Orsted builds renewable energy. They had a plan to build wind farms in the sea in the US. But the US stopped this plan. Because of this, shares of wind power companies went down. Also, the stock market in France went down because the Prime Minister asked for a vote of confidence. So, the main stock markets in Europe closed lower today.</p>
            <p>The DAX index in Frankfurt went down by 89.97 points, or 0.37%. It closed at 24273.12 points.</p>
            <p>The CAC 40 index in Paris went down by 126.65 points, or 1.59%. It closed at 7843.04 points.</p>

            <h1>Coach Chou Tai-ying Questioned in NTNU Women's Soccer Blood Test Case</h1>
            <p>There was a disagreement about blood tests for the National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) women's soccer team. Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office told the Taipei City Investigation Office to search three places: Coach Chou Tai-ying's home and office. They also called Coach Chou in for questioning. Four other teachers, including Chen Chung-ching, were also asked to come in as witnesses. They were all taken to the Taipei Prosecutors Office later that evening for more questions.</p>
            <p>Chou Tai-ying, a famous former Taiwanese women's soccer player and now a coach at NTNU, was accused of threatening players. She supposedly said she would take away their school credits if they did not agree to have their blood drawn for a research study. Because of this, on July 16, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office started an investigation. They assigned a special team that fights crimes against the public to work with the Taipei City Investigation Office.</p>
            <p>The investigators asked for information about the research project from the Ministry of Education, the National Science and Technology Council, National Central University, and National Taiwan Normal University. They also talked to one research assistant and 18 current and former female soccer players. The prosecutor questioned 12 of these players.</p>
            <p>After looking at all the documents and checking money transactions, the investigators believe that Chou Tai-ying might have committed fraud and taken things that were not hers. They asked the court for search warrants, and the court approved them.</p>
            <p>Today, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office directed the Taipei City Investigation Office to search three places, including Chou Tai-ying's home and office. Chou Tai-ying was called in as a suspect, and four other people, including Chen Chung-ching, were called in as witnesses. They were all taken to the Taipei Prosecutors Office later in the evening for more questioning.</p>

            <h1>India Worries About China's Dam on Brahmaputra River, Plans Own Dams Faster</h1>
            <p>India is worried that a very large dam China plans to build in Tibet, on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, could greatly reduce water flow to India. During dry seasons, India fears it might lose up to 85% of its water. This worry has made India speed up its own plans to build dams to lessen this problem, according to a report from the Indian government and four people who know about the situation.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that in December last year, China announced its plan to build the world's largest hydroelectric dam in a border area. This dam would be built on the Yarlung Tsangpo River before it flows into India. India's government in New Delhi is concerned that China, which says it owns part of India's Arunachal Pradesh region, might use its control over the river as a weapon.</p>
            <p>In July this year, construction began on China's Yarlung Tsangpo dam. This project will cost about 170 billion US dollars (around 5 trillion New Taiwan dollars). Once it is finished, it will produce enough electricity each year for all of the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Yarlung Tsangpo River starts at the Angsi Glacier. In India, it is called the Siang River and the Brahmaputra River.</p>
            <p>The Angsi Glacier provides water for over 100 million people in China, India, and Bangladesh, which are downstream. Since the early 2000s, the Indian government has been thinking about water projects to control the water from the Angsi Glacier. However, people living in Arunachal Pradesh, which is close to the Chinese border, are afraid that building dams will flood their villages and ruin their way of life. Because of this, they have strongly and sometimes violently stopped these plans.</p>
            <p>In May this year, India's largest hydropower company moved equipment for surveying to the planned site for the "Upper Siang Multipurpose Storage Dam." This was done with protection from armed police. If this dam is built, it will be the biggest dam in India.</p>
            <p>Two people who know about the plans said that high-ranking Indian officials have continued to meet this year to discuss speeding up dam construction. The office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi organized one of these meetings in July.</p>
            <p>The Indian government's analysis report, which does not have a date, talks in detail about their worries regarding the Yarlung Tsangpo dam. Reuters confirmed the details of this report with four sources and was the first to share this information.</p>
            <p>Beijing has not officially released many details about the Yarlung Tsangpo dam project. The Indian government's report used past studies from its own agencies, like the Central Water Commission, to guess the size of China's dam.</p>
            <p>According to the sources and the report, New Delhi believes that the dam will allow China to control up to 40 billion cubic meters of water. The problem of less water will be very clear during the dry months, when temperatures in many parts of India get hotter and the land becomes drier.</p>
            <p>The Upper Siang dam project plans to store 14 billion cubic meters of water. This would let India release water during dry seasons to help with droughts. According to the sources and the report, Guwahati, a major city that depends on industries and farming that use a lot of water, would benefit from this. Without the dam, Guwahati's water supply would decrease by about 25% in the dry season. With the dam, it is expected to decrease by only 11%.</p>
            <p>The sources also mentioned that this project could help reduce the terrible effects if Beijing releases a lot of water at once.</p>
            <p>If the Upper Siang dam holds less than 50% of its full water capacity, it can completely take in any extra water released from China's water facilities. Two sources said that India is thinking about keeping 30% of the dam's space empty at all times. This would be to prepare for unexpected floods.</p>
            <p>A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Reuters about the Yarlung Tsangpo dam project. They said that the project has been carefully studied for safety and environmental science. They stated it will not cause any bad water, environmental, or geological effects on countries downstream. They also added that China always acts responsibly when developing and using rivers that cross borders. China has also kept in touch and worked with downstream countries like India and Bangladesh for a long time.</p>
            <p>Modi's office and India's water and foreign affairs ministries did not answer Reuters' questions. The state-owned National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) also did not respond to Reuters' request for comments.</p>
