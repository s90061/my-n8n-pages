            <h1>Russia and Ukraine Exchange Prisoners: 146 People Return to Each Side with UAE Help</h1>
            <p>Moscow, August 24 (Central News Agency) â€“ Russia and Ukraine exchanged 146 prisoners of war today. This happened with the help of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Both the Russian Ministry of Defense and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy confirmed this.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the Russian Ministry of Defense said all the released Russians are now in Belarus. They are getting mental and medical help there.</p>
            <p>The ministry also stated that Ukraine returned eight people from Russia's Kursk region.</p>
            <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the prisoner exchange on the messaging app Telegram. However, he did not say how many people were exchanged at that time.</p>
            <p>He shared photos of the released prisoners smiling happily. He said that most of them had been captured since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. He also mentioned that a journalist, who was captured one month after the invasion, was among them.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy thanked the UAE for watching over the exchange. He wrote, "The prisoner exchange continues. Maybe it's possible because our soldiers are increasing the exchange fund for Ukraine."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy called the Russian soldiers captured by Ukrainian forces during a quick attack in Russia's Kursk region Ukraine's "exchange fund."</p>

            <h1>Canada's Prime Minister: Sending Peacekeepers to Ukraine is Possible</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, August 24 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today, Canadian Prime Minister Carney told Ukrainian President Zelenskyy that he supports Ukraine's request for strong security promises in any peace deal. Carney also said that Canada might send peacekeeping troops to Ukraine under such a plan.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the war where Russia fully invaded Ukraine has been going on for three and a half years. US President Trump is leading efforts for peace. Ukraine is working with its European friends to create a plan that could give Kyiv security after the war. Trump has shown he is open to this idea.</p>
            <p>Today, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy led a ceremony in central Kyiv to celebrate Independence Day. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who is visiting Ukraine for the first time since becoming Prime Minister in March, and Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg were both there.</p>
            <p>At Sophia Square in Kyiv, Zelenskyy told his guests, "We are all working to make sure that when this war ends, Ukraine will have peace. This way, our children and grandchildren will not have to suffer from war or the threat of war."</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy said he wants future security promises in any peace deal to be as close as possible to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This article says that if one member country is attacked, it is like an attack on all member countries.</p>
            <p>Prime Minister Carney agreed with Ukraine's request for possible international help.</p>
            <p>At a joint press conference, Carney said, "Canada believes that it's not enough to only rely on the strength of Ukraine's army for security... It must be supported and made stronger."</p>
            <p>The leaders of both countries also signed an agreement to work together to make drones. Carney said that next month, Ukraine will get more than 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 22 billion Taiwan dollars) in military help from a plan that was announced before.</p>

            <h1>Peace Talks Are Stuck, Zelenskyy Asks to Meet Putin</h1>
            <p>Kyiv, August 24 (Central News Agency) â€“ Today is Ukraine's Independence Day. President Zelenskyy said that talks to end the war through diplomacy are not moving forward. He believes that meeting with Russian President Putin would be "the best way to move the peace process forward."</p>
            <p>Agence France-Presse reported that Ukraine launched drone attacks today. This caused a fire at a nuclear power plant in Russia.</p>
            <p>US President Trump has been trying to arrange a meeting between Ukraine and Russia's leaders. However, on August 22, Russia said that an immediate meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy was not possible. After this, hopes for peace became small.</p>
            <p>But today, Zelenskyy said, "Meetings between leaders are the best way to move the peace process forward." He asked again for a meeting with Putin.</p>
            <p>Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Western countries were trying to "find excuses to stop the talks." He also criticized Zelenskyy for "demanding an immediate meeting at any cost."</p>
            <p>At a ceremony, where US special envoy Keith Kellogg and other Western officials were present, Zelenskyy promised to "force Russia towards peace."</p>
