            <h1>Zelenskyy Hopes Trump Will Help Stop Russia-Ukraine War Like Middle East Ceasefire</h1>
            <p>Today, Ukraine's President Zelenskyy spoke with US President Trump. He said he hopes Trump can help stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, similar to how he helped create a ceasefire in the Middle East, to bring peace to Ukraine.</p>
            <p>Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized that if Trump can stop one war, then other wars can also end.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Russia attacked Ukraine's power systems heavily. This caused power outages in Kyiv and nine other areas. Zelenskyy called Trump today after these attacks.</p>
            <p>Zelenskyy posted on Facebook, saying: "I had a very good and helpful phone call with Trump." He also praised Trump for his "excellent" work in making the Middle East ceasefire plan happen.</p>
            <p>He added, "If a war in one area can stop, then wars in other areas can definitely stop too, including Russia's war." He asked Trump to put pressure on Russia to start peace talks for the Ukraine war.</p>
            <p>Trump and Zelenskyy had an argument when they met at the White House in February. But now, their relationship is clearly better. Trump has recently been stronger against Moscow and has shown more understanding for Ukraine.</p>
            <p>In September, Trump wrote on his social media site, "Truth Social," that Kyiv should try to "take back" all its occupied land with help from Europe and NATO.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, US First Lady Melania Trump said that she has a special way to talk with Russian President Putin. She used this to help release Ukrainian children who were taken by Russia.</p>
            <p>Ukrainian officials said that Russia attacked the Odesa region in southern Ukraine today. At least five people died, and some areas lost power.</p>

            <h1>Wu Derong: Hot Days Until October 18, Northeast Monsoon Arrives on October 19</h1>
            <p>Today, the weather agency issued a high temperature warning. Five areas, including Greater Taipei, should prepare for temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Weather expert Wu Derong said that it will be mostly hot during the day until October 18. He expects the northeast monsoon to bring colder air starting on October 19. Also, there is a tropical disturbance developing east of Taiwan. We need to watch how this will affect temperatures and rain.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency today issued a high temperature warning. The weather will be clear and hot everywhere. Today, New Taipei City, Yunlin County, Tainan City, and Pingtung County have an orange warning, meaning there is a chance of continuous temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius. Taipei City has a yellow warning, meaning temperatures above 36 degrees Celsius are possible.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong, an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at National Central University, wrote today in his column "Xie Tianji Classroom" for the Weather Application Promotion Foundation. He said that the newest European weather model shows that today and tomorrow, most areas will have clear to partly cloudy skies. It will be hot during the day, so people should use sun protection and avoid heatstroke. In the afternoon, there might be some light rain in mountain areas.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong also noted that the latest European weather model predicts clear to partly cloudy skies from October 12 to 18. It will be hot during the day, with short, local thunderstorms in mountain areas in the afternoon. Eastern Taiwan may have some light rain.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong explained that the newest weather models from different countries show that the northeast monsoon, bringing cold air, will generally arrive starting on October 19. This will cause rain in areas facing the wind and a gradual drop in temperature. However, there is also a tropical disturbance developing east of Taiwan. The interaction between these two weather systems, one cold and one hot, makes the predictions from different countries more uncertain. It is important to keep watching if the "co-effect" will influence Taiwan, how low the temperature will drop, and how much rain will fall.</p>
            <p>Wu Derong mentioned that the latest path prediction map from the weather agency shows that Tropical Storm Nakri is currently south of Japan. It is moving faster towards the northeast, past the main island of Japan.</p>

            <h1>Cloudy to Clear, Light Showers in Eastern Taiwan, Afternoon Thunderstorms in Mountains and South of Chiayi</h1>
            <p>The Central Weather Agency stated that most areas today will have cloudy to clear weather. Eastern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula will have scattered, short rain showers. In the afternoon, areas south of Chiayi and other mountain areas will have local, short thunderstorms.</p>
            <p>Regarding temperatures, eastern Taiwan will have high temperatures of about 31 to 32 degrees Celsius. Western Taiwan will have high temperatures of 32 to 35 degrees Celsius. In New Taipei, Taipei, Yunlin, Tainan, and Pingtung, there is a chance of local high temperatures around or above 36 degrees Celsius. If you are doing outdoor activities, please protect yourself from the sun and drink plenty of water.</p>
            <p>Weather in the outlying islands: Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu will all have clear to partly cloudy skies, with temperatures from about 26 to 32 degrees Celsius.</p>
            <p>Typhoon Nakri (international name NAKRI), the 23rd typhoon, is located northeast of Ryukyu. It will move towards the northeast and south of Japan, so it will not directly affect Taiwan's weather.</p>
            <p>According to the air quality forecast from the Ministry of Environment: Today, the wind will mainly come from the east. The wind speed in western Taiwan will be a bit weaker, making it easier for pollutants to build up. In the afternoon, due to sunlight, ozone levels are likely to increase. The air quality in Yilan, Hualien-Taitung, and Penghu is "good." The air quality in Hsinchu-Miaoli, Central, Yunlin-Chiayi-Tainan, Kaohsiung-Pingtung, Matsu, and Kinmen is "normal." The air quality in northern Taiwan is at an "orange alert" level.</p>
