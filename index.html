            <h1>Syria Votes to Form New Parliament After Assadâ€™s Fall</h1>
            <p>On October 5, local groups in Syria voted to choose members for a new temporary parliament. This marks a new start after former President Bashar al-Assad's time. However, some people are saying this is not democratic because the interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, will directly choose one-third of the members.</p>
            <p>News from AFP says that this new parliament will make al-Sharaa's power stronger. His group, made mostly of Islamist fighters, removed Bashar al-Assad from power last December. This happened after a civil war that lasted 13 years.</p>
            <p>Members of the local groups voted in the National Library in Damascus, the capital city. The election committee said tonight that "voting has finished, and we are now counting the votes."</p>
            <p>A member of the Damascus election committee told AFP that some early results might be ready tonight. But the full list of winners will be announced tomorrow.</p>
            <p>The election committee stated that more than 1,500 people wanted to be elected for a 30-month term. Only 14% of these candidates were women. Al-Sharaa will directly choose 70 out of 210 seats. The other two-thirds will be chosen by local groups that the election committee set up. However, al-Sharaa also chose the election committee itself.</p>
            <p>After taking power, the new leaders in Damascus closed the old parliament, which just agreed with everything. A temporary law from March says that the new parliament will make laws until a real constitution is approved and a national election is held.</p>
            <p>Millions of Syrians have left the country or moved within the country because of the war. Many do not have the right papers. Al-Sharaa said it is not possible to hold direct elections right now.</p>
            <p>Human rights groups do not like this process. They think al-Sharaa has too much power. They also think it does not represent Syria's smaller ethnic and religious groups.</p>
            <p>Last month, many groups said together in a statement that this process means al-Sharaa "can easily create a majority in parliament, because he either picks the members himself or they are people who promise to support him."</p>

            <h1>Putin Suggests Extending Nuclear Treaty, Trump Agrees It's a Good Idea</h1>
            <p>On October 5, US President Donald Trump said that Russian President Vladimir Putin's idea to keep limits on nuclear weapons "sounds like a good idea."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that last month, Putin said Russia is willing to keep the limits of the 2010 "New START" treaty. This treaty sets a limit on the number of nuclear weapons for the world's two biggest nuclear powers. Russia will do this if the United States does the same. The treaty will end in February next year.</p>
            <p>When reporters asked Trump about Putin's idea as he left the White House, he said, "I think it sounds like a good idea."</p>
            <p>Last week, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, said that Moscow is still waiting for Trump to answer Putin's offer to keep limits on nuclear weapons.</p>
            <p>Trump and Putin met in Alaska, USA, in mid-August. Since then, American and Russian relations have become more difficult because Russian drones have often flown into NATO airspace. If they can agree to limit nuclear weapons, the situation might get better.</p>
            <p>In a video released today, Putin warned that if the United States decides to give Ukraine long-range Tomahawk missiles, which can hit deep inside Russia, the relationship between Moscow and Washington could completely break.</p>
            <p>In the video, he said, "This will destroy our relationship, or at least it will make the good things that have started to happen between us disappear."</p>
            <p>Last month, US Vice President J.D. Vance said that Ukraine has asked for missiles that can hit inside Russia, including Moscow. Washington is thinking about it. It is still not clear if the US has made a final decision about this.</p>

            <h1>US Military Has Authorization to Strike Drug Boats in Caribbean, Says Defense Secretary</h1>
            <p>On October 5, US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that he has received all the needed power for the US military to attack boats that are suspected of carrying drugs near Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Hegseth said this in an interview shown on Fox News Channel today. On October 3, the US military attacked, and four people died. This was at least the fourth similar action in recent weeks.</p>
            <p>In the interview on "The Sunday Briefing" show, he said, "We have all the needed power. These groups are called foreign terrorist organizations."</p>
            <p>Hegseth and US President Trump have not yet shown clear proof that the boats they attacked were indeed carrying drugs. Last week, Trump told Congress that he has decided that the US is now in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug groups. But he did not give new legal reasons for this.</p>
            <p>Hegseth said, "If you are in our area, in the Caribbean Sea, north of Venezuela, and you want to bring drugs to the United States, you will be a legal target for the US military."</p>
            <p>Today, Trump said that the US military's presence in the Caribbean Sea has successfully stopped drug trafficking from South America.</p>
            <p>He told reporters at the White House, "No drugs are entering our waters now. We will think about the next steps."</p>
