(Central News Agency reporter Hsieh Ching-wen, Taoyuan, July 15) The Rakuten Monkeys baseball team sent pitcher Huang Tzu-peng to the minor league on July 13. Head coach Koichi Koga said that it looked like his pitching control needed to be fixed, so Huang Tzu-peng was sent to the minor league to adjust. As for Lin Li's return date, he will decide with the team's physical therapist.

Monkeys pitcher Huang Tzu-peng started a game on July 5. He pitched for 3.1 innings, gave up 10 hits, and lost 7 runs that counted against him. He was then sent to the minor league on July 13.

Head coach Koichi Koga spoke to reporters before today's game. He said that they had already planned to send Huang Tzu-peng to the minor league to adjust, but it was changed later due to some reasons. Regarding what Huang Tzu-peng needs to adjust, Koichi Koga said he could not share the exact details, but overall, it was about pitching control.

Monkeys foreign pitcher Marcelo Martinez also gave up many runs in his start on July 12. He pitched for 4.1 innings, gave up 8 hits, including 1 home run, and lost 8 runs (7 runs that counted against him). He was given the loss.

Koichi Koga said that maybe the time between his two starts was too long, so his adjustment was not good. It could also be because he played in Kaohsiung, where the weather in the south is hotter, which might have affected him.

Also, about player Lin Li's condition, Koichi Koga said Lin Li feels a bit worse this year than last year. But there is no set date for his return. Lin Li will talk with the physical therapist, and he will return when he feels ready. (Edited by: Li Shu-hua) 1140715

***Nissan in Trouble; Plans to Close Oppama Factory in Japan by 2027***

(Central News Agency, Tokyo, July 15, via foreign news) Japanese car maker Nissan said today that it will close its Oppama factory, located in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, by the end of the 2027 financial year.

According to AFP, Nissan lost 671 billion Japanese yen (about 4.5 billion US dollars) last year. The company has already announced that it will cut 15% of its workers worldwide. In May, Nissan also said it would reduce its 17 car factories around the world to 10.

Nissan said in a statement today that it will stop making cars at the Oppama factory by the end of the 2027 financial year. It will move the production to another factory it already has in Kyushu.

This year, talks between Nissan and Honda about working together did not succeed. Nissan is now making changes to its business and making fewer cars.

The Oppama factory started in 1961 and is one of Nissan's main factories. It can make 240,000 cars a year, but it has not been used much because Nissan's sales are weak.

Former US President Trump put a 25% tax on Japanese cars earlier this year. Among the big Japanese car companies, Nissan is thought to be most affected by this. Experts say this is because Nissan's customers usually care more about the price.

One possible way for Nissan to improve is to work with Foxconn, a big electronics company from Taiwan. Foxconn is famous for making iPhones and is now getting into the car business.

Foxconn said in February that it would be open to buying shares from Renault, which owns a lot of Nissan. (Intern translator: Lo Wei-chieh/Editor: Chen Cheng-chien) 1140715
