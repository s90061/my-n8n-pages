**Tropical Depression Might Become Typhoon Danas: Southern and Hualien-Taitung Areas Should Prepare for Heavy Rain This Weekend**

The weather agency said today that a tropical system near the Philippines could become a tropical depression tomorrow. It might even become Typhoon Danas this weekend and could land in Taiwan. The system is expected to be closest to Taiwan on July 5th and 6th, bringing rain to all of Taiwan. Southern and Hualien-Taitung areas should prepare for heavy rain. The system will likely move west for the next two days, then turn north on the 5th. Its path after turning north is uncertain; it could pass by Taiwan's east or west coast, or even directly land on the island.
