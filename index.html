            <h1>Beyond Reality: Architects Explore Ideal Buildings at the Edge of What's Possible</h1>
            <p>How do architects go beyond what is real and build their dream buildings? Architects like Li Wen-sheng, Hsiao Li-jen, Que He-bin, Dai Chia-hui, and Lin Hsin-ping, along with their teams, are showing their ideas in an exhibition called "Beyond Reality" at Taipei National University of the Arts. They are looking at all the different things architecture can be.</p>
            <p>The Taiwan Modern Architecture Society, Shih Chien University, and Taipei National University of the Arts are working together to host this event.</p>
            <p>The person who planned the exhibition, Wang Chun-hsiung, said that Taiwan has changed a lot in the first 25 years of the 21st century. Cities and rural areas have been rebuilt many times. People have felt both hopeful and sad. In this time, architecture is not just about designing spaces and shapes. It must also respond to political, economic, and cultural facts.</p>
            <p>Wang Chun-hsiung said that the architects and their teams in the exhibition have been focusing on Taiwanese architecture since 2000. Their works are varied and cover both private and public areas. Their works show how Taiwan has changed over 25 years. They also show how these architects have worked hard to break limits. This gives new ideas for architecture in the future.</p>
            <p>In Li Wen-sheng's part of the exhibition, called "Inside Dust, Outside Hermitage," he shows two views: being involved in the world and being separate from it. In the busy city and the open nature, there is both the quiet of a meditation hall and the active flow of neighborhood life. This answers to living in both our daily lives and our minds.</p>
            <p>Hsiao Li-jen's part, "Where Do We Come From, Where Are We Going?", uses a central courtyard. It connects memories of home, deep thoughts, and group creative work. From old family homes to modern social housing, it shows Taiwanese people's ideas about space and their future across different generations.</p>
            <p>Que He-bin's part, "Between Real and Unreal," looks at how solid things and empty spaces mix together. He takes six parts of city life â€“ food, clothes, housing, transport, education, and entertainment â€“ to redefine how buildings connect private and public areas. He uses "empty spaces" to create new chances for people to meet and interact.</p>
            <p>Dai Chia-hui and Lin Hsin-ping's part, "A Trilogy of Public Life," puts their experience with public buildings into three sections: "Policy â€“ Design â€“ Life." It shows how public spaces turn from numbers in a policy into design actions. Finally, they become part of everyday life. This encourages more people to join in shaping the future of public life in Taiwan.</p>
            <p>"Beyond Reality: A Joint Exhibition by Four Groups of Architects" is open from now until September 28th. It is on the 3rd floor of the Technology Art Building at Taipei National University of the Arts. During the exhibition, there will be special talks every Saturday and guided tours by the architects every Sunday.</p>

            <h1>Former Vice President of Bank of China, Lin Jingzhen, Reportedly Missing</h1>
            <p>News says that Lin Jingzhen, who used to be a vice president at Bank of China, might be missing. Earlier this year, Lin Jingzhen left his jobs as an executive director and vice president of Bank of China, and as a non-executive director of BOC Hong Kong. At that time, he was not yet 60 years old, which is the normal retirement age.</p>
            <p>The Sing Tao Daily newspaper from Hong Kong reported today that it got news from mainland China saying Lin Jingzhen's phone is turned off.</p>
            <p>Reports say that Lin Jingzhen was born in May 1965 in Quanzhou, Fujian. He studied economics at Xiamen University. He worked for Bank of China for nearly 40 years. He worked in important areas like banking for businesses and international money matters. He also worked in Hong Kong from May 2015 to January 2018 as a vice president of BOC Hong Kong.</p>
            <p>Bank of China is one of the big banks owned by the government in China.</p>

            <h1>Cadeler Strengthens Asia-Pacific Offshore Wind Plans, Projects Visible Until 2030</h1>
            <p>Cadeler, a company from Denmark that moves and puts in offshore wind turbines, announced today that its team in Taipei has moved to a new, bigger office in the Xinyi District. This shows their strong promise to help the Asia-Pacific region grow in the long term. Right now, two of their work ships are active in the waters around Taiwan. They have projects planned until about 2030.</p>
            <p>Cadeler released a press statement today. It said that with the new office, Cadeler will be better able to take on and finish the quickly growing offshore wind projects in different Asia-Pacific countries. They are expanding from Taiwan to new wind power places like Vietnam, the Philippines, South Korea, and Australia.</p>
            <p>Cadeler explained that after joining with Seajacks/Eneti in 2023, Cadeler built its presence in Taiwan. This included working on Taiwan's first large-scale operating offshore wind farm, Formosa 1. Currently, Cadeler has two work ships in Taiwan's waters. One, called Wind Maker, is helping Ã˜rsted install 14MW wind turbines for the Greater Changhua Southwest 2 and Northwest wind farms. The other, Wind Zaratan, has a long-term service contract with Vestas.</p>
            <p>For future projects, Cadeler's ships have work planned in the Asia-Pacific region until around 2030. For example, in 2027, the Wind Maker will help install wind turbines for CIP's Fengmiao Phase 1 wind farm project. In 2028, it will help SRE, a company that develops wind power, install Siemens Gamesa 14MW wind turbines for the Formosa 4 offshore wind farm.</p>
            <p>Cadeler stated that the Asia-Pacific region is seen as a very important market for offshore wind growth. Taiwan continues to be a leader, with many wind farms working and more planned. South Korea and Japan are working to reach higher goals. Australia shows promise for deep-water wind power. Vietnam has also confirmed its goals for offshore wind power. The Philippines has finished its first bid for projects, and Singapore is actively becoming a main place for importing renewable energy.</p>
            <p>Cadeler's new Taipei office looks similar to its European offices in design and company image. It can hold at least twice as many people and has room to grow. Mikkel Gleerup, the CEO of Cadeler, said the new Taipei office will be Cadeler's main center for operations in the Asia-Pacific. It will support the local team, make customer relationships stronger, and help with projects across different countries. This will bring energy to the future of clean energy in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
            <p>Tony Lu, Cadeler's Asia-Pacific manager, said that the new office is not just a place to work. It also shows the company's trust in the Asia-Pacific market. With two ships working actively in Taiwan and many projects already planned, this new office will provide the space and energy needed to meet the growing demands of the market.</p>
