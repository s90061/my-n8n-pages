            <h1>Sun Chia-hung Becomes Taiwan's Flag Bearer at World Games, Says It Feels "Like a Dream"</h1>
            <p>The 2025 Chengdu World Games held its opening ceremony today. Sun Chia-hung is a martial arts athlete, and he became the first martial arts athlete to be the flag bearer for Taiwan's team. He was very excited and said this moment felt like something that happens only in a dream.</p>
            <p>In the last World Games in Birmingham, Taiwan won 1 gold medal, 6 silver medals, and 6 bronze medals. For this Chengdu World Games, Taiwan has sent 120 athletes who will compete in 14 different sports. Taiwan's women's tug-of-war team will try to win their 6th straight championship in the 500-kilogram group, which would be a first in history.</p>
            <p>At the opening ceremony of the Chengdu World Games today, Sun Chia-hung and Huang Mei-chien were the flag bearers for Taiwan's team. They walked in at the 104th spot, between Syria and the Czech Republic. A total of 64 athletes from Taiwan took part in the big event. They are competing in sports like canoe polo, korfball, orienteering, water sports, roller sports, water skiing, wushu (martial arts), and tug-of-war.</p>
            <p>Sun Chia-hung won a gold medal in Taijiquan and a silver medal in Taijijian at the 2021 Chengdu World University Games. Now, he is back in Chengdu and has become the first martial arts athlete to be a flag bearer. He told reporters that this scene is something he has dreamed of since he was a child. He also said that this is the result of hard work over time, and that many older athletes before him achieved great results. Together, they have helped Taiwan's martial arts gain a good reputation and be seen more in international competitions.</p>
            <p>Huang Mei-chien was a swimmer for Taiwan in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. In recent years, she has been focusing more on coaching. However, she still actively competes in finswimming. In 2024, she won a gold medal in the 50-meter bi-fins race at the World Finswimming Championships. Huang Mei-chien shared that she has been an athlete's representative and a torchbearer before. But this is her first time as a flag bearer. She said she felt "very excited and a little nervous," and hopes to complete this important task well.</p>

            <h1>If Your Car Is Flooded, FSC Says You Need Extra Insurance to Be Covered</h1>
            <p>Recently, heavy rains from a southwest air current caused serious damage in central and southern Taiwan. Many cars were flooded. Today, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said that regular car insurance, like Type A, B, or C vehicle damage insurance, does not cover losses caused by typhoons or floods. If people want protection for this type of damage, they must add a special clause called "Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood or Water Accumulation Due to Rain Additional Clause." Only then will they be covered.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan, the deputy head of the FSC's Insurance Bureau, explained in a regular meeting today that insurance is divided into two parts: insurance for individuals and insurance for businesses. The areas affected in central and southern Taiwan are large, and not only individuals and businesses but also homes and cars might be damaged. For individual insurance, current home fire insurance policies already include "Residential Typhoon and Flood Disaster Compensation Insurance." If a house is flooded by more than 50 centimeters because of a typhoon or flood, this insurance provides basic coverage of NT$7,000 to NT$9,000 for three different areas.</p>
            <p>Chen Ching-yuan pointed out that if people feel the basic coverage is not enough, they can ask their insurance company to add the "Excess Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause." This extra clause offers more payment than the basic coverage. It also provides NT$3,000 per day for temporary housing, for up to 60 days.</p>
            <p>Also, there have been many mudslide disasters recently. Chen Ching-yuan said that if a house is in a low-lying area or on a hillside, people can choose to add the "Land Subsidence, Landslide or Landslide Insurance Additional Clause." This protects against losses caused by land sliding or sinking, landslides, loose ground, or sand and soil washing away (including mudslides), which happen because of typhoons or floods.</p>
            <p>He explained that many cars have also been damaged by floods. However, current car insurance policies, like Type A, B, or C vehicle damage insurance, do not cover losses from typhoons or floods. If people live in a low area and think a typhoon or flood might damage their car, they can add the "Typhoon, Earthquake, Tsunami, Hail, Flood or Water Accumulation Due to Rain Additional Clause." This will protect their vehicle from losses caused by typhoons, floods, or similar events.</p>
            <p>For business insurance, Chen Ching-yuan said that businesses most often buy commercial fire insurance, which is called "Commercial Fire Comprehensive Insurance." This type of insurance covers buildings, machines, and movable property for losses from sudden and unexpected accidents. Therefore, it also covers losses caused by typhoons and floods.</p>
            <p>However, Chen Ching-yuan also mentioned that commercial fire insurance needs a clear list of what is covered. So, if losses from typhoons or floods are not clearly listed, businesses can add the "Typhoon and Flood Insurance Additional Clause" separately. This helps them manage the financial risk from natural disasters. He advises businesses to talk to their insurance company when buying insurance to make sure the coverage meets their needs.</p>

            <h1>Taipower Says Xidong Line Project Damaged Power Line; New Taipei MRT Bureau Will Investigate</h1>
            <p>Songshan Airport had a power cut tonight. Taipower (Taiwan Power Company) said that the Xizhi-Donghu Line construction project by the New Taipei City MRT Bureau accidentally damaged a power line, causing the outage. However, the New Taipei City MRT Bureau replied that they are not yet sure if their project caused the power cut. They will let Taipower enter the site tomorrow morning to check and find out the truth.</p>
            <p>The Civil Aeronautics Administration stated that the power cut at Songshan Airport lasted only 3 to 4 seconds, and no flights were affected. Also, many areas in Songshan District experienced brief power cuts, including escalators at Nanjing Fuxing MRT station stopping.</p>
            <p>Taipower said that after checking, the New Taipei City MRT Bureau's Xizhi-Donghu Line project accidentally damaged a power transmission line. This caused a very quick drop in electrical voltage. As a result, the power at Songshan Airport, Taipei MRT, and Far EasTone headquarters briefly flickered. Taipower's power supply is now working normally.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City Government MRT Engineering Bureau explained through a message that the MRT Xidong Line project was doing drilling work on Tongxing Road in Xizhi District. According to the high-voltage power line map provided by Taipower, there was no 161KV high-voltage power line under the ground at that specific location. Also, the construction company dug down 2.5 meters and drilled 40 meters, but they did not find any pipes or lines. Because of this, they are not yet sure if their work caused the power cut.</p>
            <p>The New Taipei City MRT Bureau said that since Taipower directly stated that the Xidong Line project was the cause, they will arrange for traffic control and let Taipower enter the site tomorrow morning to check. This will help them understand the real reason for the incident.</p>
