            <h1>Trump's UN Speech: Teleprompter Problems Make It More Interesting</h1>
            <p>Today, during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, U.S. President Trump faced some unexpected issues. First, the escalator suddenly stopped. Then, the teleprompter broke. After the speech, he wrote online that these two things might have made the speech more interesting than planned. He also said his speech was about energy and immigration, and the UN General Assembly was the best place to talk about these important topics.</p>
            <p>The main debate of the United Nations General Assembly (UN General Assembly) began today. President Donald Trump and other world leaders spoke one after another.</p>
            <p>After giving a nearly one-hour speech at the UN today, Trump posted on his social media, "Truth Social." He wrote that his speech focused on energy and immigration. He said these are topics he has talked about for a long time. The UN General Assembly was the best place to make these important statements.</p>
            <p>He also mentioned the problems he faced at the UN today. These included the broken teleprompter and the escalator stopping when he and his wife, Melania Trump, were going to the stage.</p>
            <p>He said, "But these two things might have made the speech more interesting than it would have been." He added, "It is always an honor to speak at the United Nations, even if their equipment isn't perfect."</p>
            <p>Regarding immigration, Trump's speech criticized the United Nations for giving money to immigrants who need help. He accused the UN of "paying for attacks against Western countries and their borders" and "supporting people who enter the U.S. illegally." At the same time, he praised his strict immigration policies.</p>
            <p>Trump also criticized green energy in his speech. He said it is too expensive and that renewable energy is "a joke."</p>
            <p>He stated, "In my opinion, climate change is the biggest scam in the world's history... the carbon footprint is a trick made up by bad people, and they are heading towards complete destruction."</p>

            <h1>UN Warns: Unsolved Inequality and Stalled Social Justice Threaten Democracy</h1>
            <p>The United Nations warned today that deep-rooted inequality is reducing people's trust in systems and democracies worldwide. This is happening even though there has been great progress in education and reducing poverty in recent decades.</p>
            <p>According to Agence France-Presse, 30 years ago, world leaders met in Copenhagen for the first World Summit for Social Development. There, they promised to end poverty, create jobs, and help people feel more included in society.</p>
            <p>The UN's International Labour Organization (ILO) praised the progress made since that summit in its newest report. It said the world has become "richer, healthier, and more educated." That summit was the largest meeting of world leaders ever.</p>
            <p>However, the report also warned: "The benefits of development are not shared equally. Progress in reducing inequality has stopped. Serious global inequality still exists." This report was released before a follow-up summit in Qatar in November.</p>
            <p>Gilbert Houngbo, the ILO's Director-General, said in a statement: "The world has made clear progress, but we cannot ignore that millions of people still lack jobs and respect. Social justice is not just a moral duty; it is also key for economic safety, social unity, and peace."</p>
            <p>The report listed important achievements from the past 30 years. For example, the number of child laborers aged 5 to 14 has fallen by half, from 20% to 10%.</p>
            <p>The report also showed that the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide has dropped from 39% to 10%. Also, the rate of children finishing primary school has gone up by 17 percentage points.</p>
            <p>But the ILO also warned that problems are still "serious and ongoing." The report said that efforts to improve job quality have stopped. Globally, 58% of workers still have informal jobs. This number has only dropped by 2 percentage points since 1995. Also, the number of people in forced labor has increased.</p>
            <p>Even though unemployment rates are at record lows, especially in rich countries, the ILO still warned that "the quality of work is getting worse in many areas... This makes economic safety, security, and rights weaker."</p>

            <h1>EU and WHO Say Painkillers in Pregnancy Are Not Linked to Autism, Disagree with Trump</h1>
            <p>Today, health groups in the European Union and the UK confirmed that it is safe to take paracetamol during pregnancy. They disagreed with warnings from U.S. President Trump, who claimed this common painkiller is linked to autism.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that the World Health Organization (WHO) said the evidence for a link is still unclear. They asked people to be careful before making conclusions.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Trump said that autism is linked to childhood vaccines and pregnant women taking Tylenol (paracetamol). He brought these claims, which are not based on science, into the center of U.S. health policy.</p>
            <p>Today, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said there is no new information to change Europe's current advice on using paracetamol (called Tylenol in the U.S.) during pregnancy.</p>
            <p>The EMA said in a statement: "Current evidence does not show a link between using paracetamol during pregnancy and autism." They also added that pregnant women can use the medicine if needed, but they should take the smallest amount that works and not too often.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, the UK health regulator said the medicine is safe to use.</p>
            <p>When asked about a possible link between taking paracetamol during pregnancy and autism, Tarik Jasarevic, a WHO spokesperson, said at a press conference in Geneva: "The evidence available is still not clear."</p>
            <p>He mentioned some studies that suggested a possible link but did not give specific details. He also said that later studies did not confirm this. He said, "This lack of repeated results reminds us to be careful when we try to decide what causes what."</p>
            <p>Viktor Ahlqvist, who led the biggest study so far on the possible link between paracetamol use during pregnancy and autism, said that the Trump administration "seems to have misunderstood the current evidence."</p>
            <p>Ahlqvist stated: "Our study found no proof that taking paracetamol during pregnancy causes autism." This study looked at data from 2.5 million pregnancies in Sweden.</p>
            <p>Ahlqvist pointed out that taking any medicine during pregnancy can be connected to bad results for children. However, he explained that this is usually not because of the medicine itself. Instead, it is because of the mother's health problems that led her to take the medicine.</p>
