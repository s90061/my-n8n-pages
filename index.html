            <h1>US Police Raid Hyundai Factory, Detain 450 People Including Koreans</h1>
            <p>US police and immigration officers raided a Hyundai car factory in Georgia. They detained around 450 foreign people who were living in the US illegally, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said today.</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that earlier news said this factory was a joint project between battery maker LG Energy Solution and Hyundai Motor. Some South Korean people were held by US immigration officers during the raid.</p>
            <p>The US Department of Justice in Atlanta posted about the raid on X, a social media platform. LG Energy Solution did not want to comment. A Hyundai Motor representative did not answer immediately.</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that US immigration officers raided Hyundai's large electric vehicle (EV) factory in southeast Georgia on September 4th, US time. They also closed a nearby construction site for an EV battery factory.</p>
            <p>Lindsay Williams, a spokesperson for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), confirmed that federal officers were working at the 1214-hectare factory area west of Savannah. He said the officers mainly focused on the battery factory construction site.</p>
            <p>Georgia highway police blocked roads leading to the Hyundai factory area. The Georgia Department of Public Safety said in a statement that highway police were sent to help the federal officers.</p>
            <p>Videos on social media showed workers in yellow safety vests standing in a line. A man wearing a mask and a tactical vest with "Homeland Security Investigations" (HSI) written on it told them: "We are from Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole place."</p>
            <p>He added: "We need to stop all construction work immediately. All work at the site must stop right now."</p>
            <p>The US government under President Trump carried out many ICE operations to send large numbers of people back to their home countries. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants, and car repair shops.</p>

            <h1>US and Japan Exchange Documents on Trade Agreement, Including Investment Profit Sharing</h1>
            <p>Japanese official Akazawa Ryomasa visited the US starting on September 4th to discuss tariffs. During this visit, Japan and the United States exchanged two documents. One document formally recorded their agreement from July, and the other was a memo about Japan's investments in the US, which included how investment profits would be shared.</p>
            <p>Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) reported that the first document was a "Joint Statement" that wrote down what both sides agreed on July 22nd.</p>
            <p>The statement said that Japan will import 75% more US rice under the "Minimum Access (MA)" quota. It will also buy US farm products like soybeans, corn, fertilizers, and biofuel ethanol worth 8 billion US dollars (about 246 billion New Taiwan Dollars) every year.</p>
            <p>The statement also mentioned that Japan will buy US energy products, including liquefied natural gas, for a long time. This will be worth 7 billion US dollars (about 216 billion New Taiwan Dollars) each year. In the future, Japan might also buy liquefied natural gas from Alaska, USA.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the statement noted that Japan will buy 100 Boeing airplanes from the US. According to Japan's "Defense Capability Building Plan," Japan will buy more US-made defense equipment and semiconductors, worth billions of US dollars each year. Also, US-made cars that have US safety approval will not need extra tests to be sold in Japan.</p>
            <p>The second document was a "Memorandum of Understanding" about Japan's investments in the United States. When Japan and the US talked about tariffs in late July, Japan promised to invest 550 billion US dollars in the US.</p>
            <p>This memo said that to help both economic and national security (defense) interests, Japan believes investing 550 billion US dollars in areas like semiconductors, medicines, important minerals, shipbuilding, energy, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the best choice.</p>
            <p>An investment committee, led by the US Commerce Secretary, will suggest where to invest. Then, the US President will make the final decision.</p>
            <p>These investments will happen anytime during US President Donald Trump's term, which ends on January 19, 2029. If Japan keeps its promises in the memo, the US will not increase the agreed tariff rates.</p>
            <p>According to this memo, for a certain amount of profit from these investments, it will be split 50/50. After that, 90% of the profit will go to the US and 10% to Japan.</p>
            <p>The White House announced today that President Trump signed an executive order. This order lowered the 25% tariff on Japanese cars to 15%. It also made Japan a country eligible for equal tariff reductions, meaning the 15% tariff would not be added on top of other tariffs.</p>
            <p>Akazawa Ryomasa, Japan's Minister for Economic Revitalization, who represented the Japanese government in tariff talks with the US, signed the "Memorandum of Understanding" today with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. This memo was about Japan's previously agreed 550 billion US dollar investment in the US.</p>
