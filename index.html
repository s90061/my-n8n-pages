            <h1>Pegula Wins Easily Against Krejcikova, Reaches US Open Semifinals</h1>
            <p>New York (CNA) â€“ Jessica Pegula, the number 4 seed from the US, won her quarter-final match at the US Open today. She beat Barbora Krejcikova from the Czech Republic, who has won two Grand Slam titles before, with a score of 6-3, 6-3. Pegula will now play in the women's singles semifinals. This is the second year in a row that Pegula has reached the US Open semifinals.</p>
            <p>Last year, Pegula reached the final at the US Open but did not win. In this year's tournament, she has not lost any set yet. Today, she played against Krejcikova, who is ranked 62nd in the world, and won steadily, showing her strong form.</p>
            <p>After the match, Pegula said in an interview, "I think I played very well today, and I felt very comfortable."</p>
            <p>In the semifinals, Pegula will play against either Aryna Sabalenka, the world's number one player and last year's champion, or Marketa Vondrousova from the Czech Republic, who won Wimbledon in 2023. This match will decide who goes to the final.</p>
            <p>Krejcikova came back to play after a six-month break due to a back injury. In her match before this one, against Taylor Townsend from the US, she saved 8 match points and won. However, she could not continue her good performance in this match and did not achieve another great result.</p>
            <p>Pegula said, "Everyone saw how she played in her last match, so I am happy that I could finish this match."</p>

            <h1>Protests Continue in Indonesia; President Prabowo Visits China for Parade</h1>
            <p>Jakarta (CNA) â€“ Indonesia's President Prabowo Subianto had planned to cancel his trip to China because of recent protests in his country. However, Indonesian officials said today that Prabowo will still go to Beijing on September 3rd to attend a parade celebrating the 80th anniversary of China's victory in the war against Japan.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, Indonesia is in a difficult situation because of large protests where at least 8 people have died. The protests started because people were angry about the good benefits that members of parliament receive. As the protests grew, Prabowo said he would reduce some of the benefits and allowances for members of parliament to calm the public.</p>
            <p>Prasetyo Hadi, Indonesia's State Secretary, said that Prabowo left for China tonight and is expected to return home one day later.</p>
            <p>He said, "The President has been checking the latest situation today and has received reports from all relevant government departments that society is slowly returning to normal."</p>
            <p>Prasetyo Hadi also said that Prabowo plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit.</p>
            <p>Reports say that after the benefits for Indonesian members of parliament were cut and the army was sent to Jakarta on September 1st, the protests there have become smaller.</p>
            <p>Indonesia has always tried to be neutral in its foreign policy, keeping good relationships with both the United States and China. However, Prabowo has promised to work more closely with China in terms of diplomacy and defense.</p>

            <h1>Tunisian Man Stabs 5 People in Marseille; French Police Kill Attacker</h1>
            <p>Marseille (CNA) â€“ The public prosecutor in France said that police today killed a man in the southern port city of Marseille. This man was suspected of stabbing at least 5 people, and one of them is in a very serious condition.</p>
            <p>According to AFP news, prosecutor Nicolas Bessone told reporters that the attacker was a man from Tunisia who was living legally in France. He stabbed the manager of a hotel. The manager had just asked him to leave because he had not paid for his stay.</p>
            <p>Bessone said that the suspect also attacked the manager's son, another person staying at the hotel, and two people on the street. The person staying at the hotel was hurt the most seriously.</p>
            <p>A police source, who did not want to be named, said that the police came and killed the man.</p>
            <p>The office of Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said that Retailleau plans to go to Marseille tonight. He is expected to visit the police headquarters in the city.</p>
            <p>A resident who saw what happened told AFP that the suspect tried to stab police officers when they tried to arrest him.</p>
            <p>Another person who saw the event told AFP that the man had "two big knives for killing."</p>
            <p>Police blocked off the area and set up a special tent for collecting evidence in front of a fast-food restaurant.</p>
            <p>Reuters news reported that Bessone and the police said the Tunisian attacker had two knives and an iron bar.</p>
            <p>The incident happened at 2:45 PM local time in the 1st district of Marseille.</p>
