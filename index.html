            <h1>Southwest Winds Get Stronger, Rain Spreads; West Taiwan Should Prepare for Heavy Rain from August 2nd to 4th</h1>
            <p>The weather office said that today, the mountains in Kaohsiung and Pingtung will continue to have very heavy rain in some areas. From tomorrow until August 4th, the southwest winds will get stronger, and there will be more rain. West Taiwan should be ready for heavy rain or very heavy rain in some places. On August 2nd and 3rd, the mountains south of Chiayi should be careful of very heavy rain or even more extreme rain in some spots.</p>
            <p>The Central Weather Office of the Ministry of Transportation continues to warn about large and strong heavy rain. Forecaster Chu Mei-lin said at a press meeting that today, central and southern Taiwan will still have rain showers or thunderstorms from time to time. The mountains in Kaohsiung and Pingtung continue to have very heavy rain in some areas. As of 2 PM, Pingtung mountains had more than 370 millimeters of rain, and Kaohsiung mountains had more than 200 millimeters. In Sandimen, Pingtung, 3 hours of rain at noon reached over 200 millimeters, which is considered very heavy rain in a short time.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin said that the southwest winds bring a lot of moisture, which makes strong rain clouds form. This causes a lot of rain in the mountains of Kaohsiung and Pingtung. Today, the mountains in Greater Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Yilan will have thunderstorms in the afternoon. Some areas will have strong rain in a short time, with more than 40 or 50 millimeters of rain.</p>
            <p>As the low-pressure area slowly moves north, Chu Mei-lin pointed out that from tomorrow until August 4th, the stronger southwest winds will bring more clear rain to Taiwan.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin said that from day to night tomorrow, the rain area in central and southern Taiwan will get bigger. Northern, northeastern, and eastern Taiwan will also have rain on and off. Western Taiwan might have heavy rain or very heavy rain in some parts.</p>
            <p>Chu Mei-lin said that on August 5th, as the southwest winds become weaker, the rain will slowly decrease. From August 6th to 8th, the weather will mostly be cloudy to sunny.</p>
            <p>Also, Tropical Depression No. 13 formed this morning. Chu Mei-lin said it is expected to become a light typhoon, but it will not directly affect Taiwan's weather. Its path will mostly be towards the northeast.</p>

            <h1>Reporter on Site / Beijing Heavy Rain Causes 44 Deaths; Village with Nursing Home is Closed Off</h1>
            <p>(Beijing, August 1st, CNA Reporter Hsieh Yi-hsuan) Heavy rain in Beijing for many days caused a disaster, leading to 44 deaths. The village where the nursing home with many deaths and injuries is located has been closed off with barrier tape. Also, in Xiazhazi Village, Dachengzi Town, a mountain area, the road collapsed. Workers said that parts of this village are badly damaged, and houses have been washed away.</p>
            <p>Yesterday, Beijing city officials held a press meeting about flood control and disaster relief. They reported that the heavy rain over several days has caused 44 deaths in the whole city. Among these, 31 people died at a nursing home in Taishitun Town, Miyun District. Most of them were elderly people who could not move easily.</p>
            <p>The official website of the Beijing city government shows that this nursing home is in Putao Garden Village, Taishitun Town. Today, a reporter went to Putao Garden Village. Outside the village, barrier tape was put up, and staff were controlling who could enter. Other people were not allowed to go in.</p>
            <p>Around Putao Garden Village, you can see signs where the floodwaters passed. Many power poles were knocked down, and a car was washed away by the flood, getting stuck between a house and a power pole. Some residents used the sunny morning to throw away furniture that was in the water inside their houses and to clean out the mud. The outer walls of the houses still have mud and water marks. Also, some people were making calls to apply for insurance.</p>
            <p>The reporter, acting as a regular person, asked a local resident. She said she was inside her house when the flood happened. At 6 AM, she woke up, and "the power lines in the back had no electricity. I ran out to see, and people outside said the power pole in front had fallen, and then the water came."</p>
            <p>Local residents said that some areas have power again, but they don't have normal water. By the stream between villages, people can be seen riding bikes to the stream to get water. Near construction sites, bottled water is also seen everywhere on the ground.</p>
            <p>Xiazhazi Village in Dachengzi Town, Miyun District, Beijing, about 24 kilometers from Taishitun Town, is badly damaged. On the way to the village, many parts of the road have collapsed, bridges have fallen down, and power poles have fallen.</p>
            <p>On the road to the Xiazhazi Village Committee, less than 2 kilometers of the road has collapsed. It is not possible to go to the village center. A search and rescue team is ready to go to the village center to help. As far as the eye can see, part of Xiazhazi Village in that area has about 30 houses, and their foundations have been washed away by the flood.</p>
            <p>The reporter, acting as a regular person, asked a worker if the area ahead was a heavily damaged area. He said, "Yes, (the current road section) was just laid yesterday, and all the houses were washed away. You can see the house foundations are gone."</p>
            <p>Around Miyun Reservoir, which is about 1.5 to 2 hours drive from central Beijing, many business people run campsites. However, most of the things set up in these campsites were also washed away by the flood.</p>
            <p>Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday that from July 23rd to 29th, Beijing had continuous, very heavy rainfall. Far-off areas like Miyun, Huairou, Yanqing, and Pinggu were badly affected. Currently, Beijing city officials are working hard on disaster relief, dealing with the aftermath, and rebuilding.</p>
