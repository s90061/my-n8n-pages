An investment group from the insurance company Prudential Financial has agreed to provide up to $500 million in financing to Affirm, a company that offers "buy now, pay later" services. This type of loan is known as private credit, which means it comes directly from an investment firm instead of being sold on public markets. Companies like Affirm, which are not traditional banks, are increasingly working with large financial partners to make sure they have enough money to lend to their customers. This deal is part of a larger $1.7 billion financing arrangement for Affirm and shows how investment firms are becoming more important in providing loans to consumer finance companies.

**Gucci Owner Picks Auto Executive for One of Global Luxury’s Top Jobs**

Kering, the company that owns luxury brands like Gucci and Saint Laurent, has chosen a new leader to help improve its performance.
