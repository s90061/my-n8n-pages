            <h1>Evergreen Air Salary Dispute: Minister Says No Bad Treatment for Parental Leave</h1>
            <p>Evergreen Airlines is in a disagreement because more than 60 flight attendants on parental leave say their pay raises were affected. On July 17, Minister of Labor Hong Shen-han said that companies should not treat workers unfairly because they take parental leave. He hopes companies and the government can work together to create better workplaces.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Flight Attendants Union recently protested. They said over 60 Evergreen flight attendants complained that parental leave stopped them from getting pay raises. The Ministry of Labor's Appeals Committee also decided that affecting pay raises because of parental leave is against the Gender Equality in Employment Act. They asked the labor department to quickly check and confirm that this is illegal. They also asked Evergreen Airlines to pay back the flight attendants who were on parental leave and to stop appealing this decision.</p>
            <p>Before attending a meeting, Minister Hong Shen-han spoke to the media about this case. He said the Ministry of Labor has clearly stated that employers cannot let parental leave affect bonuses, allowances, or pay raises. He said, "Parental leave cannot be a reason for employers to treat workers badly."</p>
            <p>Hong said that the Ministry of Labor's Appeals Committee has made a professional decision. They believe the local government's decision that the employer broke the law was correct.</p>
            <p>Hong also said that Taiwan has a very serious problem with fewer babies being born. He hopes that employers can work with the government to make a better work environment for workers who have children.</p>
            <p>Last year, Evergreen Airlines was found to have broken the Gender Equality in Employment Act seven times. One of these cases was about "parental leave being counted as time not at work, which affected pay raises." After a union leader, Lin Yu-chia, complained and won, more than 60 Evergreen flight attendants made similar complaints.</p>
            <p>The Taoyuan City Department of Labor said recently that for two complaints from last year, the city has already punished Evergreen for breaking the Gender Equality in Employment Act. They have now received over 60 more complaints from Evergreen flight attendants. They will hold a gender equality meeting at the end of July to check these cases. Evergreen Airlines said they will wait for the results of their legal appeals before doing anything.</p>

            <h1>TSMC's US Training Program: Burger Shop Worker Becomes Chip Technician</h1>
            <p>TSMC Arizona, a part of TSMC in the US, started a training program last year. It teaches people to become semiconductor technicians. Now, nearly 150 technicians are in this program. A local TV station in Arizona talked to one of the trainees, Nolan Cottingham. Through this program, he went from working at a burger shop to becoming a semiconductor process technician.</p>
            <p>Cottingham shared his experience in the program with CW7 Arizona. He worked at an In-N-Out restaurant for six years. When he saw that the training program was open for applications, he quickly applied. After passing the interview, he joined the program.</p>
            <p>Cottingham said he works in the process department. His job is to watch the machines to make sure everything is running well. He reports any mistakes or problems to the engineers. He said going from cooking burgers every day to this new job felt like hitting a wall. He had to learn a lot of new things.</p>
            <p>He explained that he is learning how all the tools work. His job involves using ion beams. These beams put ions into tiny parts on a chip called transistors. This makes them positive or negative so electricity can flow through them. When he first started, all the special words and short forms felt like a new language.</p>
            <p>Cottingham said that the semiconductor industry is growing fast. He hopes to become a senior process technician in 10 years. By then, he expects to have a good salary and make sure everything works smoothly.</p>
            <p>TSMC said that the training program is supported by the Phoenix government. It works with industry groups, local government, and schools. It gives chances to people who want to start a career in the semiconductor industry. Employees in the program get a certificate after working enough hours at TSMC Arizona. They can also improve their skills by taking classes at local community colleges.</p>
            <p>The general manager of TSMC Arizona, Castanares, said that everyone needs the semiconductor industry because modern life depends on it. He added that the world always needs more computing power, and people need it every day. (Edited by Chang Liang-chih) 1140717</p>

            <h1>Former Tibet Leader Wu Yingjie Gets Death Sentence with Delay for Taking Bribes (About 1.4 Billion)</h1>
            <p>Wu Yingjie, the former Communist Party Secretary of Tibet, was sentenced to death with a two-year delay yesterday. This was a first trial. He was found guilty of taking bribes worth over 343 million Chinese Yuan, which is about 1.37 billion New Taiwan Dollars.</p>
            <p>According to the People's Daily app, the Beijing No. 3 Intermediate People's Court announced the judgment for Wu Yingjie's bribery case on July 16. The court sentenced Wu Yingjie to death for bribery, with a two-year suspension. He will also lose his political rights forever, and all his personal money and property will be taken. The money and gifts Wu Yingjie received from bribes, and any profits from them, will be taken by the government. If there is not enough, the government will continue to take more.</p>
            <p>The report stated that the court found Wu Yingjie used his power from June 2006 to February 2021. He was the Standing Committee member of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, Head of the Propaganda Department, Vice Chairman of the government, and later Deputy Secretary and Secretary of the Party Committee. He helped certain companies and people with engineering projects and running their businesses. In return, he illegally took money and gifts, which added up to over 343 million Yuan.</p>
            <p>The court said that the amount of money Wu Yingjie took was very large. His crime was very serious, and it had a very bad effect on society. It caused great losses to the country and its people. Therefore, he should be sentenced to death. However, "Wu Yingjie reported other people who might have broken the law, and this information was found to be true. This is a big help." Also, he did not complete some of his bribery crimes. He also told the investigation team about most of the bribes they did not know about. He admitted his mistakes and returned the money. Most of the money and gifts he took, and their profits, have already been returned. Because of these reasons, the death sentence can be delayed. The court then made the decision mentioned above.</p>
            <p>"Suspended death sentence" is a shorter name for "death penalty with a delay of execution." This is a special punishment system in China. During the delay, the person must stay in prison. If they do not commit new crimes during this time, their sentence will change to life imprisonment. If they do something very helpful, it can even change to a fixed prison term. If they commit another intentional crime, and it is proven true by the Supreme People's Court, then the death penalty will be carried out.</p>
            <p>Public information shows that Wu Yingjie is 69 years old. He worked in Tibet for 47 years. He became the Communist Party Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region in August 2016. He left this job in October 2021. After that, in March 2023, he became a member of the Standing Committee of the 14th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Director of the Culture, History, and Learning Committee. He held this position until June 2024, when it was announced that he was being investigated. Then he was removed from his jobs.</p>
            <p>In December of the same year, it was announced that Wu Yingjie was removed from the Communist Party and from public service. The announcement said he "did not strongly follow the Party's new policies for governing Tibet." He was heavily involved in engineering projects, acting for his own benefit. This badly affected Tibet's development. He also failed to properly manage the Party's strict rules, which helped corruption grow and damaged the political system. In March this year, prosecutors formally charged Wu Yingjie, and his bribery case was heard in court. (Edited by Chang Shu-ling/Chen Kai-yu) 1140716</p>
