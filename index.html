            <h1>China's A-shares Keep Rising, Shanghai Index Hits New 10-Year High</h1>
            <p>Today, China's three main stock indexes, called A-shares, all started higher. The Shanghai Composite Index (or "Hu Zhi") went back above 3700 points. It broke its previous high of 3731.69 points from February 18, 2021. This is the highest it has been since August 20, 2015.</p>
            <p>China had a big stock market crash in 2015. On June 12 of that year, the Shanghai Composite Index reached its highest point ever at 5178.19 points. After that, it fell a lot and stayed around 3000 points for many years.</p>
            <p>According to Chinese media, the Shanghai Index has gone up a lot, by 22.72%, since it reached a low of 3040.69 points on April 7, 2025. It is also important to know that the Shenzhen Component Index has gone up by almost 30% in the same time, and the ChiNext Index has gone up by 47%.</p>
            <p>China's Industrial Securities company believes that this market increase is not mainly because people expect the economy to get much better. More importantly, government support and new growth areas are making the market stronger. This brings more trust and new money into the market. The market might take a small break after rising for a long time. Recent policies from China and other countries have just given a good chance for this to happen.</p>
            <p>Guotai Haitong Securities thinks that A-share indexes might reach new highs. People usually think that things like how well companies do, interest rates, and how much people are willing to take risks affect stock prices. But they often forget something very important: changes in rules. This factor is more important in the Chinese market than in other markets. Sometimes, it is even the most important factor.</p>

            <h1>Bolivia Presidential Election: Two Right-Wing Candidates Go to Second Round</h1>
            <p>In Bolivia today, a presidential election was held. Early results show that two right-wing candidates won the first round. This means that the country's left-wing government, which has been in power for almost 20 years, will end. The election will now have a second round of voting.</p>
            <p>According to news from AFP, two groups that do surveys, Ipsos and Captura, made predictions based on some of the results. They said that a center-right senator named Rodrigo Paz got the most votes in the first round, with more than 31%. This was a surprise.</p>
            <p>The numbers showed that the next person with the most votes was the former right-wing president, Jorge "Tuto" Quiroga. He got about 27% of the votes.</p>
            <p>Samuel Doria Medina, a rich businessman who many thought would do well, ended up in third place with 19.5% to 20.2% of the votes. The main left-wing candidate, Andronico Rodriguez, who is the head of the Senate, was in fourth place with much fewer votes.</p>
            <p>Bolivia's weak economy was the most important issue for voters. The country is going through its worst economic crisis in a generation. Because of this, many voters decided not to support the ruling party, the Movement for Socialism.</p>

            <h1>National Academy of Education Teams Up with Yilan County Government to Create Special Learning Areas</h1>
            <p>Today, the National Academy of Education and the Yilan County Government signed an agreement to work together for two years. They will combine their resources to build "regional experimental sites." These sites will be special places to try new ideas in education, especially for including all students and using digital technology in new ways.</p>
            <p>The National Academy of Education said today in a press release that Yilan County has worked hard for a long time on outdoor education, making education fair for everyone, and teaching students about social and emotional skills. This new partnership will focus on designing lessons and new ways of teaching. They will use the nature and community resources in Yilan to create these experimental sites. They will work together on many things, from designing lessons and setting up the sites to developing teachers and pushing for new policies.</p>
            <p>The Academy also said that these experimental sites will help make ideas real. Learning will not just be from books; it will happen in classrooms and outside. Students will truly experience and learn things. Digital development is a very important part of this plan. They will also make sure that students with special needs can learn equally and will create outdoor lessons that include all students.</p>
            <p>Also, the National Academy of Education recently signed an agreement to share ideas and work with Yilan University. In the future, the Academy, Yilan University, and the Yilan County Government will work together in a three-way partnership. The "experimental sites" will be the main focus. They will create a model in Yilan and then share it with the whole country. This will bring together research, management, and expert knowledge. They will use Yilan's natural environment to create learning platforms that combine different subjects. They will also improve lesson design, train teachers, and include local culture in education.</p>
            <p>The National Academy of Education hopes that this partnership will create new ways of teaching that are unique to the local area, use new ideas, and have a good system for getting feedback. This will bring new energy to making Taiwan's education more digital and fair, opening up new possibilities for development.</p>
