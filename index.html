            <h1>Denmark Invaded by Drones, NATO Strengthens Baltic Air Defense</h1>
            <p>NATO, also known as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said today that it will improve its work in the Baltic Sea area. This is because drones have recently flown into Denmark's air space. NATO will send ships that can defend against planes and other equipment.</p>
            <p>The Danish army said today that unknown drones were seen near some military places in Denmark last night. Also, earlier this week, drones flew into the air space around airports and other important places many times.</p>
            <p>On September 22nd, Copenhagen Airport, which is the busiest in Northern Europe, had to close for several hours. This happened late at night because many large drones flew into its air space. In the days after, five other smaller airports in Denmark, used by both military and normal people, also closed for a short time.</p>
            <p>NATO told Reuters that it will "make its watch stronger in the Baltic Sea area with new equipment for many different tasks." This includes "platforms for gathering information, watching, and looking for things, and at least one ship that can defend against planes."</p>
            <p>These new deployments will make NATO's "Baltic Sentry" mission stronger. This mission started in January this year. It was created because underwater cables, phone networks, and gas pipes in the Baltic Sea were damaged many times. For this mission, NATO sends ships, planes that patrol, and navy drones to help protect important structures.</p>
            <p>Also, this month, NATO started "Eastern Sentry" mission. This mission makes the defense of Europe's eastern side stronger. It is a response to Russian drones flying into Poland's air space.</p>
            <p>On September 19th, Estonia said that three Russian Mig-31 fighter jets flew into its air space for 12 minutes. Italian fighter jets from NATO then made them leave. On September 23rd, NATO warned Russia that it would use "all necessary military and non-military methods" to defend itself.</p>
            <p>However, Russia said that its fighter jets did not fly into Estonia's air space. It also said that the drones did not plan to attack targets in Poland.</p>

            <h1>Russia Often Flies into Air Space, Latvia Asks NATO to Make Air Defense Stronger</h1>
            <p>Today, the President of Latvia, Edgars Rinkevics, asked NATO to protect the Baltic Sea countries more. He said this because Russia has flown into NATO's air space many times. Lithuania also asked for the same thing before.</p>
            <p>Leaders in Europe said that Russia has often flown into NATO's air space. This includes areas in the Baltic Sea countries and Poland. Earlier this month, about 20 Russian drones entered these countries' air spaces. Because of this, NATO fighter planes shot down some of these drones.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rinkevics spoke at a meeting of NATO's military committee in Riga, the capital of Latvia. He said, "Russia keeps acting in a way that causes problems. Recently, it has openly flown into the air space of Poland and Estonia."</p>
            <p>He also said, "It is very important to change the mission of watching the air in the Baltic Sea. It should become a mission to defend the air in the Baltic Sea, with clear rules for fighting."</p>
            <p>Reuters reported that Lithuania's Defense Minister, Dovile Sakaliene, said earlier this month that Lithuania's government has prepared a document. This document says that the mission should change to include more things, "for example, defense systems on land, sensors, and detectors."</p>
            <p>Russia said that its fighter jets did not fly into Estonia's air space. It also said that its drones did not plan to attack places in Poland.</p>
            <p>After the events in Poland's air space, NATO started the "Eastern Sentry" operation. This operation makes NATO's entire eastern side stronger in defense. But officials from the Baltic Sea countries said they still need more protection.</p>
            <p>NATO makes decisions when all 32 member countries agree. So far, it has not answered the call to change the mission. It also did not immediately comment on what Mr. Rinkevics said.</p>

            <h1>Russia's Foreign Minister Says No Plans to Attack Europe, But Will Respond Strongly if Attacked</h1>
            <p>Today, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's Foreign Minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He told world leaders that Russia does not want to attack Europe. However, he warned that if anyone attacks Russia, it "will respond very strongly."</p>
            <p>The Associated Press reported that in recent weeks, planes without permission have flown into NATO's air space. People believe Russia is responsible for these events, which has made Europe very worried. The situation became more serious after NATO fighter jets shot down drones over Poland. Also, Estonia said that Russian fighter jets flew into its land and stayed there for 12 minutes.</p>
            <p>Russia said that its planes did not fly into Estonia. It also said that the drones were not trying to attack Poland. Belarus, a friend of Moscow, said that Ukraine's jamming of signals made the drones go off course. But European leaders think these events are planned actions to cause trouble for NATO and to see how it reacts.</p>
            <p>However, Mr. Lavrov insisted that Russia is the one facing danger.</p>
            <p>He said, "Russia has not had, and does not have now, any plan to attack Europe or NATO countries. But any attack against our country will be met with a strong response."</p>
            <p>This week, US President Donald Trump said he believes Ukraine can take back all the land that Russia has taken.</p>
            <p>This is a big change in what the American leader has said. Before, he said that Ukraine needed to give up some things. He also said that Ukraine would never get back all the areas that Russia took since 2014 when it took Crimea, and since 2022 when Russia fully invaded.</p>
            <p>Three weeks ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia and the United States "understand each other," and that the Trump government "is listening to us."</p>
            <p>Mr. Trump's new ideas came after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on September 23rd, during the UN General Assembly.</p>
