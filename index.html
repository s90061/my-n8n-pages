            <h1>The AI Trend Boosts Demand for Drill Bits; Apex Stock Price Nears NT$100</h1>
            <p>Because the need for AI (Artificial Intelligence) and HPC (High-Performance Computing) is growing quickly, the materials used in circuit boards are getting better. This makes the technology for drill bits harder to make. Apex, a company that makes drill bits, had its best monthly sales ever in August. The company's stock price has been going up very fast recently. Today, its price reached the highest limit in the morning and almost reached NT$100 again. During the day, the price stayed about 5% higher, and more than 50,000 shares were traded.</p>
            <p>More and more layers are being added to circuit boards for AI servers and advanced network switches. Also, the materials for these boards are getting better. This has made the demand for high-quality drill bits go up. In the second quarter, Apex used over 90% of its production capacity. Sales of its special coated products made up 45% of its total sales.</p>
            <p>Apex's total sales for August were NT$389 million. This was 8.1% more than the month before and 21.7% more than the same month last year. This was a new record for monthly sales. The total sales for the year so far are NT$2.65 billion, which is 17% more than last year.</p>
            <p>In the last month or so, Apex's stock price has risen very quickly, almost doubling. Today, the stock price started high and moved up and down. In the morning, it reached the highest limit of NT$99.2, almost touching NT$100 again. During the day, the price stayed about 5% higher, and more than 52,000 shares were traded.</p>
            <p>Apex said that because the demand for AI and HPC is increasing fast, the improved circuit board materials make drill bits harder to create. This means drill bits need to be more resistant to wear and tear and better at removing waste. Apex uses a two-part approach: "high-performance drill bits" and "expert drilling services." They make valuable products to meet the technical needs of server packaging boards and advanced multi-layer circuit boards.</p>
            <p>Looking ahead to the second half of the year, Apex stated that their main customers are positive about future demand. To meet the high demand, the company has started plans to make more products. They expect their monthly production of drill bits to increase from 31 million to 35 million by January next year. Plans for building new factories in 2026 are also being made.</p>

            <h1>Taichung City's Budget for 2026 Passes City Council Meeting, with a Shortfall of Over NT$18.3 Billion</h1>
            <p>Today, the Taichung City Government Council approved the city's total budget plan for 2026. The estimated income is over NT$179 billion, and the estimated expenses are over NT$197.4 billion. This means there is a deficit (shortfall) of over NT$18.3 billion. Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen said that the city will find ways to get money to cover this deficit.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu said that education will still get the largest part of the budget. The biggest increase in spending will be for the Taichung MRT Blue Line project.</p>
            <p>Mayor Lu also mentioned that some numbers in the budget plan are temporary. This is the first time the Taichung City Government has sent a temporary budget plan to the Taichung City Council for review. Many other cities and counties are doing the same this time.</p>
            <p>The Taichung City Government's Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said that some grants from the central government have not been fully approved yet. The city still needs to collect and include the funds for these plans. Later, the city will adjust the funds for these plans based on what the central government agencies approve. Then, they will provide a final report to the City Council when all the information is complete.</p>

            <h1>National Academy of Environmental Research Teams Up with Korea Climate Center for Climate Projects</h1>
            <p>Today, the National Academy of Environmental Research (NAER) of the Ministry of Environment signed an agreement with the Korea Climate Change Center. In the future, they will work together on several areas. These include teaching people about climate and getting them involved, studying climate policies and making plans, working on projects to adapt to and slow down climate change, building skills, and sharing information.</p>
            <p>Liu Tsung-yung, the head of NAER, told reporters that the Korea Climate Change Center has a lot of experience and knowledge in climate education, policy research, adapting to climate change, and managing environmental issues. He also said that this is the first time NAER has signed a partnership agreement with an international partner since it was started two years ago. It is also their first agreement in Asia.</p>
            <p>Liu Tsung-yung added that NAER will plan and organize activities with the Korea Climate Change Center. They will start with simple exchanges and then move on to working together on research topics. Besides Korea, they also invited a representative from Japan's National Institute for Environmental Studies to Taiwan today for discussions, hoping to work together in the future.</p>
            <p>Liu Tsung-yung mentioned that Taiwan and the United States have worked together on environmental education for over 30 years, starting from when it was the Environmental Protection Administration. However, in Asia, especially East Asia, there are strong connections in how environmental issues are managed and how climate change affects each other. Because of this, East Asia is a key area of focus right now.</p>
            <p>NAER is also holding an event today and tomorrow called "Moving Towards the Future: International Forum and Symposium on Climate Change Adaptation and Environmental Governance." They have invited people from central government agencies in Taiwan and experts from both local and international research groups. These experts will share their progress on climate policies and their research findings.</p>
            <p>Minister of Environment, Peng Chi-ming, spoke at the opening. He mentioned that Typhoon Danas and heavy rains after it caused damage recently. He pointed out that Taiwan first had a typhoon land in Chiayi, and then experienced heavy rains similar to Typhoon Morakot. He hopes that through different partnerships and talks, they can continue to work together on adapting to climate change, managing the environment, and recycling resources.</p>
